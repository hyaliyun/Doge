William Nicholas Keogh PC (1817‚Äì 30 September 1878) was an unpopular and controversial Irish politician and judge, whose name became a byword in Ireland for betraying one's political principles.  Background  He was born in Galway, son of William Keogh, clerk of the Crown for Kilkenny, and his wife Mary ffrench. He went to Dr Huddard's school in Dublin, and graduated from the University of Dublin: he was called to the Bar in 1840, and became Queen's Counsel in 1849. No-one has ever questioned his intellectual abilities. He was a superb speaker both in public and private and he founded a well-known debating society, the Tail-end Club. He published several books on law, politics and literature, including a book on the prose writings of John Milton. Despite his later reputation for eccentricity and bad temper, as a young man he was considered to be the best of company: genial, good humoured and a superb conversationalist. He joined the Connaught circuit where he rapidly acquired a large practice, due less to any great legal skill than to his eloquence and impressive presence; these gifts soon turned him towards politics.Fitzgerald, John Donoghue, \\"William Nicholas Keogh\\", Dictionary of National Biography 1885‚Äì1900 Vol. 31 He married Kate Rooney, daughter of a Galway surgeon, in 1841; they had one son, and a daughter Mary, who married James Murphy, judge of the High Court.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray, London, 1926  Political career  In 1847 Keogh was elected MP for Athlone. In 1851 he was one of the founders of the Catholic Defence Association; he was re-elected for Athlone in 1852. In the latter year he helped found the Independent Irish Party, which was popularly known as \\"the Pope's Brass Band\\". The new party was pledged to repeal the Ecclesiastical Titles Act and to further the cause of tenant reform, and most crucially, its members gave an explicit promise not to take office but instead to hold the balance of power at Westminster. In this they were at first successful, helping to vote out the administration of Lord Derby, who was replaced by Lord Aberdeen. Within months of promising not to take office, Keogh (together with his colleague John Sadleir) made the decision which destroyed his reputation in his own lifetime and long after his death: he accepted office in the Aberdeen Government, becoming first Solicitor-General for Ireland, and then Attorney-General for Ireland in 1855. His decision was seen by the Irish electorate as an unforgivable betrayal of a solemn pledge and his name, along with Sadleir's, entered the Irish political vocabulary. Even a century later, John A. Costello turned down the offer by √âamon de Valera to make him a Supreme Court judge on the ground that he \\"did not wish face charges of being another Sadleir or Keogh\\".McCullagh, David The Reluctant Taoiseach Gill and Macmillan Dublin 2010 p.277  Judicial career  In 1856 Keogh was appointed a judge of the Irish Court of Common Pleas. On the grounds of legal ability no one could dispute that he was highly qualified for judicial office, but unfortunately his conduct as a judge did nothing to restore the damage to his reputation. He was a man of strong opinions, which were always expressed forcefully, and his hot temper led to frequent quarrels with counsel. On one occasion Peter O'Brien, the future Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, was threatened with removal from Court. It must be said in Keogh's defence that, having recovered his temper, he apologised to O'Brien in open Court in the presence of the assembled Bar.Reminisces of Lord O'Brien 1910 This suggests that Keogh, who as a young man had been famed for geniality and good humour, was not acting out of malice, but rather suffering from stress and ill-health. Keogh's conduct of the \\"Fenian Trials\\" of 1865‚Äì6 and the savage sentences which were handed down were much criticised, although his defenders said that Charles Kickham at least had been treated as leniently as the evidence allowed. In non-political cases he had a good reputation: if not a profound lawyer, he had the ability to quickly see the essential point of a case.DNB Further damage was done to his reputation by his decision on the Galway election petition case of 1872, where William Le Poer Trench, the unsuccessful candidate, petitioned to unseat the winner, John Philip Nolan, on the grounds of intimidation and undue pressure from the Catholic clergy. According to Delaney, Keogh's judgment took nine hours to read and \\"was delivered in an extremely biased manner and did nothing to enhance the reputation of the judiciary\\".Delaney, V.T.H. \\"Christopher Palles\\" Allen Figgis, Dublin, 1960 Much of it seems to have been a diatribe against the Catholic hierarchy, which struck the audience as coming very strangely from a former member of the \\"Pope's Brass Band\\". There was a public uproar, and the Government had to move to defeat a motion in the House of Commons calling for Keogh's removal from the bench. On foot of the judgment the Government's Law officers, much to their own embarrassment, felt obliged to prosecute Patrick Duggan, Bishop of Clonfert, and were clearly relieved when he was acquitted. Friendship with Father Healy Keogh developed a close friendship with Father Healy of Little Bray and the two used to dine at each other's houses every week. Father Healy's broad mindedness and sense of humour struck a chord with the unconventional judge. Father Healy remained supportive of Keogh throughout Keogh's disputes with the Church and periods of mental illness. William John Fitzpatrick, Memories of Father Healy of Little Bray, Macmillan, 1895 The following exchange was recorded by Father Healy's biographer: > \\"My dear Healy,\\" said Keogh, with a very solemn face, \\"I'll do anything you > wish - only name it. I'd turn Turk or Mohammedan if it serves you.\\" \\"Turn > Catholic,\\" replied Healy.Fitzpatrick 1895, p.116  Last years and death  In his last years, Keogh showed increasing signs of eccentricity, in the face of unrelenting public hostility from much of the Catholic population. His public clash with Peter O'Brien, which probably occurred in 1877, suggests that his bad temper was the result of stress rather than ill nature, and the reminisces of Oliver Burke demonstrate that he could still show considerable charm and good humour on occasion.Burke, Oliver Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit Dublin 1885 In 1878 he travelled abroad to Belgium and Germany in an effort to regain his health, but on 19 August 1878 he attacked his valet with a straight razor in a fit of delirium,The Political Year-Book, (1878), ed. Norman Lockhart, Edinburgh: Thomas C. Jack, 1879, p. 100 and was confined to a hospital. While he may have recovered his sanity, he continued to decline physically and died in Bingen am Rhein 30 September 1878. He was buried in Bonn.The Irish Law Times and Solicitors' Journal, Volume 12, 5 Oct 1878, p. 500  Reputation  Effigy of Judge Keogh, published June 1872 Keogh's death did nothing to lessen the hostility to him at home; the Irish newspapers heaped abuse on him, causing The Times of London to protest that in any country but Ireland his talents would have won him popularity and respect. There is no doubt of his intellectual gifts, and his friends recalled the charm and good humour he had shown in his earlier years. The picture of him in Burke's Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit, published a few years after Keogh's death, is largely favourable. However, as McCullagh points out, The Reluctant Taoiseach p. 277 not many politicians so damage their reputations that they are still spoken of with contempt a century later; and despite Keogh's gifts, one must conclude that much of the damage to his reputation was self-inflicted. The inscription on the Cormack brothers memorial at Loughmore ‚Äì placed there 32 years after Keogh's death ‚Äì was typical of the continuing hostility to him.

The gewog is a producer of cardamom and citrus fruits. History On September 29, 1990, a group of four unidentified men set fire to a dispensary in Dorona. The attack was in coordination with unrest in southern Bhutan that month between villagers and the administrative authority, who called for better communication with the people. Dzongda Hisey Dorji called a meeting in Nimtoladara on April 4, 1991 to review the southern uprisings. Administrative divisions Dorona Gewog is divided administratively into five chiwogs: *Dorona Chhewa *Dorona Chhoongwa *Mangmethang (Maamedthang) *Nimtola (Nyhitola) *Tshalamji Economy Citrus fruits and cardamom are grown in Dorona, with relatively fewer vegetables grown due to it being further from the market and cut off during the monsoon season. A farmshop was expected to be built by May 2017. Green houses with citrus saplings have been built in Mamedthang chiwog. In November 2016 a Citrus Fruit Drop Collection and Destruction campaign was held in Dorona and Drujegang Gewog, conducted by the National Plant Protection Centre in collaboration with the Dzongkhag Agriculture Sector of Dagana.

Career Club Born in Kom√°rno into an ethnic Hungarian family, Z√°csik made her senior debut for V√°ci NKSE at the age of 14. Her talent was spotted early and was traced by both Gy≈ëri ETO KC and Ferencv√°rosi TC. Finally, in 2006, Ferencv√°ros secured her services. During her spell at the club she won all color of medals in the Hungarian championship and added a Hungarian cup silver to her success list as well. In 2009, she moved to Slovenian EHF Champions League outfit RK Krim, but her recurrent shoulder injury hampered her to settle in the area, and on 27 April 2010 it was reported that she is leaving Krim and going to re-join Ferencv√°ros in summer 2011. However, the transfer move was realized earlier than expected, as Z√°csik have been released by Krim on 22 December 2010, making her able to join her former team immediately. Ferencv√°ros called a press conference on 27 December 2010, where it was announced that they have agreed with Z√°csik and have signed a contract which will keep the left back by the club until 30 June 2013. Z√°csik immediately found herself in the starting lineup and played a pivotal role in the club's EHF Cup Winners' Cup triumph in 2011. She first found herself in the limelight against past year EHF Champions League winners Viborg HK: with only a few seconds left and trailing by one on aggregate goals, she hit a penalty shot, giving a dramatic and unexpected victory over their highly rated rivals on away goals. In the following round she helped her team with sixteen goals to knock out Toulon St-Cyr Var Handball, that was eliminated during the Group phase of the EHF Champions League and continued their European adventure in the EHF Cup Winners' Cup. After beating Metz Handball in a close encounter, Ferencv√°ros played the finals against CB Mar Alicante. This time Z√°csik did not contribute to the success with number of goals, but with a clever team play. She got a tight man marking, making her unable to get into shooting position. However, by dividing the attention of the defenders, she created space for her teammates to score goals easier. Ferencv√°ros eventually went to win the trophy and Z√°csik ended the competition with 49 goals on eight matches. International Z√°csik have won the silver medal on the Junior European Championship on home soil, and also debuted in the senior team on 22 September 2009 against Germany.

The defense of Cactus Ridge to the west, and The Pinnacle to the east, marked the start of resistance by Japanese land forces on Okinawa. Assault on Cactus Ridge 4 April 1945 As the US 96th Infantry Division advanced south along Okinawa's Highway 1 on 4 April, it came under increasing fire from the south and from the ridges on their left (east). Three medium tanks from the 763rd Tank Battalion were destroyed by a carefully sited and well- concealed 47 mm anti-tank gun. Firing twenty rounds, Japanese gunners set the three tanks afire. Japanese Army commanders later described this feat as an illustration of the effectiveness of 47 mm guns. \\"Great results,\\" Japanese combat instructions stated, \\"can be obtained by concealing the guns and opening surprise fire on the tanks at close range.\\"7th Div G-2 Periodic Rpt No. 10, 11 Apr 45: 32d Army Combat Instructions, 5 Apr 45. 5 April 1945 By 5 April, the 383rd Infantry Regiment indicated that its forward elements were receiving fire from 20 machine guns and from 15 to 20 mortars, besides artillery pieces. As movement progressed, it encountered a series of fortified positions, the approaches to which were often covered by minefields. Dislodging the Japanese from these positions required coordinated enveloping movements, and resulted in numerous American casualties. On the afternoon of 5 April, well-camouflaged Japanese troops, supported by tanks, attacked elements of the 382nd Infantry Regiment, but were broken up by combined machine gun, mortar and artillery fire. Ultimately, the 382nd gained approximately of east‚Äìwest ground by the evening of 5 April. To the west, the 383rd was focusing its efforts on what came to be known as Cactus Ridge. The initial direct assault by a single infantry company, supported tanks, proved to be disastrous. Cactus Ridge was protected by a tank ditch, barbed wire, and a long mine field. When American tanks tried to pass through a gap in the minefield, they came under direct 47 mm fire. Two were hit and had to be abandoned. Heavy Japanese machine gun, rifle and mortar fire halted the assault and American forces were forced to withdraw. 6‚Äì7 April 1945 On the following day, 6 April, the fortified Japanese positions on Cactus Ridge continued to hold up the 383rd. Attempts were made to dislodge the defenders with an airstrike early on that morning, but subsequent troops assaulting the targeted positions found defensive enemy fire as intense as ever. American forces continued to make direct frontal assaults, through heavy Japanese mortar fire, against the ridge. Such assaults ultimately resulted in charging and reducing Japanese positions with hand grenades and small arms fire. By the end of 6 April, these \\"Banzai\\" type charges by the 2nd Battalion enabled the 383rd to ultimately gain first the western half of Cactus Ridge. On 7 April, similar tactics by the 2nd Battalion allowed the 383rd to capture the rest of Cactus Ridge. As a result of the offensive actions of 4‚Äì7 April, the 383d Infantry found itself assembled against the formidable Japanese positions on Kakazu Ridge.

Kangpara Gewog, along with Thrimshing Gewog, comprises Thrimshing Dungkhag (sub-district). Kangpara is one of the remotest gewogs under Trashigang Dzongkhag(district). The gewog is 341.9 square kilometers and shares borders with other gewogs like Gomdar, Thrimshing, Shongphu, Khaling, Shingkhar Lauri and Merak. Kangpara is popular for housing some sacred monasteries like Lamai Goenpa, Sikhar Goenpa et al., and is also popular for their belief in deities like Ama Jomo and Meme Dangling. The origin of the name The word \\"Kangpara\\" literally means \\"footprint.\\" There are footprints of Lord Buddha in a hermitage. According to oral sources, the footprints were said to be carved by a great lama Drupthob Dong-nga Rinchen. He visited Bodh Gaya and on his return, brought with him imprints of Lord Buddha's footprints. Using them as a model, he carved the footprints on a stone in the hermitage. It is considered by the people as one of the most sacred relics of the lhakhang along with the Drupthob's walking cane. Demography According to Trashigang Dzongkhag's official website,Kangpara Gewog has a total population of 3824 and has about 347 households. The gewog houses about 17 villages and some of the major villages are Pasaphu, Paydung, Madewa, Kangpara, Kheri, Kheshing, Wangthang, Lamyong, Rebaling, Gorapey, Brumshari, Churphu, Neiling, Bedingphu, Sarong, Merda, Gorenchenma, Zordung and Threlphu. Administration and politics As of December 2011, the head of the gewog or \\"gup\\" is Chempa Dorji and the Gewog Administration Officer is Sonam Wangdi. They have their offices in Woongthung, near Kangpara Lower Secondary School. Apart from the gup and Gewog Administration Officer, the gewog like every other gewog has a Mangi and Tshogpas to look after the affairs of the people and actively participate in the democratic process. In the 2008 democratic election, Kangpara and Thrimshing (one constituency) elected Choki Wangmo as their MP and the win was a landslide. Ever since then, she has been representing the people of Kangpara and Thrimshing in the Parliament of Bhutan. Similarly, during Bhutan's first National Council election, Sonam Kinga from Galing was declared the winner and he has been representing Kangpara gewog along with 14 more gewogs of Trashigang in the National Council ever since. Recent Changes Until recent years, the gewog was largely secluded from other parts of the country and was tucked away in picturesque mountains and virgin forests. It had no amenities other than a few schools and health clinics. However, starting from a five or six years ago, the people of the gewog saw unprecedented changes and developments. It all started with the electrification of almost all the villages in the gewog. A couple of years later, one of the primary schools was upgraded to a lower secondary school, removing parents' burden of sending their children after the 6th grade for schooling to Thungkhar Lower Secondary School, which is a day's walk from Kangpara. The gewog has approximately 4 schools, namely, Kangpara Lower Secondary School, Pasaphu Primary School, Threlphu Community School and Zordung Community School. The connecting of the gewog to the mobile was another unprecedented change; the accessibility of the mobile means that farmers of the gewog can keep up-to-date with their relatives and alike who stay in different parts of the country, mostly as civil servants. Besides, a farm road is on its way to the gewog and will reach there by next year or so. The farm road will prevent people from walking six hours to reach the nearest road and will benefit around 400 households of Kangpara. The alignment of the road has fueled some controversy over the past years and has greatly delayed the work; however, many thought the present alignment was the best option and would benefit more households than the previous alignment, and this could have been the main reason why the road was realigned. Lifestyle, occupation, and activities The people of Kangpara along with the people of Kheng are renowned throughout the country for their unparalleled craftsmanship. The most exquisite handicraft product the artisans produce is called \\"Bangchung\\". The raw material used to make handicrafts like Bangchung is called \\"Ringshu\\" (Neomicrocalamus and ropogonifolius), which they fetch in bulk from places like Remung, under Orong Gewog, S/Jongkhar. Handicrafts are a major source of income for the people of Kangpara, and they market their finished products to other parts of the country in exchange for hard currency. The connecting of the farm road to the gewog is likely to further ease artisans of the gewog in fetching raw materials and transporting their finished products. Almost all denizens of the gewog are subsistence farmers and, until recently, barter played a significant role among the people and, to a lesser extent, it is still prevalent. Farmers cultivate crops like chillies, paddy and maize, of which, chillies are essentially cultivated to earn some cash income and the latter two for domestic consumption. They use ponies as a means of transportation to sell their products to the market, and therefore, it is no accident that almost every household owns a pony or mule each. Also, a relatively small percentage of the population, precisely in the north, are nomads and livestock farming plays a dominant role in their everyday life; for them, livestock and livestock products are the only means where-through they can scrape out a living. Lamai Goenpa The Origin of Lamai Goenpa dates back to the time of Tibetan Prince Lhasay Tsangma, sometimes in the 10th Century (???). The hermitage was in-between a cliff - not at the present site, perched spectacularly viewing three villages-Zordung, Kangpara and Bedingphu. The story of the remains of the hermitage is little known by the surrounding people. However, the present monastery, actually named as Lhundrup SamtenCholing, popularly known as Lamai Goenpa still, is located some 100 meters away from the past location, beyond a ridge of the Tshephu cliff. It is surrounded by Chenla, a mountain pass which is considered to be the most sacred and must-visit pilgrimage spot in the area. It was built by Lopoen Melam Rabzang in 1930, and he was originally from Tangsibi in Trongsa. According to a source, he was a disciple of Togden Shakya Shri(a great practitioner of Drukpa Kagyu, well known for his mastery in Dzogchen) and was predestined to pursue Naro Choedruk (Six profound practices of Naropa). The funding for the construction of the monastery came from no other than the most popular Dzongpon (governor) of Trashigang, Sey Dopola, who, according to a source, is the paternal great-grandfather of Queen consort Ashi Jetsun Pema Wangchuck. Upon the demise of Lama Melam Rabzang in 1945, the monastery is said to have lacked strong headship despite successive Lamas had been appointed. However, in 1986 H.E. Gyeltshen Trulku took over the charge and renovated the monastery. Today the hermitage houses around 40 monks/disciples, a Lama, and a couple of teachers. Lamai Goenpa is a sacred hermitage in the region for housing a rare statue of Tshepamay in the heart of the mountain called Tshephu. Any visitor who stumbles upon a chance to visit Kangpara should not miss the privilege to visit the most sacred hermitage in the gewog. Her Majesty, the Queen Mother Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck visited the Goenpa in 2000.

Lucien de Hirsch had one illegitimate daughter by Ir√®ne-Catherine Premelic, named Lucienne Ir√®ne Marie Premelic, who became Lucienne Premelic Hirsch (no particule) upon being adopted by her grandparents; she was later adopted by her grand-aunt Hortense Montefiore. Described in 1901 in A.M.F. Monthly as \\"the world's greatest heiress ... [and] strikingly handsome,\\" Lucienne Premelic Hirsch married a German banker, Edouard Balzer, in 1904. The de Forest children, however, have been identified as Baron de Hirsch's illegitimate sons by Juliette Arnold de Forest.Samuel James Lee, Moses of the New World: The Work of Baron de Hirsch (T. Yoseloff, 1970), p. 197 Baron de Hirsch died in Hungary at the age of 64 in 1896. His widow Clara died three years later, on 1 April 1899. Maurice inherited his adoptive father's residence, Schloss Eichhorn (now known as Veve≈ô√≠ Castle) near Br√ºnn in Moravia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Maurice inherited from the Baroness 25,000,000 Francs, as well as her estates in Rossitz-Eichhorn. Baron de Hirsch had bought the estates in Rossitz (now Rosice) in 1881.Emmelie de Forest is NOT a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria , royalmusings, 18 February 2013 Maurice de Forest-Bischoffsheim was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1899, he was awarded the title Freiherr von Forest by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.of Ruvigny, Marquis, The Titled Nobility of Europe, 1914, p. 564. According to the Court Circular, on 6 March 1899, \\"The Emperor of Austria has given the title of Baron De Forest to M. Arnold [De] Forest and to his brother M. Raymond De Forest, both the adopted sons of Baroness de Hirsch de Gereuth, widow of the late Baron de Hirsch.\\" Both men inherited millions of dollars from Baroness de Hirsch upon her death.Isidor Singer and Cyrus Adler, The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 6 (Funk and Wagnalls, 1912), p. 410The American Jewess: A Sure Test, Volume 9, Issue: 4, May, 1899, pp. 16+ In the following year, he was naturalised to become a British citizen, and was authorised to bear the title Baron de Forest by royal licence. He was commissioned into the Militia as a Second Lieutenant in the Prince of Wales's Own Norfolk Artillery (Eastern Division) on 25 August 1900. He resigned his commission on 20 June 1903, but this was later cancelled and he became Second Lieutenant in the Staffordshire Imperial Yeomanry (Queen's Own Royal Regiment) on 4 July 1903. He resigned this commission on 5 May 1906, by which time he was also an Honorary Second Lieutenant in the Army. De Forest converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. Churchill visited de Forest at his Lancashire home, Rosefield Hall, near Southport. Churchill also spent much time on de Forest's yacht and stayed three times (in 1908 together with his wife during their honeymoon journey) at de Forest's Schloss Eichhorn (Veve≈ô√≠ Castle) in Moravia. Marriages De Forest was married twice, his wives being: *Mathilde Madeleine Rose Menier, n√©e Letellier, the widow of chocolate magnate Albert Menier and a daughter of a French newspaper publisher. They married in 1901 and had one daughter, Mabel B√©atrix Clara Mary Magdalen de Forest (born 5 March 1902). The marriage was declared null and void by a decree of the Pope in 1902. *Hon. Ethel Gerard, daughter of William Cansfield Gerard, 2nd Baron Gerard, whom he married in 1904 and divorced in 1911. They had two sons, Alaric de Forest and John de Forest (both later adopted the surname de Bendern). The marriage broke down in January 1910, due to the baroness's adultery with a younger man. Motoring and aviation De Forest was an enthusiast for the emerging technologies of motor cars and aeroplanes. An accomplished motor racing driver, he competed in a number of major races including the Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing. From 1903‚Äì1905 he held the Daily Mail Challenge Cup, having attained a record speed over the flying kilometre at Phoenix Park, Dublin, breaking the world land speed record. In 1909 he offered the Baron de Forest Prize of ¬£2,000 to the first Englishman who could fly across the English Channel in an English-built aeroplane. When a Frenchman, Louis Bl√©riot successfully crossed the Channel in July 1909, he doubled the prize to ¬£4,000. It was eventually won by Thomas Sopwith in December 1910. He was also a rider of the Cresta Run in St. Moritz where a cup was named after him.St. Moritz Tobogganing Club, Annual Report, No. 90, 2009-2010, pp. 302 and 311. Politics De Forest was active in the Liberal Party, and at the January 1910 general election stood as parliamentary candidate at Southport. Despite the support of Churchill, De Forest was defeated by his Conservative opponent, Major Godfrey Dalrymple-White in a campaign marred by racist slurs. In March 1910 he was elected to the London County Council as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party, representing Kennington. He held the seat until 1913. In July 1911 a parliamentary by-election was called for the seat of West Ham North, and de Forest was chosen to defend the seat for the Liberals. In his election address he stated that he was in favour of land nationalisation, Irish Home Rule, revised licensing laws, female suffrage and equality of religion in education. He retained the seat for the Liberal Party, with an increased majority. He held the seat until the next general election in 1918. First World War and aftermath With the outbreak of war with Germany and Austro-Hungary in 1914, attempts were made to prosecute de Forest as an enemy sympathiser. However, with Churchill's assistance, he was able to resist the pressure. He joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1914, subsequently serving in the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Section. Following the war, a decision was taken that persons authorised to use titles granted by \\"enemy states\\" should have this right withdrawn. Accordingly, de Forest was requested to \\"voluntarily\\" relinquish his title. He initially refused to do so, but finally relented, and a royal warrant was issued on 16 January 1920 that relinquished \\"the rights and privileges\\" granted to him \\"in consideration of the fact that the said foreign titles of nobility appertain to Countries now or recently at war with Us\\". He became known as Maurice Arnold de Forest. The family estates in Moravia were confiscated by the new state of Czechoslovakia for which de Forest was paid ¬£100,000 compensation. Later life In 1932 he was naturalised in Liechtenstein, was granted the title Count Maurice de Bendern, and was appointed a diplomatic counsellor to the principality in 1936. De Bendern amassed a valuable art collection including a work by Frans Hals. He maintained a villa at Cap Martin, on the French Riviera, and Ch√¢teau de Beauregard, which contained an animal sanctuary. He died in Biarritz in October 1968, aged 89. Relatives His son John Gerard de Forest (Bendern) was a good amateur golfer and won The Amateur Championship in 1932. He married firstly Lady Patricia Sybil Douglas, daughter of Francis Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry. Their children included Simon Frederick de Bendern, Emma Magdalen de Bendern, who married firstly journalist Nigel Dempster, secondly Giles Trentham and thirdly Prince George Galitzine,. and Caroline de Bendern, who married firstly saxophonist Barney WilenDivenni la Marianna del '68 Oggi le modelle vanno a destraCorriere della Sera and associated with Olivier Mosset, Amanda Lear, Salvador Dal√≠, Andy Warhol and Lou Reed. 150px On 13 May 1968, during the protests in Paris, Caroline de Bendern was photographed by Jean-Pierre Rey sitting on the shoulders of painter Jean- Jacques Lebel waving a North Vietnam flag.

It is positioned by the Tibiscus river (Timi»ô River), north of Zarmizegethusa Regia and south of Ziridava. It was near the Tisza river, in the area of the Dacian tribe of Biephi. This town was attested by Ptolemy in his Geographia (III; 8; 4), yet its exact location remains unknown. Zurobara is amongst the places, which are not to be found on the great Roman roads between the Tysis and the Aluta,  Ancient sources   Ptolemy's Geographia  Dacia's map from a medieval book made after Ptolemy's Geographia (ca. 140 AD). Zurobara is on the north west. Zurobara is mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia (c. 140 AD) in the form ' as an important town in western Dacia, at latitude 45¬∞ 40' N and longitude 45¬∞ 40' E (note that he used a different meridian and some of his calculations were off). Ptolemy completed his work soon after Trajan's Dacian Wars, as a result of which parts of Dacia were incorporated into the Roman Empire as the new Dacia province.  Tabula Peutingeriana  Dacia on Tabula Peutingeriana Unlike many other Dacian towns mentioned by Ptolemy, Zurobara is missing from Tabula Peutingeriana (1st-4th century AD), an itinerarium showing the cursus publicus, the road network in the Roman Empire. The Danish philologist and historian Gudmund Sch√ºtte believed that the town with similar name Ziridava, also mentioned by Ptolemy and also missing from Tabula Peutingeriana, was the same with Zurobara. This idea is deemed erroneous alongside many other assumed duplications of names, by the Romanian historian and archaeologist Vasile P√¢rvan in his work Getica. P√¢rvan reviewed all localities mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia, analyzing and verifying all data available to him at the time. He points out that Ziri and Zuro (meaning water) are the roots of two different Geto-Dacian words. Additionally, Ptolemy provided different coordinates for the two towns, some medieval maps created based on his Geographia depict two distinct towns.  Etymology  Zurobara name (that could have been a spelling variant for Zuropara) was interpreted initially as \\"strong city\\" where: the ending term of name \\"bara\\" / \\"vara\\" means ‚Äòcity‚Äô (the same as Thracian \\"para\\") and the first term of the name \\"Zuro\\" means ‚Äòstrong‚Äô . Zuro ‚Äòstrong‚Äô is also found in the name of Zyraxes, a Dacian king. Because of Proto-Indo-European \\"e\\" > Dacian \\"a\\" (cf. PIE *dhewa > Dacian dava, PIE *ser > Dacian sara), bara is rather derived from root *bher ‚Äòrich, abundance‚Äô and zura from root *ser, *sara ‚Äòwaters, river'. In this case, Zurobara meant ‚Äòa waters abundance city‚Äô.

The large middle portion is ca. 710 ha (1,750 acres); the Sigria salient to the west is ca. 250 ha (620 acres). The portion to the east of Kiambu road has been allocated to special national priorities. As of mid-2016, 36% of the forest contains indigenous upland forest tree species. The forest is home to some 200 species of bird as well as suni, Harveys Duiker, bushbucks, bush pigs, genets, civets, honey badgers, bush babies, porcupines, Syke's monkeys, bush squirrels, hares, fruit bats, and various reptiles and butterflies. Karura now has over 50 km of trails for visitors to walk, run or bike.Friends of Karura Forest - Forest Map Due to its proximity to a growing city, there have been plans to reduce the forest in favour of housing and other development. However, these plans have been controversial with conservationists. In the late 1990s there were housing projects that would have excised portions of the forest. Conservationists, led by Wangari Maathai, the leader of Green Belt Movement who later became a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, carried out a much publicised campaign for saving the forest.

FKF raised the necessary funds and the fence was completed in September. In December 2010 the Strategic Management Plan signed by KFS Director D.K, Mbugua, and on 26‚Äì27 February 2011 there was a Grand Opening Ceremony in the forest to celebrate a Karura that was now ‚ÄôSecure, Safe & Serene‚Äô and open for visitors.

It was named after violinist and composer Giuseppe Tartini, of whom a monument was made in 1896. History The square was once an inner dock for smaller vessels such as fishing boats, and was located outside of the first city walls. In the Middle Ages the dock became surrounded by important buildings and palaces, because of which it became an important site of the town. However, because of sewage which ended up there, the officials decided to bury the dock and set up a real square there in 1894. Around the newly created platform various new buildings appeared, including the town hall. Of those buildings, the only one that still has the original exterior is the Gothic house named Beneƒçanka (Venetian house), dating to the 15th century. The sculptor of the 1896 bronze monument to Tartini was Antonio Dal Z√≤tto. From 1909 to 1912, a trolleybus path was made which connected Piran to the train station in Lucija where the Parenzana railway was made, which connected Trieste and Poreƒç with various other towns. After 1912, the trolleybus was replaced by the more efficient tram, which was operational until 1953 when it was abolished. At 300th anniversary of Tartini's birth a huge renovation of the square occurred, when an ellipse platform was formed out of white stone, designed by architect Boris Podrecca. Present In recent years there have been some changes to reduce the number of personal vehicles within the square, in favor of tourism, so during the main season (July 1 to September 1) no vehicles are allowed to park within the square; instead they have to park in the town's car park in Fornaƒçe. There is also a line of free mini-buses which drive from Piran to various other coastal towns in the main season.

Since then the bridge has been partially or fully destroyed more than once. The Kehl railway bridge constructed in 1956, was a single track railway bridge between Strasbourg and Kehl, crossing in the process both the Rhine and the frontier between Germany and France. A replacement double track railway bridge was first used on 10 October 2010 and formally opened in December 2010 in order to permit trains to cross the river more rapidly. The speed limit on the new bridge is 160 km/h (100 mph).  The 1861 bridge  Under the terms of an international convention dated 2 July 1857 between Baden and the French government it was agreed that a railway bridge should be constructed across the Rhine between Kehl and Strasbourg. This would be the first permanent bridge across the Upper Rhine. The completed bridge seen in 1920. The structure would comprise a twin track bridge long, with a central truss section of . On each side of the bridge would be a turntable with of usable diameter. Work began in 1858, the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est taking responsibility for the foundations. In order to sink the piles into the Rhine mud it was necessary to construct protective caissons extending below the river level. The steel superstructure was delivered and assembled by \\"Gebr√ºder Benckiser\\" (Benckiser Brothers), a Pforzheim company. The superstructure weighed approximately 1000 tons, and was assembled on the west (Strasbourg) bank of the river on a site long. The bridge became operational on 11 May 1861. The outbreak in 1870 of the Franco-Prussian War saw the turntable on the eastern (Kehl) end of the bridge dynamited. Until a new steel structure could be erected in 1874, a provisional timber structure was put in place. As a result of the war the frontier moved: between 1871 and 1919 both ends of the bridge were located in and wholly owned by Germany, but in 1919 it was stipulated under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that the bridge would be wholly owned by France. This was consistent with France's military occupation, under the terms of the treaty, of the formerly German Rhineland: the occupation continued in various forms until 1930. The destroyed bridge in 1940 The new bridge shortly before it opened in 2010 By this time a project had reached the planning stage to replace the bridge which by now was more than 75 years old, but no such replacement would be built till well after the Second World War. With the outbreak of war in the late summer of 1939, French troops blew up the bridge's main western support. Until September 1940 the bridge could nevertheless be used courtesy of temporary repairs undertaken. In November 1944 German troops blew up the bridge's main eastern support, effectively destroying the bridge in its totality.  Replacing the 1861 bridge: the 1956 bridge  Topographical map showing the location of the current bridges. France is on the left, Germany on the right. In July 1945 U.S. engineering troops constructed a military kit based provisional single- track bridge. On 30 January 1953 an agreement was signed between France and Germany concerning permanent bridges and transit over the Rhine on the Franco- German frontier (Abkommen √ºber die festen Br√ºcken und F√§hren √ºber den Rhein an der deutsch-franz√∂sischen Grenze). This included provision for new railway bridges connecting Kehl and Strasbourg. Two separate single-track bridges were envisaged, one for each direction of travel, but a second bridge of this nature was never actually built. Work began on the first single track rail bridge in May 1954. This is a triple span post-free trellis frame steel bridge supported by a continuous beam. The bridge was opened on 12 August 1956. The frontier was set at the midpoint of the bridge: Germany owns the eastern half and France owns the western half.  Complementing the 1956 bridge: the 2010 bridge  On 14 March 2006 France and Germany agreed the framework for the construction of the extended high speed LGV Est railway line.Interconnexion du TGV-Est fran√ßais et de l‚ÄôICE allemand - LGV-Est sur ¬´ france-allemagne.fr ¬ª The project required that trains be able to cross the Rhine at Kehl at speeds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) at a time when the single track 1956 bridge was restricted to 60 km/h (37 mph).Le nouveau pont de Kehl est sur les rails sur ¬´ 20minutes.fr ¬ª Provision was therefore made for a twin track bridge.

The novel was published in Britain by Gollancz in 2010, and by Tor in 2011 in the US. It is a heist story, set in a futuristic Solar System, that features a protagonist modeled on Ars√®ne Lupin, the gentleman thief of Maurice Leblanc. The novel was nominated for the 2011 Locus Award for Best First Novel, and was second runner-up for the 2011 Campbell Memorial Award. Setting Several centuries after the technological singularity largely destroyed earth, various posthuman factions compete for dominance in the solar system. Though sentient superintelligent AGI has never been successfully developed, civilization has been greatly transformed by the proliferation of Hansonian brain emulations (termed \\"gogols\\" in reference to the author of the same name's work Dead Souls). An alliance of powerful gogol copies rule the inner system from computronium megastructures housing trillions of virtual minds, laboring to resurrect the dead in religious devotion to the philosophy of Nikolai Federov. This alliance, the Sobornost, has been in conflict with a community of quantum entangled minds who adhere to the \\"no-cloning\\" principle of quantum information theory, and so do not see the Sobornost's ultimate goal as resurrection, but death. Most of this community, the Zoku, was devastated when Jupiter was destroyed with a weaponized gravitational singularity. Among the last remnants of near-baseline humanity exist on the mobile cities of Mars, where advanced cryptography and an obsessive privacy culture ensure that the Sobornost cannot upload their citizens' minds. The most notable of these cities is the Oubliette, where time is used as a currency. When a citizen's balance reaches zero their mind is transferred to a robotic body to serve the needs of the city for a set period, before being returned to their original body with a restored balance of time. Plot summary Countless gogols of the legendary gentleman thief Jean Le Flambeur are trapped in a virtual Sobornost prison in orbit around Neptune, playing an iterated prisoner's dilemma until his mind learns to cooperate. A warrior from the Oort Cloud, which has been settled by Finnish colonists, successfully retrieves one of the Le Flambeur gogols and uploads it into a real-space body. Acting on behalf of a competing Sobornost authority, this Oortian, Mieli, ferries the thief to the Martian city known as The Oubliette, where he has stored his memories for later recovery. The two intend to recover his memories so that he may return to an operating capacity sufficient to serve his Sobornost benefactor in a theft and repay his liberation. On the Oubliette, the young detective Isidore Beautrelet helps vigilantes catch Sobornost agents illicitly uploading human minds. These vigilantes are revealed to be in the service of a local colony of Zoku. Beautrelet is employed to investigate the arrival of Le Flambeur, and in the process becomes aware that the Oubliette's cryptographic security was always compromised. The memories of its citizens are fabrications, and the \\"King of Mars\\" long believed ousted in a revolution, still reigns behind the scenes. This King, who is another copy of Jean Le Flambeur, is defeated in the ensuing conflict. Le Flambeur fails to recover all of his memories, which he had locked with a quantum entangled revolver that required him to kill several of his old friends to open his stored memory. He and Mieli escape a liberated mars having recovered only a mysterious \\"Schrodinger's Box\\" from the Memory Palace.  Themes  Themes central to The Quantum Thief are the unreliability and malleability of memory and the effects of extreme longevity on an individual's perspective and personality. Prisons, surveillance and control in society are also major themes. In the book, the people living in the Oubliette society on Mars have two types of memory; in addition to a traditional, personal memory, there is the exomemory, which can be accessed by other people, from anywhere in the city. Memories about personal experiences can be stored in the exomemory and partitioned, with different levels of access granted to different people. These memories can be used, among other things, as an expedient form of communication. The Oubliette society has an economy where time is used as currency. When an individual's time is expended, their consciousness is uploaded into a \\"Quiet\\". The Quiet are mute machine servants who maintain and protect the city. Although the quiet seem to have little interest in the world outside their occupations, they do seem to retain some traces of their former personalities and memories. The conspiracy central to the plot involves the hidden rulers, called the \\"cryptarchs\\", manipulating and abusing the exomemory and through the citizens' transformations to quiet and back, the traditional memory as well. In the book, the Oubliette society is compared to a panopticon; a prison, where every action of the dwellers can be scrutinized. History and influences The first chapter of The Quantum Thief was presented by Rajaniemi's literary agent, John Jarrold, to Gollancz as the basis for the three-book deal that was eventually secured. Rajaniemi has stated that he had \\"come up with an outline that had every single idea I could cram into it, because I wanted to be worthy of what had happened.\\" The outline eventually expanded into three parts, and the first part became The Quantum Thief. The novel's plot was inspired by one of Rajaniemi's favorite characters in fiction, Maurice Leblanc's gentleman thief Ars√®ne Lupin, who operates on both sides of the law. What intrigued Rajaniemi were the cycles of redemption and relapse Lupin goes through as he tries to go straight, always falling short. Besides LeBlanc, Rajaniemi mentioned Roger Zelazny as a strong influence. Ian McDonald was the other science fiction author he mentioned as influential,Interview of Hannu Rajaniemi - novelist and mathematician, 24 Sep 2012 plus Frances A.Yates's book The Art of Memory, for memory palaces.2011 interview of Rajaniemi at The Guardian In an interview, Rajaniemi said he wasn't trying to write the novel as hard science fiction: \\"For me, the more important consequence of having a scientific background is a degree of speculative rigour: trying hard to work out the consequences of the assumptions one begins with.\\"An Interview with Hannu Rajaniemi by Preston Grassmann, November 16, 2011 Reception The novel has received generally positive reviews. Gary K. Wolfe writes in his Locus review that Rajaniemi has \\"spectacularly delivered on the promise that this is likely the most important debut SF novel we'll see this year\\". James Lovegrove, reviewing the book in his Financial Times column, notes that \\"many an anglophone author would kill to turn out prose half as good as this, especially on their maiden effort.\\" Eric Brown, reviewing for The Guardian, finds the novel to be \\"a brilliant debut\\", while alluding to the \\"apocryphal\\" (and incorrect) myth that \\"this novel sold on the strength of its first line.\\" Sam Bandah, at SciFiNow, praises the novel for \\"its engaging narrative and characters backed by often almost intimidatingly good sci-fi concepts.\\" Criticism for the novel has generally centred on Rajaniemi's sparse \\"show, don't tell\\" writing style. Brown notes that \\"the author makes no concessions to the lazy reader with info-dumps or convenient explanations.\\" Niall Alexander, of the Speculative Scotsman, states that \\"had there been some sort of index, [he] would have gladly (and repeatedly) referred to it during the mind-boggling first third of The Quantum Thief\\", while proclaiming the novel to be \\"the sci-fi debut of 2010.\\" Awards * Nominee for the 2011 Locus Award for Best First Novel. \\"Gene Wolfe\\" .

Developed by Canadian studio Radical Entertainment and published by Activision, it is the sequel to 2009's Prototype. The game was announced at the 2010 Spike VGA Awards. Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on July 14, 2015 alongside the first game as Prototype Biohazard Bundle. Separate versions of the games became available in August 2015. The game features a new protagonist, James Heller, as he goes on a quest to destroy the Blacklight virus. The story is one of revenge, as Heller wants to kill Alex Mercer, protagonist of the original Prototype, after his family was killed in the outbreak of the Blacklight virus. While the game was a top seller for a period of time, its sales would eventually result in the downsizing of its developer. Gameplay James Heller can shapeshift and assume other people's identities and memories by consuming them. Taking people's identities and shapeshifting into them has become more tactical. Due to Blackwatch's actions in the Yellow Zone, if the player assumes the role of a soldier, people will react to him in a way that shows that they want nothing to do with him. To make sure that enemies do not overwhelm the player, Radical has created a dodging system and new, more realistic AI. Heller will be able to use weapons in the game, such as ripping the Gatling cannon off a tank and using it against enemies. Heller can also sneak up on unsuspecting human enemies, inject them with the Blacklight virus turning them into \\"BioBomb\\" to blow up spectacularly. Heller also has superhuman strength and agility, near- invulnerability to harm, near-flight leaping and gliding, infinite stamina, increased speed, and has a sonar sense. The sonar includes a new pulse ability that highlights the key features of an environment to make it easier for the player to find someone, instead of looking in a large crowd for a person with an icon above their head. Radical has stated that the powers will be more meaningful, appearing as mutations and upgrades that let players decide how they want to play as Heller. To give gamers more power in the game, the developers have added tendrils. Tendrils sprout from Heller's arm and can be used for a variety of purposes. Players can use tendrils to smash objects into other objects, such as a car into a tank, utilising the 'Black Hole' attack. Players will be able to dismember enemies, a force that will become more useful as the game progresses. There are many more ways to kill enemies, ranging from throwing a car at a group of Blackwatch soldiers, hacking off a mutant's head or using powers. Consuming has not changed since the original Prototype, with the exception of some enemies, which are consumed upon grabbing them (e.g. Supersoldiers, Brawlers). It has also been announced that Heller can now control a pack of Brawlers (similar to Prototypes Hunters) to attack anything he desires (note: this power is limited to main variant of Brawler). Heller will no longer find 'Events' throughout NYZ, instead starting side-missions by hacking into Blacknet. Blackwatch's system that details military operations and the three areas of NYZ, Heller chooses from a small list of missions at each terminal. Blacknet will allow Heller to find operations that he can disrupt or take control of for his own purposes and find important people that will allow him to learn more about what he has become because of the Blacklight virus. It will also help him find out more about Alex Mercer and what his connections are to his family's deaths. The missions that are selectable can be sidequests or extensions to the main quest that tell Heller more about the Blacklight virus. Plot One year after the events of the first game, U.S. Marine Sergeant James Heller, after returning from touring in Iraq, discovers his wife and daughter to be declared dead, causing him to rejoin the military in the fight for NYZ against the Blacklight virus. Heller is briefed on the previous outbreaks in Idaho in the 60's and in NYZ in the events of the first game. He later finds that Alex Mercer (the main protagonist in the first game) has now lost faith in humanity and begins chasing him. Pursuing Mercer for vengeance, Heller is infected by Mercer with a strain that imbues him with similar superhuman abilities. After blacking out, Heller awakens in a Yellow Zone lab where Gentek scientist Dr. Anton Koenig and Blackwatch Col. Douglas Rooks are experimenting on him. Heller escapes from the Gentek base, when Mercer confronts him and claims Gentek and Blackwatch are responsible for recreating and cultivating the Blacklight virus, making them responsible for the second infection and the deaths of Heller's family. Revealing his plans to take down Gentek and Blackwatch, Mercer offers a truce to Heller. Unsure of Mercer's intentions Heller goes to his local pastor, Father Luis Guerra, for advice and help. Using information supplied by Guerra, Heller hacks into Blacknet Terminals to find out about and sabotage a number of their operations. Gradually consuming his way through Blackwatch, Heller eventually finds and confronts Koenig, who claims to be on his side and reveals Blackwatch's super-soldier program, codenamed \\"Orion\\". Heller prevents Project: Orion's progress by killing a super-soldier who was injected with his DNA. After consuming one of the head scientists, Heller discovers that Koenig was observing him in order to find his weaknesses. Enraged at Koenig's betrayal, Heller tracks him down, only to discover that he has powers similar to he and Mercer, and is one of several \\"Evolved\\" agents planted in Gentek and Blackwatch by Mercer. After defeating and consuming the doctor, Mercer reveals to Heller that he intends to recruit him in an attempt to control NYZ. His doubts growing, Guerra then shows Heller a video tape of Mercer releasing the virus for the second time in Penn Station, the same place Mercer originally released and contracted the virus. Enraged at Mercer's deception, Heller sets off to the Green Zone to hunt down Mercer's henchmen, including an Evolved agent in Gentek named Sabrina Galloway; upon confronting Galloway, however, Heller reluctantly teams up with her when she reveals she can help him take down Mercer. With Galloway's help, Heller soon finds that Mercer plans to infect the entire world through \\"Whitelight\\", a contaminated vaccine released by Gentek that actually serves to accelerate infection and evolution rather than prevent it. Frustrated with Heller sabotaging his plans, Mercer confronts him and the two engage in a fight. However, Mercer's strength proves superior and he easily overpowers Heller. As Mercer attempts to consume Heller, a strange chemical reaction occurs, resulting in Mercer discovering he is unable to kill him due to his 'annoyingly resistant DNA', solidifying Heller's status as a virus-human hybrid. Mercer promptly flees, and Heller receives a call from Father Guerra. Guerra informs him that a large horde of infected have amassed outside his apartment. Heller arrives at Guerra's apartment, finding only his corpse. However, a grieving Heller uses Guerra's phone to reach Athena, Guerra's contact, who is revealed to be Dana Mercer. Dana explains that Heller's daughter, Maya, is still alive, prompting Heller to head for the Red Zone to take down Mercer and save Maya. After Heller prevents Blackwatch's second attempt to level Manhattan Island, Rooks takes Heller's daughter hostage in Gentek Headquarter and locks it with an unbreakable door, but Heller consumes an Alpha Juggernaut and temporarily obtains the ability to control other Juggernauts. Using this new ability, he breaks the door. Heller confronts Rooks, who reveals that he has a daughter of his own, and grants Heller free passage to leave NYZ. Before Heller can take Maya, Galloway arrives and kidnaps her, having joined forces with Mercer once more. Upon confronting Mercer, he reveals that he plans to solve international conflicts and world problems by infecting the entire human race, effectively creating a superorganism, with Maya's unique DNA inherited from her father acting as the catalyst. After Mercer absorbs Galloway and the remaining Evolved, the two engage in a bloody duel, only for James to emerge victorious and to kill and consume Mercer, who says, \\"Welcome to the top of the food chain\\", before dying. Subsequently, Heller wipes out the infected in NYZ along with most of the Blacklight Virus; then using Mercer's absorbed memories, Heller locates and frees Maya and Dana from a vault. The story then ends with the three overlooking New York before Dana questions what to do next. Radnet Prior to the game's launch, Radical Entertainment announced Radnet for Prototype 2 users who would either pre-order the game or buy a new copy. Radnet offers the player weekly in game abilities, events, challenges and avatar items. Upon the launch of the game, first-run copies and pre-ordered copies of the game would include 55 pieces of additional add-on downloadable content (DLC) at no extra cost. Included in the pre-order/launch content was in-game events, additional and optional challenges, avatar items for the Xbox 360 and themes for the PlayStation 3 and behind the scenes videos. In order to make Radnet coherent to players, Activision announced that the events playable in Radnet would be outside of the game's main storyline. The 55 pieces of DLC would be launched by Radical weekly from April 24 until June 7, with content available forever once unlocked. To earn the rewards given for an event or a challenge for a given week of DLC, players had to achieve at least a bronze medal in events and a minimal score threshold in challenges. To make Radnet more accessible, content will be available to all profiles on the console where Radnet was unlocked. Comic It was announced by Radical Entertainment that like the original Prototype, Prototype 2 would have a comic counterpart. The three part series takes place before the second video game, acting as a bridge between the two games. Published by Dark Horse Comics, the first comic was called the Anchor. After eradicating the virus in Africa, Mexico and Russia, Alex travels around the world, wondering about if the virus has made him a human, humanity's killer or its savior. Alex slowly begins to decide that he is the earth's savior and will usher it into a new age of prosperity after he wipes out humanity. However, this changes when he falls for a woman. When the woman betrays him, he decides that he will wipe out humanity, and so he returns to New York City and makes it NYZ. The second comic, dubbed the Survivors, focuses on a former police officer, Conrad, who joins up with Ami Levin, a religiously tolerant person and Marcie, an art student. The three run afoul of Lieutenant Riley; he would, however, agree to let Conrad see his wife, so long he agrees to work for Gentek. Unbeknownst to Conrad, his wife is dead, and he ended up in a project called Orion. The third comic, entitled the Labyrinth introduced Heller and Mike Marcos. Development Development of the game started soon after the success of the first game and was in development for three years. The game was first shown at the Spike 2010 VGA Awards in December. The game was revealed to be the main focus of the April 2011 EGM Issue. It was displayed in EGM and EGMI in 2011 revealing many new details about the game's plot, characters and gameplay. The game's graphics have been completely updated with buildings being much more detailed and deformation of vehicles, mutants and humans being much more visual. The game was also partially written by Dan Jolley. Prototype 2 used the Titanium 2.0 game engine. Promotion To promote the game, Radical Entertainment launched a Facebook app for the game. The app is called Blacknet, named after the game's mission system, and it allows fans to work together to \\"hack\\" the interface. Hacking it will allow the fans to uncover a series of videos, interviews and other behind the scenes content, all in the run up to the game‚Äôs launch. Also via Facebook, Radical unveiled that they would announce something huge for Prototype 2 at ComicCon. This was the ability to let people play the game, they also released the first of three trailers detailing the story of Prototype 2. At ComicCon, Activision held a raffle in which the winner won either the jacket worn by James Heller, or Alex Mercer's jacket; and a custom skinned Xbox 360. At ComicCon, Activision employees were handing out Prototype 2 themed merchandise, including T-shirts, posters, giant foam Heller Blade Arms and more materials based on the game. Activision released for iOS an official game titled ProtoSlice, available free to download. Activision has released a couple of trailers, Radical Entertaintment's team also went to Paris to promote the game in February 2012, and had a video interview with JeuxVideo Live. Commercials for the release of the game used the song \\"Hurt\\", as sung by Johnny Cash, in the background. The video depicts two live actors (one for Alex and one for James). James falls over the side of a building as if to commit suicide, while flashbacks of the war, his wife being found dead, seeing imprisoned civilians, and being infected by Mercer flash across his mind. Just as he hits the ground, he creates a shockwave killing multiple Blackwatch soldiers in the area, showing that he is infected and the suicide was just a misdirection to the viewer. He stands up, unharmed, and looks at Alex (who is standing a short distance away). Alex looks at James with a smile, who returns with an angry look. Alex displays his claws, and James displays his blade. James then rushes Alex while screaming loudly in rage. The words \\"The Power of Revenge\\" then flash on the screen. The video is around 1:27 seconds long. Reception Pre-release Out of all Activision's titles displayed at Comic Con, Prototype 2 was the most well received. Greg Miller of IGN awarded Prototype 2 as Activision's best game at Comic Con and did not mention anything negative in his preview for the game. Release Prototype 2 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms except the Xbox 360 version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. PlanetXbox360 called the game a \\"wonderful sequel that surpasses the original\\". At the time of his departure from the show, Community creator Dan Harmon considered Prototype 2 a great game. GameZone gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of nine out of ten and said it was \\"everything you could expect from a sequel, really. While there are certain elements that once again hunker back to the old days of Ultimate Destruction, Radical Entertainment has stepped up with a piece of sheer rollicking, do-whatever-you-want entertainment.\\" Edge gave the same console version eight out of ten and said, \\"There's a dazzling seamlessness to every aspect of Prototype 2. You feel it as you traverse the world, sprinting powerfully up buildings, bounding high into the air just as you reach the lip of the roof and then transitioning with a tap of the right trigger into a glide that will take you to the next rooftop.\\" 411Mania gave the game a score of eight out of ten and called it \\"a decent game. It's less frustrating than the first, with more options for customization, better abilities and more stuff to do. It's hampered though by a garbage storyline and a serious lack of Barry Pepper. It's worth a look if you liked the first game, or if you like super hero games at all.\\" The Guardian gave the Xbox 360 version a similar score of four stars out of five and stated, \\"The very purity of purpose which makes the game such a fine arcade killbox also renders it unengaging on any level that isn't soggy and littered with stray organs. So while as a destruction simulator Prototype 2 scores very highly, there's a chance that, just like those toddlers in the dirt, you'll get bored after a short while and wander away.\\" The Digital Fix gave the same console version a score of seven out of ten and said, \\"It's really not the AAA title it wants to be but that said it's also far from bargain bin fodder, landing somewhere just above the middle.\\" The Escapist gave it a similar score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"a decent action-adventure with fun combat, but gets a little too samey here and there.\\" Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five and said that it \\"excels as an open-world killing field, in which you can wrench anyone asunder in gory cascades of blood and guts. Underneath, it's a pretty standard action game featuring mundane missions that offer no real challenge, wrapped in a story that lacks substance and originality. But those players who can turn off their brain and just enjoy the ride will find Prototype 2s flavor of blood-soaked action a rather guilty pleasure.\\" Metro UK similarly gave it a score of six out of ten and said, \\"In small doses Prototype 2 is a perfectly enjoyable game but in the end, because Heller and Mercer don't care about anyone else you never end up caring about them.\\" Sales Although Prototype 2 was the top seller for April 2012, beating Kinect Star Wars and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, its sales were considerably down from the sales of games released in April 2011. Prototype 2 would continue its strong sales into the month of May, garnering more sales than the highly anticipated Dragon's Dogma, but failing to beat Max Payne 3 and fellow Activision Blizzard game Diablo III. On June 28, 2012, Activision announced that despite the \\"substantial investment\\", the game \\"did not find a broad commercial audience\\", and as a result, developer Radical would encounter layoffs and the studio would be reduced to a supporting role towards other Activision projects.

Pebble conglomerate is common at the base of the formation. Locally, where the unit is less than 10 ft thick, it is a fine- to medium- grained, gray, pyritic quartzite, grading into a dark-gray dolomitic sandstone. Stratigraphy The Hardyston unconformably overlies Precambrian crystalline basement rocks where it was deposited on an irregular surface and fills only the troughs or depressions. It gradationally underlies the Leithsville Formation of the Kittatinny Supergroup.

Opened in 1842, the station forms part of the Milan‚ÄìVenice railway, and is a junction for direct branch lines to Bologna, Bassano del Grappa and Camposampiero (junction for the line to Calalzo). Padova railway station is also the terminus of a short goods line to Padova Interporto. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia, NTV and Thello. Location Padova railway station is situated in Piazzale Stazione, north of the city centre. Features Passenger building The passenger building has both passenger facilities and commercial activities. These include a ticket office, a customer support office, the Club Eurostar, many automated ticket machines, a luggage deposit (also used as the sale of train tickets and SITA, FTV and CTM bus tickets), an office of the railway police, two newsagents, two bars, a supermarket, two travel agencies, a bank, a post office, three car rental offices, as well as numerous businesses and travel agencies. Station yard Currently the station yard is composed of: * Passenger yard with eleven loops, of which nine (tracks 1‚Äì3, and 5‚Äì10) are equipped with platforms and the remaining two (4 and 11) are used for manoeuvres, as well as stabling of trains; * Secondary yard (ex Yard A, ex Padova Scalo), located south of the line to Venice; used only for stabling of trains that originate or terminate at this station; * Locomotive depot, wedged between the lines to Milan and Bologna; * Wash stalls, located north of the line to Milan; also used for stabling of trains. Operating under this system are the Gruppo Scambi Altichiero (ex Bivio Altichiero) and the Gruppo Scambi Mont√† (ex Bivio Mont√†). Each of these yards connects with a corresponding namesake line from Padova Campo Marte railway station, and allows freight trains coming from Bologna to continue towards Camposampiero and Milan, respectively, without having to reverse direction. Train services The station is one of the main railway nodes of the Italian system, with approximately 18.5 million passenger movements per year. Around 450 passenger trains call at the station each day. They include trains of categories AV, ES *, ES *, CIS, EC, EN, Eurostar, IC, ICN, and R. The main domestic destinations served directly from Padua (all exclusively with Trenitalia trains) are Venice, Genoa, Turin, Como, Milan, Lecco, Bolzano/Bozen, Trento, Bassano del Grappa, Belluno, Calalzo di Cadore, Udine, Trieste, Mantua, Bologna, Florence, Pescara, Bari, Lecce, Rome, Naples, Messina, Palermo, Syracuse. Some of the services to and from Bassano and Trento are operated by Trentino Trasporti using Minuetto trains, but always on behalf of Trenitalia. The main international destinations are Nice, Paris, Geneva, Lausanne, Bern, Basel, Z√ºrich, Schaffhausen, Innsbruck, Munich and Vienna. International trains are made up of either Trenitalia or foreign railways' rolling stock, i.e. √ñsterreichische Bundesbahnen (√ñBB). In addition to passenger trains, the station is affected by a number of transit freight trains operated by both Trenitalia and other companies (Ferrovie Emilia Romagna, FFS Cargo, Linea, NordCargo, Sistemi Territoriali). These trains do not stop at the station for loading and unloading, as it has had no freight facilities since the 1990s; the freight facilities are now all concentrated at the Padova Interporto railway station.

Illidge's father moved to Manchester, and, dying young, left a young family ill-provided for. Illidge was educated in Manchester, and taught drawing. He was subsequently the pupil in succession of Mather Brown and William Bradley. He initially tried landscape painting, but married early, and, as a result, took up portrait-painting as a more profitable endeavour. Illidge was successful as a portrait-painter in the great manufacturing towns of Lancashire, painting many of the civic or financial celebrities of the locality. He was a frequent exhibitor at the Liverpool Academy from 1827. In 1842 he came to London, and was from that time was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Academy. In 1844, on the death of Henry Perronet Briggs, R.A., Illidge purchased the lease of the deceased artist's house in Bruton Street, Berkeley Square, where he commenced practice as a popular and fashionable portrait-painter.

Idwal, on the death of his father, fled for safety to the collegiate establishment at Llancarfan.

The science fiction series by Hannu Rajaniemi currently consists of the novels The Quantum Thief, The Fractal Prince, and The Causal Angel. Jean le Flambeur Jean le Flambeur (flambeur, French, \\"big-time gambler\\") is the protagonist of The Quantum Thief and The Fractal Prince. Events narrated from his point of view as Jean le Flambeur are in the first person, while all other points of view in the novels are narrated in the third person, including those in which Jean assumes another name, identity or disguise. In his identity as Jean le Flambeur, he prefers to wear a white shirt and velvet jacket, and sometimes sports blue shades. At the start of The Quantum Thief, he is imprisoned in the Dilemma Prison, a Sobornost prison located in the Neptunian Trojan belt, but is rescued by Mieli at the behest of Josephine Pellegrini, and tasked to undertake another heist. Clues from his memories lead them to Oubliette, a Moving City of Mars. Paul Sernine As Paul Sernine (a pseudonym and an anagram of Arsene Lupin, assumed in the Maurice Leblanc novel 813), Jean assumed the identity of an architect in order to hide his loot in the Oubliette. Jean had hoped that he could cast off his prior life as a thief and settle down in the Oubliette with Raymonde, his Oubliette lover. The Interlude chapters in The Quantum Thief with names taken from the nine Dignities are flashbacks to the events of the Paul Sernine era, and each of the main Oubliette characters in those Interlude chapters has a customized Watch carved with the corresponding Dignity. These chapters describe Jean's hope to cast off his past as Paul Sernine, his plan to do so and his subsequent departure from Mars, but in Xuexue's chapter, some backstory for how the solar system became post-human is introduced. Jean le Roi The events in The Quantum Thief are partly due to Jean's quest to retrieve his memories, and partly due to the manipulations, via gevulot, of Jean le Roi, who is stated by Jean to bear a very close resemblance to himself. In fact, it is stated outright in The Fractal Prince that Jean le Roi is actually another version of Jean le Flambeur. It appears that Jean le Roi was another version of Jean that was shipped out to the Oubliette as one of the initial prisoners, and that he had later risen after the prisoners' rebellion to become King of the Oubliette and, after the Revolution, the Cryptarch of the Oubliette. Jean le Roi claimed that he and Jean le Flambeur were cellmates at Sante Prison on Earth, but this is doubted by the latter, and le Roi then claimed that they were cellmates \\"after a fashion.\\" After Paul Sernine decided to leave Mars, Jean le Roi hooked up with Raymonde and fathered Isidore Beautrelet, while somehow convincing everyone that the child was Sernine's. At the end of The Quantum Thief, Jean le Roi is imprisoned in a Dilemma Prison brought about by the release of an Archon by Jean le Flambeur, but not before passing on the keys of the Cryptarch to Isidore, who used it to calm the splintered Oubliette population via the Voice. The Flower Thief Jean is sometimes described as the flower thief. This may be an allusion to his charisma, but he is also known to sometimes wear a flower on the lapel of his jacket. Mieli Mieli (Finnish, \\"mind\\") is an Oortian warrior\\"so battle-ready she has a fusion reactor embedded in her thigh\\"‚Äîand the daughter of Karhu of the Hiljainen Koto. She is bonded to serve the Sobornost Founder, Josephine Pellegrini, after losing her lover in Venus during the creation of a singularity and believing that Pellegrini will restore her lover back to her. In The Quantum Thief, Mieli is tasked to rescue Jean le Flambeur from the Dilemma Prison. She is ambivalent about her task, as she despises thieves but is ordered to help one. Her honor leads to occasional conflicts with Jean, but helped her to secure the tzadikkim's assistance when Jean's persuasion failed to work on the latter. She proves to be a skilled warrior and is crucial in extricating Jean from several dangerous situations. A bond between her and Jean soon develops, to the extent that she gives Pellegrini the right to make gogols of her (i.e. clone her, thus sacrificing her uniqueness) in exchange for permission to rescue Jean le Flambeur and the Oubliette from certain doom. In The Fractal Prince, Mieli has become more ambivalent about her task. Her loyalty to Pellegrini is tested when Jean's actions repeatedly endanger both her and her ship. More of her backstory is revealed through flashbacks, including the story of how she came to lose her lover, Syd√§n. Oortians The Oortians are a humanoid race from the Oort cloud. Their culture, as revealed by Mieli, is based on Finnish culture, as the Oortian colonies were presumably seeded by Finnish refugees from Earth. Mieli's name is Finnish, as is that of her lost lover, Syd√§n. Also, Jean makes references to the Oortian deities Kuutar and Ilmatar: both appear in the Kalevala, the former being the Moon spirit, the latter the air spirit. Oortians appear to have functional wings, as Mieli and Syd√§n are portrayed to have them. Perhonen Perhonen (Finnish, \\"butterfly\\") is a sentient Oortian spidership. She has a flirtatious personality and often fills the inside of the ship with butterfly avatars. She was sung from the alinen by Mieli. Syd√§n Syd√§n (Finnish, \\"heart\\") is an Oortian woman and the lost lover of Mieli. Mieli treasures a jewel of Syd√§n's that she managed to hold on to before Syd√§n was lost, and is very protective of it. In The Quantum Thief, it is implied that she is under the influence of the Sobornost, and that Mieli is bound to serve Pellegrini in the hope of being reunited with her. She appears to Mieli in the Dilemma Prison as a dream memory, which was supplied by Pellegrini to alleviate Mieli's ordeal. In The Fractal Prince, the story of how Mieli and Syd√§n became lovers and were then separated in Venus is revealed. Syd√§n was driven by a desire to visit the Inner System and later revealed that she desired immortality, instead of going into the alinen like the other Oortians. In The Causal Angel, its revealed/implied that Syd√§n was actually a creation of Josephine Pelligrini's, designed to entice and seduce Mieli to help bring her closer to Josephine so she could use her to access the Kaminari Jewel. The Sobornost The Sobornost (etymology) are a collective of entities who command millions, if not billions, of gogols and thereby have god-like powers over them and their environments. The arc of the Jean le Flambeur series appears to revolve around an emerging conflict amongst certain high-ranking members of the Sobornost, known as the Founders. The Founders were humans that gained power after the massive mind uploadings and thereby acquired individual command of a large number of gogols. The faces of seven Founders are carved into the Sobornost ships that carry the guberniyas and raions. Known Founders include Matjek Chen, Josephine Pellegrini, the Engineer-of-Souls (aka \\"Sasha\\"), the twins Hsien-ku, Vasilev, Sumanguru and Chitragupta. A copyclan is the collection of gogols commanded by a Sobornost entity that are its clones. Note that the entity need not be a Founder. A gogol that is in a copyclan of a Founder is referred to by the uncapitalized name of the Founder, so that a \\"pellegrini\\" is a copy of Josephine Pellegrini, and so on. The Sobornost were, and possibly still are, at war with the Zoku. The most recent war was the Protocol War, in which Jupiter was destroyed in the event known as the Spike. All- Defector The All-Defector is a purported glitch in the Dilemma Prison that appears to prisoners as themselves. This gogol always defects, hence the name. In the epilogue of The Quantum Thief, it is revealed that three gogols escaped from the Dilemma Prison: Jean le Flambeur, Mieli and the All-Defector, which Sasha states to be a creation of the Archons. This fact plays an important role in the events of The Fractal Prince. Archons The Archons (etymology) are the builders and wardens of Dilemma Prisons. They were created by the Engineer-of-Souls to provide prisons for the Sobornost. They are nanomachines motivated to create Dilemma Prisons to override the \\"old ugly physics\\" of the real world with the physics in the Dilemma Prison. Hence, they will convert any structure that is not a Dilemma Prison into one. But they are also entities that provide computational analysis. They are mentioned as providing a list of possible battle outcomes for the Sumanguru gogol during the Battle of the String. They are not Dragons, so therefore are based on edited human gogols (as all other Sobornost tech). Matjek Chen Matjek Chen is a Sobornost Founder and considered to be the Lord of the Inner System, if not the whole solar system. He made his first appearance in the series in the epilogue, The Hunter, of The Quantum Thief. Jean mentions in The Quantum Thief that when they were humans, he used to go drinking with Chen. In The Fractal Prince, Chen's role in the story is heightened, as the backstory of his past interactions with Josephine Pellegrini and Jean le Flambeur is explored in greater detail in the many flashbacks, presented in the novel as stories within stories. It is revealed that the Great Common Task originated from him as a goal for the Sobornost. He is also portrayed in the flashbacks as a precocious boy with great technical prowess. Engineer-of-Souls The Engineer-of-Souls, called Sasha by Josephine Pellegrini, is a Sobornost Founder who specializes in cultivating new types of minds inside his Guberniya in his \\"garden of souls\\", hence the title. His creations include the Archons, which are used to take care of criminals in the Dilemma Prison, the Dragons (although this has also been attributed to Chen) and the Hunter, which was created in the events of the eponymous chapter of The Quantum Thief at the behest of Pellegrini, presumably to hunt down Jean le Flambeur. In his prior life as a human, he studied at the University of Minsk and had romantic feelings for Pellegrini. Chitragupta Chitragupta is a Sobornost Founder. Not much known about him, likely is mystic and mathematician. Hsien-ku Hsien-ku are twins who are also Sobornost Founders. They are involved in a project on Earth that has a historical objective. Thus, they run a lot of ancestor virs. In The Fractal Prince, they sent a sumanguru to investigate the murder of Councilwoman Alile Soarez in Sirr. Jos√©phine Pellegrini Jos√©phine Pellegrini (namesake of the Countess of Cagliostro in the Arsene Lupin stories) is a Sobornost Founder and the employer of Mieli. She instigated the release of Jean from prison in The Quantum Thief, for reasons initially unknown, but it is revealed in the epilogue of the same novel that she is under threat from the other Founders and sees in Jean a potential weapon against her peers. It is hinted in The Quantum Thief that she and Jean shared a complicated past relationship, one that has both professional and romantic components, and this is revealed in greater detail in The Fractal Prince. In The Quantum Thief, the \\"pellegrini\\" is initially portrayed as a mysterious entity of the Sobornost, who wields god-like powers over Jean and Mieli. She has employed Mieli to free Jean from his prison for some unknown purpose. This apparently entails recovering Jean's lost memories, some of which are hidden in the Martian Moving City of Oubliette. As the story progresses, the \\"pellegrini\\" reveals, using Mieli's body as a mouthpiece, that she had an elaborate history with Jean, having possibly been both a mentor and a lover. At the end of the novel, the character of Jos√©phine Pellegrini is introduced as a Sobornost Founder. In The Fractal Prince, Jean has also realized the identity of the \\"pellegrini,\\" including the fact that she was his employer before he was caught and sent to the Dilemma Prison. Several flashbacks establish the circumstances of Jean's capture and the nature of his relation with Pellegrini. Mieli's story, particularly how she came to be under the employ of Pellegrini, is also detailed in The Fractal Prince. In Mieli's zoku Realm, in \\"The Causal Angel,\\" the witch Yuki-Onna, a creature from Japanese myth, represents the pellegrini. Sumanguru Sumanguru (etymology) is a Sobornost Founder and a warmind. As a human, he is said to have escaped a black box upload camp (perhaps similar to the one in the Ordos Desert, where Xuexue was stationed) when he was eleven, became a Fedorovist leader in Central Africa and single-handedly wiped out gogol trade there. In The Fractal Prince, it is revealed that he is the Sobornost warmind trapped inside the Schr√∂dinger's Box that Jean le Flambeur has stolen from the Zoku, after Jean used a Realmgate in a Zoku router to enter the Realm in the Box. Both Sumanguru and Jean appear to remember that it was Matjek Chen who betrayed Sumanguru, and Jean attempted to use this memory to lure Sumanguru out of the zoku Realm with the promise of revenge on Chen. Nevertheless, Sumanguru had become angry with Jean for letting him be trapped in the Box and decided not to cooperate. Unfortunately, Jean had a firmament vir running on Oortian hardware (the ship Perhonen) and Sobornost software, and so was able to trap Sumanguru's Founder Code. Vasilev Anton Vasilev is a Sobornost Founder. His physical appearance is described as that of a teenager who is \\"blond and remarkably handsome, with regular Slavic features,\\" around 15 years old. His copyclan is apparently behind the gogol piracy operation on the Oubliette, as Jean and Mieli had to negotiate with vasilevs to gain the technology needed to hack the Oubliette gevulot. Vasilevs engaged in gogol piracy are known to be very vicious when they attack their victims, and will self-destruct when apprehended by the authorities. In \\"The Causal Angel\\", Josephine Pellegrini reveals that Anton Vasilev was recruited into the Founders to serve as their public face and endorser. She describes him as \\"a virtual popstar, a media cyborg, worshipped by millions.\\" It is also revealed that Pellegrini regretted the method by which she recruited Vasilev, claiming she \\"left him with a wound that never healed,\\" and it is implied that this is the source of his animosity towards her. The Oubliette Isidore Beautrelet Isidore Beautrelet (the namesake of the boy detective in Maurice Leblanc's Ars√®ne Lupin novel, The Hollow Needle)Review by TW Wagner at SF Reviews.net is a student of architecture and an amateur detective. He is only ten Martian years old when he attracts unwelcome fame after solving a gogol piracy case that was brought to his attention by The Gentleman. This fame brings him to the attention of the millenniaire, Christian Unruh, who summons him to solve the mystery of the impossible appearance of a note at his residence. His investigations eventually lead to astonishing revelations, not just about his past, but the Oubliette's as well. Specifically, he learns that the Oubliette is a panopticon and that the Revolution was a lie, perpetuated by the zoku colony to sugar-coat the Oubliette's history as the posthuman version of Australia. (The latter was also discovered by Unruh, a fact that shocked him greatly and led to his choice of an early Quiet.) He also realizes that gevulot is not as secure as people thought, but that a master key exists. It turns out that Jean le Roi holds the master key, being the Cryptarch and former King of the Oubliette, and that he is also the father of Isidore, something confirmed by Jean le Flambeur after Isidore's initial misapprehension that Jean le Flambeur was his actual father. At the end of The Quantum Thief, Isidore is the de facto Cryptarch of the Oubliette, having received the master key to gevulot from Jean le Roi. However, it is also hinted that he takes after Jean le Flambeur, not only in his choice of studying architecture at university (Jean, as Paul Sernine, was apparently an accomplished architect), but also in his successful theft of Jean's Watch during their farewell. Dignities of God The nine Dignities of God are nine Watches, custom-made by Paul Sernine (aka Jean le Flambeur) and given to nine Oubliette citizens whom he considered to be his friends. They form the price if ever Jean le Flambeur were to claim the loot he locked in the memory palace: to claim it, he must fire a revolver nine times, each time draining one Watch of its Time and sending one of his friends to an irreversible Quiet. The known Dignities (chapter names) and their owners are: * Goodness: Xuexue in the robot garden, a former uploader at the Iridescent Gateway of Heaven, an upload camp in the Ordos desert. * Will: Isaac the rabbi and drinking buddy, who gave Paul Sernine the idea to lock up his toys. * Wisdom: Bathilde, the patron of Sernine's work, Hallway of Birth and Death. * Truth: Marcel the artist, and the story of how his partner, Owl Boy, was hurt in the Spike. * Virtue: Gilbertine Shalbatana, who carries the Box in her exomemory. Isaac Isaac is a rabbi and a drinking buddy of Paul Sernine. He gave Sernine the idea to lock up his loot, which Sernine did by building the nine buildings in the Maze and fashioning the nine Dignities. When Raymonde shows Jean the revolver, she also tells him that Sernine had said to pass on the message that he should see Isaac, which Jean does. Odette Odette (etymology) is an assistant of Christian Unruh, the millenniaire. She approached Isidore to investigate a mystery for Unruh, the millenniaire, after Isidore made it into the newspapers upon solving a gogol piracy case. Quiets The Quiets are machines operated by the downloaded consciousnesses of Oubliette citizens who have entered the Quiet. They can be best described as servants who perform the menial and administrative tasks that keep the Oubliette society running. Examples include: Atlas Quiets who support the Moving City; Quiets defending Oubliette from the constant attacks of the phoboi plague; security and civil service Quiets, who are sometimes in humanoid form; and Quiets who assist the Resurrection Men. Raymonde Raymonde is a musician who was the lover of Paul Sernine (the pseudonym assumed by Jean le Flambeur when he was a citizen of the Oubliette). When Jean comes to look for her in the events of The Quantum Thief, she is composing an opera about the Revolution. Raymonde believed that she was with Jean le Flambeur's child, not knowing that it was le Roi who fathered Isidore. In the 20 years (10 Martian years) after Paul Sernine left, she decided to take an early Quiet. After coming back from the Quiet, she disguises herself as the mysterious tzadik The Gentleman and mentors Isidore in his detective work, drawing his attention to a gogol piracy case at the start of The Quantum Thief. Resurrection Men The Resurrection Men are charged with implementing the resurrection laws in the Oubliette. As citizens of the Oubliette transit to the Quiet, their Noble bodies are collected by the Resurrection Men and stored until their time in the Quiet is complete, after which their consciousness is downloaded back into their bodies. Tzadikkim The tzadikkim (plural; singular tzadik, see Hebrew meaning) are a vigilante group formed by Oubliette citizens, out of concern for the gogol piracy that is plaguing the Oubliette. This may also be a reference to The Tsaddik of the Seven Wonders (1971), a Jewish-themed comic fantasy novel by Isidore Haiblum. After their botched negotiations with the vasilevs in the Museum of Contemporary Art on the Oubliette, Mieli obtained some information about the identities of the tzadikkim from the vasilev mind she captured. This led her to barge in on the altercation between Jean le Flambeur and Raymonde in Raymonde's apartment. When Jean and Mieli meet the tzadikkim in the Silence's kitchen in Montgolfiersville, there are six of them: The Silence (faceless dark blue mask, tall male), the Futurist (Mme Diaz, as Jean revealed; dresses in red, moves very quickly), the Rat King (male with a young high-pitched voice and a thick body), Cockatrice (blonde female in a red leotard and a Venetian-style mask, whom Jean would flirt with under normal circumstances), the Bishop (skull-faced tall male with bony knees) and the Gentleman (Raymonde). Christian Unruh Christian Unruh (possibly named after physicist W. G. Unruh, literally \\"restless\\" or \\"unquiet\\" in German, Unruh is also a technical term for a central part of mechanical watches) is a millenniaire, a person who is very rich in Time. When he first meets Isidore, he is about to organize a farewell party for himself, as he has elected to enter Quiet early. A mysterious note has appeared under impossible circumstances in his residence, announcing a gate-crasher to his party. After learning of Isidore's exploits, Unruh summons him to solve the mystery. Xuexue Xuexue is a citizen of the Oubliette. Her story gives an infodump of how mind uploading was carried out prior to events in The Quantum Thief. In the Goodness chapter, she recalled to Paul Sernine how she would persuade parents in situations of distress (e.g. after suffering a natural disaster) into letting their children be uploaded. The children would then be led to an upload camp in the Ordos desert, called the Iridiscent Gateway of Heaven. There, they would be subjected to harsh training before being uploaded. Later, the Ordos desert operation was raided by drones, possibly on the orders of Matjek Chen, as revealed in The Fractal Prince. Fearing for her life, Xuexue uploaded herself. Eventually, she ended up as a prisoner gogol of the Oubliette and, later, a citizen. When Paul Sernine found her, she loved to smile at the red robot in the garden. Sirr Sirr is a city on Earth, which is now ravaged by rogue nanites or \\"wildcode.\\" Wildcode is apparently nanotechnology that has somehow hybridized with the biosphere and poses a mortal danger to baseline humans and Sobornost bodies alike. Most of the remnants of humanity on Earth live in Sirr and depend on the Seals, which are apparently produced by the Gomelez family, to protect themselves from the wildcode. Abu Nuwas Abu Nuwas (namesake) is a wealthy gogol merchant on Sirr. Gary K. Wolfe reviews Hannu Rajaniemi at Locus magazine The thought-form of the jinn entwined to him is a serpent of fire. Cassar Gomelez sought his support in the vote on amending the Cry of Wrath Accords, in exchange for which Abu Nuwas asked for the chance to woo his daughter, Tawaddud Gomelez. Alile Soarez The death of Councilwoman Alile Soarez is the trigger for many events in The Fractal Prince. It threatens to weaken the Gomelez family's push for renegotiating the Cry of Wrath Accords with the Sobornost, and leads to the invitation of a sumanguru to investigate the death. In the course of the investigation, Tawaddud is led to realize some frightening truths. The Aun In The Fractal Prince, the Aun are strange entities of Sirr who hold god-like powers over the wildcode and demanded true stories from those who seek boons from them. As Cassar Gomelez recalls, the Aun were four: The Chimney Princess, The Green Soldier, The Lightkraken and The Flower Prince. They use to live as ghosts and shadows in the minds of humans, painfully copied from one host to another, and using promises of immortality to ensure that they would be remembered. But when immortality became more real, they were in danger of dying out, until someone came to set them free: the Prince of Stories. When Sirr fell, they appeared to Zoto Gomelez, the grandfather of Cassar, and asked if he and his people would like to be turned into stories. Zoto had a wife and children, however, so he chose to ask the Aun to protect them from the wildcode, in return for letting the Aun see the world through human eyes and offering them worship. This they did, by teaching Zoto how to use Secret Names to make Seals to be used as armour against the wildcode. However, throughout The Fractal Prince, only three of the four are regularly seen. The Flower Prince is missing and the Aun do not seem to know why. The Axolotl The Axolotl was a lover of Tawaddud Gomelez and is reputed to be the father of the body thieves. As a human, his original name was Zaybak. He remembers his days as a human: taking the train, which smelled of people, fast food and coffee. After the Collapse, he learned to adjust to his bodiless life and make himself a dream-train. One day, in that train, he met the Flower Prince, who offered to tell him the secret of stealing a human body. Zaybak accepted and caused a wave of body thefts and debauchery in Sirr, an event known to Tawaddud as the \\"night of the ghuls.\\" The name, \\"axolotl,\\" may be a reference to a Julio Cort√°zar short story entitled \\"Axolotl\\" in his 1956 collection Final del juego, about a man who trades minds with an axolotl in an aquarium. Cassar Gomelez Cassar Gomelez (the namesake of a character in The Manuscript Found in Saragossa by Jan Potocki) is the father of Dunyazad and Tawaddud and a member of the Sirr Council. Dunyazad Gomelez Dunyazad Gomelez (being the namesake of the sister of Scheherazade) is a daughter of Cassar Gomelez and the sister of Tawaddud. There is a rivalry between her and her sister, as she is a respected muhtasib trusted by her father, while Tawaddud is the black sheep of the family. Emina Emina (possibly in reference to one of the two Moorish princesses in The Manuscript Found in Saragossa) is an acquaintance of Tawaddud Gomelez who works in the Palace of Dreams. When Tawaddud arrives at the Palace with the sumanguru, Emina initially reprimands Tawaddud for having the nerve to return after causing trouble at the Palace, due to the Repentants coming for Tawaddud, but later relents and agrees to take Tawaddud to see Kafur to find the Axolotl. Kafur Kafur taught Tawaddud Gomelez how to entwine with jinni, during the period when Tawaddud ran away from her family. Masrurs The masrurs are a jinni guerilla movement who have been attacking soul trains in protest against the modification of the Cry of Wrath Accords, proposed by Councilman Gomelez. This would enable Sobornost machines to harvest gogols from the wildcode desert, something which the Cry of Wrath had previously stopped the Sobornost from doing so. Mr Sen Mr Sen is a jinn and a member of the Council. Tawaddud Gomelez Tawaddud Gomelez (being the namesake of the knowledgeable Tawaddud in the story \\"Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud) is a daughter of Cassar Gomelez. She is considered to be the black sheep of her family, having abandoned her mutalibun husband, Veyraz, for the City of the Dead and consorted with the father of body thieves, the Axolotl, for which she was branded the \\"lover of monsters\\" by her father and gained a reputation as the \\"Axolotl's whore.\\" Veyraz Veyraz ibn' Ad, of House Uzeda, was the husband of Tawaddud Gomelez, and substantially older than Tawaddud. Cassar Gomelez gave Tawaddud to be his wife when she was very young. Tawaddud was his second wife, the first having become possessed and gone to the City of the Dead to live as a ghul. Zoto Gomelez Zoto Gomelez (\\"Zoto\\" being the name of another character from The Manuscript Found in Saragossa) is the great- grandfather of Tawaddud and Dunyazad Gomelez. He made a pact with the Aun so that the remaining humans on Earth could be protected from the wildcode. The Zoku The Zoku (Japanese, \\"clan\\") are a transhuman faction who have a colony on the Oubliette and a city on Saturn. Jupiter used to be a home for them before the Spike happened, in which Jupiter was destroyed. The Oubliette colony was founded by the Jovian Zoku refugees. Their origins can be traced back to gamer communities from before the beginning of the massive mind uploading, and they hold Tangleparties, which can be thought of as a quantum version of LAN parties, to remember who they were. Unlike the Sobornost, whose Great Common Task demanded the rewriting of the laws of the universe to eliminate death (epitomized, according to the in-universe exposition, by the no-cloning theorem), the Zoku embraces quantum reality, which makes them \\"quantum filth\\" in the eyes of some Sobornost entities. The Protocol War was a conflict between the Sobornost and the Zoku over precisely this difference. Pixil Pixil (possibly a corruption of the word \\"pixel\\") is the zoku girlfriend of Isidore. She lives in the zoku colony on the Oubliette.The Quantum Thief, review-essay by Andrew Wheeler She reveals the identity of the Gentleman to Isidore, which leads him to confront Raymonde and thereby piece together what Jean, as Paul Sernine, had done in the past and is about to do soon. She decides to help Isidore save the Oubliette, against the wishes of the zoku colony, which prompted the zoku colony to come out in full force against the phoboi tide that threatened the Oubliette. Barbicane Barbicane is Elder of the Gun Club Zoku, which oversees the creation and preservation of weapons and ships. Barbicane made the spaceship Leblanc for Jean le Flambeur and has kept it secured in the Gun Club since le Flambeur's imprisonment in the Dilema Prison. This character shares a name Impey Barbicane who is president of the Baltimore Gun Club in Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon..

Career Together with his father, he was a patron of the homilist, √Ülfric of Eynsham. In 987 √Üthelm√¶r founded or re-founded Cerne Abbey in Dorset, and in 1005 founded Eynsham Abbey in Oxfordshire, where he made √Ülfric its first abbot,Malcolm Godden, √Ülfric of Eynsham, Oxford Online DNB, 2004 along with Priory of Bruton in Somerset. √Ülfric dedicated his Lives of the Saints to √Üthelm√¶r. In a charter of 993 in which King √Üthelred II laments his past misrule, which had resulted ‚Äúpartly on account of the ignorance of my youth, and partly on account of the abhorrent greed of certain of those men who ought to administer to my interest‚Äù, √Üthelmaer is acknowledged, along with King‚Äôs uncle, Ordulf of Tavistock, as a loyal counsellor, and from the mid 990s he generally appears first among the ministers witnessing charters, followed by Ordulf, Wulfheah and Wulfgeat. Upon the death of his father √Üthelweard in 998, no ealdorman was appointed to the Western Provinces, though both √Üthelm√¶r and Ordulf, whose father Ordgar had preceded √Üthelweard, would have been obvious candidates. From 1006 the notorious Eadric Streona leapfrogs √Üthelmaer, Ordulf, Wulfgeat and Wulfheah, to the head of the list of ministers. Wulfheah is known to have been blinded after Eadric murdered his father, ealdorman √Ülfhelm of York, while Wulfgeat was deprived of all his lands. Ordulf is another who ceases to witness after 1006, and it is probable that the √Üthelmaer who continues to attest charters after this date is another prominent thegn, √Üthelmaer son of √Üthelwold. Another √Üthelmaer who occasionally attests charters at this time in a lower position is possibly one of the brothers of Eadric Streona.Simon Keynes, \\"The Diplomas of King √Üthelred 'The Unready' 978-1016\\", 1980 By 1013 √Üthelmaer had evidently regained any lost favour as he had assumed his father's old ealdormanry of the Western Provinces. In this year he and his followers surrendered to the Danish invader Swein Forkbeard, who was encamped at Bath. He died in 1015. Descendants One of his sons √Üthelnoth, became Archbishop of Canterbury. Another, √Üthelweard, was killed by Cnut in 1017, while a son-in-law also called √Üthelweard was exiled in 1020. √Üthelm√¶r has been speculatively identified with the Agelm√¶r named by John of Worcester as brother of Eadric Streona and father of Wulfnoth Cild, who was father of Godwin, Earl of Wessex and grandfather of King Harold II, though the Worcester chronicler makes this Agelm√¶r son of Agelric rather than √Üthelweard and the pedigree as a whole has problematic chronology.Alfred Anscombe, \\"The Pedigree of Earl Godwine\\" in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 1913, 3rd Series, vol. 7, pp. 129-150Barlow, Lundie W. \\"The Antecedents of Earl Godwine of Wessex\\" in New England Historical and Genealogical Register, 1957, vol. 111, pp. 30-38David H.

Its habitat is rocky mountain canyons on cliffs of dolomite. This is a perennial herb growing from a tough, woody caudex with a basal rosette of narrow linear or lance-shaped leaves coated in branching hairs. The erect stem grows 10 to 30 centimeters tall. It is covered in a feltlike coat of hairs. The inflorescence atop the stem produces 8 to 35 flowers which grow outward and then droop. The flower has fuzzy-haired sepals and four petals each up to a centimeter long. The petals are yellow or brick red in color, or sometimes yellow with brick red tips. The fruit is a hairy silique up to four centimeters long. It is attached to the stem by a very short stalk which measures one or two millimeters long.

History Map of the ruins of the Shorchuk/Qigexing site by Albert Gr√ºnwedel (1912), X: little temple, boxed X: large temple, o: stupas In prehistory Qigexing was part of the city state of ƒÄr≈õi or Agni (now known as Karasahr/Qarasheher). ƒÄr≈õi is believed to have been the homeland of an extinct Indo-European language known as \\"Tocharian A\\", or Agnean, and was significant in the introduction of Buddhism to China. As late as the 6th century CE, Buddhist works and official documents were being written in Tocharian A. ƒÄr≈õi was mentioned in Chinese sources, as early as the Han Dynasty, as the Kingdom of Yanqi ( or Yen-ch'i ‚Äì a derivative of ƒÄr≈õi/Agni). Qigexing was conquered by the Han Dynasty in 94 CE, during its reconquest of the Tarim Basin. The Buddhist monk Faxian visited the area of Yanqi around 400 CE and mentions the presence of about 4,000 monks who were practicing Hinayana Buddhism.Marianne Yaldƒ±z: Arch√§ologie und Kunstgeschichte Chinesisch-Zentralasiens (Xinjiang), Leiden, 1987 The monk Xuanzang, who lived in the 7th century CE, reports the existence of 10 Buddhist monasteries with 2,000 monks who belonged to the Sarvastivada school of Buddhism in the area around Yanqi. In 644 CE, the Tang Dynasty invaded and annexed Yanqi during their wars against the Western Turks, a conflict that would last until the Turks were defeated in 657 CE. Tang control of the kingdom was re-established in 648 CE when a Tang general defeated a usurper who had deposed the puppet ruler that the Tang installed four years before. In 719 CE, the Tang established one of the Four Garrisons of Anxi in Yanqi, the other garrisons were in Kucha, Kashgar, and Hotan. Aurel Stein hypothesized that the Buddhist temples of Qigexing were burned during an iconoclasm after Islam became the state religion of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. Archeological finds in Qigexing include the ruins of larger temple compounds (with more than 100 buildings in total) as well as twelve cave temples. The remains of some wall paintings and in particular sculptures have been discovered at the site. Sculptures have been found as individual figures as well as in friezes. The style of the artworks mixes indo-Iranian elements with Chinese styles. The depiction of human heads at the site has a characteristic style with faces that are bulged out like balloons. The Qigexing site is also an important source for manuscripts written in the East Tocharian language, also known as Tocharian A or Agnean after Agni an ancient name for Yanqi. Of the 1150 leaves and fragments in East Tocharian that were included in a 2007 survey, 383 came from a single scriptorum in Qigexing.Valerie Hansen, The Silk Road: A New History, Oxford University Press, Jul 17, 2012 The site was investigated by Albert Gr√ºnwedel during third German Turfan expedition (1905-1907),Zaturpanskij, Choros (i.e. A. v.

Dimick expanded from a small custom gun store, to a larger emporium selling a variety of firearms and even manufacturing cannons. Dimick was respected for the quality of his firearms, but especially well known for his percussion rifles, especially his highly accurate plains rifles. During the Civil War, Dimick became nationally famous for providing the rifles for the elite sharpshooters of the 66th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment.Dan P. Fagan, The Dimick Rifles of the 66th Illinois Infantry, The Gun Report, March 1996, pgs. 16‚Äì27 Early years Horace E. Dimick was born in Vermont around 1809. By 1839 he had moved to Lexington, Kentucky where he initially owned an upholstering company. Sometime afterwards he entered the gunsmithing trade, becoming well known locally and even nationally. In a December 15, 1846 letter from the Army Ordnance Officer in Washington, Dimick is praised for his \\"...great skill...and his success in the applying of new principles to firearms...his plan for rifles is now acknowledged to be the best extant.\\"Herschel C. Logan, H.E. Dimick of St Louis, The American Rifleman, vol.106, April 1958, pg.29 Around 1849, Dimick moved to St. Louis, which was then the center of frontier firearms manufacturing. Dimick opened his first establishment at 39 North Main St. and found himself in competition with some of the world's finest gunsmiths, including the famed Hawken Brothers. Dimick expanded beyond gunsmithing, providing a variety of frontier goods at his \\"Western Emporium\\". Civil booster J. N. Taylor describes H. E. Dimick and Company's wide selection in his 1858 Sketch book of St. Louis: > \\"The position held by this house is second to none in the world, and has > been achieved by the exertions of Mr. Horace E.

Startup Weekend is a 54-hour weekend event, during which groups of developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing experts, graphic artists and more pitch ideas for new startup companies, form teams around those ideas, and work to develop a working prototype, demo, or presentation by Sunday evening. Startup Weekend has grown into an organization with a global presence. As of December 2016, Startup Weekend has reached 135 countries, involving over 210,000 entrepreneurs. Upon its 2015 acquisition, Startup Weekend, alongside Startup Week and StartupDigest, became one of the Techstars family of startup programs. History Founded in July 2007 in Boulder, Colorado by Andrew Hyde, Startup Weekend brought together 70 entrepreneurs to try to create a startup in just 54 hours. The model quickly expanded to cities around the world. In January 2010, Marc Nager and Clint Nelsen took over full ownership and registered the organization as a not-for-profit, relocating to Seattle. As of the acquisition, Startup Weekend had organized approximately 80 events in the USA, England, Germany and Canada. In February 2010, Franck Nouyrigat joined as a Co-Director and CTO. In the fall of 2010, Startup Weekend gained 501c3 status and received a grant from the Kauffman Foundation. By December 2010, the organization was composed of 8 full-time employees, over 15 'Key Facilitators', and more than 100 local organizers. In 2011, Startup Weekend launched the StartUp Foundation Initiative in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. In June 2012, Startup Weekend opened its first regional offices in London and Mexico City. By 2016, Startup Weekend events ran in over 1000 cities around the world. Event model Startup Weekend events span the course of a weekend (approximately 54 hours), and are generally composed of 60-120 participants (although events in the past have ranged from 13 to 300+). In addition to attendees (otherwise known as 'Weekend Warriors'), the event attracts speakers, coaches, panelists (generally well- respected members of the local startup community or notable names in the tech industry), and various sponsors and company representatives. A good share of teams end up working together beyond the startup weekend to build a fully operating startup and others take with them the bootcamp experience and a network of like minds. Global Startup Battle Startup Weekend launched the Global Startup Battle in 2011 during Global Entrepreneurship Week. The 2012 battle included 10,000+ participants, 1,200+ teams, taking place in 100+ cities around the world. Global Startup Battle has three phases: First, the team must win the local Startup Weekend. Second, the team must win a Facebook popularity contest by receiving votes. Only the top 15 teams move on to the final stage. The final stage is a judging panel. In 2016, Global Startup Battle, shifted to become Global Startup Weekend, a world-wide celebration of Startup Weekends.

Richard Mowry of Uxbridge, MA, his ancestors and his descendants; by William Augustus Mowry Family  Richard Mowry was born as a fifth generation descendant into a family that was prominent during the 17th and 18th century in southern New England: Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. His family had a deed from the native Americans dating from 1666. There is a book written about Richard Mowry of Uxbridge, Massachusetts and his descendants, written by his great grandson, a prolific American historical writer, William Augustus Mowry. The original family deed alludes to Roger Williams, John Brown, Edward Inman and John Sayles, early prominent Rhode Islanders. Nathaniel and John Mowry appear to be the first Mowry settlers in the Providence township around 1671. Richard Mowry was born in Smithfield, on Feb. 11, 1748 to Attorney Joseph Mowry of Glocester, Rhode Island, which at the time bordered Uxbridge. His father died when Mowry was 16, and he learned to be a carpenter at Scituate, Rhode Island. He married Phebe Smith of Glocester, who died the following year. On January 5, 1774 he married Huldah Harris, daughter of Gideon of Scituate. They had six children. Their first child was born at Scituate in 1775. From 1778 on, the children were born at Uxbridge. Mowry lived in Uxbridge from that point on. Huldah died in 1795 at the age of 50. He married again in 1802, to Isabel Chacc, and had two other children by his third marriage. Isabel died in 1820. Quaker roots One can see early connections of the Mowry family to John Brown and Moses Brown at Providence. Moses Brown, who founded Brown University, was an early Quaker and was prominent in the anti-slavery movement in Rhode Island. In 1771 at the age of 22 or 23, Richard Mowry began to attend Friends Meetings in Rhode Island. At that time the Friends meeting from neighboring Smithfield, Rhode Island had extended into South Uxbridge, Massachusetts, just across the colonial line from Glocester and Smithfield. Thus the Mowry family descended from Richard Mowry derived Quaker roots from the time of the Revolution. He formally joined the society on August 25, 1778, and was apparently at the Uxbridge Quaker meeting since his children are all born in that community from that time on. He lived in South Uxbridge for the next 60 years. Quaker City The village where the Mowrys lived came to be known as \\"Quaker City\\" and is said to be among the earliest places of industrialization in the US. It is part of the historic Blackstone Valley National Heritage Corridor, which is of national significance to the earliest industrialization of the US. There was an iron forge at Ironstone, Massachusetts, just south of Quaker City, started by Benjamin Taft in 1734. Caleb Handy added a triphammer after the American Revolution. The Quakers built buildings from bricks from Moses Farnum's farm. Bog Iron from near the Blackstone River provided the ore for metal working. Grist mills, saw mills, and apparently the earliest textiles from Richard Mowrys marketing and manufactures sprang up nearby. Mowry recorded extensive travels in New England and Central New York, and visited over 88 Quaker meetings, possibly also marketing his inventions for cider or cloth. The reference notes that Richard Mowry was a Quaker preacher and that this tradition and practice shaped early Quaker City and its families. His role as a Quaker preacher was the primary motivation for his extensive travels. A farmer and a carpenter In South Uxbridge, he bought the farm of Benjamin Archer, and with his carpenter's trade became highly proficient as a cabinet maker and working with tools. It is no doubt that with this skill set, he was able to build and market the equipment described at the outset to manufacture linens and other materials. He was also a carriage builder and a cider press builder, being an expert with \\"large wooden screws\\". The Southwick family, David and Elisha, both Quakers, of South Uxbridge, continued this tradition, and even made Conestoga wagon wheels in the Quaker tradition during the 19th century.

As a diplomat he is known for negotiations with the Second Polish Republic and League of Nations regarding Vilnius Region. As a historian he specialized in the history of Lithuania in the 13‚Äì16th centuries and lectured at the University of Lithuania and Vilnius University from 1924 until his death. He published little, but had a formative influence on the subsequent generations of historians. Biography From 1904, Jonynas studied history at the University of Moscow under Matvei Kuzmich Liubavskii, an expert on the Lithuanian Metrica‚Äîmedieval archives of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Liubavskii's critical approach to historical sources greatly influenced Jonynas. Jonynas participated in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and thus had to transfer to the University of Grenoble to study French language and literature. He also attended lectures on history at the University of Berlin. Acquitted by Russian courts, he returned to Moscow to finish his studies. After graduation in 1911, he worked as a school teacher in Noginsk and Moscow until 1919. At the end of World War I, he returned to Lithuania and joined the People's Commissariat of Education of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the failure of the Soviet government, he lived in Vilnius, worked as a school principal, and opposed Polish ambitions in the city. For a few months in mid-1920, he was the chief Lithuanian commissioner in the Vilnius Region. After the 1920 ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny, during which Polish forces captured Vilnius, Jonynas moved to Kaunas and joined the control commission of the League of Nations to negotiate the dispute over the Vilnius Region. After the diplomatic efforts failed in 1922, Jonynas continued to be employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania until 1929. From 1924 until his death, he lectured at the University of Lithuania and Vilnius University, attaining professorship in 1932. Works As a historian, Jonynas wrote little convinced that his works were not properly researched or that everything was already written by somebody else. He contributed articles on Lithuanian dukes, nobles, treaties, and other topics to the Lithuanian Encyclopedia, the first universal encyclopedia in the Lithuanian language. He studied and translated from Latin De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum (posthumously published in 1966). His most important work was a study on the family of Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1392 to 1430. However, Jonynas helped to form a new generation of Lithuanian historians and raised their level of professionalism. He always critically analyzed primary sources and dismissed secondary sources‚Äîthus helping to rid Lithuanian historiography of mistakes, medieval legends and myths, foreign biases and stereotypes.

It is a riverine and \\"swamp crop\\" similar to taro, but \\"with bigger leaves and larger, coarser roots.\\" There are no demonstrably wild populations today, but it is believed to be native to Indonesia. It is known as puraka in Cook Islands, lak in Yap (Federated States of Micronesia), babai in Kiribati, pula‚Äôa in Samoa, via kan in Fiji, pulaka in Tokelau and Tuvalu, simiden in Chuuk, swam taro in Papua New Guinea, navia in Vanuatu and palawan in the Philippines. The same species is also known by the names Cyrtosperma lasioides, Cyrtosperma chamissonis and Cyrtosperma edule. In the harsh atoll environments of the Central Pacific, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, swamp taro is an important source of carbohydrates in a diet dominated by fish and coconut. Its cultivation is difficult and time- consuming, and the plant has deep cultural as well as practical significance. The roots need to be cooked for hours to reduce toxicity in the corms, but are rich in nutrients, especially calcium. The cultivation of Pulaka in Tuvalu, and babai in Kiribati, is an important cultural and culinary tradition, now under threat from rising sea level and displacement from the growing use of imported food products. In Nepal, Giant Swamp Taro is called mane and grows in the tropical and sub tropical forests along stream banks. It is gathered in January‚ÄìFebruary and all plant parts (leaf, stem, rhizomes) are savored after being boiled and roasted. The stem requires prolonged boiling and the water is replaced once to remove irritating chemicals. If cooked carefully, the rhizomes taste like taro and the leaves like spinach. But without careful washing, the food causes an unpleasant tingling or scratchy sensation. Species Giant swamp taro is the largest of the root crop plants known collectively as Taro, which are cultivated throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Although outwardly similar to Colocasia esculenta, the most widely cultivated taro, it belongs to a different genus. The plant may reach heights of 4‚Äì6 metres, with leaves and roots much larger than Colocasia esculenta. The sagittate leaves are up to 6' 7\\" (2 meters) long by up to four feet (120 cm) in width, borne atop petioles or stalks up to 19' 6\\" (6 meters)in length and four inches (10 cm) wide.http://www.appropedia.org/Original:Root_Crops_29Deni Bown, AROIDS - PLANTS OF THE ARUM FAMILY (Portland: Timber Press, 2000 revised edit.) p. 265. It is relatively resistant to disease and pests but is susceptible to taro beetle. The corm, which can reach weights of 80 kg or even 220 pounds (100 kg) with a diameter of up to 39 inches (1 meter) and equally long.http://www.germanwatch.org/download/klak/Fb_tuv_e.pdf is starchy and cream or pink in colour, with a taste similar to sweet potato, though it is drier in texture. Cultivation Giant swamp taro is not suitable for growing in upland or rainfed conditions; it has adapted to growth within fresh water and coastal swamps. It exhibits some shade tolerance and is considered mildly tolerant of saline growing conditions compared to other taro species; that is, it can be grown in mildly brackish water. It is a slow growing crop which can take up to 15 years to mature. Giant swamp taro is nearly the only carbohydrate crop that can be cultivated on low-lying coral atolls, where it is grown in purpose-built swamp pits dug to below the level of the freshwater lens. The cultivation of Pulaka in Tuvalu, and of babai in Kiribati, has deep cultural significance. In these harsh environments, its cultivation is increasingly threatened by rising sea levels caused by global warming: the plant does not thrive in brackish water, which rots the roots, turns the leaves yellow, and stunts the plant's growth. Climate change is affecting its cultivation in two ways; more frequent droughts increase the salinity of the freshwater lens, and more extreme high tides and coastal erosion lead to saltwater intrusions where seawater enters the cultivation pits. In the Philippines, giant swamp taro is known as palawan (or palauan), palaw (or palau), or payaw. It is commonly cultivated and harvested for their corms in the Visayas Islands and Mindanao (especially in Siargao and northeastern Mindanao). They are usually prepared in the same way as other taro dishes in the Philippines. They are also used as sweet fillings for pastries like hopia. Preparation Giant swamp taro contains toxins which must be removed by long cooking. It may be field stored in the ground for very long periods ‚Äì up to 30 years or more ‚Äì and accordingly has traditionally been an important emergency crop in times of natural disaster and food scarcity. The cooked corms can be dried in the sun and stored for later use. Different methods of preparation are used for pulaka in Tuvalu, and babai in Kiribati. In the Philippines where this grows in swamps or marshes, the corms are harvested for food. It is left to grow for years and signs that it has enough corms when the mother stems have fewer leaves and it has reached a sizable size with tubers. The harvested corms are cooked for food which is starchy. Unlike taro and eddo, it is not purposely cultivated for its starchy corm for food. It usually grows in the wild in swampy areas and marshes. It is called Palawan by Waray people where it is most popular as an edible food.

In the episode, Fry leaves his job as a delivery boy at Planet Express and applies for a new job as a police officer. He is eventually promoted to the Future Crimes division, where he is foretold of a crime committed by his best friend Bender that places him in a dilemma that puts his friends' lives in danger. The episode was written by Josh Weinstein, and directed by Stephen Sandoval. It was inspired by, and makes various cultural references to science fiction media, such as the films Tron (1982), Minority Report (2002) and Avatar (2009). On May 20 and 21, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode, including concept art of the Future Crimes division, a storyboard of Fry making a delivery to a cryogenics laboratory and a 30-second preview clip of the episode. \\"Law and Oracle\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who enjoyed its humor, cultural references and the character Chief O'Mannahan, who is introduced in the episode. Plot After being sent on a prank delivery, Fry becomes disillusioned with his job at Planet Express. He and his co-workers are held hostage by criminally insane robot Roberto, who is promptly subdued by Smitty and URL, and Fry decides that joining the police force would be a more fulfilling role. He resigns from his job, and applies at the Police Academy, from which he graduates. Upon joining the force, Fry is paired with URL. The pair soon make a major arrest, and are rewarded with a promotion to the Future Crimes division. The division works to prevent crimes from occurring, by using \\"Pickles\\", an \\"oracle\\" human-robot hybrid who is able to calculate the future and predict crimes in advance. Meanwhile, Leela and Bender are sent on a delivery to the planet Pandora; however, without Fry accompanying them, the two find it difficult to be in each other's company. Professor Farnsworth, Amy, Hermes and Doctor Zoidberg find working at Planet Express to be boring without Fry's antics. Back at the precinct, Fry receives a vision of a future larceny, and discovers that the culprit is Bender. Fry questions Bender about the details of the crime, hoping to prevent him from committing it. Instead, Fry inadvertently informs Bender about the target of the crime; a priceless bottle of strong malt liquor stored in Hedonismbot's wine cellar. Upon examining the vision in closer detail, Fry sees that he will fatally shoot Bender to prevent him from stealing the bottle. He decides that he will deliberately not shoot Bender, which causes a vision of an alternate future to be created, in which Bender escapes. The alternate vision shows that Bender will share the stolen liquor with the crew at Planet Express, poisoning and inadvertently killing all of them. Bender arrives at Hedonismbot's mansion and obtains the bottle from the cellar, but is stopped by an armed Fry. Bender declares that he will not steal anything, and Fry happily exclaims that the oracle was wrong. Suddenly, Pickles appears, aiming a gun at both Bender and Fry. Pickles reveals that both visions were a set-up to allow himself to steal the liquor and frame Fry and Bender for the robbery. Pickles states that he wants the liquor to destroy his human brain cells, as he finds his precognition to be an unbearable burden. Fry attempts to shoot Pickles, but the invisible safe guarding the liquor ricochets the bullet and strikes Bender, knocking him down. Pickles shoots Fry down, and proceeds to drink the liquor, successfully damaging his brain and precognitive abilities. However, URL and the police chief choose this moment to appear from behind mirrored glass, and Fry and Bender stand up and expose their bulletproof armor. They reveal they became aware of the set-up when Pickles showed Bender sharing the deadly liquor with the Planet Express crew, which is unlikely to happen as Fry pointed out that Bender is an extremely selfish person and would never share anything (a statement that Bender strongly confirms), thus making the police realize the vision Pickles had shared was an attempt to deceive them. Fry receives his investigator's shield for stopping Bender and Pickles, but is also fired for tipping off Bender in the first place. The Professor welcomes Fry back to Planet Express, promoting him to \\"executive delivery boy\\" at Fry's request. Hermes notes that the \\"executive\\" title is simply a psychological trick to \\"help insecure people feel better about themselves\\". At that moment, the executive producer credits appear on the screen as Fry says \\"I feel better about myself!\\", and the episode ends. Production As a reference to the 2009 film Avatar, a sequence in \\"Law and Oracle\\" uses anaglyph 3-D graphics. Top image: The Planet Express ship lands on the planet Pandora. Bottom image: Bender throws a sandwich in the direction of the viewers. The episode was written by Josh Weinstein, and directed by Stephen Sandoval. On May 20 and 21, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode, including concept art of the Future Crimes division, a storyboard of Fry making a delivery to a cryogenics laboratory and a 30-second preview clip of the episode. Originally entitled \\"Frynority Report\\", the original concept for the episode's plot featured a mysterious man travelling backwards in time, who would eventually be revealed to be Fry and Leela's son. Weinstein and series co-creator David X. Cohen spent time elaborating and working on this concept before the idea was scrapped after the writing staff concluded the plot \\"wasn't funny enough.\\" Commentary for \\"Law and Oracle\\", in Futurama: Volume 6 [DVD]. 20th Century Fox (2011). \\"Law and Oracle\\" has the first appearance of Chief O'Mannahan, the police chief of the New New York Police Department. Cohen has called her one of his favorite characters of the show's sixth season.Cohen, David X. (2011) Commentary for \\"Law and Oracle\\", in Futurama: Volume 6 [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. An additional backstory between her and her love interest, URL, was scrapped from the episode. The sequence involving Bender and Leela making a delivery to the planet Pandora contains anaglyph 3-D graphics, as a reference to the moon of the same name from the film Avatar (2009), a film noted for its similar use of 3-D imagery. The 3-D graphics used in \\"Law and Oracle\\" may or may not work, depending on the type of 3-D eyeglasses used by the viewer. Cultural references The title of the episode is a parody of the long-running NBC legal drama television franchise Law & Order. The sequences involving Fry's police academy training are references to the Police Academy series of films. One of the robots in Fry's class, the \\"Sound Effects 5000\\", is a direct parody of the Police Academy character Sgt. Larvelle Jones (Michael Winslow). The sign in front of the police academy also states that they are not affiliated with the film Police Academy IV (1987). The planet Pandora is a reference to the moon of the same name from the film Avatar (2009). As a reference to the film's heavy use of 3-D graphics, the planet itself is depicted as a \\"3-D planet\\" where one needs 3-D glasses to see properly. The idea of the \\"Future Crimes Division\\" and the Cybernetic Oracle is based on the short story \\"The Minority Report\\" by Philip K. Dick (1958), which was adapted into the 2002 Steven Spielberg film Minority Report. The light cycle chase scene featuring Fry and URL is a reference to the 1982 science-fiction film Tron. In the commentary for the episode, the crew revealed that there was much discussion as to whether the sequence should be inspired by \\"old Tron\\", the original film, or \\"new Tron\\", the film's 2010 sequel, Tron: Legacy. The man being chased in the light cycle scene is Erwin Schr√∂dinger, a 20th-century Austrian physicist known for his Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox. Reception \\"Law and Oracle\\" was originally broadcast on July 7, 2011, on Comedy Central. In its original American broadcast, \\"Law and Oracle\\" was viewed by an estimated 1.548 million viewers. The episode had a 0.7 share among adults 18-49. The episode was down about 400,000 viewers from the previous week's episode, \\"Ghost in the Machines\\". The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN was pleased with the episode, noting that though \\"an episode as crowded as 'Law and Oracle' would fail more than it succeeds\\", it still, overall, \\"came together quite nicely.\\" He did, however, feel that the references to Tron and Avatar felt \\"a little shoe-horned in.\\" He also noted that he felt the episode picked up after Fry's promotion to the Future Crimes division, and also enjoyed the character Chief O'Mannahan. The episode was given an overall rating of 8/10. Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.1/10, praising the episode's humor and how the episode \\"didn't feel like it retread any ground\\". He noted that though the episode, unlike many other Futurama episodes, was not \\"fairly thought-provoking beyond all of its laughter\\" and does not make one think \\"in the way good sci-fi always has and stretches the limits of logic and our sense of what the world is about\\", the episode's jokes \\"[hit] their mark all the way through and were, if not thought-provoking, still pretty clever.\\" He, like Fowler, praised Chief O'Mannahan, calling her \\"a memorable new character.\\" However, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a more negative review and graded the episode C+. He criticized elements of the episode, feeling that the first part of the episode contained \\"a lot of hackneyed jokes\\" and also noted that \\"while the show is more than willing to swing at easy targets, there's something frustratingly perfunctory about the swings they take here.\\" While he felt the writing improved \\"when the actual plot finally kicked in\\", he also felt that the overall plot of the episode was \\"lazy\\".

November 16, 2010; Coleman, David. \\"How the Indignity of 'Junk Touching' TSA Pat Downs Strikes a Shared Nerve.\\" Huffington Post. December 1, 2010. Origin of the phrase The phrase was inadvertently coined in 2010 by passenger John Tyner, an Oceanside, California computer programmer who released an audio recording from San Diego International Airport in which he told TSA agents: \\"If you touch my junk, I'm going to have you arrested.\\" Tyner had initially chosen to undergo a pat-down rather than going through a full-body scan machine because of health concerns and the fact that he viewed the machines as a threat to privacy. The TSA refused to allow him to pass without this intimate search and so he declined to travel and got a refund on his ticket. An official then demanded that he submit to a search regardless. He declined and was threatened with prosecution, as well as a fine of $10,000. In response to being asked by a reporter if he thought he looked like a terrorist, Tyner said ‚ÄúNo, I'm a 6-foot-1 [], white man\\". He subsequently uploaded a video onto YouTube based on his experience, which went viral and received 70,000 views by the end of the same day. Most of the comments posted on the video were supportive of Tyner. Support and criticism Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer subsequently wrote an editorial in which he expressed support for Dr. Tyner and described \\"Don't Touch My Junk\\" as the \\"anthem of the modern man, the Tea Party patriot, the late-life libertarian, the midterm election voter\\" and even compared it to the American patriotic phrase \\"Dont Tread On Me\\". At least two \\"Don't Touch My Junk\\" songs have since been released, one of which was written by Houston, Texas, musician Danny Kristensen and was based on a James Cotton song, \\"Cut You Loose\\". Michael Kinsley weighed in on Politico in a column entitled \\"Go ahead, touch my junk\\", in which he defended the TSA against criticism from Dr. Tyner and others. A columnist for The Atlantic, Wendy Kaminer, argued that the intentions of those, such as Krauthammer, who were criticizing the indiscriminate screening of passengers were actually promoting racial profiling. Kaminer described Krauthammer's suggestion that screening should be conducted on the \\"profile of the airline attacker [which] is... universally known,\\" as more aptly summed up as \\"Don't Touch My Junk, Touch His\\". In another variation, news anchor Brian Williams said on the Late Show with David Letterman, \\"I always get it at [Los Angeles International Airport]. I get nailed. They go, they go right in. This new thing, they go right after Dave and the twins.\\" \\"Don't touch my junk\\" was parodied, to the tune of Parliament's \\"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\\", at the 2011 Gridiron Club dinner, with President Obama in attendance.

It is located beside the Taj-ul-Masajid in Bhopal, India.  History  The Taj Mahal at Bhopal was built as the Begum's residence, at a cost of 3,000,000. Its construction spanned over a period of 13 years, from 1871 to 1884. It was one of the largest palaces of the world built at that time. The building was originally named Raj Mahal (\\"royal palace\\"). The British Resident at Bhopal, highly impressed with the architecture, suggested that the palace be renamed the Taj Mahal, the Taj Mahal at Agra having been built by the Begum's namesake Shah Jahan. The begum accepted the suggestion and the palace was renamed to Taj Mahal. The Begum is said to have ordered a three-year-long celebration called Jashn-e-Taj Mahal after the completion of the building. After the partition of India in 1947, Nawab Hamidullah Khan allowed Sindhi refugees to stay in the palace. They stayed in Taj Mahal for around 4 years, before shifting to Bairagarh. The palace suffered some damage during this period. After India's independence, some members of the royal family of Bhopal stayed at the palace, but gradually moved away, as they had no money for the repairs. By 2008, large parts of the palace complex had collapsed. The palace was declared a state heritage monument by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in 2005 and the state archaeology department carried out restoration in parts. However, it was denotified in 2011 and the government now plans to transfer the property to the tourism department for its development as a heritage hotel.  Architecture  The architecture of Taj Mahal has British, French, Mughal, Arabic and Hindu influences. The palace contains 120 rooms, a hall of mirrors or sheesh mahal and the savon bhadon pavilion, an elaborate fountain like structure that simulated the effect of rain. The main entrance is a seven-storied structure.

It is not a federal government program but is a non-profit organization. The organization maintains two main goals. One goal of the organization is to achieve social and political rights for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people, and people who identify as intersexual. Another goal for the organization is sexual health advocacy. The foundation was started because homosexuals were incarcerated due to a criminalization of sexual activity between people of the same sex by the government. Research Fundaci√≥n Ecuatoriana Equidad organized local volunteers to participate in the iPrEx study, which was a clinical trial testing the efficacy of a drug used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection. Context Prior to current laws and regulations, Ecuadorians could be arrested for any public displays that went against their common moral value. Men were publicly and brutally attacked for being at gay bars or for interacting with the gay community. These actions were justified under the court of law, until constitutional reform in 1998. On August 10th, 1998, the Constitution of Ecuador underwent reformation in order to recognize equality based within the law, regardless of age, sex, ethnic origin, color, religion, political affiliation, economic position, sexual orientation, state of health, or any other difference. Within the South American countries, this is considered to be the most liberal, as well as the most enlightened. Since 2008, civil unions with all of the rights of marriage (except for adoption) have been available to same-sex couples. In Quito and Guayaquil, liberalism has become more prevalent as conservatism adjusts to the law. Current conditions Currently in Ecuador, both male and female same- sex sexual activity are legal in Ecuador, but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for all of the same legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples. Partners Fundaci√≥n Ecuatoriana Equidad receives support from Hivos, a Dutch organization which promotes HIV education and gay rights. Legal rights in Ecuador Currently in Ecuador, both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal, but same- sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for all of the same legal protection available to opposite- sex married couples. In 1998, Ecuador became one of the first countries worldwide to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. Since 2008, civil unions with all of the rights of marriage (except for adoption) have been available to same- sex couples. The original constitution permitted marriage only between man and woman: however, same-sex activity has been legal in Ecuador since 1997. Mission The mission is to promote sexual health and reduce prejudice and acts of discrimination based on sexual preferences sex identity, or HIV/AIDS, through communication, prevention, sensibility, empowerment and citizen participation in society. Those efforts will aid in making a better quality of life for the GLBTI community and people who have HIV and AIDS. The organization offers help with medical problems, help with getting HIV tested, psychological services, help getting legal aid for people in the GLBTI community and a community space for members. Magazine The foundation created the annual magazine called GLBTI n√πmero 12, discontinued in 2014. This magazine was meant to reflect the principle necessities that the GLBTI community faced in the country. The magazine talked about the representation of the GLBTI.

Birla Science Museum is an Indian science museum located in Hyderabad, India. Constructed by civil engineer P. A. Singaravelu, it comprises a planetarium, museum, science centre, art gallery as well as a dinosaurium. The museum itself was the second phase of the science centre when it opened in 1990. The centre also houses India's first private Space Museum. The museum is a unique facility which is dedicated to history of the space program of India. The space museum was inaugurated in July 2019 and was curated by Pranav Sharma. Planetarium The Birla Planetarium is a wing of the Science Centre. The planetarium was inaugurated by N. T. Rama Rao, on 8 September 1985 and is one of three Birla Planetariums in India. The others are the M.P. Birla Planetarium in Kolkata and B.M. Birla Planetarium in Chennai.  Space Museum  The space museum is one of a kind in the sense that it has been designed and curated in an interdisciplinary manner, thereby treating kids and elders alike. Breaking bounds of a traditional space museum, the limits of emphasizing technical details have been reduced, since the information is just a click away. This museum narrates science as a story. The story-tellers begin with ISRO‚Äôs legacy, the necessity of a space program, to its establishment and several achievements. You may find some simple yet interesting stories that led to huge science projects. Vikram Sarabhai holds the first hand narrrative, Nehru gets to detail his science policy, Bhabha, Satish Dhawan, Yash Pal, and several others get to share their reasons and stories for why they did what they did in this museum. The museum brings to light various contributions of ISRO to public awareness through images, illustrations and words. The reading you get on images is basically excerpts and anecdotes from the actual conversations between people who majorly contributed to ISRO‚Äôs legacy. More than forty three people contributed to the narration and which were taken out after some several thousand pages of information and data collected over the span of almost two years by the curator. There are more than twenty exhibits including the models of PSLV, GSLV, GSLV-MkIII (which recently successfully carried Chandryaan 2 in the outer space). The legacy series of satellites such as Aryabhata, Bhaskara, Rohini, APPLE and SROSS are also exhibited. A model of International Space Station has been set up amidst Communication Satellites which resonates the essence of architectural design of the museum. Different sections have been designed on purpose, in a maze like structure, each having relevance of its own so that the impact on the viewers is distinctive and this helps in more indulgence with the information and trivia presented in that particular section. The maze contributes to the continual amazement that the visitor experiences. School students at the Space Museum. Interestingly one might encounter excerpts from literature and poetry explaining difficult themes and are placed as riddles all over the museum, venerating the contributions of artists and writers such as Shakespeare and Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote about the moon and the stars and the space. This interdisciplinary method of imparting knowledge, while being relevant to the theme of the museum has been the fundamental idea since the beginning of this museum‚Äôs curation and idea. Dinosaurium File:Kotasauraus.jpgKotasauraus File:Kotasauraus adilabad.jpgKotasauraus adilabad The Dinosaurium is the newest addition to the planetarium and science center and opened in 2000.

It was the tallest in Woking and among the five tallest buildings in Surrey. Its height is spread over its 18 floors (15 above ground). History Export House was the significantly tallest aspect of the Surrey town regeneration after World War II, which centred on the expansion and improvement of satellite towns, in this county being Guildford and Woking. It was built at the same time as the Wolsey Place Shopping Centre, which is a contiguous building. Export House was the tallest building in the borough of Woking. Construction of Export House finished in 1974. It became tenant-ready in 1976 when it was part-let to the first lessee, BAT who then expanded across the remaining floors. Export House within Woking's skyline, 2011 Tenants and lessees In 1976, British American Tobacco moved in as the first tenant, making it their headquarters. Export House had already been completed two years previously in 1974. In 1997 BAT chose to relocate to a new building in London. Accordingly it was for some time also known as the BAT Building. It is the tallest building in Woking and among the five tallest buildings in the county. Its height is and has 18 storeys (15 floors above ground). Telewest moved into Export House during summer 2001 after a ¬£15 million refurbishment. Telewest had rented the top six floors for about a year before they moved permanently to Export House. Their previous base was in Sheerwater also by the South Western Main Line in the borough. Telewest vacated in 2006 after a merger and consolidation with NTL. From a deal of 2008 Mustang Engineering began to occupy for a few years and in the 2010s were succeeded by Mouchel Group who moved from West Hall in nearby West Byfleet. Future The block has set a precedent for iconic, complimentary buildings being open to consideration under the existing Woking Borough Local Plan, adopted in 1999. Plans for a new shopping centre, named Victoria Square, located next to Export House, were unveiled in 2012 with planning permission approved in 2014. Victoria Square includes three new towers, two residential and one a hotel, at 34, 32 and 23 stories tall respectively. All three new towers would be taller than Export House, becoming the new tallest buildings in Surrey. Construction began in 2016, and is scheduled for completion by 2021. Wildlife A pair of peregrine falcons nest on top of the building. These birds are rare, but they are often seen flying around Woking. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds requested that people should not disturb the pair of falcons. A semi-cross section view of Export House in 2007, taken from Guildford Road near Woking railway station Architecture Export House is of modular design, chamfered on the narrow west fa√ßade/parapet and lightly storey-grooved. It avoided the tri-dimensional symmetry of some of its shorter-lived contemporaries. Export House has no explicit or implicit reference to compulsory or encouraged complete demolition in the mid-term local plan. From 2000 to 2007 the structure bore an air pollution-stained upper exterior so appeared more brutalist than old and new buildings of the town centre. The 1950s to 1980s saw commercial office mid- cost construction sceptical of fancy classical architecture while remaining polite, incorporating subtle asymmetry such as with stylised ends, roofs or windows in a maximal fa√ßade: as in London's Guy's Hospital and the Royal Festival Hall. In Surrey, comparable buildings are the Chubb Tower and within 500m of border of Ewell, Surrey, the Tolworth Tower in Greater London. Export House has a staircase and four lifts adjacent to the main entrance in the western facade. The building has radio and telecom masts appropriate for its height and deep parapet roof. Location The building is part-above Wolsey Place Shopping Centre, its entrance being next to one of the latter's main entrance. Beneath the shopping centre is a private, gated car park underneath; opposite is a multi-storey car park. Occupying part of a commercial block of the entirely commercial-leisure town centre it is classed as on Cawsey Way. Export House, New Central and Centrium in central Woking's skyline are clearly visible from the Hog's Back, the narrow western ridge of the North Downs south, the closest point of these downs is the west bank of the Wey, Guildford and Pewley Down which commands the east bank, including Guildford Castle.Grid reference Finder measurement tools Public access The building has occasionally been open to the public on tours for Heritage Open Days.Building tours info Tours last for approximately 30 minutes.

Located in Lower Austria along the Danube, west of Vienna and Krems an der Donau, it is one of the westernmost wine producing regions in Austria with only a few scattered plantings in Tyrol being further west. While most of Austria follows a wine classification systems based on ripeness and harvest must weight that parallels the German wine classification system, Wachau wines have a unique classification system. The three classification levels for Wachau wine include Steinfeder for wines up to 11.5% alcohol level, Federspiel for wines between 11.5‚Äì12.5% and Smaragd that must have a minimum of 12.5% alcohol level.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 49‚Äì54 Oxford University Press 2006 Despite its renown, the Wachau is a small wine region that usually accounts for only around 3% of Austria's wine production.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 244‚Äì245 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 History Vines planted near the ancient ruins in Wachau Archeological evidence suggests that viticulture may have been introduced to the lands around the Danube by the Celtic tribes, most notably the La T√®ne and Noricum federation, prior to the Roman influence that came into the area following conquest around the 1st century BCE. Viticulture continued to flourish under Roman rule, with the introduction of Roman technology and knowledge, even though grape growing was technically banned in Roman territories north of the Alps. In the 3rd century, Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus officially overturned the ban and is reported to have ordered the introduction of several grape varieties to be brought into the territories. It has been speculated that both Gr√ºner Veltliner and Welschriesling may have been introduced to the region during the Roman period.Blom, Philipp (2000) The Wines of Austria Faber & Faber The first written account of wine production in the Wachau came from the biography of St. Severin of Noricum. The first written account to specifically mention wine production in the Wachau region was the writings of Eugippus in his biography of St. Severin, where the 5th-century Roman wine production at the Roman fort near the town of Mautern in the Wachau.A. Domine (ed.) Wine, pp. 536‚Äì543 Ullmann Publishing, 2008 Monika Caha Selections \\"About the Vinea Wachau\\" pg 4, Accessed: December 12th, 2010Austrian Wine \\"Viticulture in Austria ‚Äì a journey in fast motion\\" Accessed: December 12th, 2010 After the fall of the Roman Empire the Wachau region, along with most of Lower Austria down across the Pannonian Plain, was ravaged by repeated waves of barbarian invasions that took a toll on all forms of agriculture and trade. Wachau's wine industry entered a dark age from which it did not emerge until the time of Charlemagne in the late 8th and early 9th century. Under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, the monastic influences of the Christian church continued to promote and sustain viticulture in the area. Much as the monasteries mapped out and planted plots along choice lands in the Burgundy and Mosel wine regions, the monks in the Wachau identified vineyard sites along the northern banks of the Danube that would be ideal for viticulture. Many vineyards that exist today in the Wachau can trace their origins to monastic plantings in the Middle Ages and Renaissance period. From the 14th‚Äì16th century, viticulture in the Wachau hits its peak along with the rest of Lower Austria with plantings an estimated 10 times greater across the land than what exist today. This period saw a lack of profitability due to overproduction and competition from neighboring Germany and Hungary. As prices and influence in the important Vienna market were being affected, Wachau producers banded with neighboring Austrian producers to demand protectionist tariffs and eventually an outright ban on any \\"foreign\\" wine being imported into Lower Austria. These measures helped stabilize the Wachau wine industry to some degree until the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, followed by the phylloxera epidemic that would reach Austria later that century, would devastate the vineyards of Wachau. Slowly the wine industry would recover and during the 20th century, the Wachau would gain a global reputation for the quality of its dry Riesling and Gr√ºner Veltliner. Then the 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal, caused by producers outside the Wachau, gained international attention and caused a dramatic drop in sales for Austrian wines across the board. The Wachau, along with the rest of the Austrian wine industry, responded to the scandal with the development of strict wine laws and quality assurances. Producers in the Wachau already had a head start on this movement with the development a couple years earlier of the Vinea Wachau in 1983, a collaborative association that aimed to distinguish Wachau wine from other Austrian wines. In addition to holding its members to a guaranteed minimum quality level above the requirements of Austrian wine laws, the Vinea Wachau also established its own classification and wine labeling system that is still being used for Wachau wines today.Vinea Wachau \\"Codex Wachau\\" Accessed: December 12th, 2010 Climate and geography The Danube river provides a moderating influence on the vines grown along the terraced hills bordering the river. The boundaries of the Wachau has traditionally been the valley of the Danube between the village of Melk and Krems. Along with the Kremstal and Kamptal, the Wachau is one of the coolest wine regions in Austria. The climate of Wachau is influenced by the confluence of several weather systems including cool, moist air from the Waldviertel forests of the northwest with warmer air coming from the east off the Pannonian Plain. This creates a continental climate with marked diurnal temperature variations that include a dramatic drop in nighttime temperatures. Along with the moderating influence of the Danube river, the Wachau has a macroclimate which includes constant air and heat circulation, allowing for sugars and phenolic compounds to build up during the day but acids and aromas to be preserved by the cooler nights. This creates white wines that tend to be high in extract and acidity. Irrigation is often necessary during the peak months of the growing season when yearly rain totals fall below . The vineyard soils of the Wachau are varied but consist primarily of rock outcrops with occasional layers of loess. The geography of the region is characterized by steep, rocky river banks (as steep as those found in the Mosel and C√¥te-R√¥tie) that have had vineyards terraced into the hillsides. Higher up on the hills, the soils are rich in iron deposits and contain mixtures of gneiss, granite and slate. Closer to the river and in the flatter plains areas that dot the region, the soil is more alluvial with loess, sand and gravel. The heart of the Wachau district is the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus which includes a strip of vineyard land that stretches from the western extremity of Schwallenbach along the Danube through Spitz, Weissenkirchen, D√ºrnstein, Loiben and finally to Mautern. There are over 900 named vineyard sites in Wachau (known as Rieden). Among the sites that may appear on Wachau wine labels those of the Loibenberg, Kellerberg, Achleiten, Klaus and 'Singerriedel are the most noted. Grape varieties and wine styles Gr√ºner Veltliner There are over of vineyards in the Wachau with Gr√ºner Veltliner being the most widely planted. The area is also well known for its Riesling that carry distinctive trademarks of their terroir in aroma and flavor profile. Other varieties grown in the Wachau include Chardonnay (sometimes called Feinburgunder), Neuburger, Gelber Muskateller, Pinot blanc, Traminer and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is often planted on the most ideal vineyard location along the steep gneiss hillsides near the river while Gr√ºner Veltliners seems to thrive on the loess and sand of the lower banks. The wines are rarely, if ever, exposed to new oak or malolactic fermentation and are typically produced in a fuller bodied, higher extract style that is more similar to the wines of Alsace than of their German counterparts. Wine classification and labeling laws Unlike most Austrian wines which follow a classification system similar to Germany (which includes wines labeled based on must weight at harvest such as Sp√§tlese, Auslese, etc.), the Wachau has its own classification system for quality wine. In favorable vintages, producers may experience botrytis and can produce botrytized wines that carry the same classification as their counterparts in other Austrian wine regions‚Äînamely Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese. The Wachau designations include: ;Steinfeder: The lightest wines which may be spritzig or lightly sparkling. Under the Austrian Klosterneuburger Mostwaage scale for measuring must weight, grapes harvested for Steinfeder wines must achieve at least 15‚Äì17¬∞KMW, not be subjected to chaptalization during production and finish with an alcohol level no greater than 11.5%. The symbol for this class is the stipa pennata or feather grass that is commonly found planted on Wachau hillsides.Vinea Wachau \\"Steinfeder\\" Accessed: December 13th, 2010 ;Federspiel:Made from riper grapes harvested at least 17¬∞KMW and producing wines with an alcohol level between 11.5‚Äì12.5%. Like the other classification, the wines can not be chaptalized. The maximum residual sugar for these wines is 4 g/l. The symbol for this classification is a falcon which pays homage to the historical pastime of falconry in the Wachau.Vinea Wachau \\"Federspiel\\" Accessed: December 13th, 2010 ;Smaragd: The ripest wines that must contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum residual sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation was first used in 1986, right after the diethylene glycol scandal and was intended to denote the highest quality level of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5¬∞KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49mm long and branded with vintage year. From 2007, screwcaps are also allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines tend to be the most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found sunning itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.Vinea Wachau \\"Smaragd\\" Accessed: December 13th, 2010 Like other Austrian wines, wines from the Wachau are usually labeled by varietal with the grape variety listed needing to constitute at least 85% of the grape variety. Similarly, at least 85% of the grapes from a given harvest must come from the a vintage year on the label. Vinea Wachau The Vinea Wachau is an organization of Wachau producers who united in 1983 to create a trade association that will not only promote Wachau wines worldwide but also protect the image and integrity of the Wachau wine region. Using the historical seal of Leuthold I von Kuenring (1243‚Äì1313), a local Ministerialengeschlecht or knight of the powerful Kuenringer family, the organization outlined the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus or \\"heart of Wachau\\" which included the wine villages where traditionally the best Wachau wine was produced. Today the organization includes more than 200 members, who collectively own more than 85% of the vineyard land in the Wachau. Members of the Vinea Wachau not only must follow Austria's strict wine laws but also abide by the association's own standards. The wines designated as Steinfeder, Federspiel and Smaragd cannot be chaptalized or back-sweetened with s√ºssreserve. All wine submitted by members are tasted by a panel for quality assurances with samples of every wine, from every vintage stored at a facility at Spitz so it is available for comparison should any quality control issues emerge.

This whitening is indicative of cell damage, which occurs in the retinal pigment epithelium and outer segment layer of photoreceptors. Damage to the outer segment often results in photoreceptor death through uncertain mechanisms. Usually there is no leakage of fluid and therefore it is not considered a true edema.

Closure threat  On 23 December 2015, a notice was issued to Lamakaan by the GHMC to shut down in three days, citing \\"creating nuisance to the surrounding residents and general public\\" as the reason. After notice, Lamakaan gave a reply to the civic body that was 'not satisfactory', to which the civic body responded by issuing a closure notice on 23 December. P. Mahender, the GHMC Deputy Commissioner (Circle 10), when contacted, said that there were traffic problems every Sunday in the lane but did not mention anything about the nuisance. One certain complaint was regarding women smoking in the premises. The notice was withdrawn soon. Due to an uproar in the number of people protesting against shutting down Lamakaan and the signing of around 3,000 people on the online petitioning site change.org demanding the withdrawal of the notice, the attention of IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao was drawn. The issue was resolved after GHMC Deputy Commissioner P. Mahender spoke with the owner of the place. The notice did not specify what was the cause of the nuisance but instead talked about the place running without a license. It was decided that the parking space of Jalagam Vengalarao Park would be used for four- wheeler parking.

Located southeast of the village of Plain City in Madison County, the site occupies a group of grassy terraces located amid two farm fields. In this grassy area, archaeologists have discovered a wide range of artifacts, including stone tools, materials made of flint, and various types of pottery. Rather than being all of a single type, the artifacts differ so greatly from each other that the site was probably occupied throughout a long period of time. Evidence exists for the presence of villages at the site during the Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian periods, although the Woodland period Hopewell inhabitants left the greatest number of artifacts. Everything that has been found at the site is known from surface collection; therefore, it is uncertain what artifacts remain buried. However, some elements can be guessed to be present, judging by findings from similar sites. If Cary Village be a typical Middle Woodland village, it includes multiple hearths, burials, posthole patterns, storage pits, and middens. Because the site has never been excavated, it yet is presumed to hold many features, and it is thus a valuable archaeological site. In recognition of its archaeological value, the Cary Village Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

A member of the Terter dynasty and a younger brother of Tsar George I Terter, Aldimir was an influential local ruler as the despot of Kran. Aldimir rose to that position under his brother George, though as Smilets assumed the throne he was forced into exile. At the turn of the 14th century, Aldimir returned to Bulgaria as an ally of the regent widowed consort Smiltsena. He did not oppose the accession of his nephew Theodore Svetoslav and even assisted him in ousting his contenders. However, he was promptly eliminated by Theodore Svetoslav when he betrayed him to ally with the Byzantines. Under George I and Smiltsena Just like his brother George, Aldimir was of Cuman origin. Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov is of the opinion that Aldimir and George's ancestors had sought refuge in Bulgaria after 1241,–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), p. 9 when they left the Kingdom of Hungary amidst sedition. The brothers must have originated from the Cuman royal dynasty Terteroba, and the ruler K√∂ten was probably their relative or even direct ancestor.–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤ Pavlov also interprets Aldimir's name as originating from the Cuman-language expression for \\"heated iron\\". Aldimir rose in importance with the accession of his older brother George (r. 1280‚Äì1292) to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. He must have been conferred the high noble title of despot during George's reign, and American historian John Fine believes Aldimir was granted his appanage at that time.Fine, p. 225 Pavlov, however, conjectures that Aldimir's domain dates to 1298, long after George's reign. Unlike the neighbouring principality of Smilets at Kopsis, Aldimir remained loyal to the Bulgarian government and ensured that his domain retained its ties to the capital Tarnovo. Fine describes Aldimir's lands as spanning the region from modern Sliven in the east to Kazanlak or Karlovo in the west, just south of the Balkan Mountains.Fine, pp. 225‚Äì226 His capital was the fortress of Kran in the Rose Valley. After George's abdication in 1292, Aldimir had to flee into exile. He may have followed his brother as a refugee in the Byzantine Empire, though he certainly settled in the Golden Horde not long thereafter. Perhaps with Tatar approval, Aldimir returned to Bulgaria in 1298, after the reign of Smilets (r. 1292‚Äì1298) was over and the empire was in the hands of the child Tsar Ivan II and his mother, the widow of Smilets tentatively known as Smiltsena. Aldimir pledged his loyalty to Smiltsena, who either granted him the domain south of the Balkan Mountains or restored him to his former appanage. To consolidate that union, Aldimir married Smiltsena's daughter, the princess Maria, possibly in late 1298.Fine, p. 227 With Aldimir's appointment as despot of Kran, Smiltsena ensured that his lands were better protected from Smilets' brothers Radoslav and Voysil who, as √©migr√©s in Byzantium, held aspirations for the Bulgarian throne or at least their former domains. During Smiltsena's regency, Aldimir was one of the most influential people in Bulgaria; indeed, Byzantine statesman Theodore Metochites refers to the \\"Scythian [i.e. Cuman] venturer\\", as he calls Aldimir, as the queen's right-hand man. Aldimir's leading position leaves little doubt that he was involved in the fruitless anti-Byzantine negotiations between Bulgaria and Serbia in 1299. Pavlov even goes as far as to suggest that the proposed anti-Byzantine union was the brainchild of Aldimir. Under Theodore Svetoslav In 1299, George's son and Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300‚Äì1322), the legitimate successor to the Bulgarian throne, invaded Bulgaria along with Tatar troops. The news of that invasion was enough to force Smiltsena and Ivan to flee to the despotate of Kran even before Theodore Svetoslav's troops had reached the capital. Aldimir gave refuge to Smiltsena and Ivan, though he was clearly not opposed to his newly crowned nephew. In 1300, Smilets' brother sebastokrator Radoslav headed a Byzantine-supported campaign against Aldimir en route to the capital. However, the attack had disastrous consequences to Radoslav. He was captured by Aldimir, blindedFine, p. 228–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 247 and forced back to Thessaloniki, while his Byzantine generals were sent as captives to Theodore Svetoslav. With this act, Aldimir pledged his allegiance to Theodore Svetoslav, who rewarded him with an extension to his appanage. The despotate of Kran was enlarged to the east to include the fortresses of Yambol and Lardea near today's Karnobat. While Aldimir was nominally loyal to Theodore Svetoslav, the presence of Smiltsena and Ivan at his court would have been seen by the Bulgarian emperor as a threat. In addition, Aldimir perhaps harboured a desire to accede to the throne himself. After Theodore Svetoslav's victory over Byzantium at Skafida in 1304, the Byzantines approached Aldimir with a proposal for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. Aldimir initially remained adamantFine, p. 229 and was hostile to the Byzantine forces which entered his domain in 1305. However, by the end of that year Aldimir had switched sides to the Byzantines, as Theodore Svetoslav took back the fortresses that he had granted to Aldimir.Fine, p. 30 Shortly thereafter, Theodore Svetoslav restored his direct power over Kran by reconquering and annexing the appanage.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 249 Aldimir may have been murdered during this campaign, as no activity of his is mentioned in later sources.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), p. 10 His widow Maria and his son Ivan Dragushin managed to escape to Serbia, where Maria's sister, Theodora, was married to the prince Stephen Deƒçanski.

He was also a trustee of Comyn or Chilcott's free English school at Tiverton. With an ample patrimony, he interested himself all his life in the ancient families of Devonshire. The Devon historian Richard Polwhele referred to his skill in compiling pedigrees,Traditions and Recollections, i. 260 and the Stemmata Fortescuana, which he drew up in 1795, form the basis of the genealogies in Lord Clermont's \\"History of the Family of Fortescue\\". For some unknown reason he refused to submit his pedigrees to the inspection of Polwhele, who thereupon addressed to him an angry letter, which is printed in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' for April 1791, p. 308, and in his 'Traditions,' i. 258‚Äì9. Incledon printed at Exeter, in 1792, at his own expense, for the use of the governing body, a volume entitled \\"Donations of Peter Blundell and other Benefactors to the Free Grammar School at Tiverton\\", which was reprinted by the trustees, with notes and additions, in 1804 and 1826. He was thus the first historian of Blundell's School. The Register of Blundell's School (1904) states:Fisher, Arthur, The Register of Blundell's School, Part I (1770‚Äì1882), Exeter, 1904, pp. 4‚Äì5 > \\"At Blundell's he is remembered by many gifts and institutions, such as the > picture of Samuel Wesley in the Library, the Register, the manuscript volume > he compiled on the donations of Peter Blundell given by him to the Feoffees > and now in the possession of the Governors; by the same book published at > his own expense in 1792, the frontispiece therein now used on all the School > Prizes and Books; the pictures of Blundell and Popham in the Big School. > Although these pictures were received after his death, their receipt was > doubtless due to his exertions\\". His account of St. Margaret's Hospital at Pilton appeared in the Arch√¶ologia, xii. pp. 211‚Äì14. His manuscript collections on the Fortescues are deposited with Lord Fortescue at Castle Hill.

Bronze Age *2nd millennium BC  ca. 1800 BC ‚Äì The El Argar civilization appears in Almer√≠a, south-east of Spain, replacing the earlier civilization of Los Millares. The adoption of bronze metallurgy allows gradual dominance and influence in the region.Mar√≠a Dolores Fern√°ndez-Posse, Antonio Gilman, Concepci√≥n Martin, Consideraciones Cronol√≥gicas sobre la Edad del Bronce en La Mancha (Complutum Extra, 1996), 6 (II), 111-137,  ca. 1500 BC * A culture of smaller fortified villages known as Bronze of Levante appears in the modern-day region of Valencia, particularly in the southern half, being close culturally to El Argar. This people starts to install the first settlements in the semi-desertic La Mancha called Motillas (fortifications in the top of man-made hills). * For the first time the cattle-herding tribes of the central plateau get organize into a single culture, known as Cogotas I, practising transhumance herding. * The presence of strategic tin resources in the North Western Iberia is probably the cause of some development in this region. The Montelavar group is characterized especially by its bronze axes.  ca. 1300 BC * El Argar disappears abruptly, giving way to a less homogeneous post-Argarian culture. * The Motillas are abandoned, perhaps due to the disappearance of the Argarian state and its military needs. * The Urnfield culture is the first wave of Indo-European migrations to enter in the Peninsula. Although they stayed in Catalonia, they triggered the Atlantic Bronze Age in the Northwest of the peninsula (modern Galicia and northern Portugal), that maintained commercial relations with Brittany and the British Isles.Javier Rodr√≠guez- Corral, A Galicia Castrexa (L√≥strego, 2009), * In Western Andalusia appears an internally burnished pottery culture. * The Northwest is defined by their typical axes, divided into two types: Galician and Astur-Cantabrian. *1st millennium BC First wave of Indo-European migrations into Iberia, of the Urnfield culture (Proto-Celts). Bronze culture (Indo-European) in the Northwest of Iberia (modern Galicia and northern Portugal), maintaining commercial relations with Brittany and the British Isles. Emergence of the Castro Village culture in this Iberian area. Bronze culture in the Portuguese Estremadura (not Indo-European). Bronze culture of Portuguese Beira Alta (not Indo-European but influenced by). Emergence of Tartessian society in the territory of modern Andalusia. Iron Age *11th century BC First contacts between Phoenicians and Iberia (along the Mediterranean coast). In 1104 BC Phoenicians found the first walled city Gadir (modern C√°diz) as a trading post.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History I, 2 *10th century BC ca. 1000 BC ‚Äì Development of Tartessos, the first Iberian State mentioned in writing sources. Tartessos was a centralized Monarchy brought about under Phoenician influence and maintained commercial relations with the area of modern Algarve, inhabited by the Cynetes or Cunetes, and Portuguese Estremadura.Herodotus of Halicarnassus, The Histories, I, 163; IV, 152 Emergence of towns and cities in the southern littoral areas of western Iberia. *9th century BC Foundation of the Phoenician (from the city-state of Tyre) colony of Carthage (in North Africa).  Foundation of the Phoenician colony of Gadir (modern C√°diz) near Tartessos. Contrary to myth, there is no record of Phoenician colonies west of the Strait of Gibraltar , even though there might have been some voyages of discovery. Phoenician influence in what is now Portuguese territory was done through cultural and commercial exchange with Tartessos. Phoenicians introduce in Iberia the use of Iron, of the Potter's wheel, the production of olive oil and wine. They were also responsible for the first forms of Iberian writing, had a big religious influence and accelerated urban development. There are organized settlements in Olissipona (modern Lisbon, in Portuguese Estremadura) with clear Mediterranean influences. The myth of a Phoenician foundation of the city as far back as 1300 BC, under the name Alis Ubbo (\\"Safe Harbour\\") is not true.  ca. 900 BC ‚Äì The Castro Village culture appears in the northwestern part of the peninsula (roughly present-day northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias). This culture is characterized by their walled villages and hill forts. It expanded from south to north and from the coast to the interior of the peninsula during the next centuries. *8th century BC ‚Äì Strong Phoenician influence in the city of Balsa (modern Tavira in the Algarve).  ca. 800 BC ‚Äì The Celtic Hallstatt culture reaches the local Urnfields Celts of the Northeast, bringing the iron working technology to Iberia. This culture starts to expand to the nearby areas, embracing the northern region of the Levante and the upper Ebro valley.  The Phoenicians establish a colony in Almunecar called Sexi. *7th century BC Strong Tartessian influence in the area of modern Algarve. Second wave of Indo-European (Celts of the Hallstatt culture?) migration into Portuguese territory.  ca. 700 BC ‚Äì The cattle herding culture of Cogotas I is transformed into Cogotas II, mixing the Celtic culture with the Iberian culture (Celtiberians).Alberto J. Lorrio, Los Celt√≠beros (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 1997),  654 BC ‚Äì Phoenician settlers found a port in the Balearic Islands as Ibossim (Ibiza).Michael Dietler, Carolina Lopez-Ruiz, Colonial Encounters in Ancient Iberia: Phoenician, Greek, and Indigenous relations (University Of Chicago Press, 2009), 80, *6th century BC Decadence of Phoenician colonization of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia. Many of the colonies are deserted. Fall of Tartessos. Beginning of Greek settlement in the Iberian peninsula, namely in the eastern Mediterranean shore (modern Catalonia). There are no Greek colonies west of the Strait of Gibraltar, only voyages of discovery. The myth of an ancient Greek founding of Olissipo (modern Lisbon) by Ulysses is not true. Rise of the colonial might of Carthage, which slowly replaces the Phoenician in its former areas of dominion. Phoenician influenced Tavira is destroyed by violence. Cultural shift in southern Portuguese territory after the fall of Tartessos, with a strong Mediterranean character that prolongs and modifies Tartessian culture. This occurs mainly in Low Alentejo and the Algarve, but has littoral extensions up to the Tagus mouth (namely the important city of Bevipo, modern Alc√°cer do Sal). First form of writing in western Iberia (south of Portugal), the Southwest script (still to be translated), denotes strong Tartessian influence in its use of a modified Phoenician alphabet. In these writings the word Conii (similar to Cunetes or Cynetes, the people of the Algarve) appears frequently. The poem Ora Maritima, written by Avienus in the 4th century and based on the Massaliote Periplus of the 6th century BC, states that all of western Iberia was once called for the name of its people, the Oestriminis, which were replaced by an invasion of the Saephe or Ophis (meaning Serpent). From then on western Iberia would have been known as Ophiussa (Land of the Serpents).The poem also describes the various ethnic groups present at that time: *The Saephe or Ophis, today seen as probably Hallstatt culture Celts, in all of western Iberia (modern Portugal) between the Douro and the Sado rivers. *The Cempsi, probably Hallstatt culture Celts, in the Tagus mouth and the south up to the Algarve. *The Cynetes or Cunetes in the extreme south and some cities along the Atlantic coast (such as Olissipo, modern Lisbon), probably not Indo- European, but autochthonous Iberian (even if strongly or totally celticized over the next centuries). *The Dragani, Celt or Proto-Celt of the first Indo-European wave, in the mountainous areas of Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Cantabria. *The Lusis, probably a first reference to the Lusitanians, similar to the Dragani (Celt or Proto-Celt of the first Indo- European wave).  ca. 600 BC ‚Äì Celts penetrate in the Northwest of the Peninsula, although it has been debated whether all tribes of this area are actually Celtic, Celtizied or just native with Celtic influences.  Penetration of Celtic culture into the northern mountainous strip is minimal and most likely the tribes of this region remain fully pre-Indo European. *5th century BC Further development of strong Central European (Celtic) influences and migrations in western Iberia north of the Tagus river. Development of a second Castro Village culture in Galicia and northern Portugal. The Celtic Calaicians or Gallaeci inhabit all the region above the Douro river (modern Galicia and northern Portugal). First mint of coins and use of money in the Iberian peninsula. Discovery voyages to the Atlantic by the Carthaginians. The Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus cites the word Iberia to designate what is now the Iberian peninsula, according to ancient Greek costume. Urban bloom of Tartessian influenced Tavira.  575 BC * Foundation of Emporion (Ampurias), in the Catalan coast, by Greek colonists from Phocaea.Strabo, Geographica, III, 4 * Soon afterwards the Northwest is rapidly re-Iberized from the south. This process cut the Celts of Iberia off from their continental counterparts, preventing the late Celtic culture of La T√®ne from affecting the peninsular Celts. * ca. 500 BC  Decadence of Phoenician colonization of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia. Many of the colonies are deserted. Carthago slowly replaces the Phoenician in its former areas of dominion.  Tartessos disappears suddenly, probably destroyed by the Carthaginians as revenge of the Tartessian alliance with the Greeks during the battle of Alalia, in the coast of Corsica. The Turdetanians become their successors, although with a strong Carthaginian influence. *4th century BC The Celtici, a new wave of Celtic migration, enter deeply into Portuguese territory and settle in the Alentejo also penetrating in the Algarve. The Turduli and Turdetani, probably descendants of the Tartessians, are established in the area of the Guadiana river, in the south of modern Portugal, but celtized. A series of cities in the Algarve, such as Balsa (Tavira), Baesuris (Castro Marim), Ossonoba(Faro) and Cilpes (Silves), are inhabited by the Cynetes or Cunetes progressively mingled with Celtic populations. The Lusitanians (most probably proto-Celt) inhabit the area between the Douro and the Tagus rivers (and progressively penetrate the High Alentejo). They are neighbored to the east by the Vettones (also probably proto-Celt). Rome begins to rise as a Mediterranean power rival to Carthage. Iberia before Carthaginian conquests  ca. 400 BC * The Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus cites the word Iberia to designate what is now the Iberian peninsula, according to ancient Greek costume. * Further development of strong Central European (Celtic) influences and migrations in western Iberia north of the Tagus river. * The Autrigones, along with the Turmodigi and Belli, migrate from Gaul, overrunning the entire area of the modern provinces of Cantabria and Burgos, where they establish their first capital Autraca or Austraca, located at the banks of the river Autra (Odra). They also gain an outlet to the sea by seizing from the Caristii further east the coastal highland region between the rivers As√≥n and Nervi√≥n, in the modern Vizcaya and √Ålava Basque provinces.Mart√≠n Almagro Gorbea, Etnog√©nesis del Pa√≠s Vasco: de los antiguos mitos a la investigaci√≥n actual (Munibe (Antropologia- Arkeologia) 57, 2005), * The Belli settle along the lower Jal√≥n river valley alongside their neighbours and clients, the Titii.Francisco Burillo Mozota, Sobre el territorio de los Lusones, Belos y Titos en el siglo II A. de C. in Estudios en homenaje al Dr. Antonio Beltr√°n Mart√≠nez (Universidad de Zaragoza, facultad de Filosof√≠a y Letras, 1986) *3rd century BC The First Punic War (264-241 BC) between Rome and Carthage.

It has appealed to both Jewish and wider mainstream audiences. At various times in American history, the field of comedy has been dominated by Jewish comedians. History The Borscht Belt arose in the early 20th century out of the tradition of Yiddish theater, in Jewish resort areas in the Catskill Mountains in New York. Many of the most famous Jewish comedians of the twentieth century launched their careers there. Many of the comedians gained a wider mainstream audience with the rise of Vaudeville. Until recent years, most Jewish comedians adopted stage names that did not sound ethnic, as a way of gaining wider acceptance. Even among those who did not want to be considered Jewish comedians, their experiences as Jews were often included in their humor, including their moral sensibility. Themes and styles Some common themes among American Jewish comedians include their heritage as Jews, experience of living between two worlds (ethnic and mainstream), anxiety of living as a minority in America and the foibles of American culture. Jewish comedy has often featured ridicule and insult jokes, including insulting other minority groups. Characteristics of comedians include wit, verbal skills, self-mockery, and a \\"critical edge\\". Women in Jewish-American humor Whereas women had not been prominent in comedic roles in Europe, the changing roles of Jewish women in America allowed for the emergence of a class of female Jewish comedians, who have focused on their perspective as women, often adopting a feminist position.

It has become known informally as the \\"Shrewsbury ghost church\\".  Founding  The church had different cited building dates, all in the 1850s, with the earliest construction date by Irish and Scottish pioneers listed as 1851. There is an adjacent cemetery; the earliest known burial, according to tombstones, was 1868, although earlier possible burials are unconfirmed, since some stones are missing. The most recent burial was 2005.  Vandalism  Reports indicate that the church was the target of serious vandalism for forty years. Repeated attacks began in the early 1970s, at a time when it was still being used regularly for services. The Vankleek Hill Review reports: \\"Over the past few decades the little church survived destruction, defecation, robbery and vandalism. The bells were stolen from the bell-tower on three separate occasions during the past three decades alone. The interior and exterior of the building were attacked with axes, hammers and spray paint and many of the tombstones were toppled and defaced.\\"  Fame  Of late the church has attracted ghost hunters, witches and vandals, after being mistakenly described online as a \\"ghost church\\" rather than a church in a ghost town. A popular online rumor has the church's congregation committing mass suicide. Unofficial ghost walks are frequently conducted here as well as graveyard s√©ances. Some vandalized gravestones in the hopes of rousing spirits. The church building had been emptied of its contents, including the bell, by souvenir seekers. Two tombstones were also stolen.  Deconsecration  As a result of these incidents, a Deconsecration service was performed on December 4, 2010. The municipality of Gore, Quebec expected to renovate the church with the help of government grants, and intended to use it as a community centre.  Fire  On January 12, 2014, the church burned to the ground and was totally destroyed. An early 2014 investigation into this incident considered possible arson. On January 22, 2014, a letter to the editor of the Vankleek Hill Review from Rodney Brown of Brownsburg-Chatham argued that the fire reflected local language tensions: \\"Part of my ancestral history perished on Sunday, January 12[, 2014]. The Shrewsbury Church, in the municipality of Gore, built in 1856, was burned down by someone who obviously has [n]o respect o[r] appreciation for English history in this province. The ravaging of this church has been ongoing for several years now, while authorities in a position to protect this sacred place of worship did little or nothing to discourage the culprits. ... Forget any help from the S√ªret√© de Qu√©bec ‚Äì it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out why.\\" People from the municipality of Gore who attempted to protect the church were volunteers and mainly descendants of the area's original settlers. They blamed groups of teenagers from neighboring communities, including the predominantly Francophone Saint-J√©r√¥me, for years of vandalism and possible arson. The destruction of the church has devastated the local Anglophone community, who count this site as a symbolic cornerstone of their history.

The purpose of the Path, proposed by jaguar expert Alan Rabinowitz, is to allow jaguars to travel and inter-breed throughout their historical areas. The Panthera organization actively develops these corridors through their Jaguar Corridor Initiative. Description The corridors created by this program allow for the natural roaming behavior of the jaguar and safeguard them from ranchers and farmers by giving jaguars natural cover, letting them avoid human activities as much as possible. These corridors in some cases are as small as a line of trees along a fence; they do not have to be something large, they simply have to be enough to link habitats together in continuous ground cover. A key component of the Path of the Jaguar is the creation of small preserves spaced along the corridor at key points. These preserves are just large enough for a jaguar to stay and hunt in for a day or two, offering an alternative to the risky endeavor of hunting livestock. Potential connections There are many potential connections between current jaguar habitats. A 2010 study by Rabinowitz suggested 182 of them, 44 of which are danger of being eliminated by human use.

The Froward Point lookout is the building with the flag pole NCI Froward Point is a busy National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) lookout station at Inner Froward Point at the easterly side of the mouth of the River Dart two miles by coast path from Kingswear in Devon in England. Its twin duties are to maintain an hours of daylight watch over the local coastal area and the South West Coast Path on whose route it lies. With some significant blind spots because of the coastline, NCI Froward Point covers the coastline from Start Point in the West towards Brixham in the East. Operational details The area of operation has a mixed boating population of a fishing fleet, recreational yachtsmen, both sail and power, yacht racing fleets, small commercial passenger vessels, kayaks, canoes, military vessels, dinghy racing fleets, racing gigs, small boats and inflatables, powered and unpowered. During the summer months the recreational seafarers make the lookout both busy and an important resource. In addition there are regular visits to the River Dart by passenger cruise liners during the cruising months. The high number of boating movements makes the mouth of the Dart and the surrounding headlands places of high risk. Although it is not involved in traffic management, NCI Froward Point alerts Falmouth Coastguard both to potential incidents and incidents in progress. The Froward Point lookout became operational in July 2005 with planning going back to 2002. It is one of a growing number of NCI lookout stations on the coast of the United Kingdom. NCI Froward Point rents two buildings of the Brownstone Battery complex, a World War II battery, from the National Trust. As a part of the NCI UK registered charity, NCI Froward point is entirely supported by charitable donations. NCI Froward Point works closely with HM Coastguard at Brixham, and the Dart Lifeboat, and is accredited with Declared Facility Status, which allows full participation on UK Search and Rescue incidents. NCI Froward Point has been featured in the ITV Southwest Regional Evening News programme on 14 February 2007 as a significant point on a featured walk. Facilities The station is equipped with fixed and handheld Marine VHF radios on which it maintains a listening watch on channels 0, 16 and 67 unless authorised to transmit by the Coastguard on a per incident basis (pre 1 October 2014), and channel 65 for regular two-way traffic (post 1 October 2014), a pair of mounted telescopes, binoculars, a radar set and a weather station. The weather station updates the lookout's website with weather data every minute or so via a microwave link to a broadband connection as an important real-time service to seafarers. A webcam, updating images at the same interval, provides a visual check on sea state and weather. With no mains electricity to the site, solar panels are used, and a diesel generator is run when necessary. The lookout station maintains a visitor centre with information about both its operations and also the Brownstone Battery itself. Wildlife When not monitoring the surrounding area for people at risk, watch keepers record sightings of seals, cetaceans and other wildlife for relevant wildlife organisations. Incidents NCI Froward Point has been involved in the following incidents: *13 Sep 2007 - Asked to assist Brixham Coastguard in locating disabled motor cruiser Jelly Bean. Located successfully. *27 Sep 2007 - Assisted Brixham Coastguard with locating MFV Jose Jacqueline, reported to be in danger. *10 Feb 2007 - Initiated rescue of 5 metre RIB *20 Feb 2007 - Located 10 metre motor cruiser with mechanical failure and conned Dart Harbour and Navigation Authority vessel to the casualty *21 August 2007 - Assisted Brixham Coastguard with yacht Stay Free taking in water. *24 Nov 2007 - Initiated rescue of small high speed inflatable.

The moniker \\"Kiss\\" stands for \\"keep it stupidly simple\\", reflecting the philosophy of its designer, Nino Fam√†. Design and development The Kiss 209M is a single rotor, conventionally laid out helicopter seating two side- by-side. The design targets were low cost and easy maintenance, combined with a comfortable cabin and good performance. The centre section and the high-set tail boom are tube steel structures, clad in carbon fibre. The cabin shell is also carbon fibre and bolts to the central frame. The 120 kW (160 hp) Solar T62 turboshaft engine is supported above the cabin roof and tail line, partly exposed, driving twin blade main and tail rotors. The latter is accompanied at the extreme tail by a fin/underfin pair, both swept and slender. A narrow pair of tailplanes is located forward of the tail rotor on the boom, though the prototype initially flew with a T-tail. The Kiss can have either a skid or retractable wheel undercarriage. The main rotor advances to the right and the anti-torque tail rotor, mounted on the left side of the tail boom, advances at the bottom. The semi-articulated main rotor is supported on an underslung teetering hinge. Pitch inputs to the main rotor blades are transmitted via rods inside the hollow main rotor shaft. Control of the Kiss is conventional and manual. Dual control is an option. It is fitted with an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS). After ground runs on 15 July 2009, the Kiss flew for the first time on 13 August.

Significant parts of the fortification walls remain well-preserved. History Map of the remains of the walls that are still visible Piran's three walls were built in response to the city's expansion. The first wall was built in the 7th century, separating the town into four streets, named after each of the entrances into the town: Miljska, Stolna, Osrednja (main) and Poljska. The first wall can be seen in the old part of the town. The wall was moved south-west when new streets were built. The fortification wall, which was built along the southern coast of the town, hasn't changed much since it was first built. At the end of the 13th century, when Piran came under Venetian rule, the town grew further and in response the second wall was built. This wall included the town quarter of Campo. In the final phases of expansion between 1470 and 1538, the third fortification wall was built to protect the peninsula during construction. It protected the Marƒçana quarter. The biggest part was built when the use of gunpowder became frequent.Piransko obzidje - Arhitekturna dedi≈°ƒçina - Slovenia - Official Travel Guide The third wall is almost completely intact. Its northern part is accessible while the southern wall's floors and stairs are missing or are under reconstruction. Between them a gap opened where the wall collapsed.

In the 1890s oka travelled to the West to acquire whaling techniques and equipment, and in 1899 established Nihon En'y≈ç Gyogy≈ç K.K., which caught its first whale the following year with Norwegian gunner. Whaling in Japan grew rapidly and competition was fierce. In 1908 Oka became the first president of the Japan Whaling Association. Oka declared Japan would \\"become one of the greatest whaling nations in the world ... The day will come when we shall hear one morning that whales have been caught in the Arctic and in the evening that whales are being hunted in the Antarctic.\\" Life and career Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japan went through a period of rapid modernization, and many were sent to the West to bring back knowledge and technology. The nation began to assert its authority in the Far East, which was to lead to the colonization of Korea and Taiwan. The Russian Empire dominated whaling in the region, which added political motivations to Japanese whaling. Oka visited the government in Tokyo with a plan to modernize whaling. The government agreed to it, and he set off for Norway, where he purchased whaling equipment at 10% above the prices asked to ensure early delivery to Japan. He studied the practicalities of whaling in Finnmark and made trips to the Azores to observe traditional methods and to the Newfoundland Colony to observe modern methods which had just begun to be used there. He concluded that the Norwegians had a superior system, but that Japan could not adopt it as-is given that the Norwegians whaled primarily for oil, the Japanese for meat. Oka returned to Japan and in Yamaguchi Prefecture on 20 July 1899 established the whaling company Nihon En'y≈ç Gyogy≈ç K.K., nicknamed the Ichimaru Kaisha after its logo: the Chinese character for the number one ( ') within a circle ('). Oka was managing director. Oka's was not the first modern whaling corporation in Japan: Hogei Gumi had preceded it by a year, but had found little success and closed in 1900. Japan was in financial straits following the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95) so Oka found it difficult to raise the 100,000 yen necessary for the enterprise. The company applied for a whaling licence from Korea, which was difficult to obtain as the Korean court was under the influence of the Russian Empire. A three-year licence was granted, restricted to three locations at 600 yen per whaler. For reasons of prestige, the company had the whaler built in Japan: the Daiichi Ch≈çsh≈´ Maru (, completed 30 November 1899), named after Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, which was Yamaguchi Prefecture's name before the Meiji Restoration. The company hired an experienced Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen, who shot the company's first whale‚Äîa blue whale‚Äîon 4 February 1900. The company turned its first profit the following year, by which point it had added a whaler, the Olga, leased from an Anglo-Russian company. Nihon En'y≈ç Gyogy≈ç faced near ruin when the Daiichi Ch≈çsh≈´ Maru was wrecked on the coast of Korea in a blizzard on 2 December 1901; the ship was uninsured, as no insurance company had been willing to cover it. The Olgas catch the following year nearly covered the losses, though, and the company survived. Oka began to charter the Norwegian whalers Rex and Regina; Norwegian companies were unable otherwise to obtain whaling licenses in the region. In 1904 the company purchased the Olga and reorganized as T≈çy≈ç Gyogy≈ç () with capital of 500,000 yen. Oka obtained a concession from the Korean government on 11 January 1904; as Russian whaling ceased during the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì05) Oka had a de facto monopoly in Korean waters for the war's duration, which he expanded with the lease of three Russian stations on 1 May 1905. Japan's success in the war opened Eastern waters and allowed the company to expand. It began purchasing new whalers in 1906, the first of which was the Norwegian-built Togo, and soon became the most profitable whaling company worldwide. Its success inspired other Japanese whaling companies, with similar success. Competition was fierce, and whaling companies fought to secure the best whalers, until the government threatened to intervene; to calm this strife, Oka led a series of conferences in mid-1908 that led to the establishment of the Japan Whaling Association on 18 December 1908, based in Osaka with Oka as its first president. The Association restricted the number of whalers within Japanese waters and had heavy penalties for breaches of its code. On 2 May 1910 Japan's four largest whaling companies merged with two smaller ones to form the T≈çy≈ç Hogei K.K. (, \\"Oriental Whaling Company\\"). Oka declared Japan would \\"become one of the greatest whaling nations in the world ... The day will come when we shall hear one morning that whales have been caught in the Arctic and in the evening that whales are being hunted in the Antarctic.\\" Other companies went bankrupt, and still others partook in mergers, until by the 1930s the large company Taiy≈ç Gyogy≈ç () had absorbed them all.

As a producer and composer, he created over 40 music albums up to 2010, including those performed by himself.http://www.pierrot.privatemoon.com/albumok/ A large number of his productions have gone golden and platinum in the country, with many top hits. Pierrot established his music publisher company Private Moon Productions (1994), later Private Moon Records in 1999. They started as an independent firm, then became the label of Sony Music and subsequently EMI. In 2004-2005, as a supporter of young musicians, Pierrot was producer (and head of jury) of a singer talent show (Pop Idol) on Hungarian television (Megaszt√°r) as well as jury member of the national and international Eurovision Song Contest in 2015 and 2016. He became engaged in video game development in 1997 when he started his second company Private Moon Interactive ‚Äì later Private Moon Studios. The initial version of AGON was born in his mind in 1998. The concept, scenario, game design, 2D graphics, sound and music have been Pierrot‚Äôs personal fields of responsibility from the start. Yoomurjak‚Äôs Ring, a full-length interactive movie is also a Private Moon production. This FMV (full motion video) game won first prize at the Hungarian eFestival 2007 in the category of interactive storytelling. Pierrot devotes much of his time to studying Asian culture. The motives of Chinese, Indonesian or Indian music often appear in his compositions. His book on Asian gastronomy was published in 2004 (Megk√≥stolni √Åzsi√°t; publisher: Arterego, Hungary). The most outstanding manifestation of his passion for Chinese culture was his planned video game AGON: The Tales of the Four Dragons. Pierrot has also been creating real-life games for the tourism industry. His interactive sight-seeing \\"games\\" derive from the concept of the Yoomurjak‚Äôs Ring project and are linked to it by a number of elements such as time travel and the character of Jonathan Hunt, the hero of Yoomurjak‚Äôs Ring. From 2010, Pierrot has been increasingly active in board game development. He created a playable album of 24 abstract strategy board games and has four tabletop games of his own creation released in Hungary and internationally. The musician Pierrot has been a productive composer and music producer, creator of dozens of Hungarian top hits performed by other singers as well as himself. He studied violin and piano in school and continued private musical education thereafter. Having recognized his creativity, his teachers and instructors gave him sufficient freedom for self- development. By the time his studies were finished he was already a popular artist as a pop singer and songwriter. From 1988 Pierrot had spent several years as musical editor at a Hungarian commercial radio channel (Danubius) where he got access to a vast source of musical material. This background helped him to establish a career in the music industry and to acquire skills in studio work. His first professional band was founded in 1986 (Pierrot √°lma ‚Äì Pierrot‚Äôs dream). A ten-year period came when he performed on stage wearing a clown masque covering half of his face ‚Äì or leaving half of it uncovered, as he prefers to put it. He challenged himself in theatre too in a number of occasions. In 1991 he composed music for the Hungarian stage adaptation of Anthony Burgess‚Äôs Clockwork Orange and had regular multimedia-based performances in Budapest‚Äôs traditional B√°bsz√≠nh√°z puppet/marionette theatre. In 2010 he was music composer of a children‚Äôs musical based on the story of the cartoon series Popeye. (L. Darvasi ‚Äì Pierrot ‚Äì Ganxsta Zolee: Popeye).http://www.thalia.hu/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=558&catid;=13 He had been producer and many times composer of several albums for other Hungarian performers including Ganxsta Zolee (hip-hop) who also appears in Pierrot‚Äôs video game Yoomurjak‚Äôs Ring and lends his voice to certain characters in AGON. Pierrot was composer and producer of Ganxsta Zolee & Kartel's album K.O. (released in 2017) which went platinum and won a Fonogram at the Hungarian Music Awards in 2018. A large part of the background music in Pierrot‚Äôs games are his own compositions. The title music of Yoomurjak‚Äôs Ring, Coming Back Home is one of them, co-written with Jamie Winchester, the singer of the English version. The Hungarian version (titled Otthon), which has also been published as a stand-alone music video, is performed by Pierrot himself. The game developer Pierrot‚Äôs devotion to adventure gaming started at his first encounter with the genre in the early 1990s, especially with Robyn and Rand Miller‚Äôs graphic video game Myst. As an enthusiastic collector and reviewer, he launched a multilingual online adventure game magazine titled Inventory. From 1999, Pierrot was creative producer of GameStar (Hungary) magazine for years. This passion eventually drove him to make a game of his own: the idea of the AGON saga took shape in his mind in 1998. A few years later his company Private Moon Studios became one of the first game developers in Europe to release large-file graphic adventure games through the Internet (as a sequence of episodes).Adventure Classic Gaming magazine; Interview with Pierrot by Philip Jong, 05-27-2010; http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/531/ In 2005 Pierrot and his team were entrusted with creating a video game as an unconventional means of promoting the tourist attractions of Eger, a Hungarian town with a considerable historic background. Pierrot chose the full motion video as the form of the game, featuring top Hungarian actors, amongst them Gy√∂rgy B√°rdy (B√°rdy Gy√∂rgy) who had already played the same character in a movie nearly forty years before (Egri Csillagok by Zolt√°n V√°rkonyi, 1968).The Internet Movie Database; https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062925/ Yoomurjak's Ring was based on a popular Hungarian novel written by G√©za G√°rdonyi in and about Eger in 1899. (The book was also published in English under the title Eclipse of the Crescent Moon). A sequel to the game was released in 2015 titled MIAZMA or the Devil's Stone (MIAZMA avagy az √∂rd√∂g k√∂ve in Hungarian), also with Jonathan Hunt as the protagonist.MIAZMA or the Devil's Stone website (Hungarian); http://miazma.privatemoon.com/ Pierrot has been also involved in several types of game projects outside the computer game industry. These include edutainment projects as well as a network of interactive and playable sight-seeing programs for select Hungarian cities, including Eger. In the field of board game development, in addition to his reconstructions of ancient strategy board games, he has been expanding his portfolio with his own tabletop board game creations, released in Hungary from 2016. His first internationally released tabletop game hit the shelves in 2019. Five of his games have been published (by Trefl, Piatnik and Modell&Hobby;) and over a dozen are in development (in 2020). The author Under his real name Tamas Z. Marosi, Pierrot was co-author of a Hungarian rock music manual covering the eras 1950-1993. As a fan of Asian culture, he was the author of a book on the gastronomy of India, China, Indonesia and Thailand. The book featured his collection of recipes and some of his own photos. (Atrerego, Budapest, 2005).Megk√≥stolni √Åzsi√°t; http://www.arterego.hu/ref2.php?id=3/ Upon the success of the game Yoomurjak's Ring Pierrot launched a series of novels under the title Jonathan Hunt Adventures in 2011. He has been working with co- writers on the novels. The protagonist is Jonathan Hunt, the American journalist who settles in Hungary and gets involved in various investigations. The plots are set in major historical places of Hungary. The books published so far in the series: Jumurdzs√°k gy≈±r≈±je (Yoomurjak's Ring, co-written with S√°ndor Sz√©lesi, 2011), Az √∂rd√∂g k√∂ve (Devil's Stone, co-written with Endre G√°bor, 2012) and Magister M (co-written with Endre G√°bor,2013). The series is in Hungarian, published by Alexandra, Hungary.Jonathan Hunt Adventures on privatemoon.com; http://books.privatemoon.com/en/ Pierrot presented 24 of his own classic abstract strategy board game illustrations in a large, playable album in 2011. The book features the three game boards already known from his AGON adventure games and in the iPad series (Tablut, Fanorona, Alquerque and The Royal Game of Ur) as well as several others with a brief history and rules of play.

Shaffer's casting was announced in December 2010 and it was revealed that Ruby would be introduced as the sister of Duncan Button (Dean Aspen). Shaffer originally auditioned for the role of Leanne Holiday, in which she was not successful. Shaffer began filming her scenes in late 2010 and relocated to Liverpool for filming. Ruby made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 3 January 2011. In October 2013, it was announced that Shaffer had quit the role and would leave in February 2014. In October 2017, speculation emerged indicating Shaffer was to reprise the role very soon and on 16 November 2017, it was confirmed that Ruby would be back for Frankie Osborne's funeral later that month. She returned on 23 November 2017, departing in the following episode, broadcast on 24 November 2017. She made another return for a guest stint at the end of April 2018, making her final appearance on 30 April. Ruby was initially described as \\"sneaky\\" and likely to cause mayhem at Duncan's expense. Ruby is a tearaway and \\"occupies herself with tormenting others\\" including her best friend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks). Ruby is illiterate and the official Hollyoaks website describe this as her \\"Achilles heel\\". However, Ruby does not let her illiteracy stop her causing trouble. The character has also been called a \\"bitchy schoolgirl\\" and sharp-tongued. Series producer, Emma Smithwick, said she wants the character of Ruby to be \\"more full and not two-dimensional\\". Ruby's storylines have often focused on her various relationships and \\"bitchy\\" ways. Ruby engages in a brief relationship with Duncan's best friend, Ricky Campbell (Ashley Margolis), which ends when Ricky sees Ruby bullying others. Ruby also becomes best friends with Esther and Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis). A prominent storyline for Ruby saw her reveal her illiteracy and subsequently develop feelings for her tutor, Pete Hamill (Peter Mitchell). Ruby's behaviour soon begins to \\"spiral out of control\\" and she claims to have had sex with older man, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). She later embarks on a relationships with Jono (Dylan Llewellyn) and Ziggy Roscoe (Fabrizio Santino), and becomes embroiled in the bullying of Esther as well as suffering a heart attack. Development Casting and characterisation In December 2010, the Liverpool Echo reported that eighteen-year-old Shaffer would be joining the cast of Hollyoaks as Ruby, the sister of Duncan Button (Dean Aspen). Shaffer originally auditioned for the role of Leanne Holiday, but she was later cast as Ruby. Shaffer relocated to Liverpool, where Hollyoaks is filmed, for the role. She began filming her scenes in late 2010. Shaffer made her first on-screen appearance as Ruby in the episode broadcast on 3 January 2011. In May 2011, it was speculated that Shaffer would be leaving Hollyoaks. However, this was denied and a show spokesperson told Digital Spy \\"We don't want to spoil the storylines for the viewers, however we can confirm that Anna Shaffer is with Hollyoaks for the foreseeable future.\\" Ruby was initially described as \\"sneaky\\" and likely to \\"cause mayhem at the expense of [Duncan]\\". The official Hollyoaks website described Ruby as a \\"tearaway\\". They dubbed her the \\"Rubester\\" and said she \\"occupies herself with tormenting others\\" including her best friend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks). Ruby is illiterate, which is her \\"Achilles heel\\". However, she does not let her illiteracy stop her causing trouble. Digital Spy called Ruby a \\"bitchy schoolgirl\\" who is sharp-tongued. Series producer, Emma Smithwick, said she wants the character of Ruby to be \\"more full and not two-dimensional\\". Shaffer told OK Extra that Ruby is a \\"tart with a heart\\", but finds it hard to trust people. She said \\"[Ruby] has deep-seated insecurities and she feels quite lonely.\\" Illiteracy and school girl crush In May 2011, it was revealed that Ruby is illiterate. Ruby gets her friend, Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis) to write a love letter from their friend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks), to teaching assistant, Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). Shaffer told a columnist from Inside Soap that Ruby and Sinead \\"come up with all this ridiculous, over-the-top stuff\\" and put up copies of the letter around school. Amy discovers what Ruby and Sinead have done and asks them to write apology letters to Esther. Shaffer explained that Ruby seems worried and does everything she can to get out of writing the letter. Explaining the situation, Shaffer told Inside Soap [...] \\"Sinead realises that it's not because Ruby doesn't want to write the letter - it's because she can't\\". Esther discovers Ruby's illiteracy and decides to help. Esther's grandmother, Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson), learns of Ruby's treatment of Esther and threatens to throw her out. However, Esther convinces Frankie to let Ruby stay when she reveals her illiteracy. Esther also tells their school headteacher, Pete Hamill (Peter Mitchell). Shaffer opined that Ruby is grateful to Esther as Ruby \\"wouldn't have the guts\\". The actress added that it was \\"nice\\" to see Ruby's vulnerability, but said it would not last. Pete organises a tutor, Colin Grimshaw (Michael Mears), to teach Ruby to read and write. Ruby assumes that Pete will be tutoring her. She has feelings for him and thinks they are reciprocated. Shaffer said that Ruby is \\"gutted\\" when she learns that Colin will be tutoring her. Ruby tries to make their lessons \\"as difficult as possible\\". The other students post a photo of Ruby and Colin inside a love heart on the classroom board which leaves Ruby \\"absolutely mortified\\". Shaffer opined that people may sympathise with Ruby. She said \\"Instead of thinking about what a bitch [Ruby] is, the viewers might start to realise that she's actually just a lost little girl.\\" Ruby \\"winds up\\" Colin in their lessons and she does not think that he will retaliate. Ruby tells Pete that Colin touched her inappropriately. However, Pete convinces Ruby that Colin was only trying to comfort her. Pete tells Ruby that Colin will continue to tutor her. Ruby verbally abuses Colin and he slaps her. Pete sees this and suspends Colin. Ruby uses the situation to her advantage and \\"revels\\" in the attention. Pete then offers to be Ruby's new tutor. In August 2011, Ruby kisses Pete during one of their study sessions. Ruby kisses Pete after she accidentally spills a drink on him. Shaffer said that Ruby and Pete are \\"physically close\\" and she decides to be spontaneous. Pete is \\"horrified\\" and rebuffs her advances. Shaffer revealed that Ruby is hurt by this as she had convinced herself that her feelings were reciprocated by Pete. He then tells her that he is going to find a replacement tutor. Rebellious behaviour In May 2011, it was reported that she would soon \\"spiral out of control\\". Ruby plans to host a party as Frankie and Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) are on holiday. However, Jack asks his son, Darren (Ashley Taylor Dawson) and Darren's girlfriend, Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), to babysit Ruby whilst they are away. Darren and Nancy discover Ruby's plans and put a stop to them. Shaffer explained that Ruby sees Frankie and Jack being away as the \\"perfect\\" opportunity to make some mischief. However, Ruby underestimates Nancy, who poses as her on a social networking website and cancels the party. Ruby is \\"furious\\" and decides to run away. She stands \\"sexily\\" at the side of the road trying to hitch a lift out of the village. Ruby is pleased when Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) and Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) offer her a lift and she introduces herself as Alicia. She then joins them on their night out. Doug flirts with Ruby and Shaffer said that \\"Ruby being Ruby then thinks it would be a good idea to head back to his flat\\". Ruby and Doug kiss, but she passes out as she is not used to drinking \\"so much\\" alcohol. Doug decides to take her home and looks for her mobile phone to call one of her friends. However, he finds her student identification and discovers her real age. Doug tells Riley and as they panic, Ruby wakes up and realises that they are talking about her. She \\"freaks out\\" and unable to find her own top, takes Riley's football training top before secretly leaving. Doug and Riley are \\"frantic\\" when they realise Ruby has gone. They later find her \\"worse for wear\\" and covered in her own sick. They return her home to Frankie after getting their story straight. Later, Ruby realises who the training top belongs to and Shaffer said that she sees it as an opportunity to cause more trouble. Ruby lies to Esther, telling her that she had sex with Riley. Of Ruby's lie, a Hollyoaks insider told the Daily Star \\"As far as [Riley and Doug are] concerned that‚Äôs the end of it. But for Ruby the fun has just begun.\\" They added that Ruby is \\"one seriously mixed-up girl\\" and it is not long before her lie begins to spread. Ruby tells her friends that she had sex with Riley and the rumour begins to spread around the village. Riley's fianc√©, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), hears the rumour and is angry with Ruby. The Daily Star reported that Ruby is left \\"red- faced\\" after Mercedes confronts her. Mercedes tells Ruby that she must confess to making the lie up. Relationship with Jono In December 2011, it was announced that Ruby would begin a relationship with Jono (Dylan Llewellyn). Jono attends Ruby's sixteenth birthday party and the other guests do not arrive. Shaffer said that Ruby is \\"over the moon\\" with Jono's presence. Ruby sees Jono as a \\"cool sixth-former\\" and she asks him out. Jono accepts and they enjoy a romantic evening at the cinema. However, they are both nervous and Shaffer said that Ruby is anxious and has \\"first date jitters\\". Shaffer explained that Jono's worries are caused by his lack of experience with women. The actress called Ruby and Jono's encounter \\"awkward yet very sweet\\". Shaffer added that the storyline would see a \\"nicer side\\" of Ruby emerge, which she opined was great. She said \\"We're going to see their relationship blossom - it'll be a rocky ride, but I've got my fingers crossed!\\". The official Hollyoaks website referred to the couple by the portmanteau \\"Juby\\". The pair continue to see each other and their relationship becomes serious. Shaffer told a writer from Inside Soap that Ruby has \\"really fallen for Jono\\" and that while they have had their share of problems - a \\"proper attraction\\" remains between them. However, Jono is embarrassed because Ruby is still in school; Shaffer explained that he ensures that their dates happen when no one else is present. He does like her, but \\"it is taking a while to get there\\". Ruby is sure of what she wants and she invites him over for sex - but their encounter causes them to feel more awkward around one another. Shaffer added that Ruby and Jono's romance would continue to develop over time and said that it would have plenty of \\"drama in store for both of them\\". Departure On 31 October 2013, it was confirmed that Shaffer had decided to leave Hollyoaks. A show spokesperson revealed that Shaffer's final scenes as Ruby will air in early 2014. It was also confirmed that Ruby's on-off relationship with Ziggy Roscoe (Fabrizio Santino) would face \\"more twists and turns\\" in the following weeks. In her later storylines, Ruby bought cocaine from Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) and suffered a heart attack after taking it. Storylines Ruby arrives in Hollyoaks village to stay with her brother, Duncan Button, after leaving home. Duncan allows Ruby to move in with him. Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) tries to impress Ruby by stealing a car and taking her joyriding. Bart hits Jason Costello (Victoria Atkin) and he and Ruby flee the scene. Ruby begins dating Duncan's best friend, Ricky Campbell (Ashley Margolis). Ricky ends the relationship after he sees Ruby bullying a younger pupil at school. In retaliation, Ruby attempts to get Ricky expelled from school, but ultimately fails. Ruby gets her friend, Sinead O'Connor, to write a love letter from their friend, Esther Bloom, to teaching assistant, Amy Barnes. Amy discovers that Ruby and Sinead wrote the letter and as punishment, asks them to write apology letters to Esther. Ruby refuses and admits that she is illiterate. Ruby explains that her parents obsession with fame caused her illiteracy. Esther reveals Ruby's illiteracy to school headmaster, Pete Hamill, who offers to help Ruby. Ruby develops an attraction to Pete. Colin Grimshaw begins tutoring Ruby to read and write. Ruby falsely claims that Colin touched her inappropriately. Pete convinces Ruby that Colin was only trying to comfort her. In their next tutoring session, Ruby brands Colin a pervert and he slaps her. Pete sees this and suspends Colin. Pete offers to be Ruby's new tutor, which she accepts. Ruby plans a house party when her legal guardians, Frankie and Jack Osborne go on vacation. Jack asks his son, Darren, and Darren's girlfriend, Nancy Hayton, to babysit Ruby whilst they are away. Nancy foils Ruby's plans and secretly cancels the party. Upon discovering this, Ruby argues with Nancy and decides to run away. Whilst trying to hitch a lift out of the village, Ruby meets Riley Costello and Doug Carter and introduces herself as Alicia. She joins them on their night out and becomes intoxicated. Ruby goes home with Doug and they passionately kiss, but she falls asleep. Doug discovers Ruby's real age and calls Riley. Ruby wakes up and hears them discussing her. She takes Riley's football training top as she is unable to find her own top and sneaks out. Doug and Riley find Ruby and return her home. Ruby lies to Esther, telling her that she and Riley had sex. Riley's fianc√©, Mercedes McQueen, confronts Ruby and tells her to stop spreading lies about Riley. After Sinead and Bart McQueen complete their GCSE exams, her and Esther accompany the couple to Abersoch for a holiday after lying to Jack and Frankie about where they were really going. While there Ruby meets Bart's old friends Tilly Evans, Maddie Morrison and Jono. Jono then attempts to sleep with Ruby in order to lose his virginity, but is shot down by Ruby. After Sinead is hospitalized after almost drowning while drunk, Ruby forms a plan to sneak her and Esther back on a bus to Hollyoaks, without anyone finding out they were at Abersoch. The plan is a success and Sinead promises she won't tell anyone the two were there. Ruby and Esther then have a heart to heart about the places in the Osborne family and comfort each other by saying even if the family doesn't fully accept them, they'll always have each other and that's what matters. Nancy stops Ruby flirting with Pete, leaving Ruby angry. Ruby hears Pete offering to give Nancy a reference for a new job. Ruby steals Pete's mobile phone and when Nancy's interviewer calls for the reference, Ruby criticises Nancy. Nancy fails to secure the job. Darren learns of Ruby's deception and gives Ruby a fake letter which explains that she has been suspended from school. Darren reveals the letter is fake and Ruby apologizes to Nancy. Ruby kisses Pete during one of their tutoring sessions. Pete rejects Ruby's advances and tells her he can no longer tutor her. Ruby steals money from Jack and frames Danny Lawrence, but she later confesses. Ruby starts a relationship with Jono after he attends her 16th birthday party. The first time they sleep together is cut short when Jono doesn't last long causing awkwardness between the pair, however they make-up and sleep together again to correct it. Ruby then wants their relationship to become official but Jono feels ashamed to be dating a school girl after Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman) manipulates him. He them humiliates her at a party, so she dumps him. He manages to convince her to give him another chance and attempts to keep their relationship quiet, but Ruby soon finds out he fears he'll be embarrassed by his friends if they find out and breaks up with him. On Valentine's Day, Ruby serves as a bridesmaid along with Esther for Darren and Nancy's wedding. Jono attempts to talk to her during the ceremony but she rebukes him, still hurt by the way he treated her. Later at Sinead's party he manages to win her back by kissing her in front of his friends, showing he doesn't care what they think and that he truly wants to be with her. Ruby attends a night out with her friends and Maddie gives her marijuana to smoke. Ruby is grounded by Jack and Maddie continues to alienate everyone against Ruby. Maddie later befriends Ruby. Soon after, Maddie begins bullying Esther with the help of Sinead and Ruby. Jono plans to join the army, upsetting Ruby who declares she still has romantic feelings for him and Jono reveals that he feels the same. They then get back together and Jono realizes that if he joins the army he'll have to leave her behind. Jono then proposes to her so that she can come with him to the army to live in the couple's quarters. Ruby accepts and they plan to marry. Frankie and Jack tell them they will not allow Ruby to marry Jono. They plan to elope to Gretna Green. Maddie steals a van to transport them to Gretna Green but is followed by Bart and Esther who plan to stop the marriage. Maddie is distracted from the road and does not see Leah Barnes (Ela-May Demirican). Maddie swerves to avoid Leah and drives through the wedding venue of Doug Carter (PJ Brennan), Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson), Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). Jono saves Ruby from the wreckage, but she is horrified when both Neil and Maddie are killed. Ruby mourns their deaths and she and Jono begin planning her wedding. While sitting outside, Ruby holds Jono but is devastated to realise that he has died in her arms from internal injuries. Ruby, Sinead and Bart then act as a friend to Esther, but this is only to prevent her from talking to the police about the crash. Ruby tells a worried Sinead that if Esther does confess to the police she will wish she was dead. Ruby and Sinead's bullying worsens against Esther and when she tells the police Bart was involved in the crash, which causes Bart to leave Hollyoaks, the bullying pair worsen their treatment of Esther. Ruby takes over a lead in the bullying, purposely turning Esther's family against her. Esther starts to feel like everyone is against her which leads to her attempting to commit suicide with her needing a new liver. However, Ruby and Sinead show no sympathy whatsoever and make a pact to agree they say they had nothing to do with the bullying. But gradually, Ruby starts to get wracked with guilt over the bullying and finally confesses to Esther's family that they are the bullies. But at the same time, Sinead's stepmother Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher) questions Sinead over her involvement in the bullying in which she denies being involved. Next day after the confession, Jack furiously kicks Ruby out of the family home, forbidding her from going to see Esther and declaring her as no longer part of the family. After this, Ruby finds herself on the streets all day consumed by guilt. Later in the evening, she goes to Sinead's house and confesses to Diane that she and Sinead are the reason why Esther nearly killed herself. However, Diane furiously tells her to leave. She is then chased by John Paul McQueen who tries to talk to her, but she is then accidentally hit by Jack's car. Ruby is then taken to hospital and survives purely. However, Jack feels no sympathy for her because of her bullying Esther. She then returns home on Frankie's orders, but Frankie and the rest of the family assure her that she will punished. Next day, at a gathering at The Dog, Frankie gets into an argument with Diane, who's with Sinead, about Sinead's involvement. Diane, now fully aware of Sinead's involvement of the bullying, tries to blame the whole thing on Ruby, but Ruby reveals the whole truth by showing Dylan Shaw's (Mikey Riddington-Smith) video of Esther's message, in front of everyone, including new college headmaster Patrick Blake (Jeremy Sheffield). A few days later, Patrick calls both Ruby and Sinead into his office at different times. A remorseful Ruby apologizes sincerely for what she did, but is suspended from college for a few weeks. Sinead meanwhile shows no remorse and subsequently gets excluded. A few weeks later, Ruby ends her friendship with Sinead and returns to college. Shortly after she returns, Patrick asks John Paul to help Ruby with an anti-bullying campaign and also has Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) help her, although Phoebe is still angry with her for bullying Esther. Ruby forgives Esther, along with Sinead, after they discover that it was Brendan Brady who blackmail at her to bring Bart McQueen and Joel down. In August, after much flirting, Ruby finally kisses Ziggy Roscoe (Fabrizio Santino) and they begin a relationship. Despite their new relationship, an upset Frankie sleeps with Ziggy leaving Ruby heartbroken. She tries to tell Jack of Frankie's affair but he doesn't believe her. An upset Ruby purchases cocaine off Trevor and steals alcohol from the dog and has her own party leading her to have a heart attack. Ruby is soon discharged from hospital following her heart attack and goes to live back at The Dog in the Pond. Ruby plans to propose to Ziggy however as he doesn't return home after a night out, presumes he has slept with someone else when he was just taking care of Leela Lomax (Kirsty-Leigh Porter) who was exceptionally drunk. Ruby finds Frankie asleep on the couch and presumes she was with Ziggy so chops her hair as revenge. When Ruby realizes the truth, she feels guilty and makes plans to leave the village. Ziggy begs her not to however Esther helps pack her bags and she leaves to stay with her brother in Spain. In 2016, Jack told Darren that Esther has gone to stay with Ruby to keep her safe from the hands of the Gloved Hand Killer. In August, Esther sent her wedding invitation to Ruby, but found out that she couldn't attend. After her wife Kim left her, she went to visit Ruby for four days, and upon her return to the village, Esther mentions to her grandmother that Ruby and her brother were doing fine, Ruby got a good job in Spain and had learned how to speak Spanish. In December, Kim called Ruby to tell her that Esther had been shot. 2017-2018 In November 2017, Ruby returns to the village for Frankie‚Äôs funeral. She boasts about how good her life is to the Osbornes. At the wake, she tries to kiss Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) but he rejects her. The wake descends into chaos and Esther storms off. Ruby comforts her and admits that her life isn‚Äôt as good as she said it was. She offers Esther a chance to go to Spain with her and run a bar and Esther agrees. However, Esther decides to stay in Hollyoaks and Ruby returns to Spain alone. In April 2018, Ruby returns to the village again after Esther is almost killed by Darcy Wilde (Aisling Jarrett-Gavin). Esther decides to move to Spain with Ruby and also decides not to tell Jack but Jack catches her and they argue. Ruby helps them make up and they head to The Hutch to say goodbye to the Osbornes. They get into the taxi and find a large sum of money that was given to them by Grace Black (Tamara Wall). Ruby and Esther then leave Hollyoaks for Spain. Reception In August 2011, Inside Soap conducted a poll to find out which Hollyoaks character reader's most wanted to be murdered by serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). Ruby came second, receiving 21% of the vote. Smithwick told Digital Spy that she \\"really like[s]\\" Shaffer. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Jono was a bad boyfriend to Ruby and that she should have ended their relationship.

Established en 2000, Asociaci√≥n Civil impacta Salud y Educaci√≥n is a Peruvian non-governmental organization dedicated to clinical, biomedical and public health research as it relates to the health and human development in the fields of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Mission We are a non-profit organization dedicated to health and human behavior research by means of a multidisciplinary staff committed to the promotion of the wellbeing of individuals and society. We aim to achieve permanent advancements in knowledge that contribute to the expansion of development alternatives, health and education in the benefit our study populations and the general community. Vision Impacta will be recognized by its staff, clients and funding sources as well as the general public as the premier institution for scientific investigation in the Andean Region. Impacta will be identified as the reference center for biomedical investigations, the promotion of sexual health and the advancement of community education. Institutional values such as honesty, tolerance, respect for others and the cultivation of intellectual curiosity are the essence or our organizational approach. Conducting investigation and generating knowledge The impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which is rapidly and relentlessly expanding in developing countries, is reaching unprecedented dimensions. With the aim of taking advantage of investigations, helping combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic and assisting health care systems respond to numerous and complex health problems, it is necessary to focus on knowledge-generation and information exchange from an innovative perspective. In this context it is essential that treatment, prevention and epidemic control initiatives benefit from the most recent advancements and the most relevant experiences. Investigations are necessary so that the decisions made are evidence-based. Study findings are provided to programs and projects that combat HIV/AIDS and must be in accordance with the local circumstances and realities. Impacta‚Äôs principal activities are the generation of scientific knowledge and the search for the best ways to enhance health conditions at a population level. In this manner, Impacta conducts a range of studies in collaboration with both national and international institutions as well as with the private and public sectors. \\"It is essential that treatment, prevention and epidemic control initiatives benefit as much from the most recent scientific advancements as from the latest and most relevant experience acquired‚Ä¶\\" Prevention research More rigid tests are needed in order to prevent HIV infection as it relates to the promotion of preventive behaviors between different populations. This represents a major challenge in the context of increasing access to anti-retroviral treatment. More information is needed in order to determine the point at which data from developed countries are valid in countries that are developing or with limited resources. IMPACTA conducts projects that are directed at evaluating HIV prevention interventions as part of international research initiatives such as the HIV Prevention Trials Network. Vaccine research Although advances have been achieved both in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, the greatest hope is in discovery of a safe and effective vaccine. The development of an HIV vaccine faces numerous scientific challenges. Knowledge of protective immunity and antigens needs to expand as well as ways to confront HIV‚Äôs wide genetic diversity. In this area, Impacta has stood out as a leader in the implementation of the first preventive HIV vaccine studies in Per√∫. This lead role is sustained by the extensive preparation of study staff as well as strong community links. Impacta is the Peruvian site for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. \\"the greatest hope is in discovery of a safe and effective vaccine\\". Treatment research Basic science and the study of the pathogenesis of AIDS are important parts of the design and development of new drugs and innovative therapeutic strategies. The advent of potent antiretroviral drug combinations has provided a drastic reduction in HIV morality, principally in developed countries. As a result of the dissemination of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it has also been shown that it is necessary to address problems related to medication adherence and toxicity, immunological failure and the emergence of resistance and co-infections. Impacta‚Äôs study clinic and multidisciplinary staff are trained to provide specialized medical attention to people living with HIV/AIDS as well as confronting the challenges inherent in the implementation of treatment studies. Impacta is the Peruvian site of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. \\"It¬¥s vital to reinforce prevention in order to protect future generations, but is also necessary to expand antiretroviral treatment (‚Ä¶) A holistic approach in the fight against HIV/AIDS joins prevention, treatment, care and the support of people living with HIV/AIDS.\\"(OMS, 2004) Operational Research Operational research covers a wide range of focus areas and disciplines that support the design and improvement of systems that makes accessible effective prevention, treatment and care options and, with time, vaccines. Impacta has a special interest in: finding the best ways in which to supervise treatment in resource-limited environments; the interactions of HIV with other STI; the advancement of programs to monitor resistance to antiretrovirals; models for the creation of human resource; economic aspects; and the analysis of healthcare delivery systems, to name a few. \\"‚ÄúOperations studies help to involve and orient health services providers to coordinate their respective roles (‚Ä¶) It is fundamental to obtain data about what works, what doesn‚Äôt work and the reasons for those data. In this way it assures that information as available as quickly as possible.‚Äù\\" (OMS, 2004). Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS Although there still is no cure for AIDS, it is preventable and treatable. The majority of new HIV infections could be prevented if current prevention programs were expanded. Prevention initiatives could arrest the spread of HIV and important treatment advances could sustain the hope of a longer and better life for people that live with HIV. This area urgently needs the implementation and advancement of programs and projects in order to: prevent the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS; prevent infection via breastfeeding and in children; break the links between HIV and other STI; provide voluntary testing and counseling; and reduce the health risks in infected persons as well as other approaches. Impacta promotes HIV/AIDS/STI prevention programs and projects, as part of its efforts directed at vulnerable populations, with the support of the Global Found for the Fight Against AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. \\"‚ÄúPrevention initiatives could arrest the spread of HIV and important treatment advances could sustain the hope of a longer and better life for people that live with HIV.‚Äù\\" Partners Asociaci√≥n Civil Impacta Salud y Educaci√≥n collaborates with the University of Washington in various research projects.

A planter and prominent citizen of Fort Bend County, he organized the regiment for the Confederate States Army. Terry was killed in the regiment's first action at Rowlett's Station near Woodsonville, Kentucky. Family Born on February 18, 1821 in Russellville, Kentucky, the son of Joseph R. and Sarah David (Smith) Terry. His grandfathers, Nathaniel Terry and David Smith, had been officers in the American Revolutionary War, and the latter also served under Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812. His uncle, Benjamin Fort Smith, served on staff with Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans and later as adjutant for General Sam Houston during the Texas Revolution. Terry's family moved to Brazoria County, Texas when he was a boy. One brother David S. Terry later moved to California and served on that state's Supreme Court. A second brother Clinton Terry became an attorney at Brazoria. In 1851-53, using slave labor, Terry participated in the building of Texas‚Äôs first railroad, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway. With his business partner William F. Kyle, Terry bought the 2,500-acre Oakland plantation for $25 per acre in 1853. Paying off the debt by 1858,Wharton (2001), p. 166 he successfully farmed cotton and sugar cane and raised a family at the plantation in Sugar Land, Fort Bend County, Texas. In 1860, Terry and his 38-year-old wife Mary had six children, David, age 17, Mary, 12, Frank Jr., 10, Sally, 7, Kyle, 5 and Cornelia, 2. In 1862, his brother Clinton joined the Confederate Army and was killed at the Battle of Shiloh.Wharton (2001), p. 168 His son Kyle later became deeply involved in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War and was shot to death in the Galveston courthouse in 1890.Wharton (2001), p. 217 Career By reason of his wealth, large physical size, and popularity, Frank Terry became a leader in Fort Bend County. On January 9, 1861 he was elected a delegate to the Secession Convention in Austin. Terry and two fellow delegates, Thomas S. Lubbock and John A. Wharton, conceived the idea of organizing at least one company of Texas cavalrymen for the new government. In February and March 1861 Terry was one of the senior officers aiding John Salmon Ford and Ebenezar B. Nichols in the campaign to disarm the federal troops at Brazos Santiago. In June 1861 Terry, Lubbock, Wharton, and perhaps as many as fifty other Texans sailed from Galveston to New Orleans and then caught the train to Richmond to offer their services to the Confederate Army. In Richmond Terry and Lubbock secured positions as volunteer aides to General James Longstreet. Both men were appointed colonel, a term attached as a courtesy for their volunteer service, and participated with distinction in the First Battle of Bull Run. Afterward, the Confederate States War Department granted the authority to organize a cavalry regiment. At Houston on August 12, 1861, Terry and Lubbock issued a call for volunteers that was answered by 1,170 men. The rangers were sworn into service in September, but Terry delayed their final organization until late November, when they were officially designated the Eighth Texas Cavalry. The regiment started immediately for Virginia but en route was diverted to Nashville, Tennessee and then later ordered to Bowling Green, Kentucky. On December 17, 1861, Terry led the regiment into the Battle of Rowlett's Station near Woodsonville, Kentucky. While the battle ended in a Confederate victory, Colonel Terry was mortally wounded. His remains were sent by train to Nashville, where the state legislature adjourned and joined the procession escorting his body to lay in state at the Tennessee Capitol. Terry's body also lay in state in New Orleans and Houston, where the procession was described as \\"the most imposing ever seen in this state.\\" Governor Lubbock praised Terry in the state senate, saying that \\"no braver man ever lived-no truer patriot ever died.\\" Tributes Terry County, Texas, is named after him, as is B.

Background Dream Alliance was bred by Janet Vokes, whose main experience until then had been with breeding whippets and racing pigeons. While working as a barmaid at a local pub, she overheard Howard Davies, a local tax adviser, discussing a racehorse he had once owned. She was inspired by the idea, and soon after she and her husband, Brian, found a mare named Rewbell who was available for ¬£1000, due in part to a barbed wire injury and a very bad temperament. They ultimately bought her for ¬£350 and named Davies as the \\"racing manager\\" of the group. They bred Rewbell to Bien Bien, a stallion in his first year at stud in the UK, and the ensuing foal was born in 2001. The horse was reared on an allotment in Cefn Fforest near the town of Blackwood in south Wales, and ultimately 23 different people joined the ownership syndicate. Each member originally contributed ¬£10 per week to help develop the young horse and keep him in race training. The syndicate was organized by Davies, who estimated that it would cost ¬£15,000 a year to keep the horse in training and determined that 30 people, each contributing ¬£10 a week, could work. Racing career Dream Alliance moved from the Vokes' allotment to a stable when he was a yearling. At age three, he came to Philip Hobbs for training, after the syndicate had raised enough money to pay the training costs. On November 10, 2004, he came in fourth in his first race, third the next time, then second and finally in January 2006, won in his fourth race, hurdles at Chepstow. He then entered a slump, but began winning again in April 2007 at the Perth Gold Cup. In a 2008 preparatory race for the Grand National at the Aintree Festival, he sliced a tendon on the course, and only the quick thinking of his jockey and the urging of Davies saved him from being euthanized. Treatment required a very new stem cell treatment, but ultimately he healed and was able to race again. His winnings were adequate to cover the costs of his surgery and 15 months of rehabilitation. He reentered race training in July 2009. The horse won the 2009 Welsh National by three-quarters of a length, having been ridden by Tom O'Brien. As a result of his humble background and the successful treatment, the horse received significant media coverage in the run-up to the 2010 Grand National. The horse did not subsequently complete that race, being pulled up after the seventh fence. After the Grand National, he was found to have a lung condition. Though he ran in seven more races, he did not place again. He was retired in 2012. Ultimately, he ran 30 races and won ¬£138,646 in prize money. After all training and veterinary expenses were paid, including his surgery costs, the 23 syndicate members each obtained a profit of ¬£1430. Dream Alliance is stabled in Somerset under the care of the horse groom who worked for Hobbs and took care of him during his career. Post-Racing In 2015, a film about the horse and the people around him, titled Dark Horse: The Incredible True Story of Dream Alliance premiered, and at the Sundance Film Festival won the World Cinema audience award.

He commanded the Western Sharpshooters Regiment and the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, XVI Corps, Army of the Tennessee. Early life Burke was born in County Tipperary, Ireland, around 1830, the son of Walter Burke.Cemetery records, Calvery Roman Catholic Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri. As a child his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri. On April 8, 1846 he entered the Vincentian Seminary at St. Mary of the Barrens in Perryville, Missouri as a secular student. On April 1, 1848 he graduated with honors.Archival records of St Mary of the Barrens Seminary, DeAndreis-Rosati Memorial Archives, De Paul University. Upon returning to St. Louis, Burke became a clerk at the law firm of Glover and Richardson. He was admitted to the Missouri State Bar in 1849. After John C. Richardson was appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri in 1857, Burke went into partnership with Samuel T. Glover (considered the dean of the St. Louis Bar).Colonel Patrick E. Burke obituary. June 6, 1864, MISSOURI DEMOCRAT newspaper. Pre- war activities Burke became politically active as a supporter of the Benton faction of the Missouri Democratic Party, opposed to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and the possibility of the expansion of slavery to the western territories. In 1855 he was elected to the 19th Missouri General Assembly as a Benton Democrat, a member of the St. Louis contingent. In addition to his legal and political activities, Burke was an active participant in the St. Louis' pre-war militia organizations. Burke was elected 1st lieutenant of the prestigious Washington Blues militia company, serving until February 1861.Boyce, Joseph, Military Organizations of St. Louis, manuscript, 1897, Missouri History Museum Library and Archives. Early war activities Burke resigned from the Washington Blues in February 1861, apparently due to the secessionist views of most of its members. Shortly thereafter he became associated with underground pro-Unionist volunteers organized by Congressman Francis Preston Blair, Jr.. When the volunteers were mustered into Federal service in March‚ÄìApril, 1861, Burke was appointed captain of Company K, 1st Missouri Volunteer Infantry (3 Months). On May 10, 1861 Burke participated in the capture of the Missouri Volunteer Militia at Camp Jackson on the western edge of St. Louis, and the subsequent lethal riot in the streets of the city which became known as the Camp Jackson Affair. In the midst of the violence and tension of the Missouri secession crisis, Burke married 27-year-old Catherine Mackay, daughter of a wealthy surveyor with connections to socially prominent French members of the St. Louis elite. They were married on May 28, 1861, at Assumption Roman Catholic Church, by Father P. J. Ryan.Records of the Archive of the St. Louis Archdioceses and the Office of the Recorder of the City of St. Louis. After the June 11 collapse of the Price‚ÄìHarney Truce, Burke, leading Company K, 1st Missouri Volunteers, participated in the successful campaign to capture the state capital at Jefferson City and in defeat of a force of secessionist Missouri State Guard at the small, but strategically important Battle of Boonville.Report of Battle of Boonville, BG Nathaniel Lyon, Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Ser 1, Vol III, p13 Burke participated in General Lyon's campaign in pursuit of Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's Missouri State Guard, fighting in the Battle of Dug Spring on August 2, 1861. On August 10, Burke fought on Bloody Hill at Battle of Wilson's Creek, and was mentioned in Maj. S. D. Sturgis' official report for his leadership in the Federal counterattack which stabilized the federal line during the final southern assault.Report of Battle of Wilson's Creek, Major S.D. Sturgis, Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Ser 1, Vol III, p68 After the Federal forces retreated to Rolla, Burke returned to St. Louis and, on orders from Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont participated in the reorganization of the 1st Missouri Infantry into the 1st Missouri Light Artillery. In late 1861 Burke (who held a Missouri state captain's commission) was awarded a rare \\"regular\\" commission as a 1st lieutenant in the newly formed 13th U.S. Infantry, under Col. William Tecumseh Sherman (retroactively effective on 14 May 1861).General Orders 1861.148. Subsequently, he was promoted to captain (regular army) in the 14th U.S. Infantry, effective from October 24, 1861.General Orders 1861.197. Regimental and brigade command In June 1862 Burke was appointed colonel of the \\"Western Sharpshooters- Fourteenth Missouri Volunteers\\" by Provisional Missouri Governor Hamilton Rowen Gamble. In July, he took command of the Western Sharpshooters at Corinth, Mississippi. The regiment had a mixed reputation for hard fighting and indiscipline. Burke worked to reorganize, drill, and professionalize the unique multi-state regiment. On October 3‚Äì4, 1862 Burke personally led the Western Sharpshooters in two days of bitter skirmishes during the Second Battle of Corinth. After the battle Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans appointed Burke as Commandant of Corinth, responsible for securing the town, Confederate prisoners, stragglers, and dealing with the large numbers of casualties from both armies.Special Orders No 252, Headquarters Army of the Mississippi, Third Division, District of West Tennessee, Original Records of the War of the Rebellion, Series 1, Vol XVII, Part 2, p265 and Boyce, Joseph, Military Organizations of St. Louis, manuscript, 1897, Missouri History Museum Library and Archives. Over the next eleven months Burke shared command of the Corinth Military District. His regiment built Camp Davies, a stockaded outpost six miles south of Corinth. The Western Sharpshooters, and other troops under Burke's command, scouted and raided into southern Mississippi and western Alabama. In December 1863, the majority of the regiment (now designated the 66th Illinois Volunteer Infantry [Western Sharpshooters]) reenlisted as veterans. At the same time, members of the regiment began purchasing the new sixteen-shot Henry Repeating Rifle using their own funds. Burke supported this effort, which eventually added 250 of these advanced weapons to the unit, the second largest private purchase of the war.Billby, Joseph G., A Revolution in Arms: A History of the First Repeating Rifles, Westholm Publishing, Yardley, Pennsylvania, 2006, p133 In April, Burke was appointed to command of 2nd Brigade, Second Division, Left Wing, XVI Corps, Army of the Tennessee. His brigade consisted of the 66th Illinois, 9th Illinois Mounted Infantry, 12th Illinois Infantry, and 81st Ohio Infantry. These units had operated together since the Battle of Fort Donelson.This formation, commonly referred to as \\"Mersey's Brigade\\" operated together for most of the war. Originally under the command of Colonel (later Brigadier General) John McArthur, it operated under the command of German-American Brigadier General August Mersey in 1862 until Burke took command in 1864. At an earlier period, the brigade also included the 13th Missouri Infantry. Atlanta Campaign Burke led his brigade during opening portions of the Atlanta Campaign, leading from the front. As usual, the 66th Illinois was used as scout-skirmishers, but were employed as shock troops due to the regiment's high morale and the volume of fire they could generate with their newly purchased sixteen-shot Henry Repeating Rifles. On May 9, on Maj. Gen. Sherman's orders, McPherson's XVI Corps attacked through Snake Creek Gap in an attempt to cut Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's railroad supply line at Resaca, Georgia. The unexpected attack through the Gap succeeded, and the regiment advanced on Col. Burke's orders, single-handedly capturing the lightly held heights above Resaca.Woodworth, Steven E., Nothing Short of Victory: The Army of the Tennessee 1861-1865, New York, Knopf, 2005, p494 Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, concerned that his exposed troops might be cut off, ordered his forces which included Burke's advanced brigade, back to Snake Creek Gap.Woodworth, Steven E., Nothing Short of Victory: The Army of the Tennessee 1861-1865, New York, Knopf, 2005, p495 Sherman, learning that Snake Creek Gap was open, pulled the majority of his forces out the fight at Rocky Face Ridge, and swung around to approach Resaca through Snake Creek. Johnston reacted by pulling back to the fortified lines at Resaca. McPherson ordered Brigadier General Thomas Sweeny's division to move south, and forced a crossing of the Oostanaula River at Lay's Ferry. Sweeny sent Burke forward, and on May 14 he crossed the river using elements of the 66th Illinois and the 81st Ohio. However, Sweeny received erroneous reports that made him think that a Confederate counterattack might cut off his division and he recalled Burke's Brigade. The next day, Sweeny's Division recrossed the Oostanaula, against significantly heavier resistance, but pushed forward and created a fortified bridgehead. When Johnston learned that Sweeny was across the Oostanaula, and in position to threaten the Confederate line of communication, he ordered his forces to evacuate Rasaca, and retreat south. Burke's last battle and death XVI Corps commander Maj. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge ordered Sweeny to push forward in an attempt to strike at Johnston's army as it retreated. Sweeny's Division represented the furthest extension of Sherman's army. Burke was ordered to push forward toward Rome-Calhoun Road and the Sugar Valley- Adairsville Road, near Calhoun, Georgia. Burke's forward-most unit was Company G, 66th Illinois, under the command of Captain George Taylor.Formerly the 3rd Independent Company of Ohio Volunteer Sharpshooters. Taylor advanced his men beyond the crossroads, triggering a counterattack led by the 24th Georgia Infantry and the 1st Battalion Georgia Sharpshooters, resulting in the Battle of Rome Cross Roads.Brown, Russel K., Our Connection With Savannah: A History of the 1st Battalion Georgia Sharpshooters, Macon, Georgia, Mercer University Press, 2004 The Georgians overwhelmed Taylor's men and threatened to punch through the attenuated Federal skirmish line. Burke hurried the rest of the 66th Illinois and 81st Ohio forward to blunt the Confederate attack. As he was organizing the defense, Burke was struck in the left leg by a bullet which shattered the bone. Burke turned over command of the brigade to Lieutenant Colonel Robert N. Adams, commander of the 81st Ohio and withdrew from the battlefield. Patrick Burke's left leg was amputated below the knee, but gangrene set in and he died four days later on May 20 in an ambulance at Resaca. Burke was buried on June 5, 1864 in his family plot at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.

About the Euler Society The Euler Society was founded in 2001. The mission of the Euler Society is to encourage academic contributions that study the life, work, and influence of Leonhard Euler. Along with examining Euler, the Euler Society also explores current mathematical topics that build upon his work. In addition, the society engages in the study of the Enlightenment, which was an intellectual movement of 18th century Europe. These mathematical topics include applications to mechanics, astronomy, and technology.\\"http://mathforum.org/library/view/71505.html\\" The Executive Board The society contains the normal board positions of president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. These executive board members uphold the usual duties of their stations. Two additional titles are included in the society: chancellor and ombudsman. The chancellor is the head administrator of the society while the ombudsman is in charge of scheduling travel and handling legal matters.\\"http://faculty.washington.edu/etou/eulersoc/documents/OrgPaper.pdf\\" Activities  The committee holds annual conferences. The first conference was held in 2002 in Rumford, Maine. Since the first meeting the Euler Society has held their conferences in different areas of the Northeast and Midwest United States. Since 2012 the Euler Society has alternated hosting the conferences with the MAA MathFest in odd numbered years and independently in even numbered years. The conferences that they do independently often are held in late July and are for all levels of mathematicians. Usually these conferences have an average of attendees between 20 and 30 people. The subjects addressed are not limited to just Euler‚Äôs life and works. The topics include mathematical topics Euler‚Äôs colleagues and contemporaries worked on, the academic and political life in the 18th century and historical trends that influence the sciences and mathematics during that time. The people who present at these independent conferences have a choice to give a 20 or 50 presentation. The presentation is followed by 5‚Äì10 minutes for questioning. The conferences that are done with the MAA Fest give an opportunity for scholars to present their current and past work to people who have similar interests. These conferences are often held in early August. Both the independent and joint conferences give people the opportunity to read original sources such as Euler‚Äôs work in Latin or French, the most common original languages the works are written in. People are also able to see the early development of many mathematical and scientific ideas. The past meetings have been held in Washington, D.C. in 2015, Austin, TX in 2014, Hartford, CT in 2013, Garden City, NY in 2012, and Kenosha, WI in 2011. Opusculum is the newsletter for the Euler Society; it is accessible for free on their website. They also inspired and assisted with the creation of an online database, the Euler Archive, of all of Euler's works. Membership In order to join and become and full member of the society one must fill out a membership application and submit an application fee. Other payments to the society are voluntary, but the society encourages the donations. Honorary members can be added; this is at the discretion of the executive board.http://faculty.washington.edu/etou/eulersoc/index.html References  External links   Opusculum Mathematical societies Learned societies of the United States ","title":"Euler Society"},{"id":"30025666","text":"Bayla District (Bandar Beyla District) is a district in the northeastern Bari region of Somalia.

It is located about 36 kilometers northeast of the capital city of Mogadishu. The district is an area of 4,400 square kilometres (1,700 sq miles) with an estimated population of 642,000 and 82 villages. The district passes one of the Somalia's permanent rivers (Shabelle) which passes through the city of Bal-ad, nevertheless neighbours the Indian Ocean and has a long coast of about 70 km. The district is famous for agriculture, livestock and marine resources. Nature Reserve Bal'ad has one of the many nature reserves of the country which is located on the eastern bank of the Shabelle River, immediately south of the town. It has been established by the Somali Ecological Society in 1985, at which that time covered an area of 42 ha and later extended to 190 ha in 1987. The site consists of one of the few patches of riverine forest remaining on the Shabelle River and the surrounding scrub savannah. The principal trees of the riverine forest include Acacia elatior, Ficus sycamorus, Garcinia livingstonei, Mimusops fruticosa and Tamarindus indica, while the surrounding scrub consists of more stunted Acacia nilotica with a dense undergrowth of herbs and tall grasses. The reserve included a field-centre which, from 1985 to 1990, burning, cutting and grazing within the site was controlled and there were some signs of recovery of the forest and an increase in wildlife populations. Ports The natural ports of Ceel Macaan and Ceel Cadde which located in the district were the main gates for the incoming and out going goods of Somalia, likewise Cisiley airport during the decade and half, when Mogadishu air and seaport were closed. Industry The Somalitex factory, whose 154 automated looms work 14 hours a day, turning out nearly 14 million meters (about 15 million yards) of cloth annually the Factory employed three thousand workers. The Somalitex futas vary in thickness, colour, and design and most shops in the marketplace stock them as well as the imported polyesters. The latter, although impractical in the tropical heat, easily torn and expensive, seem to have captured the taste of Somali women by their bright patterns and varied textures. Given the ideal climate for cotton plantation in Balcad, The state-owned textile plants at Balcad could supply the local market (now not operating). Textiles are produced at the SOMALTEX plant in Balcad which supplies virtually the entire domestic market. Balcad Textile Factory was later upgraded and funded by West Germany. SOMALITEX facilities were greatly expanded. It is considered among the best equipped textile plant in Africa. The investment in cotton showed fewer long-term results than the investment in bananas. The Administration of Balcad District of the Middle Shabelle Region supported by the Somali Federal Government encourage the local and foreign investment in the Region.
