The baffled tube holds 14 oz. of mercury, which raises the length of time that the shot's impulse is spread across, thus lowering felt recoil. * Chamber Empty button: on the forend, allows unloading of unfired shell without releasing additional shells from the magazine. Recoil reducer Recoil without the internal reducer is very harsh using the 3.5 inch shells. The shotgun is very light due to its composite/steel construction. This light weight shotgun lends itself to heavy recoil using heavy loads with high velocities. The recoil reducer helps reduce the felt recoil and allows the shooter to obtain a faster second shot. The recoil reducer consists of two elements; the apparatus that connects to the stock via the buttstock compartment, and the mercury element that is inserted into the recoil apparatus. This unit is available as a kit for installation in regular Nova shotguns as well.

Design Lake Park was designed in the late 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed Central Park in New York City along with many others. Believing that access to nature had a civilizing and restorative effect on the urban public, Olmsted designed Lake Park in the Romantic tradition, with a preference for natural (over formal) landscaping, winding paths, a variety of vistas, incorporation of wildlife, and a balance between active recreation and more passive enjoyment. With Description Lake Park in 1890. Historic North Point Lighthouse at horizon. Covering on the shore of Lake Michigan, the park is part of a mostly contiguous stretch of lakefront amenities that extend north from Milwaukee's downtown, including Bradford Beach, various parks, McKinley Marina, and the Milwaukee Art Museum. The park terrain includes both bluffs and ravines. In addition, Lake Park is home to the last remaining Indian mound in the city of Milwaukee. The others were destroyed by early settlers of the city and surrounding area. It also contains the North Point Lighthouse, which was built in 1855. A 6-hole golf course was built in 1903, expanding to 18 holes in 1930. History In July 2016, Lake Park became a popular location for Pok√©- Stops in the game Pok√©mon Go. In August 2016, the Milwaukee County Parks Department asked Niantic to remove the game stops until a permit was received, in compliance with a county ordinance.

Sherman broadcast as a business commentator on KYW News Radio for more than 25 years until his retirement in January 2009 due to budget cuts at the station. He was known to radio and television audiences for his trademark sign-off, \\"I'm Fred Sherrrrrman.\\" Sherman was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents, Nathan and Eva (n√©e Josephthal) Sherman. His father owned a candy store, while his mother was a teacher. He graduated from Washington Heights High School in the Manhattan and took courses at New York University, but did not earn a degree from NYU. He would later enroll at Temple University. Sherman enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, and served in the 82d Airborne Army Rangers. Sherman flew missions over Nazi-occupied France before and after the 1944 D-Day Invasion. Sherman considered becoming a journalist following World War II, but began working at his father-in-law's furniture business instead. He left the furniture business when he was 60 years old and obtained his stockbroker's license the same year. He eventually became the chief economist for both Sovereign Bank and Royal Bank America, which is based in Narberth, Pennsylvania. Sherman became involved with radio as a business commentator during the 1980s. Sherman contacted Don Lancer, the business and financial editor of KYW 1060 radio, noting that the station's coverage of financial news was dull. Sherman told Lancer that he could make KYW's coverage more lively and entertaining. Sherman was hired by Lancer after an audition. He used humor, irreverence and wit to reach his audiences. Sherman was known for his trademark, elongated sign-off, \\"I'm Fred Sherrrrrman\\", at the end of his commentaries. He began saying his name that way after hearing another reporter use the same speaking style. The sign-off, which earned Sherman both praise and criticism, made Sherman into a local celebrity in the Philadelphia region. Sherman remained as a business commentator at KYW for twenty-five years, until KYW cut his commentaries in January 2009, citing financial constraints. Sherman also appeared on The Money Show on WPEN and contributed weekly television business segments to the Sunday morning news on WCAU NBC 10. Fred Sherman, a resident of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, died on September 12, 2009, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia at the age of 85. Sherman had suffered from several health problems, including kidney ailments, and injuries from a car accident several weeks before his death may have contributed to his declining health. He suffered the car accident shortly after returning from a trip to Europe in July 2009, and had been hospitalized on several occasions since the accident. Sherman was survived by his longtime fiancee, Diane Williams. The couple had met 17 years prior to his death when Williams approached Sherman for financial advice at one of his speeches. He was also survived by his son, David Sherman. Another of his sons, Henry Sherman, died in 2000.

He began his service in the Habsburg army as a Grenz infantry officer and fought against the Ottoman Turks. During the French Revolutionary Wars he received promotion to the rank of general officer and won an outstanding victory at Feldkirch. His later career proved that his martial abilities were limited. He twice led independent division-sized forces in the Napoleonic Wars, with unhappy results. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment from 1802 until his death.

Misinterpreting his orders as requiring him to hold his isolated position, he stayed in place until 19 May. When Jelaƒçiƒá finally realized his danger and withdrew toward Graz, it was too late. Believing his artillery to be of little use in the mountains, he sent most of it ahead of his column, retaining only four cannons. On 25 May, Paul Grenier's 12,000 to 15,000 strong Franco-Italian corps caught up with his division at the Battle of Sankt Michael near Leoben on 25 May. Without sufficient artillery and cavalry support, Jelaƒçiƒá's 9,000 troops were overwhelmed, suffering 423 dead, 1,137 wounded, and 4,963 captured.

With help from the army reserve, his soldiers drove off the first Franco-Italian attack, but the action ended in an Austrian defeat.Bowden & Tarbox, p 122-123 He commanded his division at the Battle of Wagram but John's army arrived too late on the field to have any effect on the outcome.Bowden & Tarbox, p 168 He died on 4 February 1810 at Zalaap√°ti in modern-day Hungary.

Cherenkov radiation (; Russian: –ß–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ–≤) is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity (speed of propagation of a wave in a medium) of light in that medium. Special relativity is not violated since light travels slower in materials with refractive index greater than one, and it is the speed of light in a vacuum which cannot be reached (or exceeded) by particles with mass. A classic example of Cherenkov radiation is the characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor. Its cause is similar to the cause of a sonic boom, the sharp sound heard when faster-than- sound movement occurs. The phenomenon is named for Soviet physicist Pavel Cherenkov, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics for its discovery.  History  The radiation is named after the Soviet scientist Pavel Cherenkov, the 1958 Nobel Prize winner, who was the first to detect it experimentally under the supervision of Sergey Vavilov at the Lebedev Institute in 1934. Therefore, it is also known as Vavilov‚ÄìCherenkov radiation. Reprinted in Selected Papers of Soviet Physicists, Usp. Fiz. Nauk 93 (1967) 385.

(ref ) Cherenkov saw a faint bluish light around a radioactive preparation in water during experiments. His doctorate thesis was on luminescence of uranium salt solutions that were excited by gamma rays instead of less energetic visible light, as done commonly. He discovered the anisotropy of the radiation and came to the conclusion that the bluish glow was not a fluorescent phenomenon. A theory of this effect was later developed in 1937 within the framework of Einstein's special relativity theory by Cherenkov's colleagues Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank, who also shared the 1958 Nobel Prize. Cherenkov radiation as conical wave front had been theoretically predicted by the English polymath Oliver Heaviside in papers published between 1888 and 1889 and by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1904, but both had been quickly forgotten following the relativity theory's restriction of super-c particles until the 1970s. Marie Curie observed a pale blue light in a highly concentrated radium solution in 1910, but did not investigate its source. In 1926, the French radiotherapist Lucien Mallet described the luminous radiation of radium irradiating water having a continuous spectrum. In 2019, a team of researchers from Dartmouth‚Äôs and Dartmouth-Hitchcock's Norris Cotton Cancer Center discovered Cherenkov light being generated in the vitreous humor of patients undergoing radiotherapy. The light was observed using a camera imaging system called a CDose, which is specially designed to view light emissions from biological systems. For decades, patients had reported phenomena such as ‚Äúflashes of bright or blue light‚Äù when receiving radiation treatments for brain cancer, but the effects had never been experimentally observed. Physical origin  Basics  While the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant (), the speed in a material may be significantly less, as it is perceived to be slowed by the medium. For example, in water it is only 0.75c. Matter can accelerate beyond this speed (although still less than c, the speed of light in vacuum) during nuclear reactions and in particle accelerators. Cherenkov radiation results when a charged particle, most commonly an electron, travels through a dielectric (can be polarized electrically) medium with a speed greater than light's speed in that medium. Animation of Cherenkov radiation A common analogy is the sonic boom of a supersonic aircraft. The sound waves generated by the aircraft travel at the speed of sound, which is slower than the aircraft, and cannot propagate forward from the aircraft, instead forming a shock front. In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light shock wave as it travels through an insulator. The velocity that must be exceeded is the phase velocity of light rather than the group velocity of light. The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by using a periodic medium, and in that case one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with no minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the Smith‚ÄìPurcell effect. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (see below) whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity. Cherenkov radiation in the Reed Research Reactor. In their original work on the theoretical foundations of Cherenkov radiation, Tamm and Frank wrote,\\"This peculiar radiation can evidently not be explained by any common mechanism such as the interaction of the fast electron with individual atom or as radiative scattering of electrons on atomic nuclei. On the other hand, the phenomenon can be explained both qualitatively and quantitatively if one takes into account the fact that an electron moving in a medium does radiate light even if it is moving uniformly provided that its velocity is greater than the velocity of light in the medium.\\".  Emission angle  The geometry of the Cherenkov radiation shown for the ideal case of no dispersion. In the figure on the geometry, the particle (red arrow) travels in a medium with speed v_\\\\text{p} such that :c/n < v_\\\\text{p} < c, where c is speed of light in vacuum, and n is the refractive index of the medium. If the medium is water, the condition is 0.75c < v_\\\\text{p} < c, since n=1.33 for water at 20 ¬∞C. We define the ratio between the speed of the particle and the speed of light as : \\\\beta=v_\\\\text{p}/c. The emitted light waves (denoted by blue arrows) travel at speed : v_\\\\text{em}=c/n. The left corner of the triangle represents the location of the superluminal particle at some initial moment (t = 0). The right corner of the triangle is the location of the particle at some later time t. In the given time t, the particle travels the distance :x_\\\\text{p}=v_\\\\text{p}t=\\\\beta\\\\,ct whereas the emitted electromagnetic waves are constricted to travel the distance :x_\\\\text{em}=v_\\\\text{em}t=\\\\frac{c}{n}t. So the emission angle results in :\\\\cos\\\\theta=\\\\frac1{n\\\\beta} Arbitrary emission angle Cherenkov radiation can also radiate in an arbitrary direction using properly engineered one dimensional metamaterials. The latter is designed to introduce a gradient of phase retardation along the trajectory of the fast travelling particle ( d\\\\phi/dx ), reversing or steering Cherenkov emission at arbitrary angles given by the generalized relation: :\\\\cos\\\\theta=\\\\frac1{n\\\\beta} +\\\\frac {n}{k_0} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {d\\\\phi} {dx} Note that since this ratio is independent of time, one can take arbitrary times and achieve similar triangles. The angle stays the same, meaning that subsequent waves generated between the initial time t=0 and final time t will form similar triangles with coinciding right endpoints to the one shown. Reverse Cherenkov effect A reverse Cherenkov effect can be experienced using materials called negative-index metamaterials (materials with a subwavelength microstructure that gives them an effective \\"average\\" property very different from their constituent materials, in this case having negative permittivity and negative permeability). This means that, when a charged particle (usually electrons) passes through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium, that particle emits trailing radiation from its progress through the medium rather than in front of it (as is the case in normal materials with, both permittivity and permeability positive). One can also obtain such reverse-cone Cherenkov radiation in non-metamaterial periodic media where the periodic structure is on the same scale as the wavelength, so it cannot be treated as an effectively homogeneous metamaterial. In a vacuum The Cherenkov effect can occur in vacuum. In a slow-wave structure, like in a TWT (Traveling Wave Tube), the phase velocity decreases and the velocity of charged particles can exceed the phase velocity while remaining lower than c. In such a system, this effect can be derived from conservation of the energy and momentum where the momentum of a photon should be p=\\\\hbar\\\\beta ( \\\\beta is phase constant) rather than the de Broglie relation p=\\\\hbar k. This type of radiation (VCR) is used to generate high-power microwaves. Characteristics The frequency spectrum of Cherenkov radiation by a particle is given by the Frank‚ÄìTamm formula: :\\\\frac{d^2E}{dx \\\\, d\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{q^2}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\mu(\\\\omega) \\\\omega {\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{c^2} {v^2 n^2(\\\\omega)}\\\\right)} The Frank‚ÄìTamm formula describes the amount of energy E emitted from Cherenkov radiation, per unit length traveled x and per frequency \\\\omega. \\\\mu(\\\\omega) is the permeability and n(\\\\omega) is the index of refraction of the material the charge particle moves through. q is the electric charge of the particle, v is the speed of the particle, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. Unlike fluorescence or emission spectra that have characteristic spectral peaks, Cherenkov radiation is continuous. Around the visible spectrum, the relative intensity per unit frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum‚Äîit is only with sufficiently accelerated charges that it even becomes visible; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum. There is a cut-off frequency above which the equation \\\\cos\\\\theta=1/(n\\\\beta) can no longer be satisfied. The refractive index n varies with frequency (and hence with wavelength) in such a way that the intensity cannot continue to increase at ever shorter wavelengths, even for very relativistic particles (where v/c is close to 1). At X-ray frequencies, the refractive index becomes less than 1 (note that in media, the phase velocity may exceed c without violating relativity) and hence no X-ray emission (or shorter wavelength emissions such as gamma rays) would be observed. However, X-rays can be generated at special frequencies just below the frequencies corresponding to core electronic transitions in a material, as the index of refraction is often greater than 1 just below a resonant frequency (see Kramers-Kronig relation and anomalous dispersion). As in sonic booms and bow shocks, the angle of the shock cone is directly related to the velocity of the disruption. The Cherenkov angle is zero at the threshold velocity for the emission of Cherenkov radiation. The angle takes on a maximum as the particle speed approaches the speed of light. Hence, observed angles of incidence can be used to compute the direction and speed of a Cherenkov radiation-producing charge. Cherenkov radiation can be generated in the eye by charged particles hitting the vitreous humour, giving the impression of flashes, as in cosmic ray visual phenomena and possibly some observations of criticality accidents. Uses Detection of labelled biomolecules Cherenkov radiation is widely used to facilitate the detection of small amounts and low concentrations of biomolecules. Radioactive atoms such as phosphorus-32 are readily introduced into biomolecules by enzymatic and synthetic means and subsequently may be easily detected in small quantities for the purpose of elucidating biological pathways and in characterizing the interaction of biological molecules such as affinity constants and dissociation rates. Medical imaging of radioisotopes and external beam radiotherapy Cherenkov light emission imaged from the chest wall of a patient undergoing whole breast irradiation, using 6 MeV beam from a linear accelerator in radiotherapy. More recently, Cherenkov light has been used to image substances in the body. These discoveries have led to intense interest around the idea of using this light signal to quantify and/or detect radiation in the body, either from internal sources such as injected radiopharmaceuticals or from external beam radiotherapy in oncology. Radioisotopes such as the positron emitters 18F and 13N or beta emitters 32P or 90Y have measurable Cherenkov emission and isotopes 18F and 131I have been imaged in humans for diagnostic value demonstration. External beam radiation therapy has been shown to induce a substantial amount of Cherenkov light in the tissue being treated, due to the photon beam energy levels used in the 6 MeV to 18 MeV ranges. The secondary electrons induced by these high energy x-rays result in the Cherenkov light emission, where the detected signal can be imaged at the entry and exit surfaces of the tissue. Nuclear reactors Cherenkov radiation in a TRIGA reactor pool. Cherenkov radiation is used to detect high-energy charged particles. In open pool reactors, beta particles (high-energy electrons) are released as the fission products decay. The glow continues after the chain reaction stops, dimming as the shorter-lived products decay. Similarly, Cherenkov radiation can characterize the remaining radioactivity of spent fuel rods. This phenomenon is used to verify the presence of spent nuclear fuel in spent fuel pools for nuclear safeguards purposes. Astrophysics experiments When a high-energy (TeV) gamma photon or cosmic ray interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, it may produce an electron-positron pair with enormous velocities. The Cherenkov radiation emitted in the atmosphere by these charged particles is used to determine the direction and energy of the cosmic ray or gamma ray, which is used for example in the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT), by experiments such as VERITAS, H.E.S.S., MAGIC. Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive Air Shower experiment HAWC, the Pierre Auger Observatory and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large neutrino detectors, such as the Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and IceCube. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as STACEE, a former solar tower refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in New Mexico. Astrophysics observatories using the Cherenkov technique to measure air showers are key to determine the properties of astronomical objects that emit Very High Energy gamma rays, such as supernova remnants and blazars. Particle physics experiments Cherenkov radiation is commonly used in experimental particle physics for particle identification. One could measure (or put limits on) the velocity of an electrically charged elementary particle by the properties of the Cherenkov light it emits in a certain medium. If the momentum of the particle is measured independently, one could compute the mass of the particle by its momentum and velocity (see four-momentum), and hence identify the particle. The simplest type of particle identification device based on a Cherenkov radiation technique is the threshold counter, which answers whether the velocity of a charged particle is lower or higher than a certain value (v_0=c/n, where c is the speed of light, and n is the refractive index of the medium) by looking at whether this particle emits Cherenkov light in a certain medium. Knowing particle momentum, one can separate particles lighter than a certain threshold from those heavier than the threshold. The most advanced type of a detector is the RICH, or Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, developed in the 1980s. In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high-speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, whose radius is a measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators‚Äîi.e. gases‚Äîdue to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance‚Äîthe proximity gap‚Äîand is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light whose radius is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID),The High Momentum Particle Identification Detector at CERN a detector currently under construction for ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the six experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.

It occurred about northwest of Mesilla, in Cookes Canyon. The exact date of the battle is unknown. The battle occurred in the larger context of both the Apache Wars and the American Civil War. Background In early August, a group of Arizonan refugees, from the Tubac area, abandoned their village due to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Fort Buchanan and the Siege of Tubac which left their homes burned. The bunch was known as the Ake Party, and their destination was the Rio Grande near Mesilla. The wagon train consisted of six double wagons, two buggies, and one single wagon when it reached Tucson from the surrounding region. At Tucson, several other people joined the procession, which including Moses Carson, the half-brother of the famous scout and soldier, Kit Carson. The party was now composed of twenty-four men, sixteen women, seven children, along with 400 head of cattle and 900 head of sheep, as well as horses and goats. The settlers, who were mostly miners and ranchers, left Tucson around August 15, 1861. The large number of livestock would present an irresistible temptation to the Chiricahua Apache warriors under Cochise and Mangas Coloradas. The journey was uneventful until the party crossed the Mimbres River and made for the springs at Cooke's Canyon within Traditional Arizona and the present day New Mexico. Battle It is unknown whether or not Cochise and Mangas Coloradas were leading the Apache warriors. Most likely they were, as the commanders of the combined Apache force that operated primarily in present-day southwestern New Mexico where Cooke's Canyon is located. When the last wagon had entered the canyon, the Apaches, estimated to number about 100, sprang their ambush by attacking and scattering the large group of livestock. They then charged the wagons, and were stopped from reaching them after a series of mounted countercharges by several men of the party. The wagons were maneuvered into a circle and the settlers withstood a siege that lasted the remainder of the day. Eventually the Apaches took to the surrounding slopes, firing both arrows and bullets at long range. The settlers responded from their wagon positions, killing several of the attackers who approached them on horseback and foot. Finally, toward the end of the day the Apaches retreated, taking their plunder of 400 cattle and 900 sheep with them. The settlers withdrew to the Mimbres. They had suffered a loss of four men killed and eight wounded. The last wagon in the party, carrying most of the women and children, had turned about after the first shots were fired and fled back toward the Mimbres River. Unmolested by the Apaches, this wagon reached the settlement on the Mimbres safely and sent a plea for help to Pinos Altos, where the Arizona Guards were stationed. The Confederate troops responded to the report, leading to the Battle of the Florida Mountains two days later. Other attacks During the summer of 1861, the Apache warriors of Mangas Coloradas and Cochise massacred several other groups of settlers at Cookes Canyon. Apache warriors killed and mutilated a party of seven near the east end of the canyon. Near the same location, they massacred and mutilated nine Mexican herdsmen and stole their forty head of cattle. Three whites of the same party were taken prisoner, tortured and killed later on. Fourteen American settlers were murdered on either July 25 or 26, 1861 and discovered by the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, soon after. Again, near that same location they attempted to destroy the Ake Party. Over the months, Apache warriors left what one chronicler called \\"many bones, skulls, & graves\\" in Cookes Canyon. Eventually, the Apaches killed as many as 100 Americans and Mexicans in Cookes Canyon, making it the most feared passage on the trail from Mesilla to Tucson. According to historian Dan Thrapp, 150 whites were killed within sixty days during this period. Around the same time, the Mexican governor of Sonora estimated that 500 to 600 of his people were killed by the Apache on their side of the border.

Wolf 1922, p. 16. Compare Ludwig's remark to Anton Niggl on 11/12 June 1886 about being born and going to die at 12.30 (Hacker 1966, p. 363 quoting Gerold 1914, pp. 91‚Äì3) was King of Bavaria from 1864 until his death in 1886. He is sometimes called the Swan King or ' (\\"the Fairy Tale King\\"). He also held the titles of Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, and Duke in Swabia.Adre√übuch von M√ºnchen 1876, p. 1. Ludwig succeeded to the throne in 1864, aged 18. Two years later, Bavaria and Austria fought a war against Prussia lasting only a matter of weeks, which they lost. However, in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Bavaria sided with Prussia against France, and after the Prussian victory, it became part of the new German Empire led by Prussia. Though Bavaria retained a degree of autonomy on some matters within the new German Reich, Ludwig increasingly withdrew from day-to-day affairs of state in favour of extravagant artistic and architectural projects. He commissioned the construction of two lavish palaces and Neuschwanstein Castle, and he was a devoted patron of the composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig spent all his royal revenues (although not state funds as is commonly thought) on these projects, borrowed extensively, and defied all attempts by his ministers to restrain him. This extravagance was used against him to declare him insane, an accusation that has since come under scrutiny. Today, his architectural and artistic legacy includes many of Bavaria's most important tourist attractions.  Early life Otto in 1860|alt=|300x300px Born at Nymphenburg Palace (today located in suburban Munich), he was the elder son of Maximilian II of Bavaria and Marie of Prussia, Crown Prince and Princess of Bavaria, who became King and Queen in 1848 after the abdication of the former's father, Ludwig I, during the German Revolution. His parents intended to name him Otto, but his grandfather insisted that his grandson be named after him, since their common birthday, 25 August, is the feast day of Saint Louis IX of France, patron saint of Bavaria (with \\"Ludwig\\" being the German form of \\"Louis\\"). His younger brother, born three years later, was named Otto. Like many young heirs in an age when kings governed most of Europe, Ludwig was continually reminded of his royal status. King Maximilian wanted to instruct both of his sons in the burdens of royal duty from an early age. Ludwig was both extremely indulged and severely controlled by his tutors and subjected to a strict regimen of study and exercise. Some point to these stresses of growing up in a royal family as the causes for much of his odd behavior as an adult. Crown Prince Ludwig (left) With his mother Queen Maria (in the center) and his younger brother Otto (on the right) in 1860: Otto will become King after the death of his older brother in 1886, although he will not be able to rule properly as King of Bavaria. The photo was taken privately as a photo for family albums, as was in vogue among many nobles at the time, and was obviously not published at the time. Ludwig was not close to either of his parents. King Maximilian's advisers had suggested that on his daily walks he might like, at times, to be accompanied by his future successor. The King replied, \\"But what am I to say to him? After all, my son takes no interest in what other people tell him.\\" Later, Ludwig would refer to his mother as \\"my predecessor's consort\\". He was far closer to his grandfather, the deposed and notorious King Ludwig I. Ludwig's childhood years did have happy moments. He lived for much of the time at Castle Hohenschwangau, a fantasy castle his father had built near the Alpsee (Alp Lake) near F√ºssen. It was decorated in the Gothic Revival style with many frescoes depicting heroic German sagas. The family also visited Lake Starnberg. As an adolescent, Ludwig became close friends with his aide de camp, Prince Paul, a member of the wealthy Bavarian Thurn und Taxis family. The two young men rode together, read poetry aloud, and staged scenes from the Romantic operas of Richard Wagner. The friendship ended when Paul became engaged in 1866 with a commoner. During his youth, Ludwig also initiated a lifelong friendship with his cousin Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, later Empress of Austria.  Early reign  Ludwig II just after his accession to the throne of Bavaria in 1864 Ludwig II's coronation portrait, 1865 Crown Prince Ludwig was in his 19th year when his father died after a three-day illness, and he ascended the Bavarian throne. Although he was not prepared for high office, his youth and brooding good looks made him popular in Bavaria and elsewhere. He continued the state policies of his father and retained his ministers. His real interests were in art, music, and architecture. One of the first acts of his reign, a few months after his accession, was to summon Wagner to his court. Also in 1864, he laid the foundation stone of a new Court Theatre, now the Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz (G√§rtnerplatz-Theater). Ludwig was notably eccentric in ways that made serving as Bavaria's head of state problematic. He disliked large public functions and avoided formal social events whenever possible, preferring a life of seclusion that he pursued with various creative projects. He last inspected a military parade on 22 August 1875 and last gave a court banquet on 10 February 1876. His mother had foreseen difficulties for Ludwig when she recorded her concern for her extremely introverted and creative son who spent much time day-dreaming. These idiosyncrasies, combined with the fact that Ludwig avoided Munich and participating in the government there at all costs, caused considerable tension with the king's government ministers, but did not cost him popularity among the citizens of Bavaria. The king enjoyed traveling in the Bavarian countryside and chatting with farmers and labourers he met along the way. He also delighted in rewarding those who were hospitable to him during his travels with lavish gifts. He is still remembered in Bavaria as Unser Kini (\\"our cherished king\\" in the Bavarian dialect).  Austro-Prussian and Franco- Prussian Wars  Unification with Prussia took center stage from 1866. In the Austro-Prussian War, which began in August, Ludwig supported Austria against Prussia. Austria and Bavaria were defeated, and Bavaria was forced to sign a mutual defense treaty with Prussia. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, Bavaria was required to fight alongside Prussia. After the Prussian victory over France, Bismarck moved to complete the Unification of Germany. In November 1870, Bavaria joined the North German Confederation, thus losing its status as an independent kingdom. However, the Bavarian delegation under Minister-President Count Otto von Bray-Steinburg secured privilleged status for Bavaria within the empire (Reservatrechte). Bavaria retained its own diplomatic corps and its own army, which would come under Prussian command only in times of war. In December 1870, Bismarck used financial concessions to induce Ludwig with the support of the king's equerry Maximilian Count von Holnstein to write the so-called Kaiserbrief, a letter endorsing the creation of the German Empire with King Wilhelm I of Prussia as Emperor. Nevertheless, Ludwig regretted Bavaria's loss of independence and refused to attend Wilhelm's 18 January proclamation as German Emperor in the Palace of Versailles. Ludwig's brother Prince Otto and his uncle Luitpold went, instead.Toeche-Mittler, Dr. Theodor. Die Kaiserproklamation in Versailles am 18. Januar 1871 mit einem Verzeichni√ü der Festtheilnehmer, Ernst Siegfried Mittler und Sohn, Berlin, 1896Schnaebeli, H. Fotoaufnahmen der Kaiserproklamation in Versailles, Berlin, 1871 Otto criticized the celebration as ostentatious and heartless in a letter to his brother.  Engagement and sexual orientation  fianc√©e Duchess Sophie in Bavaria in 1867 The greatest stress of Ludwig's early reign was pressure to produce an heir. This issue came to the forefront in 1867. Ludwig became engaged to Duchess Sophie in Bavaria, his cousin and the youngest sister of his dear friend, Empress Elisabeth of Austria. They shared a deep interest in the works of Wagner. The engagement was announced on 22 January 1867; a few days earlier, Ludwig had written Sophie, \\"The main substance of our relationship has always been ‚Ä¶ Richard Wagner's remarkable and deeply moving destiny.\\" However, Ludwig repeatedly postponed the wedding date, and finally cancelled the engagement in October. After the engagement was broken off, Ludwig wrote to his former fianc√©e, \\"My beloved Elsa! Your cruel father has torn us apart. Eternally yours, Heinrich.\\" (The names Elsa and Heinrich came from characters in Wagner's opera Lohengrin.) Sophie later married Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Alen√ßon, grandson of French King Louis Philippe I, at Possenhofen Castle at which Ludwig II unexpectedly attended the reception. Ludwig never married nor had any known mistresses. It is known from his diary (which began in the 1860s), private letters, and other surviving personal documents that he had strong homosexual desires.McIntosh, 1982, pp. 153‚Äì159. He struggled all his life to suppress those desires and remain true to the teachings of the Catholic Church.McIntosh, 1982, pp. 155‚Äì158. Homosexuality had not been punishable in Bavaria since 1813,Till 2010, p. 48 but the Unification of Germany in 1871 instated Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexual acts between males under Prussian hegemony. In intensely Catholic and socially conservative 19th-century Bavaria, the scandal of a homosexual monarch would have been intolerable. Throughout his reign, Ludwig had a succession of close friendships with men, including his chief equerry and master of the horse, Richard Hornig (1841‚Äì1911),Richard Hornig, Master of the Horse to King Ludwig II of Bavaria https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/513903007450603975/ the Bavarian prince Paul von Thurn und Taxis,Gay & Bisexual Men of Importance, the Love Affair of King Ludwig II of Bavaria and Paul von Thurn and Taxis, a Bavarian princehttp://gayinfluence.blogspot.com/2014_03_01_archive.html the Hungarian theater actor Josef Kainz, and his courtier Alfons Weber (b. 1862). Ludwig's original diaries from 1869 onward were lost during World War II, and all that remain today are copies of entries made during the 1886 plot to depose him. Some earlier diaries have survived in the Geheimes Hausarchiv (\\"secret archives\\") in Munich, and extracts starting in 1858 were published by Evers in 1986.Evers, Hans Gerhard. Ludwig II. von Bayern. Theaterf√ºrst-K√∂nig-Bauherr (Munich, 1986)  Patron  After 1871, Ludwig largely withdrew from politics, and devoted himself to his personal creative projects, most famously his castles, for which he personally approved every detail of the architecture, decoration, and furnishing.  Ludwig and Wagner  Bust of Ludwig II in front of Wahnfried Ludwig was intensely interested in the operas of Richard Wagner. This interest began when Ludwig first saw Lohengrin at the impressionable age of 15, followed by Tannh√§user ten months later. Wagner's operas appealed to the king's fantasy-filled imagination. Wagner had a notorious reputation as a political radical and philanderer, and was constantly on the run from creditors. However, on 4 May 1864, the 51-year-old Wagner was given an unprecedented 1¬æ hour audience with Ludwig in the Royal Palace in Munich; later, the composer wrote of his first meeting with Ludwig: \\"Alas, he is so handsome and wise, soulful and lovely, that I fear that his life must melt away in this vulgar world like a fleeting dream of the gods.\\" Ludwig was probably the savior of Wagner's career. Without Ludwig, Wagner's later operas are unlikely to have been composed, much less premiered at the prestigious Munich Royal Court Theatre (now the Bavarian State Opera). A year after meeting the King, Wagner presented his latest work, Tristan und Isolde, in Munich to great acclaim. However, the composer's perceived extravagant and scandalous behaviour in the capital was unsettling for the conservative people of Bavaria, and the King was forced to ask Wagner to leave the city six months later, in December 1865. Ludwig considered abdicating to follow Wagner, but Wagner persuaded him to stay. Ludwig provided the Tribschen residence for Wagner in Switzerland. Wagner completed Die Meistersinger there; it was premiered in Munich in 1868. When Wagner returned to his \\"Ring Cycle\\", Ludwig demanded \\"special previews\\" of the first two works (Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre) at Munich in 1869 and 1870.Millington, Barry (ed.) (2001), The Wagner Compendium: A Guide to Wagner's Life and Music (revised edition), London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. . pp 287, 290 Wagner, however, was now planning his great personal opera house at Bayreuth. Ludwig initially refused to support the grandiose project. However, when Wagner exhausted all other sources, he appealed to Ludwig, who loaned him 100,000 thalers to complete the work.Newman, Ernest. (1946). The Life of Richard Wagner Volume IV 1866‚Äì1883. Chapter XX: 'The King to the Rescue'. Cambridge University Press. . (United Kingdom).'History: The History of the Bayreuth Festival'. Bayreuth Festival. (Bayreuth, Germany). Ludwig also paid for the Wahnfried villa for Wagner and his family to reside in, constructed 1872‚Äì74. In 1876, Ludwig attended the dress rehearsal and third public performance of the complete Ring Cycle at the Festspielhaus.  Theater  Ludwig's interest in theater was by no means confined to Wagner. In 1867, he appointed Karl von Perfall as director of his new court theater. Ludwig wished to introduce Munich theater-goers to the best of European drama. Perfall, under Ludwig's supervision, introduced them to Shakespeare, Calder√≥n, Mozart, Gluck, Ibsen, Weber, and many others. He also raised the standard of interpretation of Schiller, Moli√®re, and Corneille.Rall, Petzet and Merta (2001) King Ludwig II Between 1872 and 1885, the King had 209 private performances (Separatvorstellungen) given for himself alone or with a guest, in the two court theaters, comprising 44 operas (28 by Wagner, including eight of Parsifal), 11 ballets, and 154 plays (the principal theme being Bourbon France) at a cost of 97,300 marks.See Hommel, Kurt. Die Separatvorstellungen vor K√∂nig Ludwig II. von Bayern (Munich, 1963) This was not due so much to misanthropy, but as the King complained to the theatre actor-manager Ernst Possart: \\"I can get no sense of illusion in the theatre so long as people keep staring at me, and follow my every expression through their opera-glasses. I want to look myself, not to be a spectacle for the masses.\\"  Castles  The coat of arms of King Ludwig over the entrance to Schloss Neuschwanstein Ludwig used his personal fortune (supplemented annually from 1873 by 270,000 marks from the Welfenfonds) to fund the construction of a series of elaborate castles. In 1867, he visited Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc's work at Pierrefonds, and the Palace of Versailles in France, as well as the Wartburg near Eisenach in Thuringia, which largely influenced the style of his construction. In his letters, Ludwig marvelled at how the French had magnificently built up and glorified their culture (e.g., architecture, art, and music) and how miserably lacking Bavaria was in comparison. His dream became to accomplish the same for Bavaria. These projects provided employment for many hundreds of local laborers and artisans and brought a considerable flow of money to the relatively poor regions where his castles were built. Figures for the total costs between 1869 and 1886 for the building and equipping of each castle were published in 1968: Schlo√ü Neuschwanstein 6,180,047 marks; Schlo√ü Linderhof 8,460,937 marks (a large portion being expended on the Venus Grotto); Schlo√ü Herrenchiemsee (from 1873) 16,579,674 marksPetzet Katalog 1968, p. 226. In order to give an equivalent for the era, the British Pound sterling, being the monetary hegemon of the time, had a fixed exchange rate (based on the gold standard) at ¬£1 = 20.43 Goldmarks. In 1868, Ludwig commissioned the first drawings for his buildings, starting with Neuschwanstein and Herrenchiemsee, though work on the latter did not commence until 1878.  Neuschwanstein  An 1890s photochrom print of Schloss Neuschwanstein Schloss Neuschwanstein (\\"New Swanstone Castle\\") is a dramatic Romanesque fortress with soaring fairy-tale towers. It is situated on an Alpine crag above Ludwig's childhood home, Castle Hohenschwangau (\\"Upper Swan County Palace\\"). Hohenschwangau was a medieval knights' castle that his parents had purchased. Ludwig reputedly had seen the location and conceived of building a castle there while still a boy. In 1869, Ludwig oversaw the laying of the cornerstone for Schloss Neuschwanstein on a breathtaking mountaintop site. The walls of Neuschwanstein are decorated with frescoes depicting scenes from the legends used in Wagner's operas, including Tannh√§user, Tristan und Isolde, Lohengrin, Parsifal, and the somewhat less than mystic Die Meistersinger.\\"The pictures in the new castle shall follow the sagas and not Wagner's interpretation of them.\\" Letter from footman Adalbert Welker to Court secretary Ludwig von B√ºrkel, 5 April 1879 (Petzet 1970, p. 138)  Linderhof  In 1878, construction was completed on Ludwig's Schloss Linderhof, an ornate palace in neo-French Rococo style, with handsome formal gardens. The grounds contained a Venus grotto lit by electricity, where Ludwig was rowed in a boat shaped like a shell. After seeing the Bayreuth performances, Ludwig built Hundingh√ºtte (\\"Hunding's Hut\\", based on the stage set of the first act of Wagner's Die Walk√ºre) in the forest near Linderhof, complete with an artificial tree and a sword embedded in it. (In Die Walk√ºre, Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree.) Hunding's Hut was destroyed in 1945, but a replica was constructed at Linderhof in 1990. In 1877, Ludwig had Einsiedlei des Gurnemanz (a small hermitage, as seen in the third act of Parsifal) erected near Hunding's Hut, with a meadow of spring flowers. The king would retire to read. (A replica made in 2000 can now be seen in the park at Linderhof.) Nearby a Moroccan House, purchased at the Paris World Fair in 1878, was erected alongside the mountain road. Sold in 1891 and taken to Oberammergau, it was purchased by the government in 1980 and re-erected in the park at Linderhof after extensive restoration. Inside the palace, iconography reflected Ludwig's fascination with the absolutist government of Ancien r√©gime France. Ludwig saw himself as the \\"Moon King\\", a romantic shadow of the earlier \\"Sun King\\", Louis XIV of France. From Linderhof, Ludwig enjoyed moonlit sleigh rides in an elaborate 18th-century sleigh, complete with footmen in 18th-century livery.  Herrenchiemsee  In 1878, construction began on Herrenchiemsee, a partial replica of the palace at Versailles, sited on the Herreninsel in the Chiemsee. It was built as Ludwig's tribute to Louis XIV of France, the magnificent \\"Sun King\\". Only the central portion of the palace was built; all construction halted on Ludwig's death. What exists of Herrenchiemsee comprises , a \\"copy in miniature\\" compared with Versailles' 551,112 ft¬≤.  Munich Residenz Palace royal apartment  The following year, Ludwig finished the construction of the royal apartment in the Residenz Palace in Munich, to which he had added an opulent conservatory or winter garden on the palace roof. It was started in 1867 as quite a small structure, but after extensions in 1868 and 1871, the dimensions reached 69.5 x 17.2 x 9.5 m. It featured an ornamental lake complete with skiff, a painted panorama of the Himalayas as a backdrop, an Indian fisher-hut of bamboo, a Moorish kiosk, and an exotic tent. The roof was a technically advanced metal and glass construction. The winter garden was closed in June 1886, partly dismantled the following year, and demolished in 1897.  Later projects  In the 1880s, Ludwig continued his elaborate schemes. He planned the construction of a new castle on Falkenstein (\\"Falcon Rock\\") near Pfronten in the Allg√§u (a place he knew well: a diary entry for 16 October 1867 reads \\"Falkenstein wild, romantic\\").Evers 1986, p. 228. The first design was a sketch by Christian Jank in 1883 \\"very much like the Townhall of Li√®ge\\".Kreisel 1954, p. 82. Subsequent designs showed a modest villa with a square towerDollmann 1884 and a small Gothic castle.Schultze 1884Hofmann 1886 By 1885, a road and water supply had been provided at Falkenstein but the old ruins remained untouched. Ludwig also proposed a Byzantine palace in the Graswangtal, and a Chinese summer palace by the Plansee in Tyrol. These projects never got beyond initial plans. For Berg Castle, Ludwig had a fifth tower constructed for it called \\"Isolde\\" and used the castle frequently as his summer residence. When Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia visited Berg in 1868, he had the castle magnificently decorated for the duration of her stay there; the castle otherwise, by his standards, was modestly furnished.  Controversy and struggle for power  Although the king had paid for his pet projects out of his own funds and not the state coffers, that did not necessarily spare Bavaria from financial fallout. By 1885, the king was 14 million marks in debt, had borrowed heavily from his family, and rather than economizing, as his financial ministers advised him, he planned further opulent designs without pause. He demanded that loans be sought from all of Europe's royalty, and remained aloof from matters of state. Feeling harassed and irritated by his ministers, he considered dismissing the entire cabinet and replacing them with fresh faces. The cabinet decided to act first. Seeking a cause to depose Ludwig by constitutional means, the rebelling ministers decided on the rationale that he was mentally ill, and unable to rule. They asked Ludwig's uncle, Prince Luitpold, to step into the royal vacancy once Ludwig was deposed. Luitpold agreed, on condition the conspirators produced reliable proof that the king was, in fact, helplessly insane. Between January and March 1886, the conspirators assembled the ' or Medical Report, on Ludwig's fitness to rule. Most of the details in the report were compiled by Maximilian Count von Holnstein, who was disillusioned with Ludwig and actively sought his downfall. Holnstein used bribery and his high rank to extract a long list of complaints, accounts, and gossip about Ludwig from among the king's servants. The litany of supposed bizarre behavior included his pathological shyness, his avoidance of state business, his complex and expensive flights of fancy, dining out of doors in cold weather and wearing heavy overcoats in summer, sloppy and childish table manners, dispatching servants on lengthy and expensive voyages to research architectural details in foreign lands; and abusive, violent threats to his servants. The degree to which these accusations were accurate may never be known. The conspirators approached Bismarck, who doubted the report's veracity, calling it \\"rakings from the King's wastepaper-basket and cupboards.\\" Bismarck commented after reading the report that \\"the Ministers wish to sacrifice the King, otherwise they have no chance of saving themselves.\\" He suggested that the matter be brought before the Bavarian Diet and discussed there, but did not stop the ministers from carrying out their plan. In early June, the report was finalized and signed by a panel of four psychiatrists: Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, chief of the Munich Asylum; Dr. Hubert von Grashey (who was Gudden's son-in-law); and their colleagues, Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm Hagen and Dr. Max Hubrich. The report declared in its final sentences that the king suffered from paranoia, and concluded, \\"Suffering from such a disorder, freedom of action can no longer be allowed and Your Majesty is declared incapable of ruling, which incapacity will be not only for a year's duration, but for the length of Your Majesty's life.\\" The men had never met the king, except for Gudden, only once, 12 years earlier, and none had ever examined him. Questions about the lack of medical diagnosis make the legality of the deposition controversial. Adding to the controversy are the mysterious circumstances under which King Ludwig died. (Today, the claim of paranoia is not considered correct; Ludwig's behavior is rather interpreted as a schizotypal personality disorder and he may also have suffered from Pick's disease during his last years, an assumption supported by a frontotemporal lobar degeneration mentioned in the autopsy report.)Prof. Hans F√∂rstl, \\"Ludwig II. von Bayern ‚Äì schizotype Pers√∂nlichkeit und frontotemporale Degeneration?\\", in: Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift, Nr. 132/2007. Ludwig's younger only brother and successor, Otto, was considered insane,Arndt Richter: Die Geisteskrankheit der bayerischen K√∂nige Ludwig II. und Otto. Eine interdisziplin√§re Studie mittels Genealogie, Genetik und Statistik, Degener & Co., Neustadt an der Aisch, 1997, . providing a convenient basis for the claim of hereditary insanity.  Deposition  Ludwig II of Bavaria towards the end of his life circa 1882 At 4 am on 10 June 1886, a government commission including Holnstein and Gudden arrived at Neuschwanstein to deliver the document of deposition to the King formally and to place him in custody. Tipped off an hour or two earlier by a faithful servant, his coachman Fritz Osterholzer, Ludwig ordered the local police to protect him, and the commissioners were turned back from the castle gate at gunpoint. In an infamous sideshow, the commissioners were attacked by the 47-year-old baroness Spera von Truchse√ü,Esperanza Truchsess von Wetzhausen n√©e Esperanza von Sarachaga, of Spanish descent, born Petersburg 1839, married 1862 Friedrich Truchsess von Wetzhausen (1825‚Äì94); died after 1909. B√∂hm, Gottfried, Ritter von. Ludwig II K√∂nig von Bayern: sein Leben und seine Zeit. 1922, p. 600. (German) out of loyalty to the king, who flailed at the men with her umbrella and then rushed to the king's apartments to identify the conspirators. Ludwig then had the commissioners arrested, but after holding them captive for several hours, released them. Prince Ludwig Ferdinand was the only member of the Bavarian royal family who always remained on friendly terms with his cousin (with the exception of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria), so Ludwig II wrote him a telegram; the latter immediately intended to follow this call, but was prevented from leaving Nymphenburg Palace by his uncle Luitpold, who was about to take over government as the ruling Prince Regent. That same day, the government under Minister-President Johann von Lutz publicly proclaimed Luitpold as Prince Regent. The king's friends and allies urged him to flee, or to show himself in Munich, and thus regain the support of the people. Ludwig hesitated, instead issuing a statement, allegedly drafted by his aide-de-camp Count Alfred D√ºrckheim, which was published by a Bamberg newspaper on 11 June: :The Prince Luitpold intends, against my will, to ascend to the regency of my land, and my erstwhile ministry has, through false allegations regarding the state of my health, deceived my beloved people, and is preparing to commit acts of high treason. [...] I call upon every loyal Bavarian to rally around my loyal supporters to thwart the planned treason against the King and the fatherland. The government succeeded in suppressing the statement by seizing most copies of the newspaper and handbills. Anton Sailer's pictorial biography of the King contains a photograph of this rare document. The authenticity of the Royal Proclamation is doubted, however, as it is dated 9 June, before the commission arrived, it uses \\"I\\" instead of the royal \\"We\\" and orthographic errors are included. As the king dithered, his support waned. Peasants who rallied to his cause were dispersed, and the police who guarded his castle were replaced by a police detachment of 36 men who sealed off all entrances to the castle. Eventually, the king decided he would try to escape, but he was too late. In the early hours of 12 June, a second commission arrived. The King was seized just after midnight and at 4 am was taken to a waiting carriage. He asked Dr. Gudden, \\"How can you declare me insane? After all, you have never seen or examined me before,\\" only to be told that \\"it was unnecessary; the documentary evidence [the servants' reports] is very copious and completely substantiated. It is overwhelming.\\" Ludwig was transported to Berg Castle on the shores of Lake Starnberg, south of Munich.  Death  Memorial Cross at the site where the body of Ludwig II was found in Lake Starnberg Participants of the yearly commemoration at the memorial Cross. On the afternoon of the next day, 13 June 1886, Dr. Gudden accompanied Ludwig on a stroll in the grounds of Berg Castle. They were escorted by two attendants. On their return, Gudden expressed optimism to other doctors concerning the treatment of his royal patient. Following dinner, at around 6 pm, Ludwig asked Gudden to accompany him on a further walk, this time through the Schlo√ü Berg parkland along the shore of Lake Starnberg. Gudden agreed; the walk may even have been his suggestion, and he told the aides not to join them. His words were ambiguous (Es darf kein Pfleger mitgehen, \\"No attendant may come with [us]\\") and whether they were meant to follow at a discreet distance is not clear. The two men were last seen at about 6:30 pm; they were due back at 8 pm, but never returned. After searches were made for more than two hours by the entire castle staff in a gale with heavy rain, at 10:30 pm that night, the bodies of both the King and von Gudden were found, head and shoulders above the shallow water near the shore. The King's watch had stopped at 6:54. Gendarmes patrolling the park had neither seen nor heard anything unusual. Ludwig's death was officially ruled a suicide by drowning, but the official autopsy report indicated that no water was found in his lungs. Ludwig was a very strong swimmer in his youth, the water was approximately waist deep where his body was found, and he had not expressed suicidal feelings during the crisis. Gudden's body showed blows to the head and neck and signs of strangulation, leading to the suspicion that he was strangled, although no other evidence was found to prove this. Speculation exists that Ludwig was murdered by his enemies while attempting to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864‚Äì1933), stated, \\"Three years after the king's death I was made to swear an oath that I would never say certain things ‚Äì not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest ‚Ä¶ The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war.\\" Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes that were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. \\"As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat.\\" However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds were found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later, Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12¬∞C) of the lake during an escape attempt. Ludwig's remains were dressed in the regalia of the Order of Saint Hubert, and lay in state in the royal chapel at the Munich Residence Palace. In his right hand, he held a posy of white jasmine picked for him by his cousin the Empress Elisabeth of Austria. After an elaborate funeral on 19 June 1886, Ludwig's remains were interred in the crypt of the Michaelskirche in Munich. His heart, however, does not lie with the rest of his body. Bavarian tradition called for the heart of the king to be placed in a silver urn and sent to the Gnadenkapelle (Chapel of Mercy) in Alt√∂tting, where it was placed beside those of his father and grandfather. Three years after his death, a small memorial chapel was built overlooking the site and a cross was erected in the lake. A remembrance ceremony is held there each year on 13 June. The King was succeeded by his brother Otto, but since Otto was considered incapacitated by mental illness due to a diagnosis by Dr. Gudden and had been under medical supervision since 1883, the king's uncle Luitpold remained regent. Luitpold maintained the regency until his own death in 1912 at the age of 91. He was succeeded as regent by his eldest son, also named Ludwig. The regency lasted for 13 more months until November 1913, when Regent Ludwig deposed the still-living, but still-institutionalized King Otto, and declared himself King Ludwig III of Bavaria. His reign lasted until the end of the World War I, when monarchy in all of Germany came to an end.  Legacy  Though many considered Ludwig peculiar, the question of clinical insanity remains unresolved.Desing, 1996. The prominent German brain researcher Heinz H√§fner has disagreed with the contention that clear evidence existed for Ludwig's insanity. Others believe he may have suffered from the effects of chloroform used in an effort to control chronic toothache rather than any psychological disorder. His cousin and friend, Empress Elisabeth held that, \\"The King was not mad; he was just an eccentric living in a world of dreams. They might have treated him more gently, and thus perhaps spared him so terrible an end.\\" One of Ludwig's most quoted sayings was, \\"I wish to remain an eternal enigma to myself and to others.\\"\\"Ein ewig R√§tsel bleiben will ich mir und anderen.\\" In a letter dated 27 April 1876 to the actress Marie Dahn- Hausmann (1829‚Äì1909), whom Ludwig may have regarded as a kind of substitute mother (published by Conrad in Die Propyl√§en 17, Munich, 9 July 1920). The words are based on a passage in Schiller's 1803 drama Die Braut von Messina II/1. Today visitors pay tribute to King Ludwig by visiting his grave as well as his castles. Ironically, the very castles which were causing the king's financial ruin have today become extremely profitable tourist attractions for the Bavarian state. The palaces, given to Bavaria by Ludwig III's son Crown Prince Rupprecht in 1923, have paid for themselves many times over and attract millions of tourists from all over the world to Germany each year.  Buildings  Not surprisingly, Ludwig II had a great interest in building. His paternal grandfather, King Ludwig I, had largely rebuilt Munich. It was known as the 'Athens on the Isar'. His father, King Maximilian II, had also continued with more construction in Munich, as well as the construction of Hohenschwangau Castle, the childhood home of Ludwig II, near the future Neuschwanstein Castle of Ludwig II. Ludwig II had planned to build a large opera house on the banks of the Isar River in Munich. This plan was vetoed by the Bavarian government.Petzet and Neumeister, 1995, p. 24. Using similar plans, a festival theatre was built later in his reign from Ludwig's personal finances at Bayreuth. * Winter Garden, Residenz Palace, Munich, an elaborate winter garden built on the roof of the Residenz Palace in Munich. It featured an ornamental lake with gardens and painted frescos. It was roofed over using a technically advanced metal and glass construction. After the death of Ludwig II, it was dismantled in 1897 due to water leaking from the ornamental lake through the ceiling of the rooms below. Photographs and sketches still record this incredible creation which included a grotto, a Moorish kiosk, an Indian royal tent, an artificially illuminated rainbow and intermittent moonlight.Calore, 1998, pp. 164‚Äì165. Neuschwanstein Castle * Neuschwanstein Castle, or \\"New Swan Stone Castle\\", a dramatic Romanesque fortress with Byzantine, Romanesque and Gothic interiors, which was built high above his father's castle: Hohenschwangau. Numerous wall paintings depict scenes from the legends Wagner used in his operas. Christian glory and chaste love figure predominantly in the iconography, and may have been intended to help Ludwig live up to his religious ideals, but the bedroom decoration depicts the illicit love of Tristan & Isolde (after Gottfried von Strasbourg's poem). The castle was not finished at Ludwig's death; the Kemenate was completed in 1892 but the watch-tower and chapel were only at the foundation stage in 1886 and were never built. The residence quarters of the King ‚Äì which he first occupied in May 1884Merta 2005, p. 190. ‚Äì can be visited along with the servant's rooms, kitchens as well as the monumental throne room. Unfortunately the throne was never completed although sketches show how it might have looked on completion.Calore, 1998, p. 89. Neuschwanstein Castle is a landmark well known by many non-Germans, and was used by Walt Disney in the twentieth century as the inspiration for the Sleeping Beauty Castles at Disney Parks around the world. The castle has had over 50 million visitors since it was opened to the public on 1 August 1886, including 1.3 million in 2008 alone.Till 2010, p. 34. Linderhof Castle * Linderhof Castle, an ornate palace in neo-French Rococo style, with handsome formal gardens. Just north of the palace, at the foot of the Hennenkopf, the park contains a Venus grotto where Ludwig was rowed in a shell-like boat on an underground lake lit with red, green or \\"Capri\\" blue effects by electricity, a novelty at that time, provided by one of the first generating plants in Bavaria. Stories of private musical performances here are probably apocryphal; nothing is known for certain. In the forest nearby a romantic wooded hut was also built around an artificial tree (see Hundingh√ºtte above). Inside the palace, iconography reflects Ludwig's fascination with the absolutist government of Ancien R√©gime France. Ludwig saw himself as the \\"Moon King\\", a romantic shadow of the earlier \\"Sun King\\", Louis XIV of France. From Linderhof, Ludwig enjoyed moonlit sleigh rides in an elaborate eighteenth century sleigh, complete with footmen in eighteenth century livery. He was known to stop and visit with rural peasants while on rides, adding to his legend and popularity. The sleigh can today be viewed with other royal carriages and sleds at the Carriage Museum (Marstallmusem) at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich. Its lantern was illuminated by electricity supplied by a battery.Petzet 1968, no. 780 There is also a Moorish Pavilion in the park of Schlo√ü Linderhof. Herrenchiemsee Castle * Herrenchiemsee, a replica (although only the central section was ever built) of Louis XIV of France's Palace of Versailles, France, which was meant to outdo its predecessor in scale and opulence ‚Äì for instance, at 98 meters the Hall of Mirrors and its adjoining Halls of War and Peace is slightly longer than the original. The palace is located on the Herren Island in the middle of the Chiemsee Lake. Most of the palace was never completed once the king ran out of money, and Ludwig lived there for only 10 days in October 1885, less than a year before his mysterious death. Tourists come from France to view the recreation of the famous Ambassadors' Staircase. The original Ambassadors' Staircase at Versailles was demolished in 1752.Calore, 1998, p. 60. * Ludwig also outfitted Schachen king's house with an overwhelmingly decorative Oriental style interior, including a replica of the famous Peacock Throne. * The Bayreuth Festspielhaus was built for and under the supervision of Richard Wagner, with funding provided by King Ludwig, as a showcase for Wagner's operas. * Falkenstein, a planned, but never executed \\"robber baron's castle\\" in the Gothic style. A painting by Christian Jank shows the proposed building as an even more fairytale version of Neuschwanstein, perched on a rocky cliff high above Castle Neuschwanstein. Ludwig II left behind a large collection of plans and designs for other castles that were never built, as well as plans for further rooms in his completed buildings. Many of these designs are housed today in the King Ludwig II Museum at Herrenchiemsee Castle. These building designs date from the latter part of the King's reign, beginning around 1883. As money was starting to run out, the artists knew that their designs would never be executed. The designs became more extravagant and numerous as the artists realized that there was no need to concern themselves with economy or practicality.  Ludwig and the arts  Ludwig II with Richard Wagner at the piano It has been said that Richard Wagner's late career is part of Ludwig's legacy, since he almost certainly would have been unable to complete his opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen or to write his final opera, Parsifal, without the king's support. Ludwig also sponsored the premieres of Tristan und Isolde, Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, and, through his financial support of the Bayreuth Festival, those of Der Ring des Nibelungen and Parsifal.See Detta & Michael Petzet 1970, passim Ludwig provided Munich with its opera house, Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz, establishing a lasting tradition of comic and romantic musical theatre known as Singspiele as well as operettas produced for the Bavarian public. The so-called \\"Swan King\\" is also said to have inspired the story behind the classical ballet Swan Lake by Russian composer Tchaikovsky. This could be referenced to the days of his childhood when he spent much of his youth in a castle named Hohenschwangau (\\"high region of the swan\\") in the Bavarian Alps. Ludwig grew up there among swan images and icons, and the nearby Schwansee (\\"Swan Lake\\").

It honors those who were prisoners of war (POWs) and those who are still missing in action (MIA). It is most associated with those who were POWs during the Vietnam War. National Vietnam War Veterans Day is March 29, the date in 1973 when the last US combat troops departed the Republic of Vietnam. History This day was established by an Act of Congress, by the passage of Section 1082 of the 1998 Defense Authorization Act. It is one of six days that the POW/MIA Flag can be flown. The POW/MIA flag was first recognized by and made into in 1990. Observance / Display The POW/MIA Flag should fly below, and not be larger than, the United States flag. It is generally flown immediately below or adjacent to the United States flag as second in order of precedence. National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day is different and separate from National POW/MIA Recognition Day. National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day is April 9th. It was officially designated by Congress in 1988, Public Law 100-269 [Sen J Res 253 100th Congress]. as a Presidentially-proclaimed observance. National Former POW Recognition Day commemorates the April 9, 1942 surrender of approximately 10,000 United States military personnel and 65,000 Filipino soldiers on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines by Major General Edward P. King to the invading Imperial Japanese Army headed by General Masaharu Homma. Bataan, thereafter, is distinguished as the largest mass surrender in United States military history. The surrender was followed immediately by the infamous Bataan Death March. By law, the President of the United States must issue annually a proclamation. The Bataan Death March began on April 9, 1942 and lasted, for some, almost two weeks. The Imperial Japanese Army forced all American and Filipino POWs on a 65-mile trek up from Mariveles at the tip of the Bataan Peninsula north to the San Fernando train station. At San Fernando, the men were packed standing in unventilated boxcars for a 24-mile journey by rail to Capas. Survivors then marched an additional three miles to the makeshift POW camp at Camp O‚ÄôDonnell, an unfinished Philippine Army training facility. It is estimated that at least 10 percent of the men on the March died en route. Sick and starving, the surrendered American and Filipino soldiers on the Bataan Death March were robbed of their personal possessions, denied food, water, and medical care while subject to being beaten, bayoneted, beheaded, crushed by trucks and tanks, and executed. Although this remembrance day is for all who were POWs, it is most associated with those who were POWs of Imperial Japan during WWII.

Versions 2.1.0 and higher are distributed under the GNU General Public License. It runs on most common operating systems.  System overview  The PARI/GP system is a package that is capable of doing formal computations on recursive types at high speed; it is primarily aimed at number theorists. Its three main strengths are its speed, the possibility of directly using data types that are familiar to mathematicians, and its extensive algebraic number theory module. The PARI/GP system consists of the following standard components: * PARI is a C library, allowing for fast computations, and which can be called from a high-level language application (for instance, written in C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, Perl, or Python). * gp is an easy-to-use interactive command line interface giving access to the PARI functions. It functions as a sophisticated programmable calculator which contains most of the control instructions of a standard language like C. GP is the name of gp's scripting language which can be used to program gp. Also available is gp2c, the GP-to-C compiler, which compiles GP scripts into the C language and transparently loads the resulting functions into gp. The advantage of this is that gp2c-compiled scripts will typically run three to four times faster. gp2c understands almost all of GP. PARI/GP performs arbitrary precision calculations (e.g., the significand can be millions of digits long‚Äîand billions of digits on 64-bit machines). It can compute factorizations, perform elliptic curve computations and perform algebraic number theory calculations. It also allows computations with matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers and implements many special functions. PARI/GP comes with its own built-in graphical plotting capability. PARI/GP has some symbolic manipulation capability, e.g., multivariate polynomial and rational function handling. It also has some formal integration and differentiation capabilities. PARI/GP can be compiled with GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) providing faster computations than PARI/GP's native arbitrary-precision kernel.  History  PARI/GP's progenitor was a program named Isabelle, an interpreter for higher arithmetic, written in 1979 by Henri Cohen and Fran√ßois Dress at the Universit√© Bordeaux 1. PARI/GP was originally developed in 1985 by a team led by Henri Cohen at Laboratoire A2X and is now maintained by Karim Belabas at the Universit√© Bordeaux 1 with the help of many volunteer contributors.  Etymology  The name PARI is a pun about the project's early stages when the authors started to implement a library for \\"Pascal ARIthmetic\\" in the Pascal programming language (although they quickly switched to C), and after \\"pari de Pascal\\" (Pascal's Wager).\\"TRIVIA\\" section of \\"Manpage of GP,\\" 10 August 2004 The first version of the gp calculator was originally called GPC, for Great Programmable Calculator. The trailing C was eventually dropped.  Usage examples  Below are some samples of the gp calculator usage: ? \\\\p 212 realprecision = 221 significant digits (212 digits displayed) ?

It was superseded by turboprop engines before it could be widely used. Development The VD-4K, originally designated as the M-253K, was a development of the post-war VD-3TK (M-251K) engine. Like Nazi Germany's experimental Junkers Jumo 222 multibank wartime engine, the VD-4K had six monobloc banks, each with four liquid-cooled cylinders. However, the VD-4K had a larger displacement figure ‚Äî at nearly 59.5 litres ‚Äî than any planned or tested development of the German powerplant; itself only planned to have a top displacement figure of 55.5 litres, with a 145 x 140 mm bore-stroke figure for each cylinder in its planned 222C/D version. The VD-4K utilized a trio of blow-down exhaust, also known as power- recovery, turbines were fitted between the cylinder banks, and a geared centrifugal supercharger and a turbocharger were fitted to the engine itself, which made the VD-4K a turbo-compound engine. Development began in January 1949 and construction of the prototype began in September of that year. The first engine was completed in January 1950 and it underwent its 100-hour tests in June. It successfully passed its State acceptance tests in January‚ÄìFebruary 1951. It was evaluated aboard a Tupolev Tu-4 bomber in 1950, itself powered with a quartet of the Shvetsov OKB's 1946-origin, ASh-73 radial engines, each of a displacement figure of 58.1 litres, somewhat close to that of the Dobrynin multibank powerplant design. The Dobrynin engines were most notably fitted to the two prototypes of the Tupolev Tu-85 bomber, but the aircraft, and its engines, was not placed into production because of the promise offered by turboprop engines of immensely more power, like the Kuznetsov NK-12 ‚Äî itself developed and in test by 1951Kuznetsov NK-12 (Russian Federation) - Jane's Aero-Engines ‚Äî and used on the Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomberGunston, p. 244 Applications *Tupolev Tu-4 *Tupolev Tu-85 Specifications (VD-4K)  See also References Notes Bibliography  External links * VD-4 * Dobrynin Museum, including picture of a restored VD-4 Category:1950s aircraft piston engines Category:Inline radial engines Category:Water-cooled radial engines ","title":"Dobrynin VD-4K"},{"id":"24383148","text":"Algaemia refers to the condition where green algae is found in the blood.

She financially supported Blind's political activities and was arrested with him in the summer of 1847. They married after Jacob Cohen's death in 1848, at which time Ferdinand's last name was changed to Cohen-Blind. After the Baden Revolution Blind and his family went into exile, stopping in Paris and Brussels before arriving in London in 1852. A childhood in exile shaped Ferdinand; following in his parents' shoes, he rejected the monarchical system of the German states, hoping to emulate his stepfather as a champion of democracy. Cohen-Blind returned to Germany in his 18th year, studying at the University of T√ºbingen and (from 1864) the Agricultural Academy of Hohenheim, where he was known as a good student. Assassination attempt After graduating in March 1866, Cohen-Blind went on a hike through Bavaria and Bohemia. The growing likelihood of war between Prussia and Austria led him to the decision to attempt to kill Bismarck, whom he saw as the originator of the threat of civil war. He left Carlsbad, arriving in Berlin and checking into the Hotel Royal Unter den Linden hotel on May 5. On the afternoon of May 7, he lay in wait for Bismarck, revolver in hand, in the Unter den Linden, a boulevard in central Berlin. The future Chancellor had just reported to King Wilhelm and was now walking home. When Bismarck was close to the Russian Embassy, Cohen-Blind took aim and fired twice from behind; Bismarck spun around and grabbed his attacker, who was able to fire three more shots before soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guards rushed up and took him into custody. Bismarck continued on his way home. Later that night, he allowed the King's physician, Gustav von Lauer, to examine him. Lauer noted that the first three bullets had only grazed Bismarck's body and the last two had ricocheted off the ribs and had caused no major injuries. Cohen-Blind was taken to police headquarters for questioning, but in an unguarded moment, he slashed his own throat with a knife, severing his carotid artery. He died shortly after 4 a.m. on May 8. His body was quickly buried at night without ceremony in St. Nicholas Cemetery. Cohen-Blind's weapon, a 6-shot Lefaucheux Pepperbox-Revolver in caliber 6mm, is on display in the Bismarck-Museum in Friedrichsruh.  References  * Julius H. Schoeps: Bismarck und sein Attent√§ter.

The Linzer Klangwolke () (Linz Cloud of Sound) is an open-air multimedia musical event held each year since 1979 in early September in the Linz Danube Park in the Austrian town of Linz. It is organized by the Austrian broadcasting company √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk (ORF) and the Brucknerhaus. Admission is free. The Cloud of Sound currently consists of three concerts of modern music, supplemented by visualizations. The series starts with the visualized Cloud of Sound, in which modern music (mostly commissioned works) is staged with lasers, video projections, fireworks, ships, cranes, balloons, etc. This concert attracts an audience of about 100,000. The classic Cloud of Sound is the opening concert of the Brucknerfest, performed without visualization. The children's Cloud of Sound, an afternoon event since 1998, provides musical stories for younger listeners. History Dr. Hannes Leopoldseder, director of the ORF‚Äôs Upper Austria Regional Studio, was looking for something to connect the Ars Electronica (a festival for art, technology and society) and the Brucknerfest, honoring Austrian composer Anton Bruckner. Discussions with Munich musician and composer Walter Haupt eventually led to the event's creation. Site of the festival on the Danube river. On 18 September 1979, 100,000 people listened as a studio pre-recording of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 in C minor was broadcast through a 20 kilowatt quadrophonic speaker system, opening the Brucknerfest. In 1980, the Bruckner Orchester Linz, under Theodor Guschlbauer, performed Bruckner‚Äôs Symphony No. 4 live. Since 1980, the event has been transmitted live from the Brucknerhaus. Currently, speakers with a total power of 250 kilowatts are installed on cranes in front of the Brucknerhaus between the Nibelungen Bridge and a railway bridge.

Subsequently, he gave himself up to a life of solitary asceticism in a Bithynian monastery, and is said to have remained some time in a monastery on Mount Athos.  Overview  From this seclusion he was called by the Byzantine Emperor Theodore II Lascaris to the position of patriarch at Nicaea in 1255. Upon the emperor's death Arsenios may have shared guardianship of his son John IV Lascaris with George Muzalon: while the later historians Nikephoros Gregoras and Makarios Melissenos say the Patriarch was so named, the contemporary historians Pachymeres and Acropolites name only Mouzalon.Deno John Geanakoplos, Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West, 1258‚Äì1282: A Study in Byzantine-Latin Relations, (Cambridge: Harvard, 1959), p 33n Nevertheless, a few days after Theodore's death George Muzalon was murdered by Michael Palaiologos, and who, at an assembly of the aristocracy presided over by Patriarch Arsenios, was appointed regent for the boy. Arsenios also performed the double coronation of Michael Palaiologos and John Lascaris in January 1259.Geanakoplos, Emperor Michael, pp. 41-46 Through the time between the death of Mouzalon and the double coronation, Arsenios had worked to protect the rights of the young emperor John Lascaris, at one point insisting that John and Michael exchange mutual oaths of loyalty. He also insisted that at the double coronation John Lascaris should be crowned first, which Michael Palaiologos saw as a serious barrier to his final usurpation. Pressure was put upon the patriarch to allow Palaiologos to be crowned alone, and even the young emperor was threatened. The patriarch found no support from the bishops assembled: except for two prelates, all believed that Palaiologos had the right to be crowned first. Arsenios at last conceded the point and crowned Michael and his wife first, while John Lascaris received only a special head- dress.Michael Angold, A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261) (Oxford: University Press, 1975), pp. 89f The ceremony completed, Arsenios took refuge in the monastery of Paschasius, retaining his office of patriarch but refusing to discharge its duties. Nicephorus of Ephesus was appointed in his stead. Michael Palaiologos, having recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire, induced Arsenios to undertake the office of patriarch, but soon incurred Arsenios' severe censure by ordering the young prince John to be blinded. Arsenios went so far as to excommunicate Emperor Michael Palaiologos; after attempting to frighten the patriarch into rescinding the excommunication by threatening to appeal to the Pope, Michael at last convened a synod, had Arsenios deposed, and towards the end of May 1265 sent him into exile.Donald Nicol, The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261‚Äì1453, second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 45 There he died some years afterwards (according to Fabricius in 1264; others say in 1273). Throughout these years Arsenios declined to lift the sentence of excommunication from Michael and after his death, when the new patriarch Joseph gave absolution to the emperor, the dispute was carried on between the \\"Arsenites\\" and the \\"Josephists.\\" The \\"Arsenian schism\\" lasted till 1315, when a reconciliation was pronounced by the patriarch Nephon I. Arsenius is said to have prepared the decisions of the councils and the works of the Fathers a summary of divine laws under the title Synopsis Canonum. Some hold that Synopsis was the work of another Arsenios, a monk of Athos; the ascription depends on whether the patriarch Arsenios did or did not reside at Mount Athos.

During its pre-development stages, protests were launched by residents living at the project site, claiming that they were deceived by the government.  Incidents  Since its creation the power plant has faced several breakdowns. It has been alleged by the Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister, Ajith P.

According to the Ceylon Electricity Board, there were no casualties. The Ministry of Power and Energy commented that damages to the facility would be borne by the constructors and not the government or the developers. * On , the power station ceased operations due to a leak in one of the thousands of tubes carrying water between the boilers.

In the plant, the electricity is produced using a steam turbine which is capable of producing 300MW. Coal is used as the fuel to produce steam that will then be used to rotate the turbine at a speed of 3000 rpm. Coal is imported from Indonesia since it is cheap and good quality. The coal in India is cheaper as compared with Indonesia, but Indonesian coal is used since the Indian coal contains more sulfur. Despite this, the vessels that carry coal come from a Russian port. At first the coal is brought from Indonesia via ships (65 tons per ship). The ships are anchored around 5 km from shore. This coal is brought in to the plant by using barges (long flat- bottomed boats) and then by conveyors. The coal should be maintained around 10% moisture content immediately before it is used. It needs to be ground as powder before it is burnt. There are five \\"mills\\" that pulverize (grind) the coal. Four ball mills work at a time while another one is in standby.

He first served in the German infantry in the early stages of World War I. In 1915, he joined Die Fliegertruppen (Imperial German Air Service). He first served with Feldflieger Abteilung (Field Flier Detachment) 38, then with Kampfgeschwader (Tactical Bomber Wing) 2. Hanko then progressed to fighter pilot's training. Upon graduation, he was posted to his first fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 20, on 2 November 1916.Franks et al 1993, p. 123. On 24 January 1917, he transferred to Jagdstaffel 28. He scored his first aerial victory on 22 April 1917, downing a Nieuport 17 from No. 1 Squadron RFC in a morning fight. Lieutenant AW Wood, the pilot, was wounded, but survived to be taken prisoner. Another 1 Squadron Nieuport followed on 7 May. On 25 May, he shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d from No. 20 Squadron RFC piloted by eventual 11-kill ace Lt. Campbell Hoy who was injured. He was awarded Germany's highest decoration for enlisted men, the Military Merit Cross, on 28 June 1917.Note: It was highly irregular under German regulations to award higher decorations without first awarding both classes of the Iron Cross. It is a safe assumption Hanko won such, though no source refers to them. Hanko went on to down an Airco DH.4 from No. 57 Squadron RFC on 21 August 1917. On 16 September, he became an ace when he shot down a Martinsyde Elephant from No. 27 Squadron RFC. On 24 January 1918, having been commissioned a Leutnant, he was given command of Jagdstaffel 64. He led them without personal result until being removed from duty for illness on 7 July 1918. Hanko's subsequent life is unknown.

From 1913 he was employed at the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough, Hampshire. In February 1915 he made a memorable arrival at Hendon Aerodrome in a new B.E.2c biplane flown by Frank Goodden, who treated the assembled crowd to an impromptu display of aerial acrobatics before landing. Harker was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 15 April 1916. He was posted to No. 5 Reserve Squadron from 2 May until the day after receiving the Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2945, following his flight in a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military Flying School at Birmingham on 18 May. He was appointed a flying officer on 22 June, and confirmed in his rank on 11 July. Harker was posted No. 57 Squadron, primarily a bomber and reconnaissance unit, in France.

Purdy received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1972, officially under the supervision of Paul T. Bateman, but his de facto adviser was Paul Erd≈ës. He was on the faculty in the mathematics department at Texas A&M; University for 11 years, and was appointed the Geier Professor of computer science at the University of Cincinnati in 1986. Purdy had Erd≈ës number one and coauthored many papers with Paul Erd≈ës, who regarded him as his own student. He is the \\"P\\" in G.W. Peck, a pseudonym for the group of mathematicians that also included Ronald Graham, Douglas West, Paul Erd≈ës, Fan Chung, and Daniel Kleitman. Purdy polynomial In 1971, Purdy was asked by Larry Roberts, the director of the DARPA Information Processing Techniques Office, to develop a secure hash function to protect passwords on ARPANET. Purdy developed the so-called Purdy polynomial, which was a polynomial of degree 224 \\\\+ 17 computed modulo the 64-bit prime p = 264 \\\\- 59. The terms of the polynomial could be computed using modular exponentiation. DARPA was satisfied with the hash function, and also allowed Purdy to publish it in Communications of the ACM. It was well received around the world, and DEC eventually used it in their OpenVMS operating system. A DEC report said they chose it because it was very secure and because the existing standard DES could not be exported, which meant that an alternative was needed. OpenVMS uses a 64-bit version, based on a 64-bit prime, the same size as the one in the paper. Purdy's conjecture While at Texas A&M;, Purdy made an empirical observation about distances between points on two lines. Suppose that n points are to be chosen on line L and another n points on line M. If L and M are perpendicular or parallel, then the points can be chosen so that the number of distinct distances determined is bounded by a constant multiply of n, but otherwise the number is much larger. Erd≈ës was very struck by this conjecture and told it to many others, and it was published in a book of unsolved problems by William Moser in 1981.L. Moser and J. Pach, Research problems in discrete geometry, McGill University, Montreal, 1981 It came to the attention of Gy√∂rgy Elekes, who eventually proved the conjecture as the first application of new tools from algebraic geometry that he was developing.A Combinatorial Problem on Polynomials and Rational Functions, Gy√∂rgy Elekes, Lajos R√≥nyai, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, Volume 89, Issue 1, January 2000, Pages 1‚Äì20 After Elekes's untimely death, Micha Sharir collected Elekes's notes and published an organized presentation of these algebraic methods, including work of his own. This, in turn, enabled Katz and Guth to solve the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem, a 1946 problem of Erd≈ës. Work continues on improvements in Purdy's conjecture. Awards In 2015, Purdy was awarded the IEEE Joseph Desch Award for Innovation for his work on the Arpa Network and the Purdy Polynomial.

It is the only antipoxviral drug approved in the United States. The drug works by blocking cellular transmission of the virus, thus preventing the disease. Tecovirimat has been effective in laboratory testing; it has been shown to protect animals from monkeypox and rabbitpox and causes no serious side effects in humans. However, tecovirimat has never been used to treat a human with smallpox due to the disease's eradication. Two million doses of tecovirimat are stockpiled in the US Strategic National Stockpile should an orthopoxvirus-based bioterror attack occur. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Clinical study The results of clinical trials involving tecovirimat supports its use against smallpox and other related orthopoxviruses. It has shown potential for a variety of uses including preventive healthcare, as a post-exposure therapeutic, as a therapeutic and an adjunct to vaccination.Siga Technologies Tecovirimat can be taken orally and has recently been granted permission to conduct Phase II trials by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Phase I trials tecovirimat was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Due to its importance for biodefense, the FDA has designated tecovirimat for 'fast-track' status, creating a path for expedited FDA review and eventual regulatory approval. On 13 July 2018, the FDA announced approval of tecovirimat. Mechanism of action Tecovirimat inhibits the function of a major envelope protein required for the production of extracellar virus. Thus the virus is prevented from leaving an infected cell and the spread of the virus within the body is prevented. Society and culture Originally researched by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the drug was previously owned by Viropharma and discovered in collaboration with scientists at USAMRIID. It is currently owned and manufactured by Siga Technologies, a pharmaceutical company in the biodefense arena that won a government contract to develop the drug.

He then followed his brothers to Tripoli, Lebanon where they had opened a photo studio. Galentz painted backgrounds to be used in the photo sessions. From 1929-1933, French painter Claude Michulet was his teacher in Beirut Academy of Fine Arts, where he then taught painting until 1939. Galentz was awarded the Medal of Merit by the presidium of International Exhibitions in New York in 1939, and the honorary prize by the government of Lebanon for his bas-reliefs in the Pavilion of Lebanon presented at the New York International exhibition. In 1938 he took into apprenticeship a young woman by the name of Armine Paronyan (Galentz), whom he later married on May 2, 1943. Armine became a prominent Armenian painter alongside her husband. They had two sons, Armen and Saro (1946-2017), who is a painter too. Galentz and family expatriated to Yerevan, Armenia in June 1946. The next year he participated in a group show organized to exhibit the works of newly expatriated painters. He participated in group exhibitions organized by the Artists Union, of which he was a member since 1947. He held several solo shows both in Yerevan and in Moscow and was posthumously awarded Armenian Republic‚Äôs (SSR) State Prize in 1967. His landscapes and still lifes are imbued with light. According to Henrik Igityan, \\"looking at the radiant, cheerful paintings of Galents, remembering his kind uistful eyes, one finds it impossible to realize that this quiet sad man is the author of those bright optimistic poetic tales\\".Armenian palette of the 20th century, By Henrik Igityan, 2004, Page 136 Alexander Gitovich dedicated one of his poems to Galentz. Galentz is one of the heroes of \\"People without childhood\\" by Antranig Dzarugian. Galentz‚Äô house in Yerevan is now a museum. His paintings are also in the collections of the National Gallery of Armenia (Yerevan), the Modern Art Museum of Yerevan, the Ministry of Culture in Armenia as well as in some private collections in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tbilisi, New York, Paris, Vienna, Beirut, Aleppo, Cambridge, San Francisco, Los Angeles, to list a few.

History The windmill Concordia stood on this site from 1904 until it was burnt down in 1906. It had originally been built in Damsterdiep, Groningen in 1771 and moved to Noord-Sleen in 1904 To replace it, the 1851-built corn mill Molen van Grashuis was moved from Usquert, Groningen, to Noord-Sleen by millwright H Wiertsma of Scheemda, Groningen. The first miller was Mr Westerling. Nine windmills that he worked burnt down. Westerling took a mill at 't Haantje in 1909 and Albertdina was bought by J Ziengs. The mill was restored in 1953 by millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Groningen. Since 1976 the mill has been owned by the local council. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) During the 1970s, the mill had a pair of Patent sails and a pair of Common sails, but it now has four Common sails. The sails have been shortened due to a nearby building.

The church occupies a historic red brick structure that was built in 1914. The Italian Romanesque Revival building has been designated as a Long Beach Historic Landmark and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Construction and architecture The church was founded in 1888. The current church building, designed in the Italian Romanesque style, was completed in 1914 at a total cost of $210,000. Joachim Bixby, Sr., known as the \\"Father of Long Beach,\\" was the largest contributor to the construction fund, having given $25,000. The building was designed in the Romanesque style by architect H.M. Patterson of Los Angeles and built of red pressed brick laid in patterns and trimmed with white terra cotta. The large auditorium had the capacity for seating 1,500 persons. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the \\"immense auditorium, the roof of which is fifty-five feet above the floor, gives one the impression he is entering one of the cathedrals of Europe.\\" The Times also referred to the church's art-glass windows as being \\"among the finest to be seen in the West.\\" The church also featured three great rose windows above the gallery and six picture windows below the gallery. The center window was called the \\"Light of the World.\\" History The church building was dedicated in December 1914 with more than 2,000 Congregationalists in attendance. The Los Angeles Times described the church as \\"magnificent\\" and reported that its \\"architecture and appointments are without peer in Southern California.\\" It was the largest church in Southern California when it opened. In 1924, a three-story education building with an auditorium was added to the campus. By 1927, the congregation had grown to become the fifth largest Congregational church in the United States with 1,700 members. The church sustained extensive damage in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and was closed for several months while repairs were made. Rev. Henry Kendall Booth was the pastor at the church from 1909 until his death in 1942. The church appeared in the 2007 movie License to Wed. Social activism and theology The church practices a liberal theology and has a long history of social activism, including programs to assist the poor, homeless and disabled. In 1992, the church publicly declared that it welcomed gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons into membership, employment and leadership. By 2005, 42% of the church members were from the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. In 2007, the church gained media attention when the senior pastor, Jerald Stinson, vowed to defy an order that he block homeless people from sleeping on the steps and grounds of the church. At the time, Stinson said, \\"The city's threats are ludicrous. We're not going to do what they want us to do.

It was created when the Republic of Ireland government passed the National Lottery Act, 1986 to help raise funds for good causes. The eligible causes are sport and recreation, health and welfare, national heritage and the arts, the Irish language, and the natural environment. National Lottery gaming operations began on 23 March 1987 with scratchcards, and the flagship drawing game, Lotto, began in March 1988. The National Lottery now operates three families of drawing games (Lotto, EuroMillions, and Daily Million), funds televised bingo and game shows, sells a wide range of scratchcards, and runs a number of Millionaire Raffles each year. National Lottery games are available online as well as through a network of over 3,700 retail agents nationwide. By the end of 2013, the National Lottery had achieved over ‚Ç¨12 billion in cumulative sales, had paid out ‚Ç¨6.7 billion in prizes, and had raised ‚Ç¨4.4 billion for the good causes it supports.National Lottery Company Annual Report 2013, available at In 2011, 2.2 million Irish people (64 percent of the adult population) reported playing National Lottery games, with 1.5 million (42 percent) reporting that they played weekly.Presentation to Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, and Reform by Donal Connell, Chairman, An Post National Lottery Company. Available at http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/committees/finance/Presentation.ppt In 2013, due to a financial crisis that had left the Irish state running a large budget deficit, the Irish government agreed to sell the National Lottery licence for 20 years to a private operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland. The new operator took ownership of the licence on 27 February 2014. The government is receiving ‚Ç¨405 million from the sale, some of which will finance the construction of a new National Children's Hospital. Administration From its inception until 27 February 2014, the National Lottery was operated under licence by the An Post National Lottery Company (), which was 80 percent owned by Ireland's state-owned postal services provider An Post and 20 percent by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In 2011, in response to Ireland's financial crisis, the government included the National Lottery licence on a list of state assets that could be sold to assist the public finances. In April 2012, the government announced that it would sell the National Lottery licence for a period of 20 years for an upfront payment, while ensuring that 30 percent of lottery sales would still go to fund its designated good causes. The licence was valued at between ‚Ç¨200 and ‚Ç¨600 million, with some estimates putting its value in the region of ‚Ç¨500 million. In May 2013, the Irish government enacted the National Lottery Act 2013 to allow for the sale of the National Lottery licence, provide for the establishment of a new independent lottery regulator, and eliminate some restrictions on Internet gambling to allow for the growth of online lottery sales. The legislation also added the natural environment to the list of good causes eligible to receive lottery funding. On 3 October 2013, Minister Howlin announced that the government had agreed to sell the National Lottery licence for ‚Ç¨405 million to Premier Lotteries Ireland, a consortium comprising An Post, An Post pension funds, and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (owner of the Camelot Group, operators of the UK National Lottery). Dermot Griffin, head of the An Post National Lottery Company since 2006, became chief executive of Premier Lotteries Ireland and remained in that post until 2019, having been replaced by Andrew Algeo. Other existing senior management were also retained. Executives from the Camelot Group, the Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan, and An Post were appointed to the board of the new company. The process of finalizing the lottery contracts was delayed due to an industrial dispute involving the employees of An Post National Lottery Company over the terms and conditions of staff transfers to Premier Lotteries Ireland, but the dispute was resolved in February 2014, and contracts were signed on 27 February 2014. Some of the funds paid to the Irish state will be used for a range of local infrastructural projects, including the construction of a National Children's Hospital. Games The National Lottery began gaming operations on 23 March 1987, when it launched its first scratchcards. Since then, the National Lottery has expanded its product line to include the Lotto family of games, television bingo, televised game shows, regular \\"Millionaire Raffles,\\" participation in the transnational EuroMillions lottery, and a daily ‚Ç¨1 million game called Daily Million. National Lottery tickets and scratchcards are sold by a network of over 3,700 agents around the country. In March 2009, the National Lottery began offering online sales of instant-win games, as well as key draw games such as Lotto and EuroMillions. Internet sales increased by 43 percent in 2012, to ‚Ç¨8.7 million, with around 40,000 players registered to play games online.National Lottery Company Annual Report 2012, available at In 2012, total National Lottery sales were ‚Ç¨734 million. A total of ‚Ç¨406 million was distributed in prizes and ‚Ç¨225 million was distributed to good causes. All cash prizes won in National Lottery games are paid as tax-free lump sums. All prizes in Lotto, EuroMillions, and Daily Million games must be claimed within 90 days of the applicable drawing dates. No minor under the age of 18 may purchase tickets for or claim prizes in any National Lottery game. Winners have the right to remain anonymous. Lotto logo in use from 2008 onwards Lotto Lotto, which began in March 1988, is the National Lottery's flagship drawing game. It is currently a 6/47 lottery with an additional \\"bonus ball.\\" Its starting jackpot is a guaranteed ‚Ç¨2 million, which rolls over until it is won. The minimum play in Lotto has always been two lines of six numbers each. At Lotto's current cost of ‚Ç¨2 per line, a Lotto ticket costs a minimum of ‚Ç¨4. Lotto has produced two spinoff games, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1, which began in 1997, and Lotto Plus, which began in 2000.http://www.lottery.ie/en/games/how-to-play/how-to-play-lotto/ The largest ever Lotto jackpot of ‚Ç¨18.9 million was won on 28 June 2008 by a syndicate of 16 colleagues at a quarry and concrete plant in Bennekerry, Carlow. Sales of Lotto fell from ‚Ç¨379.1 million in 2011 to ‚Ç¨339.7 million in 2012. The National Lottery said that this reflected lower jackpot levels during the year. History of Lotto The first Lotto drawing was held on Saturday, 16 April 1988. In its original 6/36 format, six numbered balls were drawn from a lottery machine containing 36 balls. Players could win a share of a guaranteed ¬£250,000 jackpot by matching all six numbers, or win smaller prizes by matching four or five numbers. If no winning ticket was sold, the jackpot rolled over for the next draw. Drawings continued each Saturday night until 30 May 1990, when the National Lottery introduced a midweek Lotto draw on Wednesday nights. Lotto draws have been held twice weekly since that time. The Lotto for Saturday if Christmas Day is falling on Saturday transferred to Christmas Eve, Friday or Wednesday draw to Tuesday (1991-2002) or Thursday in 2013. In a 6/36 lottery, the odds of matching all six numbers and winning the jackpot are 1 in 1,947,792. At Lotto's initial cost of ¬£0.50 per line, all possible combinations could be purchased for ¬£973,896. This left Lotto vulnerable to a brute force attack, which happened when the jackpot reached ¬£1.7 million for the May 1992 bank holiday drawing. A 28-member Dublin-based syndicate, organized and headed by Polish-Irish businessman Stefan Klincewicz, had spent six months preparing by marking combinations on almost a quarter of a million paper playslips. In the days before the drawing they tried to buy up all possible combinations and thus win all possible prizes, including the jackpot. The National Lottery tried to foil Klincewicz's plan by limiting the number of tickets any single machine could sell, and by turning off the terminals his ticket purchasers were known to be using heavily. Despite its efforts, the syndicate did manage to buy over 80 percent of the combinations, spending an estimated ¬£820,000 on tickets. It had the winning numbers on the night, but two other winning tickets were also sold, so the syndicate could claim only one-third of the jackpot, or ¬£568,682. Match-5 and match-4 prizes brought the syndicate's total winnings to approximately ¬£1,166,000, representing a profit of approximately ¬£310,000 before expenses. Klincewicz later appeared on the television talk show Kenny Live and wrote a self- published lottery-system book entitled Win the Lotto. To prevent such a brute force attack from happening again, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/39 game later in 1992, raising the jackpot odds to 1 in 3,262,623. The first Lotto 6/39 drawing was held on 22 August 1992. To compensate for the longer jackpot odds, the National Lottery doubled the starting jackpot to and added a \\"bonus number\\" to the drawings. Whereas players previously needed either a match-6, match-5, or match-4 to win, prizes were now also awarded for match-5+bonus, match-4+bonus, and match-3+bonus. The National Lottery's corporate logo from the late 1990s‚Äì 2008. The original 1987 logo was similar, but with the text \\"National Lottery\\" in a serif font however (with the word \\"National\\" in mixed case), and the boxes were not rounded. Lotto became a 6/42 game on 24 September 1994, which made the jackpot odds 1 in 5,245,786. The National Lottery made this change to generate bigger rollover jackpots, partly so that people living near the border with Northern Ireland would not abandon Lotto when the 6/49 British National Lottery began operations on 14 November 1994. At the same time, the National Lottery introduced computer-generated \\"quick picks\\" as an alternative to marking numbers on paper playslips. Some retailers now only offer the quick-pick option. For draws beginning on 26 September 1998, the National Lottery increased the cost of a line of Lotto from ¬£0.50 to ¬£0.75. At this time it also doubled the game's starting jackpot to ¬£1 million and increased most of the game's smaller prizes by 50 percent. With the introduction of the euro currency on 1 January 2002, the cost of a line of Lotto became ‚Ç¨0.95, and the starting jackpot became ‚Ç¨1.269 million (the euro equivalent of ¬£1 million). For draws beginning 1 September 2002, the price of Lotto was rounded to ‚Ç¨1 per line, and the starting jackpot was raised slightly to ‚Ç¨1.35 million. Core Lotto sales had declined steadily for six consecutive years up to 2006, falling from ‚Ç¨314.9 million in 2000 to ‚Ç¨255.1 million in 2006. Falling sales partly reflected public dissatisfaction with the game during the Celtic Tiger economic boom. As property prices and the cost of living escalated rapidly, particularly in Dublin, a ‚Ç¨1.35 million starting jackpot was no longer seen as offering the transformed lifestyle promoted in lottery advertising. In November 2006, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/45 game to create bigger jackpots and combat falling ticket sales. It made the starting jackpot a guaranteed ‚Ç¨2 million, increased the match-5+bonus prize from ‚Ç¨12,000 to ‚Ç¨25,000, introduced a match-3 prize of ‚Ç¨5, and increased the price of a line of Lotto from ‚Ç¨1 to ‚Ç¨1.50. The company said that the structural changes were designed to produce about twenty Lotto jackpots of ‚Ç¨5 million and over each year, and at least one jackpot over ‚Ç¨10 million. The first 6/45 draw was held on 4 November 2006. The odds of winning (in a 6/45 lottery) the Lotto jackpot are 1 in 8,145,060. The odds of getting a match-5+bonus are 1 in 1,357,510; the odds of a match-5 are 1 in 1,221,759; the odds of a match 4+bonus are 1 in 14,290; the odds of a match-4 are 1 in 148,995; the odds of a match-3+bonus are 1 in 579; and the odds of a match-3 are 1 in 14,190. The Wednesday night Lotto draw on 4 February 2015 was postponed until the following night due to a technical problem with ticket machines. This marked the first time in Lotto history that a drawing was postponed. As of 3 September 2015, the cost of buying two lines increased from ‚Ç¨3 to ‚Ç¨4 and players must now choose from 47 instead of 45 numbers, lengthening the odds of winning the jackpot to almost 11 million (approximately 10.7 million) to one. The odds against winning the second prize have increased also, but so too has the prize value, from ‚Ç¨25,000 to an estimated ‚Ç¨100,000. There will also be a new prize for matching 2 balls and the bonus ball. The current odds of winning (in a 6/47 lottery) are: Jackpot - 1 in 10,737,573; match 5 - 1 in 1,533,939; match 4 - 1 in 178,365; match 3 - 1 in 16,215. Lotto in Thailand Lotto Plus In 2000, the National Lottery introduced Lotto Plus as an add-on to the main Lotto game. For an extra ¬£0.25 per line, players could enter their Lotto numbers in an additional 6/42 drawing for a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of ¬£250,000. The first Lotto Plus drawing took place on 25 October 2000. In 2002, the National Lottery added a second Lotto Plus drawing, renamed the drawings Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2, and raised the cost of Lotto Plus to ‚Ç¨0.50 per line. The jackpots were fixed at ‚Ç¨300,000 and ‚Ç¨200,000 respectively. The first drawings for Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 took place on 1 September 2002. In November 2006, when Lotto adopted a 6/45 matrix, the National Lottery raised the Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 jackpots to ‚Ç¨350,000 and ‚Ç¨250,000 respectively. The cost of Lotto Plus remained at ‚Ç¨0.50 per line. In September 2015, following the increase of two extra balls in the machine, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to ‚Ç¨500,000. In 2018, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to ‚Ç¨1000000. A Lotto Plus raffle was also introduced. Every player that matches the 4 digit raffle number wins ‚Ç¨300. As with the main Lotto game, Lotto Plus players can win smaller cash prizes for match-5+bonus, match-5, match-4+bonus, match-4, and match-3+bonus. The odds of winning these prizes are the same as for the main Lotto game. On 30 August 2018, Lotto Plus was enhanced with the first price rise in 18 years now costing ‚Ç¨1 per line to enter. The raffle prize was increased to ‚Ç¨500, with special ‚Ç¨1 million raffle draws taking place at special points throughout the year. They offered free Daily Million quick picks for matching 2 main numbers plus the bonus ball. This meant that the odds were better at 1 in 10 at winning a prize. Over 90 percent of Lotto players play Lotto Plus. Sales of Lotto Plus in 2012 were ‚Ç¨74.3 million. Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 logo in use from 2008 onwards Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 Based around the main Lotto draw, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 was introduced in February 1997. It allows players to win prizes by correctly matching one, two, three, four, or five of the drawn numbers. The more numbers players try to match, the greater the prize. Players may base their choices either on a six-number game (excluding the bonus number) or on a seven-number game (including the bonus number). Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 accounted for ‚Ç¨13.1 million in sales in 2012. EuroMillions Euromillions logo in use from 2008 onwards. The National Lottery joined the transnational EuroMillions lottery on 8 October 2004. As of 2012, EuroMillions accounts for 24 percent of National Lottery sales. Several EuroMillions jackpots have been won or shared in Ireland: * On 31 July 2005, Dolores McNamara, a part-time cleaning lady from Limerick, won a EuroMillions jackpot of ‚Ç¨115 million, which at the time was the largest lottery prize ever won in Europe. * On 17 November 2006, two Irish winners each received a 5 percent share of an unwon ‚Ç¨183 million jackpot when it was divided under the draw's 12-week rollover rule among all twenty tickets bearing five numbers and one lucky star. The winners received ‚Ç¨9.6 million each. One winning ticket was purchased in Foynes, County Limerick and the other in Millstreet, County Cork. * On 4 July 2008, a couple who chose to remain anonymous won a EuroMillions jackpot of ‚Ç¨15 million on a ‚Ç¨9 quick-pick ticket purchased in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. * On 12 June 2009, a jackpot of ‚Ç¨58.8 million was divided among two winning tickets, worth ‚Ç¨29.4 million each. One of the tickets, a ‚Ç¨6 quick-pick, was sold in Newcastle, County Dublin. The winning family chose to remain anonymous. * On 29 January 2016, a jackpot of ‚Ç¨132,376,632 was split amongst two winners, one in Ireland and one in France, each getting ‚Ç¨66,188,316. There is no information about the winner currently. * On 19 February 2019, a jackpot of ‚Ç¨175 was won. The ticket was sold in Naul, Co Dublin Irish sales of EuroMillions were ‚Ç¨131.5 million in 2012, a 3.2 percent increase on the previous year. Plus In June 2007, the National Lottery introduced \\"Plus,\\" an add-on to the main EuroMillions game available only to Irish players. For an extra ‚Ç¨1 per line, players can enter their five main EuroMillions numbers in an additional draw for a fixed, non-rolling prize of ‚Ç¨500,000. Players can also win fixed prizes of ‚Ç¨2,000 for a match-4 and ‚Ç¨20 for a match-3. The first Plus drawing was held on 15 June 2007. 76 percent of EuroMillions players now play Plus. Sales of Plus were ‚Ç¨44.6 million in 2012, an increase of 3.7 percent over the previous year. Daily Million In September 2012, the National Lottery introduced Daily Million to replace both Monday Million (a draw game with prizes up to ‚Ç¨1 million, held once weekly on Monday nights) and All Or Nothing (a daily draw game with prizes up to ‚Ç¨500,000). A 6/39 weekly lottery drawing with a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of ‚Ç¨1 million, Daily Million takes place every day of the week, including weekends and bank holidays. It costs ‚Ç¨1 per line to play. For an extra ‚Ç¨0.50 per line, players can play Daily Million Plus for a top prize of ‚Ç¨500,000. The Daily Million/Daily Million Plus draws take place twice a day, every day (2pm and 9pm) at the National Lottery Headquarters under the supervision of Independent observers and National Lottery draw personnel.https://www.lottery.ie/help/faqs For some undisclosed reasons the National Lottery does not allow Daily Million Draws to be viewed by the public or streamed online. All or Nothing Introduced in October 2009, All or Nothing was the National Lottery's first daily draw game. Players choose 12 numbers from 24; if they got all the numbers correct, or none of the numbers correct, they won ‚Ç¨500,000‚Äîa 1 in 1,352,078 chance of victory. The game had additional prizes of ‚Ç¨5,000 for Match 11, ‚Ç¨25 for Match 10, ‚Ç¨10 for Match 9, and ‚Ç¨4 for Match 8. Tickets cost ‚Ç¨2 per line. The numbers were announced on RT√â Two each night and also displayed through an animated draw on the Lottery website. The game had generated sales of ‚Ç¨3.4 million by the end of 2009. The final draw took place on 10 September 2012. Millionaire Raffle In the summer of 2008, the National Lottery ran its first Millionaire Raffle. These special, limited edition raffles have been held several times a year since then. Two Millionaire Raffle draws were held in 2011 and three in 2012. For the Easter 2013 Millionaire Raffle, 200,000 tickets were available, costing ‚Ç¨20 each. The raffle had a top prize of ‚Ç¨1 million, a second prize of ‚Ç¨250,000, and two third prizes of ‚Ç¨100,000. Players could also win a range of smaller prizes ranging from ‚Ç¨10,000 to ‚Ç¨250. In 2016 this was increased to 500,000 tickets, still costing ‚Ç¨20 each then increased to ‚Ç¨25 a ticket in 2017 with a similar breakdown of prizes. Professional footballer Kevin O'Connor won the 2017 Christmas Millionaire Raffle.; Telly Bingo The National Lottery introduced Telly Bingo in September 1999. Players buy tickets with 24 randomly generated numbers, and can win prizes by matching the numbers drawn on a lunchtime TV show in a variety of patterns, with a prize of ‚Ç¨10,000 for a full house. An additional ‚Ç¨10,000 Snowball prize goes to someone who achieves a full house on or before the 45th number drawn. If not won, the Snowball prize rolls over to the next draw, allowing one additional number each time. In 2012, Telly Bingo sales were ‚Ç¨17.3 million. Scratchcard Games The National Lottery had a total of 23 scratchcard games on offer during 2019, ranging in price from ‚Ç¨1 to ‚Ç¨10, and offering instant cash prizes from ‚Ç¨2 to ‚Ç¨100,000. Sales of instant scratchcard games rose 3.2 percent to ‚Ç¨163.5 million in 2012. Game shows The National Lottery funds the prize money for two televised game shows. Contestants gain entry to the shows by getting three \\"lucky stars\\" on associated scratchcards and submitting them in special envelopes for televised drawings. Broadcast on Saturday nights on RT√â One since 1990, the game shows have proven very popular, often featuring among the channel's top-rated programmes. The National Lottery's flagship game show Winning Streak debuted in 1990 and screens weekly between September and early June. A summer companion programme Fame & Fortune was launched in 1996 and ran through the months of June, July, and August until 2007. It was replaced in 2007 by The Trump Card, which was replaced in turn by The Big Money Game, which was replaced by The Million Euro Challenge. References in other media In the 1990s, RT√â produced a sitcom called Upwardly Mobile about a working-class family who won the Lotto and moved to an upper-middle-class area. It ran for three seasons between 1995 and 1997. Waking Ned (known as Waking Ned Devine in North America) is a comedy film set in a tiny rural village, based on a fictitious winner of the Lotto.

The order is then flashed to recipients of the venue's proprietary data feed to see if any of those firms wants to take the other side of the order. This practice enables the market center to try to keep the trade since the firm that is seeking to buy or sell shares or stock posts the information only on a specific stock exchange before sending the trade information out on the broader public markets, and making it available to all potential investors. If a deal can be struck between recipients of the flash trade, the result is a locked market with guaranteed pricing on the order. On some trades, it also results in better profits for the firms making the trades, as the firms often get rebates or lower fees for flash trades when the transaction is completed internally and doesn't get posted on rival stock exchanges. In 2009 in the United States under an exception to Rule 602 of Regulation NMS flash orders were allowed. In high-frequency trading flash orders for small amounts are utilised to find large orders so that the high frequency trader can buy or sell all available stock before the large order reaches the rest of the market. This may be done within a dark pool or over a number of electronic exchanges where the speed of the order routing is critical to the success of the strategy. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by 2009 this practice had become controversial, with some market participants saying that high frequency traders could use flash orders to unfairly exploit others and that it is akin to front running. History According to a 2009 Bloomberg article: > Flash systems trace their roots as far back as 1978 to efforts by exchanges > to electronically replicate how a trader might yell an order to floor > brokers before entering it into the system that displays all bids and > offers. Markets have evolved since the days of floor brokers‚Äô dominance, > with computer algorithms now buying and selling shares 1,000 times faster > than the blink of an eye.Bloomberg, 5 August 2009 In 2010 flash orders gained popularity in the options markets, where as early as 2000 the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began using the particular type of order to help improve the speed of trade executions for its clients.Forbes, 10 April 2010 In 2006, Direct Edge began offering customers the ability to flash orders in the equities market. Direct Edge quickly captured market share from their rivals as their share of matched trades soared from 1% of the industry's volume to 12%. Direct Edge became a U.S. exchange in July 2010.Reuters, 21 July 2010 Nasdaq and BATS (U.S. exchanges) created their own flash market in early 2009 in response to the Direct Edge market. Both voluntarily discontinued the practice in August 2009.NASDAQ OMX, 6 August 2009, NASDAQ OMX to Voluntarily Eliminate Flash Order OfferingBATS Exchange, 6 August 2009, BATS Exchange to Cease Offering BOLT Order Type Direct Edge's response to this in 2009 was that the data that flash trading used reduced market impact, increased average size of executed orders, reduced trading latency, and provided additional liquidity. Direct Edge also allowed all of its subscribers to determine whether they want their orders to participate in flash trading or not so brokers have the option to opt out of flash orders on behalf of their clients if they choose to. Because market participants can choose to utilize it for additional liquidity or not participate in it at all Direct Edge believes the controversy was overstated stating: > \\"Misconceptions respecting flash technology have, to date, stirred a > passionate but ill informed debate.\\" Direct Edge 2009Direct Edge, November > 2009 Debate In 2009 critics argued that the practice was harmful to market transparency. Proponents of flash trading stated that it is necessary to provide liquidity for exchanges. Critics In 2009 critics of the practice (notably high-frequency trading firm GETCO https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr- nasdaq-2009-043/nasdaq2009043-3.pdf) contended this creates a two-tiered market in which a certain class of traders can unfairly exploit others, akin to front running.Ellen Brown, CounterPunch, 23 April 2010, Computerized Front- Running Exchanges in 2009 claimed that the procedure benefits all traders by creating more market liquidity and the opportunity for price improvement. However, a December 2009 article in The Banker noted: > in a bid to fuel the controversy and fill column space, however, several > commentators and pundits have complained bitterly that flashes expose > information that may allow traders to ‚Äòfront-run‚Äô orders. The widespread > perception, meanwhile, that flash orders are the preserve of hyper- > sophisticated high-frequency traders has further cemented the misguided > notion that the lay retail investor is in turn being cheated.The Banker, > December 2009 Direct Edge's response to the \\"two-tiered market\\" criticism is as follows: > First it is difficult to address concerns that may result, particularly when > there is no empirical data to support such as result. Furthermore, we do not > view technology that instantaneously aggregates passive and aggressive > liquidity as creating a two-tier market. Rather, flash technology > democratizes access to the non-displayed market and in this regard, removes > different \\"tiers\\" in market access. Additionally, any subscriber of Direct > Edge can be a recipient of flashed orders.

Even though most programs have been stopped voluntarily, it is still possible, at least with Direct Edge.Forbes, 14 April 2010, Ankle Bracelets For High-Frequency Traders Supporters In 2009 Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group, an independent research firm in Boston, saw the debate about flash orders as more philosophical than practical. Since the total market volume that goes through flash orders accounted for only 2% to 3% of daily volume in 2009, there would not be a big change in trade volume among major players if those orders disappeared. In 2009 Bogoslaw predicted that regardless of the endgame, there would always be differences in the speed of information-technology capabilities of market centers and market participants. He argued that as long as market centers competed for order flow, investors can benefit, even if participating is only through investments in mutual or pension funds. In 2009 large institutional investors benefit directly by having enough liquidity to move a big block of shares with minimal price impact.

He was born in Los Angeles, California, and he was named Steven Timothy Hoyne. It is unknown when he adopted the use of the last name Hayne. He graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1959. Hayne graduated from Brown Medical School in 1974 and interned until 1976 at Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco, California. After finishing his internship, he practiced medicine in California, Kentucky, and Alabama, before settling in Mississippi in 1987. Practice in Mississippi Until 2008, Hayne performed about 80 to 90 percent of criminal autopsies in Mississippi, and has testified to performing more than 1,500 autopsies per year. Performing more than 325 autopsies per year is considered a \\"Phase II deficiency\\" by the National Association of Medical Examiners, and prevents an office from being accredited. While performing these autopsies, Hayne also regularly appeared in court to testify as a forensic expert, and held down two hospital jobs. Cory Maye case Hayne is the medical examiner in the Cory Maye case and testified at the trial for the murder of Ron Jones. In this testimony, \\"Hayne said he could tell from the damage to Jones‚Äô body the trajectory the bullet took as it entered the officer. Based on that trajectory, he speculated that Maye was standing when he shot Jones, not lying on the floor, as Maye testified. Hayne‚Äôs testimony seriously damaged Maye‚Äôs credibility with the jury. However, according to a post-trial review by an actual, board-certified forensics expert whom Maye‚Äôs new legal team hired, it would be impossible to project the bullet‚Äôs trajectory based on the tissue damage in Jones‚Äô corpse, because Jones might have been crouching, rolling, or prone when he was hit.\\" Jimmie Duncan case Jimmie Duncan was convicted for the 1993 murder of Haley Oliveaux of West Monroe, Louisiana based primarily on the testimony of Hayne and Michael West, a dentist who claimed to identify bite marks and at the time coroner of Forrest County, Mississippi. Duncan had admitted to leaving Oliveaux in a bathtub unattended, and was initially charged with negligent homicide. Hayne examined Oliveaux and claimed to have found bite marks on her face that had not been seen by any of the other medical professionals who had previously examined her body, such as EMTs and hospital personnel. After this, a mold was taken of Duncan's teeth for use in bite mark analysis by Michael West. In performing this analysis, West repeatedly pressed the mold into the cheek of Oliveaux' corpse, creating bite marks which had not previously existed. This was recorded on videotape which surfaced in 2008. Michael Bowers, deputy medical examiner for Ventura County, California commented with regard to the bite marks that \\"Dr. West created them. It was intentional. He's creating artificial abrasions in that video, and he's tampering with the evidence. It's criminal, regardless of what excuse he may come up with about his methods.\\" Tyler Edmonds case At 2004 the trial for the murder of Joey Fulgham (committed by his wife), in which his 13-year-old brother-in-law Tyler Edmonds was also tried and convicted, Hayne claimed to be able to determine from the bullet wounds received by Fulgham that Edmonds had also been holding the gun at the time the trigger was pulled. On appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court this testimony was called \\"speculative\\" and \\"scientifically unfounded\\" by the court. Upon retrial in 2008, absent Hayne's testimony, Edmonds was acquitted.

There is also material about the Dambusters Raid.http://www.granthammuseum.org.uk/ The Museum hosts a variety of exhibitions during the year. The museum is currently managed by the Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA). This charity was formed in 2011 to take over the management of the museum from Lincolnshire County Council with a view to reopening the facility for the Queen's Jubilee in June 2012. In 2013, a few months before the death of Margaret Thatcher, the GCHA announced plans to raise funds to obtain a statue of the former prime minister.

Nagy-Talavera or Mikl√≥s Nagy (February 1, 1929 - January 23, 2000) was a Hungarian-American dissident, historian, writer and professor, Biography He was born to prosperous merchants of Sephardic Jewish descent and spent his childhood in Oradea, Romania. In 1944, when he was 14 years old, Nagy-Talavera was arrested by Hungarian police and handed over to German authorities, who transported him to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he encountered the notorious Joseph Mengele. He survived Auschwitz and returned to Budapest in 1945 to find that his parents had also survived the war by hiding with Christian friends. In 1948 Nagy-Talavera enrolled at the University of Vienna. Because of his dissident activities, he fell afoul of SMERSH, the Red Army's counter-intelligence branch. Arrested, convicted of espionage, and sentenced to 25 years of slave labor, he spent the next seven years in the USSR's gulag system. He was released in late 1955, and returned to Budapest in time to participate in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. When the revolution was failed he fled to Vienna, and thence to the United States. Nagy-Talavera completed his Bachelor of Arts and Ph.D. degrees at the University of California, Berkeley. He taught Russian and Eastern European History at California State University, Chico from 1967 until his retirement in 1991. Nagy-Talavera was the author of many articles and books including on Nicolae Iorga (Nicolae Iorga: A Biography) and the Arrow Cross and the Iron Guard (The Green Shirts and the Others: A History of Fascism in Hungary and Romania).

It was Video System's only attempt in the fighting game genre, and it was created during the fighting game trend of the 1990s that was popularized by Capcom's 1991 arcade hit Street Fighter II. Gameplay The game takes place on Earth, where eight martial artists from around the planet compete against each other to fight and defeat the legendary master and reveal the secrets of Ta‚Ä¢o Taido. The game appears to be similar to other 2D versus fighting games during its release, but has different gameplay. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in single round matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player, while using very simplistic commands that summon charging attacks. Players press and hold two out of three buttons down to charge up, then move the joystick toward a direction to perform an attack. The longer the players hold two buttons down, the more powerful and longer the attack gets and lasts; however, there are three levels of energy, and after the third and highest charge, it returns to the first and lowest charge. Short charges create weak moves, medium charges create moderate moves, and long charges create strong attacks. Both players have 3 levels of health in each round, instead of one like in most other fighting games. Ta‚Ä¢o Taido also has a cooperative 2-player feature similar to the ones in SNK's Street Smart and Fatal Fury: King of Fighters. The controls can be switched to what most other fighting games have. If B. Chung is beaten, the game is won and over. Characters Players have a character roster of eight fighters to choose from, and one unplayable boss.

The genus name Indigofera is Neo-Latin for \\"bearing Indigo\\" (Indigo is a purple dye originally obtained from some Indigofera species). Australis, from the Latin, means not ‚ÄúAustralian‚Äù but \\"southern\\", referring to the geographical distribution of the species.  Description  Its natural habit is upright, to 2 m (7 ft) high, with flexible stems. The leaves are pinnate, openly spaced on the stems, around 10 cm long and velvety smooth to the touch. The flower color is unusual, ranging through soft purple hues, often pinkish and a change from other species flowering at the same time. The flowers are smooth, in short spires in the leaf axils, freely produced and showy, outlining the curves of the stems. They may open at any time from mid- September and may continue till November in a cool spring. It can regrow and sucker from rootstocks and lateral roots after fire.  Distribution  A very common and widespread species in Australia, Indigofera australis grows in a variety of different habitats, mainly open woodland and eucalypt forest, but also in desert and in the margins of rainforest. It is widespread in southern Australia from the southeastern Western Australia to northeastern Queensland.  Habitat value  It is an excellent habitat plant for wildlife.

Initially formed in 2006 by Ben Bruce, the band officially established as a six-piece in 2008 with the founding line-up consisting of Bruce, Worsnop, Cassells, Liddell, Joe Lancaster and Ryan Binns. After the departure of Lancaster and Binns, as well as the recruitment of bassist Sam Bettley in 2009, the band released their debut album Stand Up and Scream (2009). The band released two studio albums Reckless & Relentless (2011) and From Death to Destiny (2013), before the departure of Worsnop in January 2015. He was replaced by Denis Stoff and the band released The Black (2016). Stoff departed from the band in October that year, and Worsnop subsequently returned to the band. The band released their self-titled fifth album in late 2017, which was a marked stylistic departure from their previous works. Their recent sixth studio album, Like a House on Fire, which was released on 15 May 2020, shows the group's continuity of a more straight forward and melodic hard rock sound, while also shift into different genres.  History   Formation, early releases and Stand Up and Scream (2006‚Äì2009)  Ben Bruce, the band's current lead guitarist and backing vocalist, originally formed the band in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2006. The band's original line-up consisted of completely different members compared to that of the band's line-up from 2008 and released their debut EP, Tomorrow. Hope. Goodbye. in 2006, then followed up with their debut album titled The Irony of Your Perfection in 2007. After realizing he wouldn't be able to achieve international success in Dubai, he moved back to England, Nottingham in 2008 and reassembled the band with new members from the local area, including lead singer Danny Worsnop, whom he had moved into his flat apartment in York. Later that year the band became a six- piece after recruiting Ryan Binns on synthesizers, James Cassells on drums, Joe Lancaster on bass and Cameron Liddell on rhythm guitar. Later that year Binns decided to leave the band and in January 2009 and Lancaster also decided to leave and was replaced with Sam Bettley. Lancaster later joined the metalcore band With One Last Breath. Bruce carried the name of his previous band over to his new one, due to not wanting the bother of coming up with a new one. However, he insists that despite having the same name, it is not the same band. When asked why he chose that particular name, he explained that \\"'Most bands have a pretty shit band name, so I just came up with something. I came up with Alexandria as a human name, because people relate to humans.\\" although the reason for using the word 'asking' is not explained.

This time, the album did chart in the UK, peaking at 7 on the UK Rock Chart, and also charted in Australia at 30 on the Australian Albums Chart. The band also released a cover of Akon's song Right Now (Na Na Na) for the Punk Goes... compilation series, specifically for the album Punk Goes Pop 3. Asking Alexandria later performed at the \\"Soundwave 2011 Festival\\" in Australia during late February and early March. In April and May the band headlined in the UK with support acts Of Mice & Men and Chelsea Grin. Also in April comedian Charlie Sheen had offered the band a spot on his 'My Violent Torpedo Of Truth' tour across the US however the band had to turn it down due to their touring schedule at the time, but expressed their flattery and admitted to being fans of Sheen. The group was also the headliner for the \\"Vans Warped Tour\\" 2011 in July. The band co- headlined a toured with rap rock band Hollywood Undead throughout November across America, dubbed the World War III tour. After their tour both bands supported Avenged Sevenfold during their headline arena tour throughout the remainder of November to mid December. In 2012 the band was listed by Revolver under the most anticipated albums of 2012, with Danny Worsnop giving the statement that the general sound of the album will be a \\"...musical baby of M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Slipknot.\\" In March the band participated in Dallas' 'South By So What?!' festival and later toured with support acts Trivium, Dir En Grey, I See Stars, Motionless In White and the Amity Affliction throughout North America from early March to early April, naming the tour 'Still Reckless'. In early May the band debuted a trailer for their short film titled Through Sin and Self-Destruction featuring the band members, said to contain a \\"controversial, uncensored look into the real lives of a new era of rock stars for today‚Äôs generation.\\" and was officially released on iTunes on 15 May. The film itself consists of the three music videos from their second album; \\"Reckless & Relentless\\", \\"To The Stage\\" and \\"Dear Insanity.\\" Asking Alexandria performing at Mayhem Festival 2012 On 5 August the band performed at the 2012 Mayhem Festival tour along with other bands such as Mot√∂rhead, Slayer and Slipknot. Later the same month the band offered a free download for their new song titled 'Run Free' and was said to be from their third album that had yet to be announced. A month later, when asked about the sound of the third album, Ben Bruce explained that the band had matured and in order to excel in their career they will be recording and releasing radio friendly singles, however this will not result in the sound of the overall album as he describes the rest of the album to be \\"balls-to-the-wall kind of stuff\\", adding that it would be released in 2013. In November the band headlined in Monster Energy's 'Outbreak Tour' throughout November and December across North America with support acts As I Lay Dying, Memphis May Fire, Attila and I See Stars who replaced Suicide Silence who had issues regarding the death of their singer, Mitch Lucker. Also in November the band performed at Metalfest California along the likes of Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying and Black Veil Brides. On 30 November the band released an EP exclusively through Revolver Magazine for free via subscription, containing covers of 80's rock bands including; Whitesnake, Journey, Def Leppard and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, along with their song Run Free released earlier that year. Towards the end of their Outbreak tour, Danny Worsnop sustained a torn vocal cord, causing him to sit out the New York performance and allow the singers of Atilla and I See Stars, along with a multi-talented roadie to perform vocal duties. Despite the injury the singer later performed at the memorial concert for Suicide Silence's Mitch Lucker in order to raise money for his now fatherless daughter.  From Death to Destiny (2013‚Äì2014)  After Worsnop tore his vocal cord in December 2012, he visited a doctor weeks prior to the events of January 2013, giving an update that he will need to rest his vocals until he has recovered fully but also reassured fans that this will not hinder the release of their third album as the majority of the recording had been complete before his injury. In January they performed a short headline tour across the UK with support acts Motionless in White and Betraying the Martyrs. In late March, the band released the first song of their third album titled 'The Death Of Me', and announced that the album will be released later that year in Summer. The official release date was later revealed to be 6 August with the album title, From Death to Destiny. Asking Alexandria at With Full Force 2013 The band toured across America in April and June with Whitechapel, Motionless In White, Chimaira and I Killed The Prom Queen, dubbing the tour 'Don't Pray For Us'. Also in April the band partook in the Rocklahoma festival. The band also performed at Rock on the Range festival in mid May. The band later performed at Rock AM Ring in Germany, Download in England, Graspop in Belgium and also With Full Force in Australia in June. From Death to Destiny was successfully released on 6 August, and became the band's highest charting album to date and their label's highest first-week selling album, debuting at 5 on the Billboard 200 and selling over 41,000 units. In September the band participated in the annual Aftershock Festival and later toured with nu metal band Korn in America in September and October as a support act, along with Love and Death. The band embarked on their own ‚ÄòFrom Death to Destiny‚Äô tour in October after touring with Korn, featuring support acts All That Remains, Sevendust and Emmure, across America. In 2014 the band performed at Soundwave in Australia in February and later released a cover of Nine Inch Nails song Closer for the compilation Punk Goes 90s Vol. 2 issued by Fearless Records in April, making it their second time they have recorded for the series. In March 2014, the lead single from their debut album, \\"Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)\\" was certified gold by the RIAA. Asking Alexandria was one of the main headlining bands in the annual Never Say Never Festival on 12 March, along with Bring Me the Horizon also headlining the festival. They later embarked on another headlining tour in North America, dubbed as the 'Break Down The Walls' tour, starting in March and ending in April, with support acts August Burns Red, We Came as Romans, Crown The Empire and Born of Osiris. The band also performed in South Africa in May. In July, the band was announced as the nominees for Alternative Press' first Music Awards, nominated for Best Live Band and Best International Band and also performed at the ceremony itself, covering Duran Duran's Hungry Like the Wolf featuring guest vocals from Jonathan Davis. On 15 December 2014, the band released their first official live DVD titled Live From Brixton And Beyond which features the bands sold-out London show at the O2 Academy Brixton, as well as behind-the-scenes and backstage footage from the performance, it also includes the unseen Reckless Halloween performance at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, all of the band's music videos and the 'Through Sin and Self-Destruction' short film.  Departure of Worsnop and The Black (2015‚Äì2016)  Denis Stoff was a part of Asking Alexandria from early 2015 until his departure in late 2016. On 22 January 2015, lead singer Danny Worsnop announced his departure from the band to focus on rock music with his new band We Are Harlot. He also stated that despite his departure, the band would continue touring. Lead guitarist Ben Bruce announced that there would be a new lead singer. Fans reacted to news in distress as they believe he was essential to the band's sound, while others were not surprised by his career move, some going as far to say he performs better with his new band We Are Harlot than he does with Asking Alexandria. When Bruce was queried regarding his status with Worsnop he stated that he felt abandoned long before his departure since Worsnop's lost the care for screaming and heavier music since their release of their second album, and continued to say that he wouldn't know if he could call him and Worsnop friends. When Bruce was asked regarding the sound of the fourth album, he stated that while it will feature influences of Guns N' Roses and Van Halen it will also feature influences from modern bands such as Avenged Sevenfold and Slipknot, stating that since the third album was such an unexpected change in musical style he believes that fans will expect further experimentation on the next, therefore having less backlash from their fan base. He has also stated that they started writing material for the album while on tour in summer of 2014 and had written around 18 tracks, and estimates that it will be released between July and August 2015. On 26 May 2015, Denis Stoff, formerly the guitarist and vocalist of Ukrainian metalcore bands Make Me Famous and Down & Dirty, was revealed as the new lead vocalist when the band released \\"I Won't Give In\\", their first single with him, on 27 May. Speculation regarding Stoff's involvement started shortly after Worsnop's departure due to similarities between Asking Alexandria and Make Me Famous (who were said to have been ripping off the band's sound); the fact that they were label mates would have made the transition easy for Stoff to make, and on his personal YouTube account he had covered multiple Asking Alexandria songs. Bruce was asked if he considered anyone else for the role and he stated that \\"It has to be Denis\\" going on to praise his much greater vocal range and since he was inspired by Worsnop in the earlier stages of Asking Alexandria he can perform their songs live much better than Worsnop could, however when Stoff himself was asked how he would distinguish himself from him, he stated he would not make any comparison since he is a completely different person. Asking Alexandria live in 2016 The band initially planned to perform for the first time with Stoff on 31 May at Manchester Academy 3 and at London Underworld a day after, however due to Stoff being unable to secure a visa in time for the shows, they had to cancel. They have also been announced as one of the acts for the 2015 Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park Festivals in Germany in early June. The band also announced that they will be performing at the 2015 Vans Warped Tour. In October, on their headlining tour through Europe, the band announced that the original plan to release the album in October/November has changed and that the fans can expect the album in early 2016 with a new single & music video in November. In late December it was revealed that the album's title was going to be The Black and is expected to be released in March 2016, and will be supporting British metal band Bullet for My Valentine in North America from 2 February to 7 March, dubbed the British Invasion tour.  Worsnop's return and self-titled album (2016‚Äì2018) Asking Alexandria live at Rock am Ring in 2018 In mid-October, it was speculated that the band had settled their differences with original lead vocalist Danny Worsnop and that some sort of collaborative effort would be made after several pictures were posted of Worsnop and Bruce in the studio together. However, it was revealed two days later that Worsnop had actually returned to the band as an official member after the departure of Denis Stoff. Ben Bruce explained that after a long period of time of not communicating with the band, Stoff stated, \\"Asking Alexandria does not exist unless I get what‚Äôs owed to me\\". Worsnop also opened up about his return to the band, stating that \\"this is something that [he] can embrace again\\". When the band performed again for the first time with Worsnop since Stoff's departure, their set list excluded all songs from their most recent album The Black and instead consisted of songs that they had not performed in years. This occurred just as the band headlined Sumerian's \\"Ten Years in the Black Tour\\" supported by Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, I See Stars, Upon a Burning Body, After the Burial, and Bad Omens. As time went on more information regarding Stoff had been released, such as that Stoff had lip-synced the band's older songs during live performances, an accusation made by Worsnop's lawyers who notified him after sending Stoff a cease and desist. When asked about Stoff's time as his replacement, Worsnop replied stating that \\"Replace is a strong word. He was just keeping my seat warm. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know the kid so I have no opinion of him as a person‚Ä¶\\" Stoff claims that his departure was due to personal stress caused by the unrest in his home country of Ukraine. The band released their first studio material with Worsnop back in the band on 21 September 2017, the single \\"Into the Fire\\" which would be the lead single from their upcoming album. The band released a second single from the album, entitled \\"Where Did It Go?\\", on 25 October 2017. On 15 December 2017, the band released their self-titled fifth studio album. The album marked a significant stylistic shift from the band's earlier metalcore work, incorporating influences from a wide pool of genres including stadium rock.  Like a House on Fire (2019‚Äìpresent) On 11 July 2019, the band released their new song called \\"The Violence\\". On 6 December, the band unveiled the dubstep remix of their song, \\"The Violence\\" by the electronic artist \\"Sikdope\\". The band would go on to finish the year off by re-releasing their fifth album as a belated Christmas present to fans and as an anniversary to their much acclaimed album. The re-release features six bonus tracks including a rock rendition of a previous track, a demo, an acoustic track, a cover and a mash-up. The band announced their headline tour after two years along with Falling in Reverse, Wage War and Hyro the Hero, the tour is called 'Like A House On Fire World Tour'. It is intended to be a world tour. On 11 February 2020, the band announced that a new single named \\"They Don't Want What We Want (And They Don't Care)\\" would premiere on Octane on 12 February. On 4 March, the band announced their upcoming sixth studio album titled Like a House on Fire set for release on 15 May 2020. At the same day, the band released the third single of the album titled \\"Antisocialist\\" and its corresponding music video. On 15 April, the band released the fourth single \\"Down to Hell\\" alongside an accompanying lyric video. On 11 May, four days before the album release, the band released their fifth single \\"House on Fire\\". Musical style The band's music has mostly been described as metalcore, but has also been labelled post- hardcore, screamo, hard rock, and heavy metal. Additionally, it was also sometimes described as electronicore on their early work. Their first two Sumerian albums, 2009's Stand Up and Scream and 2011's Reckless & Relentless, are both generally considered to be metalcore albums, while their fourth album, 2013's From Death to Destiny, is influenced by heavy metal and rock bands while maintaining Asking Alexandria's signature metalcore sound on certain tracks. Guitarist Ben Bruce has stated that they do not like writing music that sounds the same from album to album, which is why their musical style has changed over time.  Lyrical style  Ben Bruce has expressed the feeling that the band's lyrical style before Reckless & Relentless was immature. According to Bruce, the band wanted to move on from yelling out lyrics like \\"fuck\\" and \\"you stupid fucking whore\\" to a more mature style with more meaning. He stated that From Death to Destiny is lyrically their most mature album, no longer focusing on subjects such as drugs and women, and much more meaningful than their older lyrics. Danny Worsnop has claimed that the band's lyrics are never written before entering the studio and are always improvised during the recording of an album.  Influences  All of the band's members have expressed their passion for 1980s rock music, and demonstrated it with releases such as the Life Gone Wild EP featuring covers of two Skid Row songs or the Under the Influence: A Tribute to the Legends of Hard Rock EP featuring covers of songs by bands such as Journey, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Whitesnake and Def Leppard. Their third studio album From Death to Destiny is heavily influenced by such bands. Some of their favorite artists include Guns N' Roses, Metallica, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Sebastian Bach, Skid Row and Van Halen, but they also take influence from modern bands such as Slipknot and Avenged Sevenfold.

T. Tutte. The Tutte 12-cage is the unique (3-12)-cage . It was discovered by C. T. Benson in 1966.Benson, C. T. \\"Minimal Regular Graphs of Girth 8 and 12.\\" Can. J. Math. 18, 1091-1094, 1966. It has chromatic number 2 (bipartite), chromatic index 3, girth 12 (as a 12-cage) and diameter 6. Its crossing number is 170 and has been conjectured to be the smallest cubic graph with this crossing number.Exoo, G. \\"Rectilinear Drawings of Famous Graphs\\".Pegg, E. T. and Exoo, G. \\"Crossing Number Graphs.\\" Mathematica J. 11, 2009. Construction The Tutte 12-cage is a cubic Hamiltonian graph and can be defined by the LCF notation [17, 27, -13, -59, -35, 35, -11, 13, -53, 53, -27, 21, 57, 11, -21, -57, 59, -17]7.Polster, B. A Geometrical Picture Book. New York: Springer, p. 179, 1998. There are, up to isomorphism, precisely two generalized hexagons of order (2,2) as proved by Cohen and Tits. They are the split Cayley hexagon H(2) and its point-line dual. Clearly both of them have the same incidence graph, which is in fact isomorphic to the Tutte 12-cage. The Balaban 11-cage can be constructed by excision from the Tutte 12-cage by removing a small subtree and suppressing the resulting vertices of degree two.Balaban, A. T. \\"Trivalent Graphs of Girth Nine and Eleven and Relationships Among the Cages.\\" Rev. Roumaine Math 18, 1033-1043, 1973. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Tutte 12-cage is of order and is a semi-direct product of the projective special unitary group PSU(3,3) with the cyclic group Z/2Z.Geoffrey Exoo & Robert Jajcay, Dynamic cage survey, Electr. J. Combin. 15 (2008). It acts transitively on its edges but not on its vertices, making it a semi-symmetric graph, a regular graph that is edge-transitive but not vertex- transitive. In fact, the automorphism group of the Tutte 12-cage preserves the bipartite parts and acts primitively on each part. Such graphs are called bi- primitive graphs and only five cubic bi-primitive graphs exist; they are named the Iofinova-Ivanov graphs and are of order 110, 126, 182, 506 and 990.Iofinova, M. E. and Ivanov, A. A. \\"Bi-Primitive Cubic Graphs.\\" In Investigations in the Algebraic Theory of Combinatorial Objects. pp. 123-134, 2002. (Vsesoyuz. Nauchno-Issled. Inst. Sistem. Issled., Moscow, pp. 137-152, 1985.) All the cubic semi-symmetric graphs on up to 768 vertices are known. According to Conder, Malniƒç, Maru≈°iƒç and Potoƒçnik, the Tutte 12-cage is the unique cubic semi-symmetric graph on 126 vertices and is the fifth smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph after the Gray graph, the Iofinova-Ivanov graph on 110 vertices, the Ljubljana graph and a graph on 120 vertices with girth 8.. The characteristic polynomial of the Tutte 12-cage is : (x-3)x^{28}(x+3)(x^2-6)^{21}(x^2-2)^{27}.\\\\ It is the only graph with this characteristic polynomial; therefore, the 12-cage is determined by its spectrum.

The problems often include the decay of timber framing which, in extreme cases, have made buildings structurally unsound. Some buildings have become unhealthy to live in due to moulds and spores developing within the damp timber framing. The repairs and replacement costs that may have been avoided were estimated in 2009 to be approximately NZ$11.3 billion.  Factors  The Building Act 1991, which became law in 1993, changed building controls from a prescriptive system to a more self-regulated regime. In addition, the Government dropped the apprentice training system for builders and the related building trades. Some developers and builders knowingly or carelessly constructed buildings with numerous faults and short- cuts. An architectural design trend towards Mediterranean-style houses with complex roofs, plastered exterior walls, internal decks and small or no eaves also factored in. Some local authorities were later found to have issued Building Consents based on insufficient documentation, failed to carry out inspection of the work during construction, and issued code compliance certificates for buildings which were later found to have leaking problems. Consequently some councils now share significant financial responsibilities with the builders (which in many cases have closed or otherwise removed themselves from liability) and the owners. Court cases have generally assigned around one third of the financial responsibility to local authorities. A 2013 Supreme Court case involving the Auckland City Council extended the liability of local bodies.  Causes  There are many reasons that some buildings from the late 1980s were leaky. Cladding systems A major one was the increase in the use of cladding systems such as fibre cement sheet (generic name Fibrolite in New Zealand) and EIPS (Externally Insulated Plaster System) that relied on a paint finish as the primary defence against water ingress. This system is very similar to Exterior insulation finishing system (or EIFS). Such cladding systems typically allowed for little construction or thermal movement so that fine cracks that appeared insignificant, and would have been relatively insignificant in traditional claddings such as weatherboard, allowed continuous ingress of moisture into the framing. These causes, combined with the reduced air movement through the prevalence of sheet cladding or sheet insulating materials for the monolithic look cladding, resulted in very damp conditions which are ideal for rot. A further exacerbating factor that resulted in more significant damage from the leaks, was the change to the New Zealand Standard for Timber Treatment in 1995, allowing the use of untreated Pinus radiata timber for wall framing. As this timber has little natural resistance to rot when wet, damage occurs more quickly. In many cases claddings were not used within their specifications or not installed correctly. Many buildings built in the \\"Mediterranean\\" style used these types of cladding and had features such as recessed windows, flat roofs, minimal eaves, multiple storeys, complex roofs, solid balustrades, balconies and penetrations of the exterior cladding that increased the likelihood of water infiltrating the structure. Drawings Lack of detailed drawings for buildings was also a contributing factor. Some builders were unable to make a weathertight structure without proper guidance. This has partially been blamed on the breakdown of the apprenticeship system and unqualified builders in the marketplace. Council staff carrying out building inspections had neither the required construction expertise to ensure weathertightness nor the intuition to look for it. Juvenile sapwood A likely major contributing factor was the exhaustion of New Zealand's \\"First Rotation\\" (50-60 year old) Pinus Radiata crop in the late 1980s, and the change to using short rotation 25-30 year old Pinus Radiata at the same time. The \\"new crop\\" Radiata timber was found, in an \\"unpleasant surprise\\" to consist near entirely of juvenile sapwood, - a type of wood found in only limited quantities in traditional forestry timbers and classified as a type of \\"abnormal\\" or \\"atypical\\" wood. Juvenile wood (aka apically influenced wood, aka core-wood) is present in all trees in small amounts near the center of the trunk, with the remainder of the wood comprising mature wood, and there being a spectrum in the change in cellular qualities outwards from the core from the most pronounced juvenile wood to normal mature wood. With age, the juvenile wood and mature wood is progressively converted to heartwood, stabilising it to a degree, so a tree can have juvenile sapwood, juvenile heartwood, mature sapwood and mature heartwood. Juvenile wood of both types is intrinsically inferior in all functional qualities to mature wood, but juvenile sapwood is the most problematic. A peculiar aspect of some conifers, which would appear to be a fire-adaption, is that when growing in post-fire environments or plantation forestry environments, production of juvenile wood is exaggerated and continues to a greater extent (in terms of number of annual growth rings outwards from the core) than in other woods. This is intrinsically linked to an unusually rapid rate of growth, such as seen in Radiata. New Zealand Radiata had always had more juvenile wood present than found in traditional forestry species. This had previously caused substantial problems in construction use in the 1950s and 1960s, but these had greatly diminished by the 1970s when Radiata's use became mainstream. This was because (a) the then advanced age of the First Rotation crop meant that much more of the first/butt log of each tree consisted of mature sapwood and juvenile heartwood; and (b) most of the first rotation had not been pruned, resulting in much of the worst of the central core of juvenile wood already being excluded by virtue of comprising a large \\"defect core\\" resulting from the unpruned branches. All of that changed at the end of the 1980s with the second-rotation, when for the first time since the 1950s and 1960s large quantities of juvenile sapwood started to hit the market. This was exacerbated by much of the mature wood being preferentially diverted to non-structural uses, in particular as clear- board timber, which was achieving a higher price. While in the 50's and 60's use of Radiata in construction was heavily promoted, by the 1960's its use was not recommended by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute or the New Zealand Institute of Forestry in their publications for any exterior residential construction, no matter how treated, due to its instability issues. Such use remained illegal under local building regulations throughout much of the Country as at 1960. Its use in framing remained (contrary to much currently published material) limited and near experimental in nature. Even by the early-mid 1970s a minority of New Zealand homes used Radiata in framing, and Radiata was typically more expensive to use than native woods. The 1970s was the time period which saw a changeover from native timbers being the mainstay of construction, and arguably it was not until the 1980s when having a combination of both Radiata framing and Radiata cladding became at all mainstream. As warned by New Zealand's Forest Research Institute in 1992, some four years after significant quantities of the new crop started being used in construction but before the Leaky Homes crisis emerged, the new timber was problematic. Specifically, it was of lower strength, was prone to more distortion and surface checks, had low density, high spiral grain, and abnormal longitudinal shrinkage (and expansion). The latter quality had been blamed overseas for excessive movement in response to atmospheric conditions. Overseas studies of similar short-rotation produced juvenile sapwood had concluded it was so different from \\"normal\\" wood that it would be wise to treat it as though it were a completely different species. New methodologies to utilize the wood would have to be developed. Arguably the greatest issue was its significant longitudinal shrinkage and expansion (some seven times, on average, greater than any wood previously used in modern construction) and since shown to be sufficient to buckle structural members and associated cladding and roofing materials. Such movement was, and continues to be, of particular significance for rigid exterior claddings which during the Leaky Building crisis were found to have been suffering cracking, and the entry of water through capillary action, at an unprecedented rate. Similar failures had been experienced in British Columbia from the early to mid-1980s when quantities of its \\"Second Growth\\" structural timbers began to enter the market, with those timbers too containing unprecedented amounts of juvenile sapwood. The United States had also in the early 1980s seen a small spate of significant construction failures due to the presence of juvenile sapwood in plantation grown Loblolly Pine that was entering the market, which led to much of the early research on the topic. A crash research-project by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute to, amongst other objectives, attempt to identify how the new crop Radiata could safely be used in construction took place between 1995 and 1998 NZJFor 47(3) 2002 - \\"Value Recovery Project (1995-98) - What Did we Learn\\" - D. Cown. That project gave rise to many of the innovations and regulatory measures later implemented to attempt to allow for safe construction using juvenile sapwood including, notably, the rise of LVL and other laminated structural products. However intrinsic, and to date intractable, problems remain. The cellular structure of the wood is so non- durable and unstable (containing cell walls of completely distinct chemical and physical composition compared to normal wood)that even boron treated Radiata has exceedingly low durability, - indeed indistinguishable from untreated Radiata in graveyard testing. The sheer instability of modern Radiata means modern homes rely predominantly upon extensive flashings and moisture barriers to protect structural elements. The added complexity, cost, and often experimental nature of these systems renders homebuilding and maintenance a far more challenging exercise than previously the case. Such moisture barriers by their very nature tend to trap humidity, and because boron treated Radiata sapwood framing (juvenile or not) remains vulnerable to mould (and indeed boron actively encourages the growth of some moulds) modern New Zealand homes tend to suffer persistent, atypical, mould problems. Interbreeding with failed \\"improved\\" strains of Radiata produced in the 1970s has, since the 2000s, further reduced wood density by an average of approx 10%. Kiln drying, near ubiquitous since 1990, has recently, unexpectedly, been found to significantly increase permeability of Radiata by action upon resin ducts. Significantly New Zealand's exports of Radiata timber for structural use remains near nil, with the few trading partners who do allow use of New Zealand Radiata for construction tending to have express restrictions in place to attempt to exclude the worst of the juvenile wood.  Aftermath  The Building Act 1991 was replaced by the Building Act 2004, which introduced a licensing scheme for building designers, builders and related trades. Councils were required to be registered with a central authority and were to be subject to regular quality control procedure checks. Council building inspectors remain unlicensed. The Government dissolved the BIA (Building Industry Authority, the Government department which was responsible for the oversight and administration of the building sector) on 30 November 2004 and replaced it with DBH (Department of Building and Housing). Some of the Acceptable Solutions to the Building Code were re-written, most notably E2/AS1 External Moisture which covers the detailing of roofs and walls was greatly expanded. The Standard covering durability of timber framing was amended in late 2003 with the publication of NZS 3602: 2003 Timber and Wood-based Products for Use in Building. This revision required a return to the use of treated radiata framing in external walls. The Overview Group on the Weathertightness of Buildings that was appointed by the Building Industry Authority (\\"the BIA\\") to investigate the causes of the leaky building crisis did receive several submissions (including from the New Zealand Institute of Forestry, but not apparently from the New Zealand Forest Research Institute) suggesting that the reduced rotation age of the then current Radiata Crop might be a causal factor in the leaky building crisis. In its final 2002 report the Overview Group recommended to the BIA that research be conducted as to whether there were any \\"issues regarding the structural strength and durability with respect to the maturity of timber\\". The outcome of that recommendation is currently unknown, with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment advising in July 2019 that it had been unable to locate any records at all relating to any research or consultation having been undertaken in response to the Overview Group's recommendation. Short rotation juvenile sapwood continues to be used throughout home construction in New Zealand, as the same cell-wall abnormalities which render it problematic for construction purposes render it vastly cheaper to process for pulp, and the short rotation is eminently suitable for the production of cheap \\"wood\\" for non-structural manufacturing use. A return to 50-60 year crop rotations remains unlikely, as the 25 year crop rotation was only recommended and adopted in the late 1960s due to (a) the lack of profitability of the 50-60 year crop rotation in terms of producing structural timber, and (b) in recognition that even the 50-60 year rotation was incapable of producing structural timber of a quality which would have any material international demand. While concerns were raised regularly by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute in published studies from 1980 onwards as the adequacy of the likely qualities of the Second Rotation's short-rotation crop, the reality was that by 1988 there were insufficient other domestic timber resources (other than native trees, which required conservation) that could meet New Zealand's demand for structural timber. While considerable research continues by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute into the divergent anatomical, physical and chemical properties of juvenile sapwood, and scientific papers on the topic are regularly published by it, since the Leaky Homes Crisis emerged there has been little if any further published mention by it (or any Government body) of any possibility of juvenile wood causing construction failures, let alone linking juvenile wood to the Leaky Homes Crisis. Most current Government and industry publications, in defiance of the contemporaneous historical records, present the Leaky Homes Crisis as being an anomaly, and present Radiata as having been the predominantly used construction timber in New Zealand since 1945 (some 25 years before its actual use became at all prevalent). Consequently, few of the public in New Zealand (or even in the construction industry) have any awareness that the Radiata used in house construction in New Zealand since the late 1980s has been substantially different, and worse, than prior Radiata or Australian Radiata. Nor do many appreciate that the Radiata in structural use prior to the late 1980s was regarded by the industry and Government as being not only an expensive failure but also as being of extremely low quality. Nor is there any general awareness of how extensive the changes that have had to be implemented have been (to the extent of having to reformulate glues and resins to work with the new wood) to allow modern houses constructed using juvenile sapwood to stand any reasonable chance of lasting even 50 years, or of how unusual our residential construction remains relative to international practice and performance criteria. Accordingly no legal responsibility, or even criticism has ever rebounded onto the industry, or Government in relation to the use of short rotation and/or juvenile sapwood.  Housing affected  Several thousands of homes throughout the country are still awaiting renovation, with a total cost that has been estimated by a Price Waterhouse Coopers report to the Government in 2008 as being around NZ$11.3 billion for a consensus estimate of 42,000 buildings.Leaky home obligations 'overlooked' by Catherine Harris in Sunday Star-Times 15 July 2012 p. A7 Other building experts estimate the true cost at $23 billion for 89,000 buildings, and accused government of reducing the figure of affected buildings to 42,000 buildings because they were allegedly \\"unhappy\\" with the expert prediction.  Other buildings  The majority of affected buildings are homes or apartments, but in 2011 the twenty-year-old Ronald McDonald House for children with cancer and their families at Wellington Hospital was demolished as leaky and replaced.  Schools affected  The Minister of Education said in 2009 that at least 73 schools were affected, and in 2011 that 157 schools still needed repairs, at an estimated cost of at least $1.5 billion As of 2013 the Ministry of Education was taking action against architects and builders involved with 87 of the 309 schools which have \\"leakiness\\" problems. One school in Wellington, Seatoun School, built at a cost of $5.3 million and opened in 2002 is costing $4.5 million to repair.  Financial liabilities  As of mid-2009, plans for an up to NZ$6 billion bailout package shared between government and local authorities are in doubt because the amount could affect New Zealand's international credit rating. In November 2009, the National government decided not to offer a more substantial sharing of costs, and it is now estimated that in most cases, around 64% would have to be borne by the owners, 26% by Councils, and only 10% by government funds, while also forcing homeowners to sign away their rights to sue for more. Prime Minister John Key noted that while claimants did not have to accept the settlement, legal costs for bringing suit could eat up any further money awarded to them. Some claimants have taken negligence claims against company directors of construction companies, relying on the decision in Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd [1984] 2 NZLR 548. There have also been accusations that parts of the legal and inspection professions are profiting substantially from disputes around the cases, and that significant money was diverted into these channels rather than into fixing the buildings. The government's position was assailed by mayors of affected Councils and by pundits, who noted that by paying only 10%, and then receiving 12.5% back in goods and services tax, the government was actually making money from the crisis. Another report commissioned by North Shore City Council estimated a potential gain by government of up to $2 billion. Further, National was also criticised that as an opposition party, they had constantly asked for the then Labour-led government to assist homeowners financially. The government has also imposed a 10-year limit (after construction) on claims, even though some building experts believe many cases will only become apparent during coming years, as building rot becomes advanced enough. They also warned that houses in drier parts of New Zealand were now starting to show problems, which had simply developed at a slower pace ‚Äì and that despite Building Act reforms in 2004, there were still houses being built that leaked badly due to shoddy workmanship. Timber needs a sustained period of wetting to form mould and subsequently rot. In laymens terms, the timber has to be wet longer than it is dry. In drier areas of the country it is unlikely the timber will remain wet long enough to instigate mould formation. In February 2010, New Zealand's Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson, National, warned that the size of the issue, at least $11 billion, was so gianormous [sic] that even a government with budget surpluses would struggle. He noted that: \\"...a Government who's [sic] running deficits - and has a forecast track of deficits for many years out - has to just sit there with its head in its hands, saying, 'Well, I just don't how to do this'.\\" He also warned that it was necessary to come up with a solution so money could be spent on fixing houses, rather than paying lawyers, and that there was a risk of significant rates rises in the major centres like Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington and Christchurch, of a scale that would \\"make eyes water\\". In May 2010 the New Zealand Government launched the Financial Assistance Package (FAP) for leaky homes. Under the scheme, the home owner shares the agreed cost of repairing their home with the government and the local council, if the council approved the original work and is participating in the scheme. The government and the council each contribute 25% of the repair cost with the owner paying the remaining 50%. Despite the FAP offering to give the homeowners the certainty of financial contribution and to help get leaky homes fixed faster, by November 2012 only 12 victims had received final payouts under the government scheme. In 2009 it was estimated between 22,000 and 89,000 properties were affected, but the government's scheme would cover around 3,500 at the most.  Rates impact  Councils and politicians have indicated that the crisis could increase rates bills. From mid-2011, council must take leaky home syndrome into account when re-valuing homes, even if the home has not leaked. This takes into account that such homes face widespread stigma and are harder to sell. The lower values meant some owners paid 5% to 20% less for their rates, but other ratepayers had to pay more to make up the difference.  Effect on liable firms  The placing into liquidation of Mainzeal Construction and Property, New Zealand‚Äôs third largest construction company, in February 2013 was blamed on both a slowdown in commercial construction work and liability for several leaky apartment buildings in Auckland and Wellington where other parties had gone out of existence.  Similarities to British Columbia  A similar problem arose in the early 1980s, some 10 years before New Zealand and for similar reasons in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is commonly known in Canada as the Leaky condo crisis and has been an ongoing issue that is estimated to have caused $4 billion in damage since the 1980s.Vancouver Condo Expert Gerry Fanaken, Georgia Straight, 22 May 2013.

The festival features Azerbaijani fruit- cuisine mainly the pomegranates from Goychay. At the festival, a parade is held with traditional Azerbaijani dances and Azerbaijani music.iguide.travel Goychay Activities: Pomegranate Festival There are also several competitions such as; the biggest pomegranate or pomegranate eating competition. The festival usually takes place in October, and attracts about 5000 to 7000 visitors.  History  Goychay Pomegranate Festival was held for the first time on 3 November 2006 jointly by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Executive Authority of the Goychay Region. Indeed, starting from 2006, the festival have been held annually in every autumn (mainly in Octaber) displaying original dishes from different varieties of pomegranate. In fact, the spectators and participants of the festival expand each year. In 2013, Representatives from approximately 20 foreign countries participated in the event along with the state and government officials.  Concept  Goychay is considered the pomegranate capital of Azerbaijan because many varieties of pomegranates are grown in the city. The most famous sorts of pomegranate are Veles, Shirin, Gyuleysha and Shihbaba. Therefore, the city has been chosen as the location for the festival. The festival features a fair and an exhibition that displays different varieties of pomegranates as well as various pomegranate products produced by local enterprises. During the festival national music such as mugham and different folklore examples are presented every year. Participants of the event are familiarized with the exhibition of hand-made products from the residents of the region. The pomegranates that grown in separate villages of Goychay region and the products that made of pomegranate like juice, juice concentrates, jam, jelly, grenadine, wine, seeds in syrup are brought to the district center and displayed at the exhibition organized at the city square. The festival also includes young athletes‚Äô performances and concert programs that are available to watch in the city center. The guests can see various the craftsmen, master craftsmen, potters, millers, blacksmiths, artists and dancers, athletes and performances of folklore groups, as well children's drawings, paintings, music, songs and dances.  Activities within the festival  The activities within the festival changed over years and gained more spectators and participators. Types of events in the festival include ceremonies, competitions, dancing events, fairs, parades, performances, etc. For example, the 10th festival of the pomegranate opened with the participation of music and dance groups.2. The competitions at the festival such as the fastest eating of pomegranates, the ability to squeeze pomegranate juice, and the biggest pomegranate are held annually. In 12th festival of the pomegranate the contest \\"the most beautiful pomegranate girl\\" was held.

His 1987 book Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies (updated in 1996) is the reference standard for Laurel and Hardy fans (known as Sons of the Desert after their appreciation society, which itself derives from the 1933 Laurel and Hardy film of the same name). In 2016, Skretvedt put the book through a massive update and enhancement, retitling it LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES (ULTIMATE EDITION) and publishing it through Bonaventure Press as an oversized 8-1/2 x 11 hardcover book, increasing the text by 50% and quadrupling the number of pictures included. Early supporters of the Kickstarter campaign for this edition also received a custom audio CD of selected excerpts from Mr. Skretvedt's interviews with Laurel and Hardy colleagues and co-workers. Skretvedt is also the host of the radio show Forward Into the Past, which airs weekly on KSPC-FM in Claremont, California (88.7-FM and KSPC online). His nom de heterodyne is Randy Brian.  Early years  Skretvedt's interests in vintage media started in childhood and range across the board, including films, music and radio. His primary area of focus is the period between the world wars: the 1920s, '30s and '40s. His penchant for collecting was evident early on; even as a child he began acquiring books, records, memorabilia, rare photos, letters, ephemera, documents ‚Äì even Super 8mm prints of classic film comedies. He was a precocious communicator: his professional writing began at just 16, when he wrote a series of articles for Private Screenings, a magazine devoted to vintage movies.  Young Turk in the Sons  It was only natural that a Laurel and Hardy fan with an interest the intensity of Skretvedt's would find his way to The Sons of the Desert, the international appreciation society for the duo. Skretvedt joined as a young teen and immediately recognized that the surviving members of Laurel and Hardy casts and crews were not going to be around forever, so he commenced interviewing them and cultivating the \\"inside stories\\" that would become the backbone of his work. Although he came along too late to interview either Laurel or Hardy, Skretvedt did debrief Oliver Hardy's widow, Stan Laurel's daughter, actors Anita Garvin and Dorothy Granger, music director Marvin Hatley, effects chief Roy Seawright, film editor Richard Currier and many, many other of their co-stars, directors and technicians. Perhaps his crowning interview ‚Äì certainly in prestige if not necessarily in the forthrightness of its subject ‚Äì was with Hal Roach, studio boss of \\"The Lot Of Fun,\\" Roach Studios, where \\"The Boys\\" did all their best work. Skretvedt had not a moment to spare in his archival work: most everyone who worked directly with Laurel and Hardy in any capacity has since died.  Music authority and music collector  Skretvedt's interest in the popular culture from the first half of the 20th century doesn't end with film and cinema; he is also a fan of, and an authority on, the music of the time. His activities as a determined collector extend into the musical realm as well. He is rightly proud of his amazing \\"Barn Full O‚Äô Records\\", a carpeted, air-conditioned shrine to all things musical from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Shelves of neatly organized 78rpm records reveal years of collecting, researching and cataloging dedication; additional stacks of CDs, tapes, 33- and 45-rpm records ‚Äì plus the vast array of apparatus needed to play them all back ‚Äì make it one of the most significant private archives of its kind. Skretvedt estimates the collection includes over 30,000 recordings.  Broadcaster  Skretvedt's vast music archive performs a public service function: it provides the playlist for Forward Into The Past, the weekly radio program that Skretvedt hosts under the moniker Randy Brian. The three-hour program features two hours of primarily '20s, '30s and '40s music ‚Äì mostly jazzy danceband numbers and some novelty records ‚Äì flanking a central hour of vintage radio, comedy or drama. The program debuted in 1982. Forward Into The Past airs Sunday afternoons at 2 pm (PT) on KSPC 88.7 FM in Claremont, California and online at kspc.org.

He drew his lineage from the Syiemlieh clan. He was Syiem (chief) of Nongkhlaw, part of the Khasi Hills. His surname was Syiem Lieh. He was a constitutional head sharing corporate authority with his Council, general representatives of the leading clans within his territory. Tirot Sing declared war and fought against British for attempts to take over control of the Khasi Hills.Simon, I. M. (ed.) (1991) Chapter II History Meghalaya District Gazetteers, Shillong He died on 17 July 1835.Eastern Panorama U Tirot Sing His death is commemorated in Meghalaya as U Tirot Sing Day. Anglo-Khasi War and Martyrdom The British had gained control over the Brahmaputra valley after concluding the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826. Between their possessions in Sylhet and the newly acquired possessions in Lower Assam intervened the Khasi Hills. They wanted to construct a road through this area to connect Guwahati with Sylhet to save weeks of travel and malarious country. David Scott, the agent to the British Governor-General for the Northern Territory, found out that U Tirot Sing was interested in regaining possessions in the duars (passes into Assam) in return for the permission for the road project. After a two-day session of the durbar (court), the assembly agreed to the proposal of the British. Work on the road started. When Balaram Singh, Raja of Ranee, disputed U Tirot Sing's claims to the duars, he went with a party of armed men in December 1828 to establish his claim. He was confident that the British would support him; instead, he was confronted by a party of sepoys who blocked his passage. When news came that the British were reinforcing forces in Assam, U Tirot Sing convened a Durbar again and passed orders for the British to evacuate Nongkhlaw. The British did not pay any heed,Immortal Martyrs, Government of Meghalaya Official State Portal and the Khasis attacked the British garrison in Nongkhlaw on 4 April 1829. His men killed two British officers, and thus unleashed the fury of British retaliation. Military operations against U Tirot Sing and other Khasi chiefs started immediately. In the Anglo-Khasi War, the Khasis lacked firearms and had only swords, shields, bows and arrows. They were untrained in the British type of warfare and soon found that it was impossible to engage in open battle against an enemy who could kill from a distance. Therefore, they resorted to guerrilla activity, which dragged on for about four years. Tirot Sing fought with native weapons such as a sword and shield. He was shot at by the British and had to hide in a cave. He was eventually captured by the British in January 1833 and deported to Dhaka. The location of his hiding place was given by a chief of his who was bribed with gold coins by the British. He died on 17 July 1835. His death anniversary is commemorated every year as a state holiday in Meghalaya.

WwB has since its inception been putting research into practice through community-based strategies that combine theory and grassroots-level fieldwork. To date, WwB has conducted over 80 projects in some 30 countries with a focus on Female Leadership, Capacity Building, Gender Based Violence, Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE), and Empowering Dialogue. Responding to the growing threat of radicalisation by sensitising a hitherto neglected group to their roles and responsibilities in building community resilience from the ground up, WwB created the world's first female PVE platform: the Sisters Against Violent Extremism (SAVE) network. While addressing extremism is a priority among the range of distinct but interrelated WwB capacity building projects, this approach reflects WwB's longstanding, broader governing philosophy: translating research into action and empowering women to move from victimhood towards agency, the world over. SAVE network In 2008, Women without Borders launched SAVE (Sisters Against Violent Extremism), the first women's counter-terrorism platform. The first conference took place from November 28-December 1, 2008 at Palais Sch√∂nburg in Vienna. Thirty-three survivors of terrorist attacks, relatives of victims and terrorists, activists, and policy makers were invited to discuss their experiences,\\"Die Wut und das Mitgef√ºhl,\\" 4.20.2007, Die Presse strategize methods to combat violent extremism, and to create the SAVE declaration.\\"Es gibt keinen Ort, wo wir sicher sind,\\" 12.1.2008, Die Presse SAVE campaigns include: Schools/Students Against Violent Extremism! and Mothers for Change! which attempt to provide constructive alternatives to the appeal of extremist ideologies.\\"2010 - Seven Who Build Autonomy\\" womensenews.org WwB started student groups under the Students Against Violent Extremism campaign in Delhi, Lucknow and Mumbai,\\"SAVE: Making a difference\\" Hard News conducting educational and interactive seminars attended by survivors of terrorist attacks for University and school children, with the aim of sensitizing them to the role they can play in combating extremism.\\"Tapping into girl power\\" Hindustan Times SAVE is implementing similar projects with schools in Yemen and Indonesia.

The 'MotherSchools: Parenting for Peace' Model Women without Borders began introducing the notion of Mothers Preventing Violent Extremism (MPVE) in the context of its SAVE network of projects and initiatives from 2008. Responding to its research study findings from surveys and interviews with 1023 mothers across five countries, WwB developed and designed the pioneering ‚ÄòMotherSchools: Parenting for Peace‚Äô Model. When put into practice, this bottom-up prevention approach positions concerned and affected mothers as the first line of defence in at-risk communities. The curriculum strengthens the participant's individual capacity, capability, and emotional literacy, and heightens her awareness of radical influences. WwB has been advancing local and regional security through contextualised iterations of the programme, and to date has engaged over two thousand mothers in twelve countries across Western and Eastern Europe; Central, South, and Southeast Asia; the Middle East; and Sub-Saharan Africa. MotherSchools also upgrade existing social services and local capacity by providing civil society stakeholders in at-risk regions with the essential structures, tools, and skills to address and counteract extremist ideologies. Owing to its proven track record, WwB's MotherSchools Model has emerged as a recognised good practice and contributed to rethinking and reshaping countering and preventing violent extremism (P/CVE) policy worldwide. Projects and Activities Since its inception, Women Without Borders has conducted a variety of projects in countries of crisis and transition, including Chennai in Southeast India, Zaranj, Turkey, Cyprus, and Austria. Women without Borders invited 18 women from Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, South Africa, Israel, Palestine and Senegal to the first Women Without Borders conference in 2003.\\"Konferenz Women Included! in Wien\\" ORF.at\\"Women Included!\\" APA-OTS Since then, conferences organized by the NGO have been attended by government officials and high-level representatives of politics and civil society, including members of parliament and presidents of NGOs.\\"Summary report by UNIS Vienna on IWD 2006\\" United Nations Information Service In Afghanistan, in preparation for the 2004 Afghan elections, Women Without Borders created a handbook to encourage Afghan women to vote.

The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar waysall three have issues of communicating with the dead; Matt Damon plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a clairvoyant, but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; C√©cile de France plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a near-death experience during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and British schoolboy Marcus (played by Frankie and George McLaren), who loses the person closest to him. Bryce Dallas Howard, Lyndsey Marshal, Jay Mohr, and Thierry Neuvic have supporting roles. Morgan sold the script on spec to DreamWorks in 2008, but it transferred to Warner Bros. by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in London, San Francisco, Paris, and Hawaii. Hereafter premiered as a \\"Special Presentation\\" at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010. The film was given a limited release on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story. Plot On assignment in India, French television journalist Marie Lelay is caught in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated but left for dead. She gasps back to life after a near death experience, glimpsing a vision of the afterlife. Marie is reunited with her lover Didier as the disaster subsides, and they return to Paris. Marie's experience interferes with her work, and Didier, also her producer, sends her on a leave of absence. In San Francisco, George Lonegan reluctantly agrees to perform a psychic reading for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. An actual medium, George abandoned his career as a psychic due to the emotional, often disturbing impact of communicating with the dead. George asks if ‚ÄúJune‚Äù means anything, which Christos denies; he reveals to Billy that June was his late wife's nurse, with whom he was in love. In London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother Jackie from losing them to social services. Evading the authorities, Jackie sends Jason to the chemist to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. Escaping from street thugs, Jason is hit by a van and killed. Unable to protect his mother or cope without his brother, Marcus is sent to a foster home. Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a hospice director, a former skeptic now convinced the afterlife exists. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience, in hopes the scientific community will accept the reality of life beyond death. Desperate for a reunion with his brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and seeks help to contact Jason, but only encounters frauds. Boarding the London underground at Charing Cross, Jason's cap blows off Marcus‚Äô head. Desperate to find it, Marcus misses his train, which explodes during the 2005 London Bombings. At a cooking class, George is partnered with Melanie. Hitting it off, they prepare dinner at George's home, and a phone message from Billy forces George to reveal his past as a psychic. Melanie persuades George to contact the spirit of her father, who asks forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees in tears, and does not return to the cooking class. Having been in talks with a publisher about a biography of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Marie stuns them with her new manuscript: \\"Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence\\". The publisher rejects the work, but steers her toward another publisher in London. Marie learns Didier does not intend for her to return to her job, as her public interest in the hereafter has damaged her reputation, and he is having an affair with her replacement. Laid off from his factory job, George is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Changing his mind, he impulsively travels to London, obsessively listening to Derek Jacobi‚Äôs audiobooks of Charles Dickens' works. He visits the Charles Dickens Museum and attends Jacobi's live reading at the London Book Fair, where Marie is reading her now published book, Hereafter. When she hands George a signed copy, he has a psychic flash of her near-drowning. At the event with his foster parents, Marcus spots George, whom he has read about online. George brushes him off and returns to his hotel, but Marcus stands outside until George agrees to perform a reading. Through George, Jason tells Marcus he is happy in the afterlife, and that he knocked off his cap to save Marcus at the train station, and not to fear being alone \\"because we are one\\". With this closure, Marcus visits his mother, who is improving in a rehab center. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie that he believes her book to be true. She decides to join him for lunch; arriving at the caf√©, George sees a vision of them kissing. With their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them better appreciate life, George and Marie sit together.

When a normal display is used in an outdoor environment, there are some factors that affect its readability. The most common one is ‚Äúfog‚Äù, or condensation, which forms on the inner surface of display's vandal shield. Another factor is the reflection of sunlight, which causes a mirror-image on the display. Both phenomena can be solved by using optical bonding. Adhesive Types There are a wide variety of adhesives used for optical bonding processes. Three of the most commonly used are silicone, epoxy, and polyurethane. Below are overviews of the pros/cons of each adhesive type. * Silicone: The most commonly found adhesive in optical bonding processes that dates back to the 1970s as a solution. Silicone's core properties of low conductivity and chemical reactivity, thermal stability, and ability to repel water and form watertight seals make it a common solution for optical bonding. Also, because it is a soft material, it is very feasible to rework for bonds that become damaged over time. However, debris often forms around the edges of the bonds if they are rubbed during handling. To reduce this, edges of optically bonded displays should be covered or configured so that edges are not exposed. * Epoxy: When used as a structural glue, epoxy resin creates a more rigid bond than silicone, thus eliminating the formation of particulate debris, which is common with silicone bonding processes. However, epoxy bonding is not reworkable. * Polyurethane: Polyurethane adhesives are commonly utilized in bonding applications for displays in avionic technology and polar technology. However, this bonding adhesive yellows over time when exposed to light, so by today's standards it is considered an obsolete adhesive. Basic idea Optical bonding is the use of an optical-grade adhesive to glue a glass to the top surface of a display. The main goal of optical bonding is to improve the display performance under outdoor environments. This method eliminates the air gap between the cover glass and the display. Moreover, anti-reflective coating is often used in optical bonding glass. The real problem for display readability in outdoor environments is not the display's brightness but its contrast. Contrast means the ratio of the white level to the black level; in other words, the contrast ratio of display means the difference of light intensity between the brightest white pixel and the darkest black pixel. The main purpose of optical bonding is to increase the display's contrast ratio by reducing the amount of reflected ambient light. Benefits * Increased ruggedness: Bonding a sheet of glass on top of the display increases the ruggedness of the display. * Improved durability: A bonded display is better able to resist scratches, fluids, stains and dirt. * Condensation: The elimination of an air gap between the cover glass and the display means that moisture cannot penetrate and cause fogging on display‚Äôs surface. * Extended temperature range and EMI filtering: The temperature range of the display can be extended by incorporating ITO heaters on the cover glass; EMI filters can be added via the same mechanism.

It is located on the right (southern) bank of the Yangtze River, next to Yiling District's border with Zigui County to the west. Sandouping is best known as the location of the Three Gorges Dam, which is the world's largest electricity-generating plant of any kind. History The predecessor of today's Sandouping, the village of Huangniupu (ÈªÑÁâõÈì∫, \\"Yellow Cow Post Station\\") was established during the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor in 1496. Sandouping District was created in March 1949} and transformed into Sandouping Town in February 1984.‰∏âÂ≥°Â∑•Á®ãÊâÄÂú®Âú∞‰∏âÊñóÂù™ÈïáÂ∞ÜÂª∫ÂõΩÈôÖÊóÖÊ∏∏ÊòéÊòüÈïá (Sandouping Town - home to the Three Gorges Project - will transform itself into an international tourist destination) Sandouping used to be a small fishing village until it was selected to be the site of the Three Gorges Dam. In 1999, at the peak of the construction, over 40,000 workers lived in Sandouping. At the time, special permits were required to enter the town. Six out of nineteen Sandouping's villages are populated by families that have been resettled from the areas flooded by the waters of the Three Gorges Reservoir, or, earlier, the Gezhouba Reservoir. Geography The Town of Sandouping occupies 178 km2 on the right (southern) bank of the Yangtze River, opposite the town of Letianxi (), to which it is connected by Xiling Bridge. Sandouping is the only town in Yiling District that is located south of the river.Schematic map showing the division of Yiling District into counties at Â§∑ÈôµÊ¶ÇÂÜµ (Overview of Yiling District), compared to the county map in the provincial atlas Sandouping's western neighbor is the town of Maoping, the county seat of the nearby Zigui County. Although it is only a kilometer or two west of the dam (straight-line distance), it is actually several kilometers drive on Hubei Provincial Route 134, because of the terrain. Administratively, the Town of Sandouping is divided into 19 villages () and 1 neighborhood committee ().ÂêÑÊùëÊ¶ÇÂÜµ (Summary of [Sandouping's] individual villages) Sandouping's central urban area, where the town government and most services are located, is technically known as Yuanyi Village (). It is situated some 5 km east of the southern end of the Three Gorges Dam. The neighborhood just to the east, known as Huanglingmiao Village (), is named after Huangling Temple () located there near the Yangtze River waterfront. It is being developed as a tourism area, centered around the riverboat dock.Road Atlas of Hubei (ÊπñÂåóÁúÅÂÖ¨Ë∑ØÈáåÁ®ãÂú∞ÂõæÂÜå; Hubei Sheng Gonglu Licheng Dituce), published by ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂú∞ÂõæÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ SinoMaps Press, 2007, .

Its raising as the first armoured regiment of an independent nation merged the flair of Risala with the vision of an emergent army. The regiment was exemplified in an array of regimental insignia and colours that were a break from the usual pennants and lances, and reflected the efforts put into their design and conception. The 62nd Cavalry is an armoured regiment of the Indian Army and was raised by Lt Col RS Butalia on 31 Mar 1957 at Ambala cantonment. Drawn from the existing cavalry regiments of the time, the 62nd Cavalry was recruited from Sikh, Jat and Dogra communities. 62 CAVALRY Crest _Regimental Crest_. The five pointed star is the symbol of the Lord creator, in the sense that it represents the five basic elements of creation: earth, air, fire, water and ether. The twelve pointed chakra may be linked to the symbol of Lord Krishna‚Äôs Sudarshan Chakra. It can also be taken as a twelve pointed lotus, the symbol of lord Shiva in his benign form. Both the forms are very dear to the Jats and the Dogras. The inner chakra symbolizes the guru‚Äôs grace in battle, so near and dear to the Sikhs, whereas, the five pointed star, twelve pointed Chakra and the plain Chakra all symbolize faith in god and his protection to the wearer of the badge. The mace-head symbolizes the yama or Kal (Pran Nath) or Shiva as the destroyer of the enemy and evil. In its modern connotation the badge consists of a sprocket, conveying mobility in battle, and a mace-head that represents the destruction of the enemy through firepower. The regiment was born as the first armoured regiment to be raised in independent India and was the first Indian armoured regiment to be raised entirely on tanks. In its ninth year, the 62nd Cavalry took part in the 1965 War against Pakistan. The regiment, equipped with obsolete Sherman tanks fought modern Pakistani Patton tanks and outgunned and out-tanked them. The regiment was honoured by President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy during its silver jubilee when he presented a Guidon to them on 31 March 1981. _Regiment Colours_. The colours of the regiment are azure blue and canary yellow. The yellow signifies the divine light (jyoti) and blue stands for purity of action (or mind) a colour that is dear to both Lord Krishna and Guru Gobind Singh. It is also the colour of Vayu and of Lord Shiva. Regiment Colours of 62 Cavalry _Regimental Motto_. After research on ,regimental Crest and colours, the regiment motto was selected. It was a follow up to the sentiments behind the crest and the colours. The founders of the regiment selected ‚ÄòDhairya evm Shaurya‚Äô as the motto which signifies ‚ÄòWith Faith in God, Fight with Valour' or 'Fortitude & Valour‚Äô. Thus the interpretation is ‚Äòhaving surrendered to the will of god, fight with courage‚Äô. Lieutenant Colonel RS Butalia, first Commandant of the Regiment, played an instrumental role in selection of the motto, which reflects the blend of military and religious convictions, thus reinforcing the belief that victory has always been the privilege of the brave and the righteous.

The 62 Cavalry was operationally deployed for the first time during Operation Ablaze in April 1965. It provided the regiment an experience of preparations of war. A few exercises with troops with full strength were also conducted during May and June 1965, which came handy subsequently during operations later on. Map of 1965 War: Sialkot Sector  Plan of Operations  In early September 1965, the stage was set for operations into Pakistan and additional formations including HQ 1 Corps moved into Jammu and Kashmir. On 6 September 1965, 62 Cavalry was placed under command 6 Mountain Division for operations across Indo-Pakistan border. At an ‚Äòorder‚Äô group conference held at Headquarters 6 Mountain Division, attended by the commandant, Lieutenant Colonel BM Singh the plan of attack finalised was as under: (a) 99 Mountain Brigade with ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron 62 Cavalry to capture Charwa. (b) 69 Mountain Brigade with ‚ÄòA‚Äô Squadron 62 Cavalry to capture Maharajke. (c) ‚ÄòC‚Äô Squadron 62 Cavalry to protect the left flank of 1 Armoured Division during its advance onto Phillora. (d) Charwa and Maharajke to be secured by 0500 Hours on 08 September 1965. (e) 43 Lorried Brigade Group to advance after capture of Charwa, to Koga-Likoke. (f) 62 Cavalry less ‚ÄòC‚Äô Squadron subsequently to come under command 43 Lorried Brigade at 0900 Hours on 08 September 1965 for advance to Koga - Likoke.  Move to Forward Concentration Area  The commandant at 1100 hours same day, issued final orders and action was completed by all concerned to get tanks and administrative echelons ready with full battle loads. The regiment moved from its permanent location to Chatta near Jammu at 2000 Hours on 6 September 1965 on tracks, a distance of 20 miles on indifferent roads along with hundreds of B vehicles of infantry moving to forward concentration by 2300 hours as under: 62 CAVALRY less ‚ÄòA‚Äô Squadron in area Iron Bridge. ‚ÄòA‚Äô Squadron in area Noria. The following officers and JCOs moved to the concentration area:- Regiment Headquarters Lieutenant Colonel BM Singh - Commandant. Major BK Mukherjee - Second-in-Command.

Naib Risaldar Prem Singh.  7 September 1965  On 7 September 1965, whilst in forward concentration area at about 0730 hours, four Pakistani F-86 Sabre Jets strafed and rocketed the regiment. However, due to good concealment and dispersal, it suffered no casualties. During whole of 7 September 1965, the regiment prepared itself for the attack. After the regimental order group where details of impending attacks on Charwa and Maharajke were given out, the squadron commanders attended the order groups at respective brigade headquarters and limited marrying up with infantry units was carried out. The commandant addressed all ranks and exhorted them to trust in God and carryout the assigned tasks boldly and fearlessly.  Night of 7/8 September and 8 September 1965   Battle of Charwa  Own guns opened up at 2300 hours on 7 September and 99 Mountain Brigade crossed SL at 2330 hours. Regiment headquarters and ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron moved out to join 99 Mountain Brigade to provide anti-tank protection in the Charwa bridgehead. Due to difficult going a few tanks could not keep pace with leading elements; thus initially two troops of ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron reached Charwa at 0500 hours and remainder of ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron and regiment headquarter arrived at 0730 hours. Although the main enemy position at Charwa was captured by 0500 hours but small parties still held out in surrounding sugarcane fields. Later, ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron with a company of 2/5 Gorkha Rifle, combed the area 2000 yards south and southwest of Charwa.  Battle of Maharajke  Maharajke, a nodal point on road Zafarwal - Sialkot put up a stiff resistance. 69 Mountain Brigade with ‚ÄòA‚Äô Squadron captured it by 0530 hours in spite of heavy casualties. During early stages of battle, when communications were disrupted due to enemy action, Naib Risaldar Santokh Singh (JC-16039) carried the brigade commander in his tank to forward localities. Meanwhile, Lance Dafadar Santokh Singh (who was later killed in a tank battle near Pagowal) charged with his tank on enemy RCL gun which was engaging tanks and overran it.  Advance from Charwa  At about 1500 hours on 08 September 1965, Commander 43 Lorried Infantry Brigade ordered the regiment headquarter and ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron to resume their advance from Charwa and clear the area between Charwa and Maharajke. Small pockets of Pakistani fighters still held at Khanor and Sangial, and fired automatic weapons on tank commanders who were moving with hatches open. Near Sangial, a party of armed mujahids firing from high ground was effectively engaged by Commandant and Adjutant (Captain J Bhaskaran) themselves taking a shoot. At about 1730 hours 4 Pakistani F-86 Sabre Jets strafed and rocketed the column and at 1830 Hours it reached Maharajke. A1 & A2 echelons joined the Regiment at Maharajke. While in harbour, the regiment at night was fired upon by enemy small parties using MMGs.  9 and 10 September 1965   Capture of Kaloi  Due to bad going, advance of 43 Lorried Brigade had been slowed down and it completed concentration in Maharajke during night 8/9 September 1965. At an order group held at headquarters 43 Lorried Brigade at 2330 Hours, the regiment was ordered to advance next morning and secure Pagowal. Following additional troops were placed under command: Under Command ‚Äì 8 Garhwal Rifles Indirect Support ‚Äì R Battery 101 Field Regiment (SP) At 0915 hours advance commenced and ‚ÄòA‚Äô Squadron secured first bound Parashayan. Thereafter, the advance continued with ‚ÄòB‚Äô Squadron leading and area Kaloi was secured by 1400 hours after brushing aside minor opposition in the villages. At about 1445 Hours, Commander 43 Lorried Brigade ordered the regiment to firm in area Kaloi. 43 Lorried Brigade occupied a defended sector in area Kaloi‚ÄìRurki Khurd and the regiment was deployed to provide anti-tank defense to the brigade defended Sector. At about 1100 hours on 10 September 1965, Pakistani fighters brought down a heavy concentration of medium artillery fire on the defended sector and No 1034723 Sowar Sher Singh became the first battle casualty.  11 September 1965   Battle of Haral  Task On 11 September 1965, 62 Cavalry, less ‚ÄòC‚Äô Squadron, was located at Kaloi. At a briefing by the commandant; general officer commanding, 1 Armoured Division, tasked the regiment ‚ÄúTo secure the important area crossroads, so as to protect the western area flank of 1 Armoured Brigade attack on Phillora‚Äù. Enemy Dispositions Intelligence sources believed that little, if any, Pakistani armour was in the area Pagowal - Wadianwala. It was felt, that they had either already moved their armour further east to block the advance of 1 Armoured Brigade onto Phillora or were holding it in reserve for defense of Sialkot. Advance to Cross-Roads The regiment advanced at 0930 Hours from Kaloi along track Kaloi - Haral - Pagowal crossroads. The village Haral was secured by 1110 h,ours. As leading troops advanced further skirting village Pagowal, about 1500 yards from the objective, Pakistani Patton tanks located in a grove near Pagowal opened fire on the leading tanks. The leading squadron was ordered to deploy in the area Lone Tree - Haral to engage enemy armour frontally. The other squadron was to move up West of Haral, to take on enemy armour from that flank. Two troops of Patton tanks located in the grove were engaged and soon after were hit and set on fire. The remainder pulled back behind village Pagowal. The squadron was to keep edging forward towards cross roads, but ensuring that two troops, constantly kept a watch on enemy armour which was still in that area. Meanwhile, Pakistani artillery observation posts apparently located on top of houses in village Pagowal, which in itself was on a rise, brought down intense medium artillery fire on the leading troops of both squadrons, which were in their full view and further advance was held up. Enemy Counter Attack Soon after a big cloud of dust was seen approaching Pagowal from the southwest. It appeared enemy was fast moving armour reinforcements from Wadianwala-Chak Lwaranda to block further advance. The Pakistani reaction to the regiment‚Äôs advance to area Pagowal was because it was the deepest thrust made till then towards Sialkot; and moreover threatened to cut off their forces still fighting in Phillora. Thereafter, two squadrons of Pakistani Patton tanks supported by heavy artillery fire made an aggressive thrust to envelop the regiment around village Haral. When this thrust was held, enemy developed two parallel thrusts with a squadron each moving to the west and east of Haral aimed at cutting off communications with Brigade Defended Sector at Kaloi or possibly to drive a deep wedge towards Maharajke which then was then lightly undefended. Both the regiment‚Äôs flanks were vulnerable; 168 Brigade was still at Bajragarhi and 1 Armoured Brigade was fighting in area Libbe - Phillora. Own Plan The Commandant quickly evolved a plan, which called for holding a number of layback positions and time till each one was to be denied to the enemy. Due to the Pakistani's qualitative superiority in armour, it was vital that one squadron should hold the enemy to gain time for second squadron to move to the next layback position and settle before contact; as in a running fight Sherman tanks would likely have fared badly against Pattons. The regiment headquarter remained with each squadron as it held layback position, from where it could watch the progress of the Pakistani outflanking moves, and thus was able to control and direct the early move of troops to thwart their aim. By late afternoon, the fighting had lasted over six hours and though three Patton tanks had been knocked out and several more damaged, five Sherman tanks on the Indian side had been destroyed. Further, the tanks had almost exhausted their ammunition. However, by then, on the Commandant‚Äôs incessant requests to General Officer Commanding, 1 Armoured Division, a medium artillery regiment was allocated for support and this greatly helped slow down the Pakistani enemy advance. Meanwhile officers and men collected ammunition from A1 echelon and fed it to leading tanks in open jeeps, at times under enemy artillery fire. Finally, the Pakistani armour was halted on line Ring Contour - Ghaon - Grave Yard and the Regiment held area Kaloi - Chak Ali to block their passage to Maharajke or its interference with Brigade Defended Sector at Kaloi. 1 Armoured Division account of operations for 11 September 1965 reads:- ‚Äú62 Cavalry less one squadron with 8 Garhwal Rifles were ordered to establish themselves in area GAT to ensure that no enemy armour broke through our Right flank from Sialkot side. At about 1530 hours, the enemy launched a furious attack with a regiment of Patton tanks directed against our right flank troops established in GAT. The enemy‚Äôs intention was to cut off our rear, a sensitive spot in so far as it affected the overall day‚Äôs battle‚Äù. Even though the crossroads was not captured, bby drawing away and fighting to a standstill a major enemy armour force throughout that day, the overall aim was fully achieved, as it helped to safeguard West flank of 1 Armoured Brigade which captured Phillora at 1600 hours, on 11 September 1965. After Pagowal was captured on 13 September 1965 by 69 Mountain Brigade and 62 Cavalry, the sight of a large number of tank tracks in Wadianwala ‚Äì Chak Lwaranda area confirmed the earlier estimate that on 11 September 1965 almost a Patton regiment had fought against 62 Cavalry.

His works, not very appreciated in his days, dealt with very moralising subjects and had a clear influence of William Hogarth. Biography Joseph Danhauser was born in Vienna in 1805, the eldest son of sculptor and furniture manufacturer Joseph Ulrich Danhauser and his wife Johanna (n√©e Lambert). He took his first painting lessons with his father and later assisted the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. He studied with Johann Peter Krafft and made his first exhibition 1826. Invited by Johann Ladislaus Pyrker, patriarch of Venice, he visited the city of Doges, where he started to study the Italian masters. He came back to Vienna via Trieste in 1827, visiting Prague. On March 27, 1827 he and his colleague :de:Johann Matthias Ranftl molded Ludwig van Beethoven's death mask, roughly 12 hours after his deathLe Menestrel, 2832, year 51, nr.28, page 222 (June 1885). and Danhauser painted a water-colour representing his deathbed. In 1828, he spent some time in Eger, with an invitation of this Hungarian city archbishop Pyrker. He solicited him for some pictures for the gallery of the Archdiocese.Biography of Josef Danhauser, Gallery of Art After his father's death in 1829, his brothers and he managed his furniture factory during the Biedermeier movement, being the precursors of modern design. That made him put his painting career aside. In 1833, he responded to a second invitation from Eger's archbishop and he painted The martyr of Saint John for a new basilica in the city and he received the Vienna Academy prize for his picture Die Versto√üung der Hagar and he specialised in Genre works. In 1838, he was appointed vice-rector of the Academy and married Josephine Streit, who was the daughter of a physician and with whom he had three children, Josef, Marie and Julie, born in 1839, 1841 and 1843 respectively. Josef Danhauser was appointed professor of historical Painting at the Academy in 1841, but he left this occupation and he travelled around Germany and the Netherlands with the textile maker, art aficionado and art sponsor Rudolf von Arthaber. In this journey, he was very interested in the Dutch School and the format of his works was smaller. He died of typhus in Vienna in 1845 and was buried in Hundstrumer Cemetery, though his grave was later moved. In 1862, a street was named after him in Vienna.

These sites are comparable with the petroglyphs of Native Americans and the Rock Art found elsewhere in Australia, but are not restricted to rock carvings. Many of the sites are on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Publishers, 1981, pp.50-67 History and description The Aboriginal Australians arrived in the north of Australia around 50,000 years ago. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found in the Blue Mountains area west of Sydney, while sites going back 40,000 years exist at Lake Mungo.2003 Guide to NSW National Parks (National Parks and Wildlife Service) 2003, p.59 There are some thousands of known sites, many but not all located in national parks. Some sites are also found in more suburban settings; rock carvings can be seen in the Sydney suburbs of Bondi and Tamarama. Their art was part of day-to-day life and would normally have had a purpose. One such purpose is thought to have been what some people call \\"wish fulfilment magic\\"‚Äîor sympathetic magic‚Äîin which the act of creating the magical work is thought to bring about the event depicted in the work. For example, a hunting scene‚Äîa common subject in rock carvings‚Äîwould be aimed at bringing about the desired reality of good hunting.Aboriginal Art of Australia, Barbara Mullins (Mulavon Pty Ltd) 1986, p.8 There were also many artworks that were created for specific ceremonial purposes and which were not intended to last after the ceremony was over.Aboriginal Art of Australia, p.33 In addition to such themes, there were also works of a more secular nature, which could be created for a number of reasons, including the instruction and entertainment of children. There are substantial variations in the character of art developed in different parts of New South Wales. Art in the western part of the state could be very different from the art created in coastal areas. Aboriginal sites in the state are administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales. All known sites are recorded on the register known as the Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System (AHIMS), which is run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.AHIMS website:Retrieved 17 September 2009 There is generally a policy of protecting Aboriginal sites, although a small number of sites are publicised. Notable examples are those at the Basin Track, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and the Bulgandry site, Brisbane Water National Park. However, most sites are not publicised, and restricted sites (colloquially known as sacred sites) will never be made public. If anyone thinks they have a legitimate reason for wanting to inspect sites that are not normally available to the public, they can apply to AHIMS for permission. The sites are of many different types, for example: * Paintings * Rock carvings * Hand stencils * Charcoal drawings * Shell middens * Shield trees * Restricted sites Image:AboriginalSite0009.jpg|Rock carving, Bantry Bay, Garigal National Park Image:AboriginalSite0007.jpg|Shield tree, Bullawarring Track, Heathcote National Park Image:AboriginalSite0008.jpg|Charcoal drawing, Myuna Creek, Heathcote National Park Image:AboriginalSite0010.jpg|Rock carving, Bulgandry, Brisbane Water National Park Image:(1)rock_carvings_bondi-3.JPG|Rock carvings, North Bondi, New South Wales Image:(1)rock_carvings_Bondi-6.JPG|Mundoes, North Bondi, New South Wales Image:KingsTableland1.JPG|Grinding grooves, Kings Tableland Aboriginal Site, Wentworth Falls Image:Red Hands Cave.jpg|Hand stencils, Red Hands Cave, Blue Mountains National Park Image:Imitation1.jpg|European imitation, Grotto Point, Sydney Harbour National Park Paintings cover a wide range of subjects, both spiritual and secular. Coloured pigmentation was created with ochre (giving a red/orange colour), charcoal (for a black pigmentation) and ash (for grey pigmentation). One good example is the rock shelter popularly known as Baiame's Cave, at Milbrodale, with paintings depicting a large figure that may be Baiame, the Sky Father. Rock carvings, also known as petroglyphs or Rock Engravings, are of a style known as \\"simple figurative\\", which conventional archaeological thinking dates to the last 5000 years. Other engravings show European sailing ships, and so cannot be more than about 200 years old. Thus we are left with a date range of 5000‚Äì200 years ago. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that we know the engravings were sometimes \\"re-grooved\\" during ceremonies. Carvings could be very large. In some carvings, the figure of Baiame the Sky Father could be eighteen metres tall.Aboriginal Art of Australia, p.11 In addition to pictorial carvings, there are many grinding grooves, caused by grinding stone implements on a rock surface to shape them and give them an edge. Areas like Sydney and the Blue Mountains have many rock carvings because they predominantly consist of sandstone (known as Hawkesbury sandstone), which is a very suitable surface for rock carvings. See Sydney Rock Engravings for the main article on these. Hand stencils can often be found in rock shelters and caves, which have given them protection from the elements over the years. They were created by placing the hand on a rocky surface and blowing pigmentation around it, leaving the silhouette of the hand on the rock. There is often a number of them in one place. The best-known example is Red Hands Cave, in the Blue Mountains National Park, which has many stencils, including those created by children as well as adults.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.170 Charcoal drawings were exactly that: drawings executed with a piece of charcoal. Like the rock carvings, they could be of a wide range of subjects, with animals often featured. Shell middens developed in occupation sites where shell fish were consumed. Over the years, layers of shells would build up, creating a concentration of many shells in the soil around the occupation site. Shield trees are seen occasionally in the Sydney bush. A substantial piece of bark would be cut out of a tree and used as a shield or tray. A visible \\"scar\\" was thus left behind, which could vary considerably in size, some being quite large. Restricted areas (otherwise known as sacred sites) are usually of a spiritual nature and were restricted to adult males and, in some cases, women. These sites could include ceremonial sites, bora grounds, men's sites and women's birthing sites. Occupation sites and sacred sites It is necessary to distinguish between occupation sites and sacred sites, a subject about which there is often great confusion. Many people think that all Aboriginal sites are \\"sacred sites\\", but the reality is more complex. Before white settlement, most indigenous sites were occupation sites, which were used by all members of a tribe. Sacred sites, on the other hand, were restricted to adult males, except for certain women's sites. In more recent times, all indigenous sites have become known as sacred sites; those that were previously known as sacred sites are now known as restricted sites. Imitations It is worth noting that there are many imitation sites, in which Europeans created imitations of Aboriginal art, usually in the form of rock carvings. One of the most prominent examples is a large carving of a kangaroo alongside a walking track at Grotto Point, in the Sydney Harbour National Park. This has been known for some time to be an imitation (or fake, as some would say).Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 1987, p.31 Examples * Appletree Aboriginal Area, 75 kilometres north-west of Newcastle.

Opened about 1990, the park is located in the middle of the city along Turner Creek near southwest 32nd Avenue between Tualatin Valley Highway and Main Street. The park includes a playground, restrooms, several sports facilities, and natural areas with trails. History Turner Creek Park opened about 1990 near W. L. Henry Elementary School and southwest 32nd Avenue in the center of Hillsboro. Construction included building dams and trails along the creek, with some labor provided by an alternative school program paid for by the federal government. During construction the city received donation of nearly 100 trees from a local nursery and Portland General Electric, with volunteers providing the labor to plant the trees. During the summer of 1992 some trees at the park died due to a drought. The city sought to receive 75 live former Christmas trees in donations from local residents after Christmas in 1992 to plant at the park to replace those that died. From 1993 to 1994, the city‚Äôs parks and recreation department worked with civic groups and used a grant to improve the natural areas of the park, which included consolidation of a variety of trails, plantings, and adding bird houses. A wildflower garden was added in 1997. Bisected by Turner Creek, the wetlands area of the park and the creek have experienced numerous sewer overflows beginning around 1995. An older sewer line runs along the creek and passes through the park on its way south to the wastewater treatment plant operated by Clean Water Services at Rock Creek. The city was fined $32,000 by the state over its clean up of spills in 2006. The park played host to Heritage Christian School‚Äôs Latin Olympika games in 2003. City residents rejected a bond measure in November 2008 that would have paid for improvements at Turner Creek Park among six other parks as well as a recreation center at 53rd Avenue Park. As of August 2009, Turner Creek was one of only three parks in the city that had not been adopted under the parks departments adopt a park program. A new playground was installed in a single day by volunteers in August 2018. Amenities The park includes athletic facilities, wetlands, and wooded sections.Appendix D: Park Descriptions, p. 32. Parks Master Plan. City of Hillsboro. Retrieved on September 18, 2009. Features include play equipment for children, picnic areas, restrooms, and parking. Sports features are two tennis courts, one soccer field, and two softball fields. The natural area on the west side of the park has paved and wood chip trails leading to a boardwalk and bridge across Turner Creek. These trails run down a small canyon that separates the improved portions of the park from the creek and connect to the elementary school. About four acres are along the creek, which was changed to meander through the area which includes ponds and islands. The city changed the stream by building small dikes that are closed in the summertime to collect water and create pools for use by wildlife, including great blue herons. Other animals at the park include garter snakes, gulls, frogs, fish, and blackbirds among others. Flora include purple iris, sedges, nodding beggar-tick, knotweed, jewelweed, and Veronica.

It lies in undeveloped land, offering the prospect of a site undisturbed in modern times, with much scope for investigators. Excavations took place in 1930‚Äì31 and found human remains with evidence of violent deaths. Further investigations took place in 2003‚Äì04, and the site was also a target of the archaeological television programme Time Team in 2005.

It became a significant settlement, with many established stone buildings and a quayside cut into the bedrock. There are also indications of a river bridge in the area, and evidence of trade in coal (dated to about AD 200) has been found at the inland port. After Roman occupation ended, around AD 350, the town decayed into ruin. Post-Roman Overlying part of the Roman town's site, between Watling Street and the river, is an enclosure. It is believed to be an Anglo-Saxon military encampment thrown up after the Battle of Chester (AD 611 according to the Irish Annals). The earthwork was reinforced by masonry recovered from the Roman ruins. Archaeological excavations have uncovered a post-Roman mass grave beneath the defensive earthwork, which may hold Northumbrian casualties of the Battle of Chester. The battle was an Anglian victory by King Aethelfrith of Northumbria over a Welsh army. There are three alternative explanations for the earthwork enclosure, however. One is that it was built by Norse-Irish settlers led by Ingimundr, who established themselves near Chester about AD 905 and subsequently tried to capture the city. Second, D-shaped defensive compounds sited beside rivers, such as the Heronsgate earthwork, are a recognised feature of the Viking Age. Third, it could have been constructed very much later, perhaps being one of the positions set up during the Siege of Chester by Parliamentary forces in 1644.

Oft-cited points of criticism include a perceived lack of the body's efficacy, rampant anti-Semitism, appeasement, collusion, promotion of globalism, inaction, abuse of power by nations exerting general control over the assembly, a number of legislative decisions seen as abandonment of, among other things, the prevention of armed conflict clause(s) detailed in the Charter of the United Nations, corruption, a total lack of efficacy in both pre-emptive measures and de-escalation of existing conflicts which have ranged from social disputes to all-out wars, and misappropriation of resources. Philosophical and moral criticisms Moral relativism In 2004, former ambassador to the UN Dore Gold published a book called Tower of Babble: How the United Nations Has Fueled Global Chaos. The book criticized what it called the organization's moral relativism in the face of (and occasional support of)Gold, pp. 216‚Äì217. genocide and terrorism that occurred between the moral clarity of its founding period and the present day. While the UN during its founding period was limited to those countries that declared war on at least one of the Axis powers of World War II, and thus were capable of taking a stand against war, the modern United Nations has, according to Gold, become diluted to the point where only 75 of the 184 member states during the time of the book's publication \\"were free democracies, according to Freedom House.\\"Gold, p. 31. He further claimed that this had the effect of tipping the scales of the UN so that the organization as a whole was more amenable to the requirements of dictatorships. The UN General Assembly decided to hold a moment of silence in honor of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il following his death in 2011. Western diplomats criticized the decision. \\"An official at the Czech Republic's UN mission said the Czechs did not request a similar moment of silence for V√°clav Havel, the playwright-turned-dissident who died\\" a day after Kim.\\"UN honors North Korea's Kim Jong-il.\\" Ynetnews. 22 December 2011. 23 December 2011. Threat to national sovereignty Some critics of the UN have alleged that it threatens national sovereignty and promotes globalism. In the United States, an early opponent of the UN was the John Birch Society, which began a \\"get US out of the UN\\" campaign in 1959, charging that the UN's aim was to establish a one-world government. Charles de Gaulle of France criticized the UN, famously calling it le machin, and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help in maintaining world peace, preferring the UN to direct defense treaties between countries. Debates surrounding population control and abortion The United Nations Population Fund has been accused by different groups of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations. Controversies regarding these allegations have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and the United States government, with three presidential administrations, that of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush withholding funding from the UNFPA. The UNFPA provided aid to Peru's population control program in the mid-to-late '90s when it was discovered the Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations. The UNFPA was not found directly involved in the scandal, but continued to fund and work with the population control program after the abuses had become public. The issue played a role in the Bush administration's decision in 2002 to cut off funding for the organization. Administrative criticisms Role of elite countries There has been criticism that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), who are all nuclear powers, have created an exclusive nuclear club whose powers are unchecked. Unlike the General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council does not have true international representation. This has led to accusations that the UNSC only addresses the strategic interests and political motives of the permanent members, especially in humanitarian interventions: for example, protecting the oil-rich Kuwaitis in 1991 but poorly protecting resource-poor Rwandans in 1997.Rajan, Chella (2006). \\" \\". Frontiers of a Great Transition. Vol. 3. Tellus Institute, p. 3. Membership in the UN Security Council Any country may be elected to serve a temporary term on the Security Council, but critics have suggested that this is inadequate. Rather, they argue, the number of permanent members should be expanded to include non-nuclear powers, which would democratize the organization. Still other countries have advocated abolishing the concept of permanency altogether; under the government of Paul Martin, Canada advocated this approach. Veto power Another criticism of the Security Council involves the veto power of the five permanent members. As it stands, a veto from any of the permanent members can halt any possible action the Council may take. One country's objection, rather than the opinions of a majority of countries, may cripple any possible UN armed or diplomatic response to a crisis. As part of the Soviet Union, Russia vetoed 90 resolutions between 1949 and 1991. As of July 2019, USSR and Russia vetoed 141 times, United States 83 times, UK 32 times, France 18 times, and China 14 times. John J. Mearsheimer noted that \\"since 1982, the US has vetoed 32 Security Council resolutions critical of Israel, more than the total number of vetoes cast by all the other Security Council members.\\" Since candidates for the Security Council are proposed by regional blocs, the Arab League and its allies are usually included but Israel, which joined the UN in 1949, has never been elected to the Security Council. The Council has repeatedly condemned Israel. On the other hand, critics contend that, while Israel has the United States to rely on to veto any pertinent legislation against it, the Palestinians lack any such power. Apart from the US, several resolutions have been vetoed by Russia, notably attempts to impose sanctions on Syria during the Syrian Civil War and to condemn Russia's own annexation of Crimea in 2014. In the case of the latter, Russia's lone veto overruled the thirteen other votes in favor of the condemnation. Russia vetoed a UN resolution condemning the USSR's shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. The veto has been singled out as a threat to human rights, with Amnesty International claiming that the five permanent members had used their veto to \\"promote their political self-interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of protecting civilians.\\" As of 2014, Amnesty International has suggested that a solution would involve the five permanent members surrendering their veto on issues of genocide. Some see the fact that veto power is exclusive to the permanent five as being anachronistic and unjust, given that the United Nations is meant to equally represent all its member states. Aside from criticism directed towards its biased nature, others have pointed out that the veto makes it difficult for the Security Council to solve issues. Whilst addressing the UN General Assembly on the Russian annexation of Crimea, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the following regarding the inefficiency of the veto \\"In every democratic country, if someone has stolen your property, an independent court will restore justice, in order to protect your rights, and punish the offender. However, we must recognize that in the 21st century our organization lacks an effective instrument to bring to justice an aggressor country that has stolen the territory of another sovereign state.‚Äù Fait accompli The practice of the permanent members meeting privately and then presenting their resolutions to the full council as a fait accompli has also drawn criticism; according to Erskine Barton Childers, \\"the vast majority of members ‚Äì North as well as South ‚Äì have made very clear...their distaste for the way three Western powers [the UK, US, and France] behave in the Council, like a private club of hereditary elite-members who secretly come to decisions and then emerge to tell the grubby elected members that they may now rubber-stamp those decisions.\\"Empowering the Peoples in their United Nations ‚Äì UN Reform ‚Äì Global Policy Forum. Globalpolicy.org (1994-12-02). Retrieved on 2012-07-12. In this case, the United Nations has received some criticism in its gender-inclusivity and its reception of feminist viewpoints. While at the large scale the UN provides outlets and aid to women through UN Women and the Sustainable Development Goals, the reality is that the UN is still very male-dominated. While it has achieved gender parity in its employees at the two lowest levels of responsibility (P-1 and P-2), equal representation has not yet been achieved at any levels higher than these. Senior leadership as of 2015 was made up of 78% men, and parity is not expected for another 112 years based on current trends.http://www.un.org/womenwatch/uncoordination/documents/overview/unsystem/unsystem- infographic.pdf Both the percentage of appointments made and the likelihood and speed at which employees are promoted mirror the trend above; parity achieved at low levels while at the D-2 level women see roughly a quarter of what their male counterparts do. One reason attributed with the slow progress is that there are no methods to hold the UN accountable to its proposed changes due to its size and the different approaches taken within the different subsidiaries of the organization. Democratic character of the UN Other critics object to the idea that the UN is a democratic organization, saying that it represents the interests of the governments of the countries who form it and not necessarily the individuals within those countries. World federalist Dieter Heinrich points out that the powerful Security Council system does not have distinctions between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches: the United Nations Charter gives all three powers to the Security Council.Creery, Janet (1994). Read the fine print first: Some questions raised at the Science for Peace conference on UN reform. Peace Magazine. Jan‚ÄìFebruary 1994. p. 20. Retrieved on 2007-12-07. Multi- Sections System According to Yigal Palmor, former spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the multi-sections system of the UN prevents individual players or those who don't have geographical friends from participating in the United Nations System. He says that Israel is the only UN member, in the whole UN system, that has been prevented by the UN from playing the game like everyone else. Palmor asserts that due to the multi-sections system of the UN, Israel is being systematically excluded from all geographical sections and groups, and due to that Israel can't even apply to most of the UN councils. Israel originally should belong to the geographic section of Asia, but due to objection from Arab and Muslim countries in the region (such as Iran, Iraq etc.) it has been excluded, since its establishment. From time to time Israel has been accepted in the \\"Western countries and more\\" sections, but it is very limited. Israel became part of a regional grouping (the Western European and Others group) temporarily in 2000, gaining permanency status in 2014, 65 years after becoming a U.N. affiliated country.  Corruption in the UN Security Council  According to a study by Ilyana Kuziemko and Eric Werker, there is a strong connection between the distribution of foreign aid payments and rotating membership of the United Nations Security Council. Regarding the US foreign aid expenditure, ODA (Official Development Assistance)‚Äîreceiving countries which hold a rotating seat of the UNSC experience on average a rise of 59% in payments ($16 million); concerning financial support from the United Nations, an increase of 8% ($1 million) is being detected. This rise in payments does however not apply the whole time: Kuziemko and Werker used a ‚ÄúNew York Times‚Äù-Index to differentiate between important and unimportant years. The more the UN and the UNSC were mentioned in the New York Times, the more important the year was considered. The Korean War in the early 1950s, the Congo War in the early 1960s, and the numerous peacekeeping missions in the 1990s were decisive events. During unimportant and medium important years, ODA-receiving countries with a seat in the UNSC did not experience a significant rise in aid payments. During important years however, an increase of 170% could be detected ($16 million more). Regarding UN payments, the difference also exists, but is not as high (53% more financial support or $8 million during important years). One of the reasons could be that it is easier for the US to quickly distribute money, while aid payments of the United Nations mean a lot of bureaucracy beforehand. Kuziemko and Werker believe that this increase in payments does not happen because the ODA-receiving countries on the security council are able to use the chance and raise awareness for their problems. As soon as the country's time in council is over, the financial aid drops to the level prior to the time serving on the United Nations Security Council. However, the financial aid payments are noted to have already risen the year before the two-year term on the UNSC. The increase of aid payments is especially high regarding financial support by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). During years with a high importance measured by the ‚ÄúNew-York- Times‚Äù- Index, UNICEF offers 63% more funds to ODA-receiving countries serving on the UNSC than before they had a seat. Kuziemko and Werker argue that since its founding in 1947, the head of UNICEF has always held US citizenship. Therefore, the executive directors may be the long arm of the US government and pursue the interest of the United States through UNICEF. A similar, although not as significant increase can be seen regarding the distribution of aid payments through UNDP. It is impossible though to say if the increase of foreign aid payments by the US or by the UN have changed receiving countries' voting behavior, as they would never admit being open for bribery.Kuziemko, Ilyana, and Eric Werker. 2006. ‚ÄúHow Much Is a Seat on the Security Council Worth? Foreign Aid and Bribery at the United Nations.‚Äù Journal of Political Economy 114 (5). The University of Chicago Press: 905‚Äì30. Effectiveness criticisms Some have questioned whether the UN might be relevant in the 21st century. George W. Bush addressing the UN, questioning the relevance of the UN if it will not authorize a US invasion of Iraq. While the UN's first and second Charter mandates require the UN: ‚ÄúTo maintain international peace and security.... (and if necessary to enforce the peace by) taking preventive or enforcement action,‚Äù Excerpt of Articles 1 & 2 of the United Nations Charter due to its restrictive administrative structure, the permanent members of the Security Council themselves have sometimes prevented the UN from fully carrying out its first two mandates. Political scientist Ragnor Muller summarizes the development of the UN during the Cold War years. Without the unanimous approval, support (or minimally abstention) of all five of the permanent members of the UN's Security Council, the UN's charter only enables it to \\"observe\\", report on, and make recommendations regarding international conflicts. Such unanimity on the Security Council regarding the authorization of armed UN enforcement actions has not always been reached in time to prevent the outbreak of international wars. In 1962, UN secretary general U Thant provided valuable assistance and took a great deal of time, energy and initiative as the primary negotiator between Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, thus providing a critical link in the prevention of a nuclear war at that time. Recently discovered documentation of Secretary General U Thant's critical role in resolving the 1961 Cuban Missile Crisis. A 2005 RAND Corporation study found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared UN nation-building efforts to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as opposed to four out of eight US cases at peace. A Rand Corporation historical comparative survey of UN peacekeeping work. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism ‚Äì mostly spearheaded by the UN ‚Äì has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the Cold War or due to the fact the US and USSR were no longer pumping up oppressive governments after the Cold war ended. A detailed historical analysis of UN effectiveness in preventing wars. The bureaucratic dimension of the UN has been a cause for frustration with the organization. In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published \\"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\\",USIP Press Books, octobre 1994, a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia; he shows in particular that, between the start of the Somali Civil War in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the United Nations missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations‚Äô bureaucratic inefficiencies and excessive caution (most UN envoys to Somalia operating from the safety of their desks in Nairobi rather than visiting clan leaders in the field). If sweeping reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the United Nations would continue to respond to such crisis in a climate of inept improvisation.Book Review by Gail M. Gerhart in Foreign Affairs, March/April 1995 Diplomatic and political criticisms Inability to prevent conflicts Other critics and even proponents of the United Nations question its effectiveness and relevance because in most high-profile cases, there are essentially no consequences for violating a Security Council resolution. An early example of this was the Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide committed by the Pakistan Army on Bangladeshis. Critics of the UN argued that the UN was completely ineffective in preventing the genocide, and that military intervention by India was the only thing to stop the mass murder. Another such case occurred in the Srebrenica massacre where Serbian troops committed genocide against Bosnian Muslims in the largest case of mass murder on the European continent since World War II. Srebrenica had been declared a UN \\"safe area\\" and was even protected by 400 armed Dutch peacekeepers, but the UN forces did nothing to prevent the massacre. In the 21st century, the most prominent and dramatic example is the War in Darfur, in which Arab Janjaweed militias, supported by the Sudanese government, committed repeated acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide against the indigenous population. As of 2013, an estimated 300,000 civilians have been killed in what is the largest case of mass murder in the history of the region, yet the UN has continuously failed to act against this severe and ongoing human rights issue. At the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key heavily criticized the UN's inaction on Syria, more than two years after the Syrian Civil War began.Key compromises on UN Syria deal . 3 News NZ. 28 September 2013. Handling of the Cold War In 1967, Richard Nixon, while running for President of the United States, criticized the UN as \\"obsolete and inadequate\\" for dealing with then-present crises like the Cold War.\\"The Nixon Administration and the United Nations: 'It's a Damned Debating Society'\\", Dr. Edward C. Keefer (PDF). Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in a 1983 opinion piece in The New York Times that the process of discussions at the Security Council \\"more closely resembles a mugging\\" of the United States \\"than either a political debate or an effort at problem-solving.\\"\\"UN Mugging Fails\\", Legitimacy and Force, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, p. 229. Attention given to the Arab-Israeli conflict Number of country-specific UN General Assembly resolutions concerned with the Middle East (Palestine & Palestinians, Israel, Lebanon, Syria) vs. total country-specific resolutions. The graph is additive. Issues relating to the state of Israel, Palestinians and other aspects of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict occupy a large amount of debate time, resolutions and resources at the United Nations. The former Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, has accused the U.N. Human Rights Council of focusing disproportionately on allegations of abuses by Israel, and Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, admitted that there is a biased attitude against Israel at the UN, although he retracted later. Other critics such as Dore Gold, Alan Dershowitz, Mark Dreyfus, Robert S. Wistrich, Alan Keyes, and the Anti-Defamation League also consider UN attention on Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive.Alan Keyes quoted in Yohanan Manor, To Right a Wrong: The Revocation of the UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 Defaming Zionism (New York: Shengold Publishers, 1996), p. 171. qtd. in Wistrich, p. 484.Gold, p. 20.Dershowitz, Alan.

According to Wistrich, \\"a third of all critical resolutions passed by [the UN] Human Rights Commission during the past forty years have been directed exclusively at Israel. By way of comparison, there has not been a single resolution even mentioning the massive violations of human rights in China, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Syria, or Zimbabwe.\\"Wistrich, p. 487.

M. de Waart, BRILL, 1994, p. 121. was one of the earliest decisions of the UN. Noted lawyer Alan Dershowitz, after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the UN defined the term \\"refugee\\" as applied to Palestinian Arabs fleeing Israel in significantly broader terms than it did for other refugees of other conflicts.Dershowitz, Alan. The Case for Israel. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2003. pp. 86‚Äì87. The UNHCR, responsible for all refugees but the Palestinians, limits refugee status only to those who fled/were dispossessed of their homes and lands; by contrast, the UNRWA, responsible for Palestinian refugees, extends refugee status to descendants of the original refugees. In 2007, United Nations Human Rights Council president Doru Romulus Costea said that the UNHRC had \\"failed\\" in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Shamir, Shlomo. \\"UN human rights chief: We failed in handling Israel-PA conflict.\\" Haaretz. 30 September 2007. 7 July 2009. The UN has sponsored several peace negotiations between Israel and its neighbors, the latest being the 2002 Road map for peace. The controversial Resolution 3379 (1975), which equated Zionism with racism, was rescinded in 1991. Noted Robert S. Wistrich: \\"on the same day Resolution 3379 was adopted, the General Assembly decided to establish the 'Committee on the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.' With a large budget at its disposal and acting as an integral part of the United Nations, it has for more than thirty years done everything within its power to establish a Palestinian state in place of Israel.\\" Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism The UN has been accused by Dershowitz, human rights activists Elie Wiesel, Anne Bayefsky, and Bayard Rustin, historian Robert S. Wistrich, and feminists Phyllis Chesler and Sonia Johnson of tolerating antisemitic remarks within its walls.\\"Transcripts.\\" CNN 6 August 2004.Bayefsky, Anne. \\"Extra.\\" 21 June 2004. 7 July 2009.

William Lehman of Florida, March 11, 1981, Congressional Record‚ÄîExtension of Remarks, E993. Lehman incorporated a text by Harris O. Schoenberg, \\"Anti- semitism at the U.N.,\\" first presented in New York on March 10, 1981. qtd. in Wistrich, p. 480. Wistrich described the 1980 World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in Copenhagen in his book, A Lethal Obsession: > \\"Jewish feminists heard truly chilling comments, such as 'The only good Jew > is a dead Jew' and 'The only way to rid the world of Zionism is to kill all > the Jews.' One eye-witness overheard other delegates saying that the > American women's movement had a bad name because its most prominent founding > figures ... were all Jewish. The feminist activist Sonia Johnson described > the anti-Semitism at the Copenhagen conference as 'over, wild, and > irrational.' ... The psychologist and author Phyllis Chesler recorded the > savage response when one Jewish woman mentioned that her husband had been > shot without a trial in Iraq and that she had to escape to Israel with her > children. The place went wild: 'Cuba si! Yankee no! PLO! PLO!' they shouted. > 'Israel kills babies and women. Israel must die.'\\"Wistrich, pp. 471‚Äì483. The most infamous example of this trend was the passage of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with racism, on November 10, 1975. It was the first postwar ideology to ever be condemned in the United Nations' history. The resolution was internationally condemned in the media (especially in the media of Western countries). Many observers noted that the resolution was passed on the thirty-seventh anniversary of Kristallnacht, the pogrom historians agree marked the beginning of the Holocaust. A UN sponsored conference was held in 2001 in Durban, South Africa. The conference was meant to combat racism, but ended up being a forum for world leaders to make various anti-Semitic statements.Jordan, Michael J. \\"Jewish Activists Stunned by Hostility, Anti-Semitism at Durban Conference.\\" United Jewish Communities. 5 September. 1 September 2009.Spitzer, Maya. \\"Swiss Jews worried by pre-Durban II anti-Semitism spike.\\" Jerusalem Post. 12 May 2009. 1 September 2009. Among the anti-Semitic literature freely handed out at the conference were cartoons equating the Nazi swastika with the Jewish Star of David, flyers expressing the wish that Adolf Hitler had completely killed every last Jew on Earth, and copies of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Wistrich, p. 486.Amiel, Barbara. \\"Fighting racism? This will have the opposite effect.\\" Telegraph.co.uk. 3 September 2001. Tom Lantos, Colin Powell, Chuck Schumer, Elie Wiesel, Irwin Cotler, Alan Dershowitz, and Robert S. Wistrich condemned the entire conference, calling it hateful, racist, and anti-Semitic.Wistrich, p. 207. Alleged support for Palestinian militancy According to Dore Gold, Alan Dershowitz, and Robert S. Wistrich, the United Nations has a long history of elevating what it calls \\"national liberation movements,\\" armed groups who commit violence against civilians to achieve political goals, virtually to the status of civilians.Wistrich, pp. 468‚Äì469.\\"The UN's new position could only be understood by those who regarded themselves as members of 'national liberation movements' as a license to commit murder in the name of the cause of self-determination. The UN ... had taken the first step toward legitimizing global terror\\" (Gold, p. 37). In 1974 and again in 1988, the UN invited Yasser Arafat to address the General Assembly.Gold, p. 38.Israel Rejects UN Resolution on Yasser Arafat. Globalpolicy.org (2003-09-21). Retrieved on 2012-07-12.Yasser Arafat, Speech at UN General Assembly. Mondediplo.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-12. Alan Dershowitz accused the UN of allowing states that sponsor terrorism to sit on the Security Council. These visits legitimized the PLO without it \\"having to renounce terrorism.\\"Wistrich, p. 483. In July 1976, Palestinian and German terrorists hijacked an Air France plane headed from France to Israel, landed it in Uganda, and threatened to kill the civilian hostages. Ugandan dictator Idi Amin provided sanctuary for the terrorists in the Entebbe airport. After Israel raided the Ugandan airport and rescued most of the hostages, United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim condemned Israel for the violation of \\"Ugandan sovereignty.\\"Dershowitz, Preemption, 91 Alan Dershowitz stated that while Tibetan people, Kurds, and Turkish Armenians all desire \\"national liberation,\\" the United Nations has only officially recognized Palestinian claims to \\"national liberation\\" and allows representatives of the Palestinian cause to speak at the UN.Dershowitz, Alan M. \\"Terror Stings Its Pal, the U.N.\\" \\"Los Angeles Times\\", Thursday, August 28, 2003. The difference between the three groups and the Palestinians is that the Palestinians use terrorism as a tactic for getting their voice heard, while the Tibetans and Turkish Armenians do not. The UN, according to Dershowitz, favors \\"national liberation\\" groups who practice terrorism above those who do not, including those people who have been under more brutal occupation for a longer time (such as Tibetans). Dershowitz has accused the UN of allowing its refugee camps in the Palestinian territories to be used as terrorist bases. UN admits Sri Lanka civil war failure A review of UN action during the final months of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009, in which tens of thousands of people were killed, criticized the UN leadership, United Nations Security Council and top UN officials in Sri Lanka. UN staff were afraid to publicize widespread killings, top UN leaders did not intervene and the 15-member Security Council did not give \\"clear\\" orders to protect civilians, said the report. The review, led by former UN official Charles Petrie, said senior UN staff in Sri Lanka were afraid to highlight deaths because they feared it would put at risk humanitarian access to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in the region. UN staff in Sri Lanka and New York failed to \\"confront\\" the government about obstacles to humanitarian assistance and were unwilling to \\"address government responsibility for attacks that were killing civilians.\\" Rights groups have given a toll of up to 40,000 dead with most killed in army shelling. The report said UN headquarters' talks with the 193 member states \\"were heavily influenced by what it perceived member states wanted to hear, rather than what member states needed to know if they were to respond.\\" Turning to the Security Council, the report said the body had been \\"deeply ambivalent\\" about putting Sri Lanka on its conflict agenda. Philippe Bolopion, UN director for Human Rights Watch, said the report highlighted a \\"dereliction of duty\\" and was \\"a call to action and reform for the entire UN system.\\" Recognition of Taiwan Since 1971, when the Republic of China (Taiwan) was forced to give up its seat at the UN to the People's Republic of China, the self-governed island of 23 million has been wandering in the diplomatic wilderness, barred from the United Nations and affiliated bodies like the World Health Organization while its Olympic athletes are forced to compete under the banner of Chinese Taipei. The UN recognizes and abides by the One-China Policy which states that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. This has created a gap between Taiwan and the world because the People's Republic of China does not have jurisdiction over Taiwan. Taiwan's United Nations Task Force director, Joanne Ou, has stated that \\"The United Nations talks about justice and human rights, yet they pretend we don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs humiliating, ridiculous and childish.\\" Criticisms of scandals In the book Snakes in Suits, a study of psychopaths in the workplace, Babiak and Hare write that corruption appears to be endemic at the UN: : There are few organizations in the Western world that could survive with the allegations of mismanagement, scandal, and corruption that permeate the United Nations. For many delegates, officials, and employees, particularly those from developing nations, the UN is little more than an enormous watering hole. : Concerned about its shabby image, the UN recently developed a multiple-choice ‚Äúethics quiz‚Äù for its employees. The ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answers were obvious to everyone [Is it all right to steal from your employer? (A) Yes, (B) No, (C) Only if you don‚Äôt get caught]. : The quiz was not designed to determine the ethical sense of UN employees or to weed out the ethically inept but to raise their level of integrity. How taking a transparent test could improve integrity is unclear. There has been no mention of how management and other officials did on the test.Babiak, Paul and Robert D. Hare (2006).

Peacekeeping child sexual abuse scandal Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in Cambodia, Mozambique, Bosnia, and Kosovo after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children, former first lady of Mozambique Gra√ßa Machel documented: \\"In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in child prostitution.\\" The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children. United Nations. 26 August 1996. In 2011, a United Nations spokesman confirmed sixteen Beninese peacekeepers were barred from serving with them following a year-long probe. Of the sixteen soldiers involved, ten were commanders. They failed to maintain an environment that prevents sexual exploitation and abuse. Sexual misconduct by United Nations troops had earlier been reported in Congo, Cambodia, and Haiti, as well as in an earlier incident involving Moroccan peacekeepers in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Accountability In 2007, American diplomat James Wasserstrom raised concerns about corruption amongst UN officials in Kosovo. He was dismissed from his field job and detained by UN police. He brought a case against the UN and General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon, and at his tribunal the UN was directed to compensate him with US$65,000 for the wrongful dismissal. Haiti cholera outbreak UN aid workers from Nepal were identified as the source of a cholera outbreak which killed over 10,000 Haitians and sickened hundreds of thousands more. Yet the UN claimed diplomatic immunity and refused to provide compensation.

He was also chancellor of the diocese of London, in which capacity he examined Protestants who were brought before Bishop Bonner about matters of faith.http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/main/person12_283.html On the accession of Elizabeth I, he was a conspicuous Catholic, and was deprived of all his preferments. He remained in England, however, for some time, and was deputed to attend the Council of Trent. He was sent in order to procure an opinion on the point, then controversial, whether the Catholic faithful might frequent the Protestant churches in order to avoid the penalties decreed against recusants. He brought back an answer to the effect that attendance at the heretical worship would be a great sin. It was at his prompting that the fathers of the Council passed the decree De non adeundis Haereticorum ecclesiis. He afterwards suffered imprisonment in London, and eventually left England. He visited several parts of France and Flanders, and entered the Society of Jesus on 1 May 1563, at St. Andrew's Novitiate, Rome. He was sent first to Monaco and then to the University of Dillingen. Then the pope gave him a mission to Scotland, along with Father Edmund Hay, to the apostolic nuncio Vincentius Laurens who had been consecrated bishop, and appointed his successor in the see of Monte Regale. The object of this mission is unclear but probably connected with affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots. Subsequently he was ordered to France, having been appointed master of novices at Billom. He became a professed father of the Society of Jesus in 1572. For some years he lectured in Latin to the members of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin. This was probably at Paris, where he was residing in 1575-6, and again in 1579 and in 1583. While in Paris, he was an important early influence on Robert Southwell.http://www.bartleby.com/214/0701.html Among his converts were Henry Fitzsimon and George Gilbert.Menology of the Society of Jesus.

Heurist was originally designed by Ian Johnson (from 2005) and developed by the (now disbanded) Arts eResearch unit (AeR) at the University of Sydney. It continues to be developed within the Faculty of Arts. It was released as Open Source software in May 2013 (version 3.1.0), originally on Google Code, later moved to GitHub, and a free web service for low-demand academic databases is available at https://heuristplus.sydney.edu.au/ - other free services are listed in the project web site (http://HeuristNetwork.org). Heurist was developed to overcome two problems identified as common to researchers in the Humanities (and others): * the technical expertise required to set up rich heterogeneous databases with relationships between entities, and to publish data selectively to the web * the fragmentation of research data across many separate incompatible databases It aims to tackle the first issue by providing a web service supporting the on-demand creation and configuration of new databases through a web interface. It aims to tackle the second issue by allowing the storage and interlinking of a wide variety of research data, notes, annotations and digital attachments in a single shared database, while providing individual ‚Äòviews‚Äô on this data and workgroup-owned and private areas for research in progress. Methodology Heurist is written in PHP and JavaScript, on top of a fixed MySQL data structure (all Heurist databases have the same underlying structure, as the logical structure of the database is encoded directly in the data). Entities/record types, fields and terms are defined within the database rather than being hardcoded in the software or database structure. Heurist uses a key-value pair approach linked to a primary data table instantiating typed entities, allowing variant data structures and repeating value fields. Relationships between entities are implemented as a relationship record which is no different from any other record type, apart from a few special behaviours. Heurist has the following field types: * Numeric (integer or decimal) * Text (single line or memo) * Term lists (values from a controlled hierarchically organised list) * Date / time fields (including fuzzy dates and several alternative calendars) * Geographic (point, line, polygon) * Pointer fields allowing lookup of another record in the database (constrained or unconstrained) * Relationship fields allowing the creation of typed, constrained, directional, dated and annotated relationships between records * File attachments - this field type also allows remote files to be referenced through a URL Heurist uses Smarty templates for user-defined reporting, and generates maps and timelines directly in the interface for any items which have geographic or time fields; embedding code is provided to generate the same reports /maps / timelines in a web page using JavaScript or within an iframe. Network diagrams and schema diagrams are available in Heurist version 4. Other functions include a bookmarklet for capturing web references, WYSIWYG formatted text and threaded discussions within records, user and workgroup tags, personal and shared saved searches, search expansion rules to pull in related records, workgroup ownership of records, group notifications, and blogging. There is a Zotero bibliography synchronisation function. For developers there is a JavaScript programming API - HAPI - allowing direct read and write access to Heurist records independent of internal storage structure, and functions for transforming XML output to other forms using XSLT stored in records within the database. Heurist source code is available under GNU GPL from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/HeuristNetwork/heurist and can be installed on any LAMP server, including virtual servers in the NeCTAR Research cloud, Amazon AWS and virtual servers from most ISPs.. Applicability Heurist was conceived as a digital knowledgebase for managing heterogeneous and relatively unstructured data, in small to medium collections of (often textual) data such as those typically found in the Arts and Humanities, and in personal research spaces. It is not suitable for large, structured, homogeneous, numerical datasets typical of the Sciences.Heurist Help Heurist allows management of information with spatial and temporal components. Spatial components include the ability to enter georeferenced points, polygons etc. directly into an editor, as well as the ability to upload spatial data such as KML and Shapefiles. Spatial data is displayed on a map view within the database. Temporal components include the ability to enter dates as calendar dates, ranges, fuzzy dates or radiocarbon dates, with confidence levels. Dates are displayed on a timeline within the database. Heurist has been used to provide a database for research for a number of PhD research projects, primarily in Humanities disciplines, including Archaeology, Classics and Art History. Heurist was also used as the database to manage the cultural heritage information for nomination of the World Heritage Site Bahrain Pearling Trail, which was successfully inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2012. Cultural Heritage Managers at the former Ministry of Culture in Bahrain (now the Bahrain Authority for Culture & Antiquities) used Heurist to collate, analyse, manage and assist with the vast array of data associated with the nomination. This data included spatial polygons defining the properties to be included in the World Heritage Site, details of the properties (including timelines and history of ownership), details of people associated with the properties (including anthropological interviews with informants), associated photographs, documents and plans, including architectural plans and legal documents. These items were all cross- referenced with intuitive relationships defining how they were associated with each other. This database was referred to in the Nomination file, accepted by UNESCO in 2012.

His first work was at the Dumont Theatre in D√ºsseldorf; then as Music advisor for Karlsruhe and Stuttgart radio stations. He escaped Nazi persecution of Jews and settled in Britain in 1939. He worked as Music Director of Old Vic in Bristol, where he composed incidental music and stage scores. Karl was an enthusiast of Baroque music and a player of the viola d'amore. He edited works of Cherubini, Boccherini, Dittersdorf, Handel, Haydn and others. In 1941 he founded the London Baroque Ensemble, which had its public debut in 1943, and continued to play until 1966. Members of the Ensemble between 1952 and 1954 included Sidney Sutcliffe, Terence MacDonagh, Natalie James (aka Natalie Caine), Roger Lord on oboe; Frederick Thurston, Jack Brymer, Gervase de Peyer, Basil Tschaikov on clarinet; Cecil James, Paul Draper, Edward Wilson on bassoons; James O'Loughlin on contra-bassoon; Dennis Brain, Neill Sanders, Ian Beers on horns; Vivian Joseph (cellist) on cello; and James Merritt on double- bass. They have accompanied keyboardists Lionel Salter, Charles Spinks and George Malcolm in works of J. S. Bach and C. P. E. Bach. They made a number of recordings of Handel, Bach and Boyce,some produced by George Martin. According to Basil Tschaikov, Karl Haas was a fine instrumentalist but a poor conductor. This was evidenced when playing the Richard Strauss Sonatina No 2 for the BBC on two occasions, as the second was by far the better performance. The difference was attributed to his taking a fall after the first, which left his arms in a sling. A recording containing Dvo≈ô√°k's Serenade in D minor Op. 44, Mozart's Serenade No. 11 in E flat, K.375 and Serenade No. 12 in C minor, K.388/384a is available on the Testament label.

As an economic theory of value, LTV is central to Marxist social-political-economic theory and later gave birth to the concepts of labour exploitation and surplus value. LTV criticisms therefore often appear in the context of economic criticism, not only for the microeconomic theory of Marx but also for Marxism, according to which the working class is exploited under capitalism.  Microeconomic theory  Adherents of neoclassical economics, the mainstream school of economics, employ the theory of marginalism, which holds that the value of any good or service is measured by its price. While Marxian surplus value can't be measured, the utility of the \\"last\\" bought consumption good determined by its marginal utility, in satisfying a specific consumer's wants should therefore be concerned as a complete absolute essence, where politics, social constructions, ideologies and culture (such as the media, fashion, and consumerism) should be considered nonexistent. While Marx emphasizes profit maximisation (under the premise that a capitalist would only be concerned with profit), neoclassical economists view the maximisation of utility at the individual or societal level (i.e. in capitalism individuals are understood as altruist concerned solely in providing people with what they want). Proponents of the labor theory of value (LTV) would reply that in capitalism the price of a good is not simply measured by its usefulness but by its price. It depends on a pre-existing set of relations of distribution. These relations of distribution in turn rest on a set of relations of production, which determine how consumers \\"earn\\" money, capitalists \\"earn\\" profits, workers wages, landlords rent and so on. Consequently, the price of an object depends not only on its usefulness, but on the amount of money different consumers would spend on it, i.e. their different effective demands. It is unclear how if at all this differs from a wealth effect on demand that results directly from the individual's utility maximization problem. In microeconomics, this utility maximisation takes place under certain constraints, these are the available numbers of factors of production, for instance, labor (as with Marx profit maximisation takes place under the constraint of available production techniques and the wage rate).Details are explained by microeconomics, for a text book see Henderson, Quandt 1971. In fact, the ultimate restriction is time. Households divide their time (24 hours a day) into leisure time and time for work. Time for work is to make money to buy goods for consumption. The household chooses that amount of leisure time and (via working time) that amount of consumption goods that maximises its utility level. With Marx, working time is not based on a free decision of households, but the outcome of a class struggle between workers and capitalists, the former trying to decrease, the latter to increase working time. Further, all this does not take account of effects of the accumulation process. With Marx, there is a tendency of equalisation of rate of profit in the accumulation process, which leads to prices of production. If the price of a commodity is above its price of production, then capitalists in that sector earn a super profit (a rate of profit above the average rate of profit of the economy as a whole). As a result, capital is attracted to that sector, production increases, and prices fall until the super profit has been competed away. The resulting prices of production are via transformation from labor values into prices based on labor times. According to marginalism, value is subjective (since the same item‚Äîleisure time, consumption goods‚Äîhave a different marginal utility to different consumers, or even to the same consumer under different circumstances) and therefore cannot be determined simply by measuring how much labor is necessary to produce an item. In the Pareto optimum, on the other hand, the exchange relations between commodities are not only determined by their marginal utility, but also by the marginal productivity of the factors of production available. This means that in marginalism commodities exchange at the marginal amount of labor necessary to produce them. In this sense, an LTV, or, more precisely, a value theory of marginal labor inputs, holds.The conditions under which relative prices of commodities, if determined by marginal utilities, are proportional to amounts of labor necessary to produce these commodities, are discussed in L. Johansen: labor Theory of Value and Marginal Utilities. Economics of Planning 1963/3, p. 89-103. However, this applies to all factors of production and also to marginal utility. Labor is nothing special. That these several value theories can hold all at the same time is made possible by marginal analysis.And whether the underlying mathematical functions are ‚Äúwell-behaved‚Äù, as the term is. Otherwise no optimum solution exists. The Pareto optimum is defined as a situation where utility is maximised and at the same time all factors of production are employed most efficiently, leading to a situation, where all commodities exchange at their marginal utilities and at their - marginal - amounts of the different factors of production necessary to produce them. In other words, if empirically it was found out, that commodities exchange according to their marginally necessary labor inputs, this would confirm marginal theory. It would falsify Marx‚Äôs theory, because according to Marx these exchange ratios are determined by prices of production, which are generally different from the necessary labor inputs, the labor values. Implicitly, Marx is thus denying that capitalism is in a state of Pareto optimality.  Carl Menger's critique  Opponents of Marxist economics argue that the labor theory of value is disproven as commodities may diverge from the average price of production. In his 1871 work Principles of Economics, Austrian School economist Carl Menger writes: > There is no necessary and direct connection between the value of a good and > whether, or in what quantities, labor and other goods of higher order were > applied to its production. A non-economic good (a quantity of timber in a > virgin forest, for example) does not attain value for men since large > quantities of labor or other economic goods were not applied to its > production. Whether a diamond was found accidentally or was obtained from a > diamond pit with the employment of a thousand days of labor is completely > irrelevant for its value. In general, no one in practical life asks for the > history of the origin of a good in estimating its value, but considers > solely the services that the good will render him and which he would have to > forgo if he did not have it at his command...The quantities of labor or of > other means of production applied to its production cannot, therefore, be > the determining factor in the value of a good. Comparison of the value of a > good with the value of the means of production employed in its production > does, of course, show whether and to what extent its production, an act of > past human activity, was appropriate or economic. But the quantities of > goods employed in the production of a good have neither a necessary nor a > directly determining influence on its value.  Eugen B√∂hm-Bawerk's criticism  The Austrian economist Eugen von B√∂hm- Bawerk argued against both the Adam Smith labor theory of price and Marx's theory of exploitation. On the former, he contended that return on capital arises from the roundabout nature of production, which necessarily involves the passage of time. A steel ladder, for example, is produced and brought to market only if the demand supports the digging of iron ore, the smelting of steel, the machines that press that steel into ladder shape, the machines that make and help maintain those machines and so on. Roundabout processes, B√∂hm- Bawerk maintained, lead to a price that pays for more than labor value, and this makes it unnecessary to postulate exploitation to understand the return on capital. In contrast, Marx argued in Capital that it is not demand that creates, but labor that preserves the value of the commodities obtained prior to the actual process of production - in this case, the iron, steel and machines necessary to make the ladder: > The worker is unable to add new labor, to create new value, without at the > same time preserving old values, because the labor he adds must be of a > specific useful kind, and he cannot do work of a useful kind without > employing products as the means of production of a new product, and thereby > transferring their value to the new product. [This] is a gift of nature > which costs the worker nothing, but is very advantageous to the capitalist > since it preserves the existing value of his capital.Capital, volume 1, > chapter 8. Thus, proponents of the LTV argue, without the necessary addition of human labor-power, the ore, steel and machines would not create any new value on their own, but would in fact gradually depreciate what value they originally possessed through the ravages of time and neglect. Once these materials are activated in the labor process, their values are simply transferred from one commodity to another with no increase. They claim that it is not the materials, but the labor-time present in a commodity that represents its mark- up in value over the course of its production. B√∂hm-Bawerk's positive theory of interest also argued that workers trade in their share of the end price for the more certain wages paid by the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs, he claimed, have given up a safer wage-earning job to take on the role of entrepreneur. In other words, he claimed that profits compensated the entrepreneur for the willingness to bear risk and to wait to receive income. B√∂hm-Bawerk's essential argument that employers are compensated for shouldering some risk in paying their employees ahead of time, however, appears unable to explain how profit can be accumulated in cases where workers are reliant on commissions, tips and so on for their income, which are received only after they sell their services. However, B√∂hm-Bawerk's does provide such an explanation. In the context of a waiter earning tips, the waiter himself is not a wage-earner. The restaurant owner does not make of profit from the tips earned by the waiter. The waiter is essentially an entrepreneur, taking the risk that customers will sufficiently compensate him for the labor he provides, while the customers are under no legal obligation to do so. The waiter is making an investment of services in anticipation of future return from the customers. The waiter is compensated by an aggregate amount of earnings from tips that exceeds that labor value provided to the customers, thereby including a return on the waiter's investment. If the tips were not sufficient to provide this return on investment, then the waiter would rationally seek other employment, such as a wage-earning job with similar compensation that does not include the risk element or an entrepreneurial job with similar risk that provides a better return. Regarding other situations where the employer-entrepreneur does receive a profit from after the labor has been rendered (e.g. a salesperson who works on commission), the employer-entrepreneur may take risks other than paying a wage to the salesman, including: providing a salesperson with an office, cell phone and/or computer; paying for product training and marketing materials; paying for travel and lodging expenses; producing inventory in reliance upon future sales that may or may not be made by the salesperson. All of this comprises a potential for loss that accounts for the return on investment realised by the employer-entrepreneur. Nikolai Bukharin argued that B√∂hm-Bawerk's concept of roundaboutness was untenable in the context of the continuous, simultaneous production of a modern economy.Nikolai Bukharin, (1927) The Economic Theory of the Leisure Classes, ch. 4, part 3.  Methodological individualism  The Austrian school, led by Eugen von B√∂hm- Bawerk, argues against the whole tradition of the LTV (see above) and prefers methodological individualism. Neoclassical economics also follows this lead ‚Äî and that of Jevons, Menger, and Walras ‚Äî from the 1870s and discards the LTV in favour of General equilibrium theory, which determines prices based on the interaction of preferences, technology and endowments through supply and demand.  Socially necessary labor  Marx argues in Capital: > Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by > the quantity of labor spent on it, the more idle and un-skillful the > laborer, the more valuable would his commodity be, because more time would > be required in its production. The labor, however, that forms the substance > of value, is homogeneous human labor, expenditure of one uniform labor > power. The total labor power of society, which is embodied in the sum total > of the values of all commodities produced by that society, counts here as > one homogeneous mass of human labor power, composed though it be of > innumerable individual units...The labor time socially necessary is that > required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, > and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the > time.Capital, Volume 1, section 1 Thus, according to Marx any labor power squandered during the production of a commodity, i.e. labor that is socially unnecessary, does not add value as value is determined by the average social labor. Robert Nozick has criticised the qualifier \\"socially necessary\\" in the labor theory of value as not well- defined and concealing a subjective judgement of necessity.Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State and Utopia For example, Nozick posits a laborer who spends his time tying knots in a piece of cord. The laborer does his job as efficiently as is humanly possible, but Marx would likely agree that simply tying knots in cords is not a socially necessary use of labor. The problem is that what is \\"socially necessary\\" depends entirely on whether or not there is demand for the finished product, i.e., the knotted cord. In this way, introducing the \\"socially necessary\\" qualifier into the labor theory of value simply converts the theory into a roundabout and imprecise description of supply and demand. Thus Nozick argues that there is no longer any labor theory of value but rather the notion of what makes labor time socially necessary is dependent upon supply and demand in the market.Nozick, Robert. Anarchy, state, and utopia. Vol. 5038. New York: Basic Books, 1974, page 260 Dembinsky argues that the \\"labour value\\" metric as proposed by Marx was the main reason for many of the market inefficiencies as observed in Eastern Bloc planned economies. For the \\"labor value\\" concept to work, the society needs must be \\"perfectly known before production commences\\", the needs must not change in the meantime and the effect of production is required to actually satisfy society's needs, complying with the previously established plan. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, the economy is eventually forced to either allow users to determine their own value in use using market prices (second economy, NEP) or deny the users \\"the right to assign goods a value in use\\". According to Dembinsky, many of the declaratively Marxian economies were effectively left with an open and crucial question on how to actually assess the labor value, which is not clearly answered in Marx works. Most of them applied an ideologically safe \\"average labor time\\" model, which had however considerable negative influence on effectiveness by \\"discouraging marginal productivity gains\\". Another criticism is that socially necessary labour time needs to be able to be measured as a homogenous unit of labour, which can then be added up. If socially necessary labour time cannot be measured, then it is difficult to see how Marx's theory can be maintained, as the quantum that Marx viewed as underlying all of capitalism cannot actually be examined. Some critics of Marxism argue that its proponents have failed to find an adequate way to measure socially necessary labour time.Nitzan, Jonathan, and Shimshon Bichler. Capital as power: A study of order and creorder. Routledge, 2009, pp.86-97  In a socialist society  It is often assumed that the LTV would apply in a socialist (or post-capitalist) society, though (purportedly at least) without the corresponding exploitation. However, Marx argued in his Critique of the Gotha Programme: > Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of > production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little > does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these > products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to > capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion > but directly as a component part of the social labor.Critique of the Gotha > Program ch 1 David Ramsay Steele expands on this: > Numerous Marxist writers, from Marx and Engels down to Charles Bettelheim, > have favoured employing units of labor-time for planning production under > socialism. This proposal is often referred to as an application of the labor > theory of value, though that usage is not in conformity with Marx's. The > Marxian labor theory of value (LTV) is intended to explain the determination > of prices under commodity production (this is occasionally denied, but see > Steele 1986). In Marxian terminology, there can be no 'value' in post- > capitalist society. Both the LTV and communist planning conceive of resource > allocation being guided by quantities of labor-time. Yet the LTV as an > explanation of market prices and the labor-time planning proposal are two > distinct theories, which may stand or fall independently.

And if units of labor-time could effectively be employed > for communist planning, this would not require that the LTV be the correct > explanation of market prices. [...] According to Marx's theory, actual > prices virtually always diverge from 'values' defined as units of labor- > time. In Marx's thinking, after 1860, the relationship between 'value' and > observed market prices is somewhat analogous to the relationship between > 'mass' and 'heaviness', or between 'heat' and everyday awareness of > temperature. Marx's 'value' is purportedly necessary to explain price, but > it does not correspond to price or equilibrium price (often not even > roughly) and therefore obvious disparities between value and price are not > seen by Marx as refutations of his theory, though they are seen as > contradicting the simple models employed in the early stages of expounding > his theory in Volumes I and II of \\"Capital\\".David Ramsay Steele, \\"From Marx > to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic > Calculation\\", La Salle: Open Court, 1992  Cases of inapplicability  The LTV is a theory of capitalist production, or generalised commodity production. However, there are commodities bought and sold under capitalism that have an 'imaginary' price even though they do not have a value. \\"Objects that in themselves are no commodities, such as conscience, honour and the like, are capable of being offered for sale by their holders, and of thus acquiring, through their price, the form of commodities. Hence an object may have a price without having value. The price in that case is imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics. On the other hand, the imaginary price-form may sometimes conceal either a direct or indirect real value-relation; for instance, the price of uncultivated land, which is without value, because no human labor has been incorporated in it\\" (Capital Volume 1, Chapter 3, section 1).\\"Chapter Three: Money, Or the Circulation of Commodities\\". However the socially necessary labor theory of value only becomes inapplicable for uncultivated land when that land can never be productive no matter how much commercial labor is expended on it. Desert sand, gibber plains and icy wastes have very small land values because no commercial labor can be diverted from other uses to be usefully employed. In other cases, the price-form represents the indirect socially necessary labor that could be usefully employed: * Pieces of art could be explained as instances of monopoly. * Uncultivated land has a price, even if there is no labor involved. The price of land is explained by the theory of rent. Both Ricardo and Marx developed theories of land-rent based on the LTV. * Paper money‚Äîaccording to Marx, \\"[t]he function of gold as coin becomes completely independent of the metallic value of that gold. Therefore things that are relatively without value, such as paper notes, can serve as coins in its place\\" (Capital, Vol 1, Part 1) Section 2.\\"Chapter Three: Money, Or the Circulation of Commodities\\" * Value of shares is explained similarly like the value of land.  Importance of labor  Marx stated that only labor could cause an increase in exchange value. Assuming that all labor is equal, this suggests that labor-intensive industries ought to realize a higher profit than those that use less labor. This contradicts the tendency, accepted by Marx, that rates of profit between industries should become equal. Marx explained this contradiction by the fact that in real economic life prices vary not randomly, but in a systematic way from values. The mathematics applied to the transformation problem‚Äîtransformation of labor values into production prices‚Äîattempt to describe this (albeit with the unwelcome side consequences described above). Critics (following, for instance, studies of Piero Sraffa) respond that this makes the once intuitively appealing theory very complicated; and that there is no justification for asserting that only labor and not for example grain can increase value. Any commodity can be picked instead of labor for being the commodity with the unique power of creating value, and with equal justification one could set out a corn theory of value, identical to the labor theory of value.Karl Marx¬ß 3 Anarchist Robert Paul Wolff, despite identifying as a Marxist on economic matters,Self-description of Robert Paul Wolff nevertheless offers such a critique, saying \\"By reproducing for corn [grain] or iron or coal, all the striking results that Marx derived concerning for labor, we have, it seems to me, raised questions about the foundations of Marx's critique of capitalism and classical political economy.\\"Robert Paul Wolff, quoted in Ellerman's Property and Contract in Economics: the case for economic democracy ch 4 However, there may be several problems with this criticism. The starting point for Marx's argument was as such: \\"What is the common social substance of all commodities? It is labor.\\"Value, Price and Profit ch 6 It is not possible to view grain, iron etc. as common to all commodities, whereas the production of commodities is impossible without labor (while it can also be said that other commodities such as tools are required, they cannot be properly aggregated by value because they are specialised and disparate in nature and their values, relative to each other and to labor, depend on prices that in turn depend on their values; Sraffa (1960), for instance, aggregates them according to the labor required for their production). Marx identifies the substance of value as labor, which in his view is not a commodity (though \\"labor power\\" is). This was a necessary aspect for the substance of value Marx elaborates upon in Capitalsee ch1 of Capital and Theories of Surplus Value.See Marx's discussion of measures such length and the area of triangles in ch 20 p 312 Some supporters of the LTV, however, accept the thrust of the \\"corn theory of value\\" critique, but emphasise the social aspect of what Marx calls the \\"common social substance\\", arguing that labor power is unique as it is the only commodity not sold by capitalists but rather sold by the workers themselves, whose income tends to a minimum, because they have nothing else to sell. The surplus product is appropriated by the capitalists. Alan Freeman argues: \\"This is of course true of other commodities [than labor power] also; but other commodities do not walk around the market disposing of their income on an equal basis with their owners. The cost of labor power is determined independently of its capacity to make money for its purchaser. This, and no other reason, is why profit exists. If laborers were hired directly as slaves, robots, beasts of burden or servants, then whether or not labor time were the measure of value, surplus labor would not be extracted in the form of money profits but directly, like domestic labor.\\"Freeman, Alan: Price, value and profit - a continuous, general treatment. In: Alan Freeman, Guglielmo Carchedi (editors): Marx and non-equilibrium economics. Edward Elgar. Cheltenham, UK, Brookfield, US 1996.For the difference between wage workers and working animals or slaves confer: John R. Bell: Capitalism and the Dialectic - The Uno-Sekine Approach to Marxian Political Economy, p. 45. London, Pluto Press 2009 Albert Einstein, in his description of the LTV, argues similarly: \\"It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product.\\"Albert Einstein: \\"Why Socialism?\\". Originally published 1949 in Monthly Review Marx writes on this: ‚ÄúIn the slave system, the money-capital invested in the purchase of labor-power plays the role of the money-form of the fixed capital, which is but gradually replaced as the active period of the slave‚Äôs life expires.‚ÄùKarl Marx Capital, volume II, chapter XX. www.marxists.org David Steele argues that Marx gives no good reason why labor should have a \\"privileged position in the determination of prices\\", when any other input could be used - machines, paper or even capital itself. Steele notes that commodities almost never have equal quantities of labor and that Marx's argument rests upon the assumption that when commodities are exchanged, they must have \\"something\\" in common and that something can be nothing but labor. Steele argues as such: > [...] any input could be chosen as a creator of value [...] Thus a 'paper > theory of value' would hold that prices were ultimately determined by > values, defined as quantities of 'socially necessary paper' (measured in > pounds weight). The organic composition of capital would be the ratio of > non-paper means of production to paper, and it would be asserted that only > paper created new value, and therefore surplus-value. The whole of Capital > could be rewritten, substituting 'paper' for 'labor'. Exploitation of paper- > owners would occur because they do not really sell their paper, but rather > their 'paper-power'. Goods requiring no paper inputs would be regarded as > having 'imaginary prices', just as Marx regarded salable goods which require > no labor inputs. The same thing, of course, could be done with > 'electricity', 'liquid', 'metal', or 'machines', or it could be done with > 'capital' (constant capital, which would then have to be renamed variable > capital), thus showing that the capitalist class produces all wealth and is > exploited by other classes, especially the wholly unproductive working > class, which contributes no capital and therefore no value. To provide > support for Marx's theory, it is necessary to show both that prices can be > mathematically derived from labor-values (the transformation problem) and to > present a good argument why we would wish to do this - why the class of > inputs known as 'labor' should be given this privileged position in the > determination of prices. Steele thus refers to marginal theory, under which labor is just another input in the production process and therefore concludes that to say that capital exploits labor makes as much sense as saying \\"that labor exploits capital, or electricity exploits roofing tiles\\". Indeed, it has been argued that Marx never offered (despite promising to do so in Volume 3 of Capital) a positive proof for his theory or an explanation for why labour-power is the only commodity that can create more value.Donald Ernsberger, Jarret Wollstein, \\"The Labour Theory of Value (an analysis), Liberty International, 12 October 1988Sesardiƒá, Neven. \\"Marxian Utopia.\\" (1985), p.21 Steele also argues that Marx thought that prices needed to be explained by some third factor, beyond supply and demand, because he believed that when supply and demand balance or equal each other, they can cancel each other out and thus could not explain equilibrium prices (hence the need for the labour theory of value to explain equilibrium prices). Steele argues this is mistaken as it is based on the view that supply and demand are magnitudes or numbers, when really they can be viewed more like schedules or functions. Supply and demand, when equal, do not cancel each other out but rather they are actually coinciding; at that particular price, the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. Price is thus always (proximately) determined by supply and demand, even when the two coincide. Thus when supply and demand are understood this way, Marx's argument cannot be forwarded.Steele, David Ramsay. From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Ecomic Calculation. Open Court, 2013. Eugene B√∂hm-Bawerk uses an analogy to a balloon filled with gas. The balloon will continue to rise through the air until the air pressure of the atmosphere and the air pressure within the balloon are in equilibrium. Thus the height of the balloon can only be explained by considering the relative density of the balloon on one side and the atmosphere on the other. However, B√∂hm-Bawerk argues that if Marx's view of equilibrium is used, then one would have to say that the densities would cancel each other out and thus have \\"ceased to act\\", meaning they cannot explain why the balloon is now floating, which is incorrect as it is the relative densities that explain why the balloon floats. Thus for B√∂hm-Bawerk, it is simply inaccurate to state that supply and demand cannot explain equilibrium prices because they supposedly cancel each other out.von B√∂hm-Bawerk, Eugen. Karl Marx and the close of his system: A criticism. TF Unwin, 1898, 180-182 Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai observed that there is also the prospect of surplus value arising from sources other than labour and a classic given example is winemaking. When grapes are harvested and crushed, labour is used. However, when yeast is added and the grape juice is left to ferment in order to get wine, the value of wine exceeds that of the grapes significantly, yet labour contributes nothing to the extra value. Marx had ignored capital inputs due to placing them all together in constant capital‚Äîtranslating the wear and tear of capital in production in terms of its labour value. Yet examples such as this demonstrated that value and surplus value could come from somewhere other than labour.Desai, Meghnad, Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism, 2002, Verso Books, page 264 Some Marxists argue that this criticism is erroneous because the labour theory of value was only ever meant to refer to freely reproducible commodities (i.e those not limited by scaricity), which would exempt goods such as wine, paintings, land and so forth.Ehrbar, Hans, and Mark Glick. \\"The labor theory of value and its critics.\\" Science & Society (1986): 464-478, pp.467-468Allen Wood, Karl Marx, 2005, Taylor and Francis, p.234 However, a counter-criticism is that this position makes no sense because non-freely reproducible commodities are still commodities and if Marx wishes to find a common factor that underlies all commodities, this common factor must exist in all commodities, rather than a narrow conception of commodities. Marx has also been criticised for not making clear in his writings when he is using \\"commodity\\" in this narrow conception.von B√∂hm- Bawerk, Eugen. Karl Marx and the close of his system: A criticism. TF Unwin, 1898, pp.69-73 Since Marx argued that skilled labor was simply \\"condensed\\" labor, he has been accused of circular reasoning, as he resolves the issue of the value of skilled labor in the labor theory of value by assuming the labor theory of value is true so that skilled labor is judged by its exchange- value.Albert Whitaker, \\"History and Criticism of the Labor Theory of Value in English Political Economy\\", Batoche Books, 2001, p.25von B√∂hm-Bawerk, Eugen. Karl Marx and the close of his system: A criticism. TF Unwin, 1898, pp.153-163Steele, David Ramsay. From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Ecomic Calculation. Open court, 2013.Sesardiƒá, Neven. \\"Marxian Utopia.\\" (1985), Centre for Research into Communist Economies, , pp.18-19. It has been argued that Marx's effort to distinguish between skilled and unskilled labor was incoherent, as all labor ultimately required some degree of skill - true unskilled labor would only be possible with mindless automatons as workers still need to think in order to produce. This means it is not possible to reduce skilled labor to unskilled labor (and thus determine the number of unskilled labor hours) because all labor is skilled, meaning that value cannot be determined just by counting labor hours.Nitzan, Jonathan, and Shimshon Bichler. Capital as power: A study of order and creorder. Routledge, 2009, pp.96 Furthermore, Marx asserted that skilled labor is allegedly more productive than unskilled labor, yet this explanation is both circular and incomplete. It is circular because productivity can only be compared by using wage and price differences, the very thing the labor theory of value is supposed to explain. It is incomplete because Marx does not explain why the additional value-creating power of skilled labor should necessarily be related to the labor cost of skill acquisition. While one suggested solution is that the skilled labor transfers its production time to the commodity it produces, this solution means that it is not the total number of hours of skill creation that matter but only those that the worker or their employer end up paying for, when in reality economics and politics are never separate, thus rendering the equilibrium assumptions behind the theory untenable. Much training is provided by the government, community and house for free. In addition, the economy is almost never at a fully competitive equilibrium, so there is no guarantee that the education and training will be transacted for at their value. Lastly, it is unclear what should be used as measure of unskilled labor (the unskilled labor of a school graduate, a peasant, a hunter-gatherer etc.) by which to measure skilled labor.Nitzan, Jonathan, and Shimshon Bichler. Capital as power: A study of order and creorder. Routledge, 2009, pp.142-143  Post-Keynesian criticism  The post- Keynesian economist Joan Robinson, who was otherwise sympathetic to Marx's writings, was strongly critical of the labor theory of value. She wrote that it was essentially a \\"metaphysical doctrine\\" and \\"logically a mere rigmarole of words\\".Joan Robinson, \\"Economic Philosophy\\" p39 She writes: > Value is something different from price, which accounts for prices, and > which in turn has to be accounted for. And to account for it by labour-time > is mere assertion... This theory of prices is not a myth... Nor was it > intended to be an original contribution to science. It was simply an > orthodox dogma.Joan Robinson, \\"Economic Philosophy\\" p38 Others have pointed out that the labor theory of value is based on a failure to recognize the properly dialectical component of human desire. Pilkington writes: > [V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in > turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] > enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our > peers. [A] medal [or an enemy] flag are not valued for their objective > properties, nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them, > rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the inter- > subjective network of desires. Pilkington says that this is a different theory of value than the one we find in many economics textbooks. He writes that in mainstream marginalist theory consumers are viewed in an atomistic manner, unaffected by the desires of their peers. He writes that \\"actors in marginalist analysis have self- contained preferences; they do not have inter-subjective desires\\". He says that dialectical analyses of value can be found in the work of Thorstein Veblen and James Duesenberry.Philip Pilkington, Marx, Hegel, The Labour Theory of Value and Human Desire  Ecological economics  In ecological economics, it is argued that labor is in fact energy over time.Anson Rabinbach, \\"The human motor: Energy, fatigue, and the origins of modernity\\" However, echoing Joan Robinson, Alf Hornborg argues that both the reliance on \\"energy theory of value\\" and \\"labor theory of value\\" are problematic as they propose that use- values (or material wealth) are more \\"real\\" than exchange-values (or cultural wealth)‚Äîyet, use-values are culturally determined.Jean Baudrillard, \\"Pour une critique de l'√©conomie politique du signe\\" For Hornborg, any Marxist argument that claims uneven wealth is due to the \\"exploitation\\" or \\"underpayment\\" of use-values is actually a tautological contradiction, since it must necessarily quantify \\"underpayment\\" in terms of exchange-value. The alternative would be to conceptualize unequal exchange as \\"an asymmetric net transfer of material inputs in production (e.g., embodied labor, energy, land, and water), rather than in terms of an underpayment of material inputs or an asymmetric transfer of 'value'\\". In other words, uneven exchange is characterised by incommensurability, namely: the unequal transfer of material inputs; competing value-judgements of the worth of labor, fuel, and raw materials; differing availability of industrial technologies; and the off-loading of environmental burdens on those with less resources.

In 1863, Rufus Henry Ingram met George Baker from San Jose, California, who had just come east to join the Confederate Army. Baker complained because the secessionists in California had no experienced leaders. Ingram claimed to have been with Quantrill's Raiders during the Lawrence Massacre and became interested in going back with Baker to recruit soldiers for the Southern cause. In early 1864, Rufus Henry Ingram arrived in Santa Clara County with a Confederate commission as captain and with a former undersheriff of Monterey County, Tom Poole, organized about fifty local Knights of the Golden Circle and commanded them in what became known as Captain Ingram's Partisan Rangers. Finding difficulty in raising funds to purchase supplies for his unit, Ingram first planned a raid on San Jose to rob its banks and stores in the manner of Quantrill's raid on Lawrence. A quarrel within the band, however, led to the exposure of the plan to the local sheriff and it was abandoned. John Boessenecker, Badge and Buckshot: Lawlessness in Old California, University of Oklahoma Press, 1997. pg. 137-140 Soon after, Ingram decided to rob shipments of silver from the Comstock Lode to Sacramento. On June 30, Ingram, along with a small detachment, robbed two stagecoaches eleven miles east of Placerville of their gold and silver, leaving a letter explaining they were not bandits but carrying out a military operation to raise funds for the Confederacy. During the pursuit of his fleeing band, the posse had a gunfight with two lawmen at the Somerset House. One of the posse was killed, while Poole was wounded and left to be captured. After a two-day chase the Placerville posse lost their trail and they got to Santa Clara County a week later. Tom Poole gave a complete confession, the bullion was recovered and he exposed his companions identities. Regardless, they evaded the search for them in Santa Clara County. John Boessenecker, Badge and Buckshot, pg. 140-149 On July 15, an attempt by Ingram to rob the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine payroll failed, ending in a shootout with the posse of Santa Clara County Sheriff John Hicks Adams a mile and a half outside San Jose on the Almaden road.

Early life Burnett was born and raised in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. He attended Cumberland College and received a law degree from the University of Tennessee. Professional Life A farmer, businessperson and attorney, Burnett served as a Cumberland County Church of Christ preacher in Jamestown, Tennessee. After graduating from law school, Burnett established a law practice and began his political career. Political career In 1970, 28-year-old Burnett, a Democrat, was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. His district included Fentress, Overton and Morgan counties on the Cumberland Plateau. Burnett became a trusted lieutenant of House Speaker Ned McWherter. Burnett served first as house floor leader then house majority leader during the administrations of Governors Ray Blanton, Lamar Alexander and McWherter. Burnett's strong oratorical skills and effectiveness at working across party lines made him a gifted politician. Some state political observers speculated Burnett would become governor. He is given much of the credit for winning passage of major education legislation proposed by Governor Alexander, nursing home reforms, the Tennessee Sentencing Commission Act, and tort reform. Among the successful legislation that he sponsored were laws mandating use of seatbelts and limiting the nighttime hours of work for teenage students. 1983 conviction In 1983, Burnett served 10 months in prison at Maxwell Air Force Base after his conviction in federal court for the misdemeanor of willfully failing to file federal income tax returns. While in prison, he was re-elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, defeating two opponents in the primary and winning the November 1984 general election with 60 percent of the vote. 1991 conviction Burnett was convicted again in August 1990 on nine counts for his involvement in an illegal bingo gambling operation. In 1991, Burnett was convicted as a result of the Operation Rocky Top investigation by the FBI into corruption in the Tennessee General Assembly. One of his convictions was for defrauding a man he had met in prison and inducing him to invest $48,000 in the gambling operation. Burnett received a five-year prison sentence for his Operation Rocky Top conviction, and served 16 months before being released to a halfway house in August 1992. After his conviction, he was forced to end his campaign for re-election to an 11th term in the fall of 1990, and went to work as a car dealer during the appeals process. After six months in the halfway house, he began a new career as a talk radio commentator on Teddy Bart's Roundtable program in Nashville. As a convicted felon, Burnett lost his law license and could not seek public office again. However, he succeeded in getting the law license restored in 2003 and became a lobbyist in the General Assembly in his final years, although health problems limited his physical activity.Ken Whitehouse, State bids farewell to legendary legislator Tommy Burnett, NashvillePost.com, September 17, 2009 Later years Burnett's career also included stints as a cattle rancher, oil prospector, chicken farmer, and seller of fireworks. He is credited with helping to establish the Highway 127 Corridor Sale, which has been called \\"the world's largest flea market.\\" Death Burnett died September 17, 2009, in a hospital in Nashville. His funeral was September 20, 2009, in the Fentress County community of Banner Springs.

He was a nephew of the famous Macedonian Bulgarian voyvoda Hadzhi Dimitar and a brother of the IMARO revolutionary Yordan Asenov. He graduated from the Bulgarian Men's High School of Varna and later from the Sofia University. Afterwards Asenov worked as a Bulgarian Exarchate teacher in Macedonia. Under the influence of Gotse Delchev, he joined the IMARO and the struggle for the liberation of Macedonia and Odrin from the Turkish yoke. When he was a teacher in the village of Leshko, Asenov met Yane Sandanski. He was one of the organizers and took an active role in the Miss Stone Affair. In 1902, his sister, Doctor Sabka Asenova, preserved a part of the ransom collected from the Miss Stone Affair. Asenov's cousins, Dimitar Asenov and Ivan Asenov were freedom fighters in the revolutionary band of the voyvoda Toma Davidov. During 1902, Asenov's revolutionary activity was concentrated on the right coast of the Struma River. During the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising he was a voyvoda of the Kilkis cheta and fought against the Ottomans in the area of the Paiak Mountain. In the village of Kornishor, there was a merger between the Kilkis band of Krastyo Asenov, and the Enizhe-Vardar bands of Apostol Petkov and Ivan Karasuliyata.

However, he was killed only several days after the wedding by his superstitious comrades, dissatisfied with his decision to marry.

He was –∞ founder of what came to be called National Communism. Biography Shakhrai joined the Bolsheviks after completing his training at the Military Academy in Poltava in 1917, while some sources claim that he was already a Bolshevik since 1913. He was one of the few Ukrainians amongst the Poltava Bolsheviks. At the time the Bolsheviks were in a unified organisation with the local Mensheviks, but Shakhrai supported Serhii Mazlakh, a Jewish Poltava Bolshevik who successfully ousted the Mensheviks by August 1917. Shakhrai and Mazlakh were then elected editors of the weekly newspaper. By this time Shakhrai was supporting Ukrainian national interests within the party. Although this caused concern amongst the predominantly Jewish local Mensheviks, he gained support amongst local Bolsheviks, who felt that it helped gain support amongst the largely anti-Russian Ukrainians of the region. Shakhrai was elected as a delegate to both the First All-Ukrainian Consultative Conference of the CP(b)U and the First All Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. He was also appointed the People's Commissar for Military Affairs in the Soviet Ukrainian government. In this capacity he accompanied Trotsky to Brest Litovsk for the treaty negotiations there in March 1918. He was concerned about the suppression of Ukrainian cultural organizations by Russian Bolshevik troops who were sent to Ukraine in January and February 1918. Lenin consented to the dismemberment of Ukraine through the founding of the Donets- Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic as a ruse to place it outside the terms of the Brest Litovsk Treaty. Although this stratagem failed, it further raised concerns for Shakrai as regards to how the Bolsheviks were treating Ukraine. This concern was increased when Lenin gave a speech in November 1918, which called upon party functionaries to consider themselves Russian patriots. By December 1918 his alienation from the Bolsheviks was more or less complete.Introduction by Michael Luther, On The Current Situation in the Ukraine 1970 His pamphlet The Revolution in Ukraine was published in November 1918, followed by On the Current Situation in Ukraine in January 1919. It led to Shakhrai expulsion from the CP(b)U in June 1919. Shakhrai then went to Saratov, then occupied by Anton Denikin's White Volunteer Army. Here he worked on a number of underground newspapers, before being arrested and shot by Denikin's administration in autumn 1919.

In recent times, this technique was widely taught in India and around the world by Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj, who experienced a spiritual vision in which the manifestation of a Jangama sage instructed him in this technique of meditation to achieve self-realization. Jangama means 'eternal existence' and dhyana means 'meditation.' Hence Jangama dhyana is 'Meditation on the Eternal Existence (of the Self).' Today, the technique is taught by his direct disciple Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, who carries the legacy and spiritual teachings of his guru Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj around the world.  Origins  Jangama dhyana is an ancient meditation technique which involves concentrating the mind and sight between the eyebrows. According to Patanjali, this is one method of achieving the initial concentration (dharana: Yoga Sutras, III: 1) necessary for the mind to go introverted in meditation (dhyana: Yoga Sutras, III: 2). In the deeper practice of the Jangama dhyana technique, the mind concentrated between the eyebrows begins to automatically lose all location and focus on the watching itself. Eventually, the meditator experiences only the consciousness of existence and achieves Self Realization. Swami Vivekananda describes the process in the following way: > When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or > external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken > current, as it were, towards that point. This state is called dhyana. When > one has so intensified the power of dhyana as to be able to reject the > external part of perception and remain meditating only on the internal part, > the meaning, that state is called Samadhi.See Swami Vivekenanda on Dhyana > and Samadhi in Raja Yoga s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume > 1/Raja-Yoga/Dhyana And Samadhi/here. The point between the eyebrows is referred to as the bhrikuti and symbolically as the ajna chakra, which means 'commanding circle.' When the mind becomes totally concentrated at this point, one becomes the commander of one's mind. Until then, the meditator will not have achieved self-mastery. The Bhagavad Gita describes the process and benefits of the meditation technique as follows: > Shutting off sense > From what is outward, > Fixing the gaze > At the root of the eye-brows, > Checking the breath-stream > In and outgoing > Within the nostrils, > Holding the senses, > Holding the intellect, > Thrusts fear aside, > Thrusts aside anger > And puts off desire: > Truly that man > Is made free for ever.Swami Prabhavananda and Christoper Isherwood, 1987, > Bhagavad-Gita: The Song of God, p. 133. In modern times, the 19th century Yogi, Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, practiced meditating between the eyebrows in order to achieve Nirvikalpa Samadhi (bringing the mind to a complete standstill, beyond imagination). Though he was able to withdraw his mind from all external sensations and objects, he initially could not go beyond the vision of goddess Kali, which his mind had become totally concentrated upon during his long period of devotional tapas. Shri Ramakrishna recounts how his Guru on the path of Advaita Vedanta, Totapuri, gave him further instruction in the meditation technique to overcome this obstacle: > He cast his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it > between my eyebrows... 'Concentrate the mind on this point!' he thundered. > Then with stern determination I again sat to meditate... The last barrier > fell. My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself > in Samadhi.M. (Pseudonym for Gupta, Mahendranath),1942, The Gospel of Sri > Ramakrishna, p. 29. Later Shri Ramakrishna was to give the same instruction in meditation to his illustrious disciple Swami Vivekananda.The Life of the Swami Vivekananda, Volume I, 1979, Advaita Ashrama, p. 132. Today, the technique is associated with Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj. Shri Shivabalayogi was initiated into the technique at the age of fourteen. On 7 August 1949, he experienced a vision of a tall Jangama Sage (ancient order of ascetics) with matted hair, who told him to sit in padmasana (lotus posture), and close his eyes. The Sage then touched the young boy between the eyebrows and instructed, 'Watch here.' Thus, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj sat in tapas (deep, prolonged meditation) for twelve years, meditating for 23 hours a day for eight years and around 12 hours a day for the remaining four years. After this period, he initiated tens of thousands of people into the meditation technique he had used to achieve Self Realization. In 1994, Shri Shivabalayogi initiated his direct disciple, Seenu, into tapas using the Jangama dhyana technique. He achieved Self Realization in November 1999 and was given the name Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, after meditating for around 20 hours a day over five years.  Name  The name for the technique was coined by Shri Shivabalayogi while walking around the Dehradun ashram one night with his direct disciple, Seenu, who was later to become the Enlightened Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. He suddenly turned to Seenu and said: > Perhaps it would be nice to name the meditation technique we are teaching > worldwide as Jangama dhyana. Lord Shiva first appeared to me in the form of > a Jangam Sage to impart the technique, and Jangama means 'Eternal > Existence'; so Jangama dhyana would mean 'meditation on the Eternal > Existence of the Self.'Young, Bruce, 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 190.  Technique  The Jangama dhyana technique is as follows:See description on the website of Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. > Sit, closing the eyes. > Concentrate the mind and sight in between eyebrows. > Keep watching there by focusing the attention. > Do not repeat any mantra or name. > Do not imagine anything. > Do not open eyes until the duration of meditation is over. > Today, initiation into this technique is given by Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj. He identifies the greatest secret of meditation as not analyzing any thoughts or visions that may appear: > This meditation is a purification process, but this purification doesn't > occur quietly. During the purification, visions and thoughts come. It is > just like when you are washing clothes; you see the dirt coming out into the > water. In the same way, when the mind is going through the purification, > then thoughts and visions occur. But they occur only for a moment, and then > they disappear. That is why we need to be so careful in this regard, because > if you are watching, then the mind can very easily get involved in the > thought, and if it gets involved it can further acquire new imprints. This > re-acquiring is so subtle. This is why it is so important not to analyze > thoughts during meditation, and this is also why the total cleansing of the > mind takes time.Hopkins, Charles & Carol, 2007, From the Heart of Peace, p. > 95-96. Visions and experiences are not important in meditation. The only symptom of progress is greater peace. After being totally cleansed through meditation, the mind becomes pure consciousness capable of realizing through deeper meditation (Samadhi) its existence beyond imagination as the eternal Self. This state is known as Self Realization or Enlightenment.  Resources  * Hopkins, Charles and Carol, 2007, From the Heart of Peace, (). * M.

The largest of these by volume is the Narmada, followed by the Tapti. Madhya Pradesh falls in five major river basins. The northern part of the state falls within the Ganges Basin where the Betwa, Chambal and Son flow. South of the Ganges Basin is the Narmada Basin, the second largest by surface area. The other three basins cover small portions of Madhya Pradesh, namely the Mahi Basin to the west, the Tapi Basin and the Godavari Basin to the south. Kunda River Khargone city is situated at the bank of Kunda River.kunda river is life line of Khargone district. It Is Situated In Khargone (MP).  Ganges Basin: betwa  The Betwa drains off of the Deccan plateau. Originating in the Kumra village in Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh, the Betwa flows for 590 km (232 km in MP and 358 km in UP). After meandering through Madhya Pradesh, it enters the neighbouring state, Uttar Pradesh, and joins the river Yamuna (Jamna) in Hamirpur. The Betwa takes along with it the waters of the eastern Malwa plateau. The tributaries of the Betwa include the Bina, Yamini, Dhasan and Ken. In ancient times, the Betwa was known as Vetrawati.  Ganges Basin: Chambal  The Chambal originates from the Janapav Near Mhow Mountain in the Vindhya Range, and flows northeast through Ujjain, Ratlam and Mandsaur, before entering Rajasthan. It reenters Madhya Pradesh after meandering through parts of Rajasthan and touches Morena and Bhind. Here are the infamous Chambal Ravines that have been and still are the safest refuge for dacoits.  Shipra  The Shipra starts her journey in the Vindhya Range from a hill called Kokri Tekdi situated at a distance of 11 km from Ujjain. This river is 195 km long, out of which 93 km flow through Ujjain. It then touches Ratlam and Mandsaur, before joining the river Chambal in Gwalior . The main tributaries of the Shipra are the Khan and the Gambhir.  Ganges Basin: Sone  The Sone, also called the Maikalsut because its source is in the Maikal Hills, originates in Anuppur District in the Amarkantak highlands of the Maikal Range. Its chief tributaries are the Rihand and the North Koel. and also include the Kewai, Tipan, Kunak, Murna, Johilla, Mahanadi, and the Rer.  Kewai  The Kewai arises in the Maikal Hills and flows in Shahdol District and Anuppur District and then into the Son River.  Tipan  The Tipan River merges into the Son at the town of Anuppur. It is subject to illegal gravel mining.  Johilla  The Johilla (Juhila) arises on the high trappean (basalt) plateau of the Mandla District, in the Maikal Hills and is a tributary of the Son.  Mahanadi  The Mahanadi tributary of the Son is distinct from the Mahanadi which originates in Chhattisgarh state and flows east. The political and mafia influence in western Madhya Pradesh's katni district's Ghunaur village has made this beautiful flowing perennial river worse than a drain . Once livelihood of the two villages namely Ghunaur and Barhata was inseparable of this river.  Mahi Basin  In Madhya Pradesh the Mahi Basin consists of the headwaters of the Mahi in Dhar and Jhabua districts; and the headwaters of the Anas River and Panam River in Jhabua District. This river crosses tropic of Cancer twice.  Tapi Basin: Tapti  The Narmada, the Mahi and the Tapti River (Tapi) all flow westward into the Gulf of Khambat, of the Arabian Sea. The 724 km long Tapti is agriculturally very important as it drains an area of over 65,145sq km spread over Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. This river originates at a height of 762m in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh (to the south of the Satpura Range). The Tapti journeys almost parallel to the Narmada, though it is much shorter in length than the Narmada and has a smaller catchment area.  Godavari Basin  In Madhya Pradesh the Godavari Basin consists of the headwaters of the Kanhan, including the Pench, and the headwaters of the Wainganga River.

It occurs across several phases, including prenatal development, puberty, and pregnancy. At menopause, breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy. Breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as breasts in primates, which serve primarily as mammary glands. The process is mediated by an assortment of hormones (and growth factors), the most important of which include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and growth hormone. Biochemistry The breast: cross-section scheme of the mammary gland. Hormones The master regulators of breast development are the steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, growth hormone (GH), mostly via its secretory product, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and prolactin. These regulators induce the expression of growth factors, such as amphiregulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), IGF-1, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which in turn have specific roles in breast growth and maturation. At puberty, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. GnRH induces the secretion of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), from the pituitary gland. The secreted gonadotropins travel through the bloodstream to the ovaries and trigger the secretion of estrogen and progesterone in fluctuating amounts during each menstrual cycle. Growth hormone (GH), which is secreted from the pituitary gland, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is produced in the body in response to GH, are growth-mediating hormones. During prenatal development, infancy, and childhood, GH and IGF-1 levels are low, but progressively increase and reach a peak at puberty, with a 1.5- to 3-fold increase in pulsatile GH secretion and a 3-fold or greater increase in serum IGF-1 levels being capable of occurring at this time. In late adolescence and early adulthood, GH and IGF-1 levels significantly decrease, and continue to decrease throughout the rest of life. It has been found that both estrogen and GH are essential for breast development at puberty ‚Äì in the absence of either, no development will take place. Moreover, most of the role of GH in breast development has been found to be mediated by its induction of IGF-1 production and secretion, as IGF-1 administration rescues breast development in the absence of GH. GH induction of IGF-1 production and secretion occurs in almost all types of tissue in the body, but especially in the liver, which is the source of approximately 80% of circulating IGF-1, as well as locally in the breasts. Although IGF-1 is responsible for most of the role of GH in mediating breast development, GH itself has been found to play a direct, augmenting role as well, as it increases estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast stromal (connective) tissue, while IGF-1, in contrast, has been found to not do this. In addition to estrogen and GH/IGF-1 both being essential for pubertal breast development, they are synergistic in bringing it about. Despite the apparent necessity of GH/IGF-1 signaling in pubertal breast development however, women with Laron syndrome, in whom the growth hormone receptor (GHR) is defective and insensitive to GH and serum IGF-1 levels are very low, puberty, including breast development, is delayed, although full sexual maturity is always eventually reached. Moreover, breast development and size are normal (albeit delayed) in spite of GH/IGF-1 axis insufficiency, and in some the breasts may actually be large in relation to body size. The relatively large breasts in women with Laron syndrome have been suggested to be due to increased secretion of prolactin (which is known to produce breast enlargement) caused by a drift phenomenon from somatomammotrophic cells in the pituitary gland with a high GH secretion. An animal model of Laron syndrome, the GHR knockout mouse, shows severely impaired ductal outgrowth at 11 weeks of age. However, by 15 weeks, ductal development has caught up with that of normal mice and the ducts have fully distributed throughout the mammary fat pad, although the ducts remain narrower than those of wild-type mice. In any case, female GHR knockout mice can lactate normally. As such, it has been said that the phenotypes of women with Laron syndrome and GHR knockout mice are identical, with diminished body size and delayed sexual maturation accompanied by normal lactation. These data indicate that very low circulating levels of IGF-1 can nonetheless allow for full pubertal breast development. Tanner stages of breast development. Development of the breasts during the prenatal stage of life is independent of biological sex and sex hormones. During embryonic development, the breast buds, in which networks of tubules are formed, are generated from the ectoderm. These rudimentary tubules will eventually become the matured lactiferous (milk) ducts, which connect the lobules (milk \\"containers\\") of the breast, grape-like clusters of alveoli, to the nipples. Until puberty, the tubule networks of the breast buds remain rudimentary and quiescent, and the male and female breast do not show any differences. During puberty in females, estrogen, in conjunction with GH/IGF-1, through activation of ERŒ± specifically (and notably not ERŒ≤ or GPER), causes growth of and transformation of the tubules into the matured ductal system of the breasts. Under the influence of estrogen, the ducts sprout and elongate, and terminal end buds (TEBs), bulbous structures at the tips of the ducts, penetrate into the fat pad and branch as the ducts elongate. This continues until a tree-like network of branched ducts that is embedded into and fills the entire fat pad of the breast is formed. In addition to its role in mediating ductal development, estrogen causes stromal tissue to grow and adipose (fat) tissue to accumulate, as well as the nipple- areolar complex to increase in size. Progesterone, in conjunction with GH/IGF-1 similarly to estrogen, affects the development of the breasts during puberty and thereafter as well. To a lesser extent than estrogen, progesterone contributes to ductal development at this time, as evidenced by the findings that progesterone receptor (PR) knockout mice or mice treated with the PR antagonist mifepristone show delayed (albeit eventually normal, due to estrogen acting on its own) ductal growth during puberty and by the fact that progesterone has been found to induce ductal growth on its own in the mouse mammary gland mainly via the induction of the expression of amphiregulin, the same growth factor that estrogen primarily induces to mediate its actions on ductal development. In addition, progesterone produces modest lobuloalveolar development (alveolar bud formation or ductal sidebranching) starting at puberty, specifically through activation of PRB (and notably not PRA), with growth and regression of the alveoli occurring to some degree with each menstrual cycle. However, only rudimentary alveoli develop in response to pre- pregnancy levels of progesterone and estrogen, and lobuloalveolar development will remain at this stage until pregnancy occurs, if it does. In addition to GH/IGF-1, estrogen is required for progesterone to affect the breasts, as estrogen primes the breasts by inducing the expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) in breast epithelial tissue. In contrast to the case of the PR, ER expression in the breast is stable and differs relatively little in the contexts of reproductive status, stage of the menstrual cycle, or exogenous hormonal therapy. During pregnancy, pronounced breast growth and maturation occurs in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. Estrogen and progesterone levels increase dramatically, reaching levels by late pregnancy that are several hundred-fold higher than usual menstrual cycle levels. Estrogen and progesterone cause the secretion of high levels of prolactin from the anterior pituitary, which reach levels as high as 20 times greater than normal menstrual cycle levels. IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels also increase dramatically during pregnancy, due to secretion of placental growth hormone (PGH). Further ductal development, by estrogen, again in conjunction with GH/IGF-1, occurs during pregnancy. In addition, the concert of estrogen, progesterone (again specifically through PRB), prolactin, and other lactogens such as human placental lactogen (hPL) and PGH, in conjunction with GH/IGF-1, as well as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), acting together, mediate the completion of lobuloalveolar development of the breasts during pregnancy. Both PR and prolactin receptor (PRLR) knockout mice fail to show lobuloalveolar development, and progesterone and prolactin have been found to be synergistic in mediating growth of alveoli, demonstrating the essential role of both of these hormones in this aspect of breast development. Growth hormone receptor (GHR) knockout mice also show greatly impaired lobuloalveolar development. In addition to their role in lobuloalveolar growth, prolactin and hPL act to increase the size of the nipple-areolar complex during pregnancy. By the end of the fourth month of pregnancy, at which time lobuloalveolar maturation is complete, the breasts are fully prepared for lactation and breastfeeding. Insulin, glucocorticoids such as cortisol (and by extension adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)), and thyroid hormones such as thyroxine (and by extension thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)) also play permissive but less well-understood/poorly- characterized roles in breast development during both puberty and pregnancy, and are required for full functional development. Leptin has also been found to be an important factor in mammary gland development, and has been found to promote mammary epithelial cell proliferation. In contrast to the female- associated sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone, the male-associated sex hormones, the androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), powerfully suppress the action of estrogen in the breasts. At least one way that they do this is by reducing the expression of the estrogen receptor in breast tissue. In the absence of androgenic activity, such as in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), modest levels of estrogen (50 pg/mL) are capable of mediating significant breast development, with CAIS women showing breast volumes that are even above-average. The combination of much higher levels of androgens (about 10-fold higher) and much lower levels of estrogen (about 10-fold less), due to the ovaries in females producing high amounts of estrogens but low amounts of androgens and the testes in males producing high amounts of androgens but low amounts of estrogens, are why males generally do not grow prominent or well-developed breasts relative to females. Calcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D, acting through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has, like the androgens, been reported to be a negative regulator of mammary gland development in mice, for instance, during puberty. VDR knockout mice show more extensive ductal development relative to wild-type mice, as well as precocious mammary gland development. In addition, VDR knockout has also been shown to result in increased responsiveness of mouse mammary gland tissue to estrogen and progesterone, which was represented by increased cell growth in response to these hormones. Conversely however, it has been found that VDR knockout mice show reduced ductal differentiation, represented by an increased number of undifferentiated TEBs, and this finding has been interpreted as indicating that vitamin D may be essential for lobuloalveolar development. As such, calcitriol, via the VDR, may be a negative regulator of ductal development but a positive regulator of lobuloalveolar development in the mammary gland. A possible mechanism of the negative regulatory effects of the VDR on breast development may be indicated by a study of vitamin D3 supplementation in women which found that vitamin D3 suppresses cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the breast, and by doing so, reduces and increases, respectively, the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth factor Œ≤2 (TGF-Œ≤2), a known inhibitory factor in breast development. Moreover, suppression of PGE2 in breast tissue is relevant because, via activation of prostaglandin EP receptors, PGE2 potently induces amphiregulin expression in breast tissue, and activation of the EGFR by amphiregulin increases COX-2 expression in breast tissue, in turn resulting in more PGE2, and thus, a self-perpetuating, synergistic cycle of growth amplification due to COX-2 appears to potentially be present in normal breast tissue. Accordingly, overexpression of COX-2 in mammary gland tissue produces mammary gland hyperplasia as well as precocious mammary gland development in female mice, mirroring the phenotype of VDR knockout mice, and demonstrating a strong stimulatory effect of COX-2, which is downregulated by VDR activation, on the growth of the mammary glands. Also in accordance, COX-2 activity in the breasts has been found to be positively associated with breast volume in women. Growth factors Estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, as well as GH/IGF-1, produce their effects on breast development by modulating the local expression in breast tissue of an assortment of autocrine and paracrine growth factors, including IGF-1, IGF-2, amphiregulin, EGF, FGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNF-Œ±), tumor necrosis factor Œ≤ (TNF-Œ≤), transforming growth factor Œ± (TGF-Œ±), transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤), heregulin, Wnt, RANKL, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These factors regulate cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation via activation of intracellular signaling cascades that control cell function, such as Erk, Akt, JNK, and Jak/Stat. Based on research with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) knockout mice, the EGFR, which is the molecular target of EGF, TGF-Œ±, amphiregulin, and heregulin, has, similarly to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), been found to be essential for mammary gland development. Estrogen and progesterone mediate ductal development mainly through induction of amphiregulin expression, and thus downstream EGFR activation. Accordingly, ERŒ±, amphiregulin, and EGFR knockout mice copy each other phenotypically in regards to their effects on ductal development. Also in accordance, treatment of mice with amphiregulin or other EGFR ligands like TGF-Œ± or heregulin induces ductal and lobuloalveolar development in the mouse mammary gland, actions that occur even in the absence of estrogen and progesterone. As both the IGF-1R and the EGFR are independently essential for mammary gland development, and as combined application of IGF-1 and EGF, through their respective receptors, has been found to synergistically stimulate the growth of human breast epithelial cells, these growth factor systems appear to work together in mediating breast development. Elevated levels of HGF and, to a lesser extent, IGF-1 (by 5.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively), in breast stromal tissue, have been found in macromastia, a very rare condition of extremely and excessively large breast size. Exposure of macromastic breast stromal tissue to non-macromastic breast epithelial tissue was found to cause increased alveolar morphogenesis and epithelial proliferation in the latter. A neutralizing antibody for HGF, but not for IGF-1 or EGF, was found to attenuate the proliferation of breast epithelial tissue caused by exposure to macromastic breast stromal cells, potentially directly implicating HGF in the breast growth and enlargement seen in macromastia. Also, a genome-wide association study has highly implicated HGF and its receptor, c-Met, in breast cancer aggressiveness. Lactation Upon parturition (childbirth), estrogen and progesterone rapidly drop to very low levels, with progesterone levels being undetectable. Conversely, prolactin levels remain elevated. As estrogen and progesterone block prolactin-induced lactogenesis by suppressing prolactin receptor (PRLR) expression in breast tissue, their sudden absence results in the commencement of milk production and lactation by prolactin. Expression of the PRLR in breast tissue may increase by as much as 20-fold when estrogen and progesterone levels drop upon childbirth. With suckling from the infant, prolactin and oxytocin are secreted and mediate milk production and letdown, respectively. Prolactin suppresses the secretion of LH and FSH, which in turn results in continued low levels of estrogen and progesterone, and temporary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycles) occurs. In the absence of regular, episodic suckling, which keeps prolactin concentrations high, levels of prolactin will quickly drop, the menstrual cycle will resume and hence normal estrogen and progesterone levels will return, and lactation will cease (that is, until next parturition, or until induced lactation (i.e., with a galactogogue), occurs). Breast size and cancer risk Some factors of breast morphology, including their density, are clearly implicated in breast cancer. While breast size is moderately heritable, the relationship between breast size and cancer is uncertain. The genetic variants influencing breast size have not been identified. Through genome-wide association studies, a variety of genetic polymorphisms have been linked to breast size. Some of these include rs7816345 near ZNF703 (zinc finger protein 703); rs4849887 and rs17625845 flanking INHBB (inhibin Œ≤B); rs12173570 near ESR1 (ERŒ±); rs7089814 in ZNF365 (zinc finger protein 365); rs12371778 near PTHLH (parathyroid hormone-like hormone); rs62314947 near AREG (amphiregulin); as well as rs10086016 at 8p11.23 (which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7816345) and rs5995871 at 22q13 (contains the MKL1 gene, which has been found to modulate the transcriptional activity of ERŒ±). Many of these polymorphisms are also associated with the risk of developing breast cancer, revealing a potential positive association between breast size and breast cancer risk. However, conversely, some polymorphisms show a negative association between breast size and breast cancer risk. In any case, a meta- analysis concluded that breast size and risk of breast cancer are indeed importantly related. Circulating IGF-1 levels are positively associated with breast volume in women. In addition, the absence of the common 19-repeat allele in the IGF1 gene is also positively associated with breast volume in women, as well as with high IGF-1 levels during oral contraceptive use and with lessening of the normal age-associated decline in circulating IGF-1 concentrations in women. There is great variation in the prevalence of the IGF1 19-repeat allele between ethnic groups, and its absence has been reported to be highest among African-American women. Genetic variations in the AR have been linked to both breast volume (as well as body mass index) and breast cancer aggressiveness. COX-2 expression has been positively associated with breast volume and inflammation in breast tissue, as well as with breast cancer risk and prognosis. Rare mutations Women with CAIS, who are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated actions of androgens, have, as a group, above- average sized breasts. This is true despite the fact that they simultaneously have relatively low levels of estrogen, which demonstrates the powerful suppressant effect of androgens on estrogen-mediated breast development. Aromatase excess syndrome, an extremely rare condition characterized by marked hyperestrogenism, is associated with precocious breast development and macromastia in females and similarly precocious gynecomastia (women's breasts) in males. In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition in which the AR is defective and insensitive to androgens, there is full breast development with breast volumes that are in fact above average in spite of relatively low levels of estrogen (50 pg/mL estradiol). In aromatase deficiency, a form of hypoestrogenism in which aromatase is defective and cannot synthesize estrogen, and in complete estrogen insensitivity syndrome, a condition in which ERŒ± is defective and insensitive to estrogen, breast development is completely absent.

If he was born in 1624, then he was only 9 years old when Lastman died. Such an apprenticeship therefore seems unlikely. In 1643 he became a member of the Alkmaar Guild of St. Luke, which may point to an initial training in that city.

The French planned to land 5,000-6,000 soldiers in North-East Scotland to support a rising by local Jacobites, that would restore James Francis Edward Stuart to the throne of Great Britain. Despite French commander Claude de Forbin warning the chances of evading the Royal Navy long enough to land his troops were extremely limited, his fleet of small privateers reached Scotland in March 1708. As he had forecast, he was unable to disembark the troops and returned home, narrowly escaping a pursuing British naval force. Such attempts reflected a fundamental and continuing divergence of objectives; while the Stuarts wanted to regain their throne, for the French, they were a simple and low-cost way to absorb British resources. Much of the Royal Navy was occupied chasing de Forbin, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. This made it successful for France, but a failure for the Jacobites. Background French Admiral Claude de Forbin (1656-1733); he had little faith in the expedition from the start Under the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, Louis XIV withdrew support from the exiled James II, and recognised William III as legitimate monarch. However, when James died on 16 September 1701, he reneged on this, and proclaimed his son James Francis Edward Stuart King of England and Scotland. The War of the Spanish Succession began soon after; William died in March 1702 and was succeeded by the last Stuart monarch, James' Protestant daughter Anne. By the end of 1707, the war had reached stalemate; despite victories in Flanders, the Allies had been unable to break French border defences, or place their candidate on the Spanish throne. Both sides attempted to use internal conflicts to break the deadlock; Britain supported the Camisard rebels in South-West France, with the Jacobites serving a similar function for the French. Jacobite agent Nathaniel Hooke convinced Louis there was an opportunity for a Scottish rising, which would divert British troops from Europe. The 1707 Act of Union was widely unpopular in Scotland, while French privateers caused enormous losses for their maritime trade, and the coastal fishing industry. Protecting Scottish shipping was not a priority for the Royal Navy, which faced multiple demands on its resources for escorting merchant convoys. Hooke visited Scotland in 1707, meeting supporters like the Earl of Erroll, while elderly Jacobite Thomas Buchan provided reports on bases at Fort William and Inverness. Senior nobles like the Dukes of Atholl and Hamilton refused to commit, partly due to an attempt in 1703 by Simon Fraser, later Lord Lovat, to implicate them in a Jacobite plot as part of a personal feud. However, Hooke obtained a letter of support signed by Erroll, the Earl of Panmure and six others, promising 25,000 men, and requesting 8,000 French troops, weapons, money, artillery, ammunition and ‚Äòmajors, lieutenants and serjeants to discipline‚Äô the Scots army. In addition, supposed Jacobite Presbyterian John Ker claimed some radical Presbyterians or Cameronians supported the Stuarts since 'they are persuaded (Union) will bring an infinite number of calamities upon this nation, and render the Scots slaves to the English.' This was because they viewed union as a threat to Presbyterian Church of Scotland, despite the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act. While the Cameronians were certainly considering this as an option, Ker was a government agent, whose role was to persuade them not to do so. Louis decided there was enough support to begin planning in November 1707; this was supervised by the Comte de Pontchartrain, who had been involved with previous attempts in 1692 and 1696. Claude de Forbin was appointed commander of the naval squadron, with the Comte de Gac√© in charge of the landing force. The Expedition Sir George Byng (1663-1733); ca 1700. As the Royal Navy patrolled exits from the French Channel ports, naval operations often took place during the winter months, when wind and tides made it harder to enforce a blockade. However, it also increased risks from the weather; conditions off North-East Scotland were well-known to French privateers and de Forbin's biggest concern was lack of a confirmed landing place. He later recorded 'the Minister did not mention any port in a condition to receive us, ...or where our fleet might anchor and... troops disembark in safety.' Based on information supplied by French captains, de Forbin told Pontchartrain and Louis XIV the expedition had no chance of success, but planning continued. The fleet assembled at Dunkirk, a major privateer base for centuries, since ships could reach the Thames in a single tide, allowing them to reach as far north as the Orkney Islands. By the end of February, 5,000 - 6,000 troops were ready to embark, joined by James himself on 9 March. Rather than slow-moving transports, de Forbin insisted on using a larger number of small but fast privateers, many of which reduced their crews and offloaded guns to accommodate the troops. While this improved their chances of avoiding the Royal Navy, they could not hope to defeat them in a naval battle. The British had been monitoring French preparations, and a squadron under Sir George Byng now arrived off the nearby port of Gravelines. This prevented the French departure and since James was ill with measles, the troops were disembarked while he recovered. After a week, Byng returned to port for resupply; James and the soldiers were re-loaded, and on 17 March the French force of 30 privateers and five warships left Dunkirk. Merchant ship (left), battling a much smaller privateer (right); these small but fast vessels formed the bulk of Claude de Forbin's fleet Although their departure was immediately delayed by a two day gale, it forced Byng to take shelter, enabling the French to make for the Firth of Forth. Rather than following the coastline, de Forbin kept out to sea to avoid being spotted, and ended up north of the proposed landing site. On 25 March, the French anchored near Fife Ness, then spent the next day searching for a landing place, allowing Byng to catch up with them. Despite James' protests, the French privateers could not face the British in battle and headed north; they then spent two days attempting to enter the Moray Firth before giving up. Most of them made it back to Dunkirk, despite being pursued by the British around the north of Scotland and west of Ireland, but sustained severe damage to both ships and men. Hearing news of the French fleet, some of the Jacobite gentry, including James Stirling of Keir House and four others, gathered at Brig o' Turk. They were arrested, imprisoned in Newgate Prison in London, then later transferred to Edinburgh Castle where they were tried for high treason. They were acquitted of this charge, as the evidence against them proved only that they had drunk to James' health. Aftermath Perceptions of the expedition's value reflect a fundamental divergence of objectives between France and their Jacobite allies. The Stuarts wanted to regain their throne; for the French, they were a useful, low-cost means of absorbing British resources but a Stuart restoration would not change the threat posed by British expansion. The 1708 attempt was a response to the dire military situation France faced as a result of Marlborough's victories in Flanders. It occupied large elements of the British and Dutch navies for several months, with Byng ordered to remain in Scotland even after its defeat, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. A French army of 110,000 recaptured large parts of the Spanish Netherlands, before defeat at Oudenarde on 11 July evicted them once more. Despite ultimate defeat, for France the expedition achieved its short-term purpose, but helped the pro-war Whigs win a majority in the May 1708 General Election, the first held after Union. It also damaged the Jacobites, who failed to launch an effective insurgency in Scotland despite popular opposition to Union; in his overview of the political situation, Hooke concluded 'the country seemed to be fully resolved on peace.'

Early history Ballale means border place in the local Alu language. As long as the natives of the Shortland Islands can remember, the island was uninhabited. According to a local legend, a strange blue light was often observed over the island. Therefore, the island was avoided, and, traditionally, no one lived there. For the local people, Ballale Island was considered a haunted place (sacu-sacu). War groups from neighboring Buka Island used this uninhabited island to cannibalize their prisoners captured during successful tribal feuds and headhunting raids to Choiseul Island. Englishman Sam Atkinson purchased the island in 1901 and established a coconut plantation, harvesting copra. The plantation included the Atkinson family home, as well as copra drying sheds and living quarters for workers. Copra was exported by boat. When Sam Atkinson died in 1931, his wife Edith kept on managing the plantation. She remained on the island until early 1942 when the British colonial government ordered all Europeans to be evacuated from the Solomons Islands. World War II The island was the scene of a Japanese war crime during the Second World War. A work party of 517 British prisoners of war from various artillery regiments captured after the Battle of Singapore were transported to the island under the command of Lt. Col. John Bassett to build an airfield. When the airfield was completed the prisoners, including their commander Bassett, were executed. The mass graves were discovered after the war. Japanese authorities claimed that the prisoners were lost at sea when their transport was torpedoed. This base was the intended destination from Rabaul of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto when his inspection flight was intercepted and shot down on April 18, 1943, near the later site of Buin, Bougainville Island, killing him. Sale of relics Location of Balalae Island, Shortland Islands, south of Bougainville In 2007, the Solomon Islands Government agreed to an arrangement for the sale of all World War II relics at the community of Balalae in Shortlands to an international group. The agreement allowed for the removal of the remains of 11 Japanese planes that had been in place since World War II.

Castle has been built at the steep bank of Daugava River, overseeing this important medieval waterway. Built before 1248 by Albert of Buxthoeven, an Archbishop of Riga. During the Livonian War, LielvƒÅrde Castle was destroyed by Russian troops in 1579. Conserved ruins up to the level of second floor.  History  LielvƒÅrde castle ruins in 1792 (Johann Christoph Brotze collection). In the course of the missionary work in Livonia and the associated construction of fortifications, knight Daniel von Banerow was granted the Lennewarden (LielvƒÅrde) District by Albert of Buxthoeven in 1201. The ancient wooden defense systems of the on the castle hill Livukalns located here were constantly expanded and the livs elder of the castle district continued to rule it. During the , the Crusaders burned the Liv's wooden castle. In 1213, Lithuanian mercenaries captured the elder of LielvƒÅrde castle , but Order of the Sword Brothers bought him from captivity. There are no remains of this wooden structure. The ruins that have survived today largely date from the 14th century and are located on opposite hill from the original fortified complex. Even before 1229, the bishop's vassal Daniels built a stone castle on the site of the Liv castle. The downstream fortress of Uexk√ºll probably served as a model for the construction of the system, since it was a suitable type for a small vassal castle. After his death, Riga LielvƒÅrde 1248. granted to Riga Cathedral, but 1255 recognized it as his property in. In 1262 the Samogitians defeated the army of the Order, the remains of which took refuge in the castle. 1361 The castle was occupied and looted by Lithuanian troops. 14-15 In the 16th century, LielvƒÅrde became the center of the bailiffs of the Riga archbishopric t. s. In the Latvian way, while also preserving the status of the farm castle - the archdiocese's bread barn. At the beginning of the 15th century, the archbishop was forced to pledge the castle to the Order until 1435. year. In the 16th century, the Bernardine monastery of the Antonija Brothers Convent (1514‚Äì1534) was located in LielvƒÅrde Castle, and a stone church was built in the courtyard. During the Livonian War, the castle was pledged to the King of Poland under the \\"pacta protectionis\\" concluded in 1559 and handed over to the protection of Polish-Lithuanian troops, but in 1577 the castle and the church were destroyed by Russian troops in course of Livonian War. The governor of Swedish Livonia partially restored the castle in 1633, but later the medieval building was not repaired and a manor center was established next to it. J.C. Brotze drawing shows that in 1792 the building had two floors, but to this day only one and a half floors have survived and the row of windows on the second floor has disappeared. At the beginning of the 19th century, the manor house was built in the classicist style. At the beginning of the 20th century, the architect Wilhelm Bockslaff rebuilt the manor house by order of the manor owner, Baron . During the First World War, there was a front line along the Daugava for several years, during the cannon fire, the LielvƒÅrde manor castle was completely destroyed.

Gourley was born in Liverpool in 1886. He was the holder of a Master of Engineering degree. On 5 October 1912 he gave a lecture to the Salford Technical and Engineering Association on reinforced concrete construction. He also submitted a paper for publication in the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers investigating the flow of water over circular weirs. During the First World War Gourley served as a commissioned officer in the Corps of Royal Engineers of the British Army. By 1917 he was a Second Lieutenant in the Territorial Force (the army's volunteer reserve) and was also an Associate Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 1 December 1917. Gourley was made Second-in-Command of a field company and on 8 July 1918 was given the acting rank of Captain whilst he held this command Gourley was promoted to acting Major on 24 January 1919, by which point he was serving in the Welsh Division. He reverted to his permanent rank of Lieutenant on 31 March 1919 on ceasing to be employed (due to the end of the war). After the war he continued to be liable to recall to the army as he belonged to the Reserve of Officers until he reached the age limit on 14 November 1936. On 22 April 1938 Gourley was appointed a land tax commissioner for the City of Westminster and its Liberties. Before 1935 he wrote a paper for Engineering entitled \\"Great works of the Roman invaders\\". In 1945 he conducted a general survey of the water resources of Gloucestershire for the county planning office. On 28 January 1949 he was a main speaker at a discussion on river flow surveys and records at Burlington House which was chaired by Sir Roger Hetherington and covered in The Observatory. During this period he was described as a \\"well known consulting engineer\\". On 21 September 1951 he was one of 35 people injured by the Weedon rail crash, the derailment of a passenger train on the West Coast Main Line near to Weedon Bec which killed 15 people. He was partially handicapped as a result and was awarded ¬£47,720 damages by Mr Justice Pearce in the Queen's Bench Division in a judgment delivered on 1 April 1954, comprising ¬£37,720 for loss of earnings, ¬£9,000 for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, and ¬£1,000 for out-of-pocket expenses. The damages awarded for loss of earnings were not subject to tax, but the amount awarded did not take account of the fact that the net earnings retained by Gourley - if he had not been injured - would have been reduced substantially by tax. An appeal against the damages was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, but the House of Lords reduced the damages for loss of earnings to ¬£6,695, to take account of the hypothetical income tax and surtax that would have been due on the actual earnings, setting a legal precedent known as the Gourley principle that remains important in English law.[1956] A.C. 185 Gourley became president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in November 1956. He died just six weeks into his term on 18 December 1956, becoming the first elected president to die whilst in office (Thomas Telford, who was president-for-life, had previously died in office). As the ICE council was empowered to fill any vacancy except that of president a Special General Meeting was called. During this meeting Sir Frederick Arthur Whitaker was elected as president to take effect from February. Whitaker served the remainder of Gourley's term in addition to the full 1957-58 term. A portrait of Gourley hangs in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London.

Nowadays, fragments of the foundation are exposed. History  Dinaburg Castle before the destruction in 1577. In 1273 the order built Dinaburga Castle on lands nominally controlled by Grand Duke of Lithuania Traidenis. The castle was of great strategic importance: it was used as a base for Order raids into central Lithuania in hopes that a weakened Traidenis would discontinue his support of Semigallians who rebelled against the Order. In 1277 castle was surrounded by Traidenis. Within a month, the castle was stormed with 4 movable siege towers. The Russians fought among the attackers, but this did not bring any success, and the Lithuanians were forced to destroy the siege equipment and to withdraw through Daugava. The Order Master Ernst von Ratzeburg responded with an unsuccessful march to the depths of Lithuania in 1278. Than Battle of Aizkraukle ensued. Russians and Lithuanians in the 14th-16th centuries attacked and demolished the castle, but each time the magistrates rebuilt it: * 1313 the castle was rebuilt by the Master Gerhard von Jork, * 1396 the castle was again destroyed by the Lithuanians, but the Order rebuilt it, * 1403 Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas, who started the war with the Order, invaded Latgale and devastated the castle of Dinaburg. It was rebuilt by the swordsmen, * 1418 the castle was attacked again by Vytautas and burned down, * 1481 Dinaburg was commanded by the regiment of the Grand Duke of Moscow Ivan III of Russia under the supervision of the Master Wolter von Plettenberg. The magistrate was forced to sign a contract for payment of tribute imposed on him by Duchy of Moscow, * 1558 The war with Livonia was started by Ivan the Terrible because he wanted to get a strategic access to the Baltic Sea, and got casus belli when the Treaty of Pozvol between Sigismund II Augustus, the ruler of Lithuania and Poland, and Johann Wilhelm von F√ºrstenberg, Master of the Livonian Order was concluded in 1557, proclaiming the military union of the Livonian Order, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against the Grand Duchy of Moscow, 1559 the castle was occupied by Russian and Tatar troops, where Ivan the Terrible had his residence for some time, * 1561 By the Treaty of Vilnius (1561) Livonia was divided and Latgale (with Dinaburg), Vidzeme and South Estonia were given to Lithuania for administration; The treaty was signed by the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Augustus. After the Union of Lublin was signed in 1569 Poland also received the right to administer these lands. Dinaburg became the administrative center of Latgale, where the bishop of the Catholic Church had residence, * 1577 Dinaburg was attacked by Ivan the Terrible's army for two weeks, firing from bombards projectiles with massive bombs of 20 pounds (320 kg). They were made by the students of Andrey Chokhov, who created the masterpiece of casting the Tsar Cannon.Charles Piazzi Smyth Three Cities in Russia, Volume 2 L.

Its main purpose was to be an eastern outpost to control trade routes from Russia. Nowadays the impressive fragments of the castle walls, including a three-floor high fragment, still remain. The ruins are the main tourist attraction in the Ludza District, and is considered a symbol of the town. History The first mention of the castle dates from 1433 when the Livonian Order built a larger and stronger fortress to replace an earlier wooden fortress built by the ancient Latgalians. The Ludza stone castle had three stories, six towers, three gates and two foreparts. It was built as an outpost for the Livonian order, mainly to strengthen the eastern border of Livonia and guard trade routes from Russia. In 1481 the Russians invaded Livonia, occupied and devastated the castle.

At the start of the Livonian War in 1558, German troops attacked Krasnij Gorodok and destroyed a number of parishes in Pskov. In the same year Moscovian troops of Grigoriy Temkin occupied the castle, but suffering defeat, he was forced to abandon his conquest. In 1577 Livonia was once again invaded by Russian troops under the guidance of Ivan IV Vasilyevich and the castle was sacked. The following year the Order had Ludza castle with some others in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania mortgaged, and in 1561 asked the castle to be included in the Inflantia. In 1582 the castle returned to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the Polish-Swedish War in 1625 the Swedish army occupied the castle, but the Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth soon got it back. In the Russian-Polish War in 1654 the Russian voivod Lev Saltikov surrounded Ludza and the castle surrendered. According to a decision of the Polish Sejm in 1667, only the Daugavpils castle was maintained and other defenses, including Ludza castle, were neglected. After that the castle was abandoned and left in ruins.

It was released in 1975, when the political regime portrayed in the film (the Estado Novo) had already been destroyed. The film was released in Cinema Londres, in Lisbon, on September 18, 1975.  Overview  * Script: Alberto Seixas Santos, Lu√≠sa Neto Jorge, Nuno J√∫dice * Director: Alberto Seixas Santos * Production: Centro Portugu√™s de Cinema (CPC) and T√≥bis Portuguesa * Financed by: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation * Shooting dates: March 1972, October 1973, finished in 1974 * Archive footage: Cinemateca Nacional, Emissora Nacional * Film extracts: A Revolu√ß√£o de Maio, Chaimite * Format: 35mm * Genre: fiction (social drama) * Duration: 72‚Äô * Length: 1978 meters * Distributor: Marfilmes (currently), Filmes Castello Lopes (on release date) * Release date: Cinema Londres, in Lisbon, on September 18, 1975 * International English Titles: Gentle Costume, Gentle Morals, Mild Manners  Synopsis  A portrait of the everyday life of a typical middle-class family in parallel with the fall of the Estado Novo, the 48-year dictatorship led by Salazar. The daughters' conflicts and frustrations with their parents, their grandmother and their maid find an obvious echo in the country's collective events. The Carnation Revolution is about to explode.  Historical context  As a rupturing film, Brandos Costumes is less identifiable by the presence of avant-garde aesthetics or an agile plot with a daring structure - not like Belarmino, by Fernando Lopes or O Cerco, by Ant√≥nio da Cunha Telles - than by its ideological left-wing posture, taking a portrait of the social classes, and by its social and political sense of critic. Some characteristics of the new generation films, revolted with the state of things and motivated to denounce the social injustices, are clearly present in Brandos Costumes. The theatrical tone of the representation of this work let it be integrated in the tradition that Manoel de Oliveira (O Passado e o Presente - 1971) explores.

While travelling on the continent he was converted to Catholicism by Robert Parsons at Rome in 1579. On his return to London he, in conjunction with Thomas Pounde of Belmont, formed a Catholic Association, consisting of unmarried young men of birth and property. They promised to live on bare necessities of their state, and to give the rest of their incomes for the good of the Catholic cause. The association was blessed by Pope Gregory XIII on 14 April 1580. Members lodged together in the house of Norris, the chief pursuivant, in Fetter Lane or Chancery Lane, London. Norris had influence with John Aylmer, bishop of London, and was liberally paid by Gilbert. At Fulham the bishop's son-in-law, Dr. Adam Squire, was in Gilbert's pay. Through the connivance of these men the members of the association were able to receive priests and to have masses celebrated daily in their house until, after the arrival of the Jesuits Parsons and Edmund Campion in England, persecution of Catholics grew more severe. In 1581 Gilbert deemed it prudent to withdraw to the English College at Reims, where he was welcomed by William Allen; he then entered the English College, Rome as a pensioner. While preparing to go to France on a papal mission, Gilbert contracted a fever, and died on 6 October 1583. Gilbert had seen to the covering the walls of the English College at Rome with frescoes of the English martyrs. He left the superintendence of this work to William Good, who had the pictures engraved and published, under the title of Ecclesiae Anglicanae Trophaea, Rome, 1584.

The moor has a total area of about , of which around are raised bog and some are fen. The peat layer is up to almost 6 metres thick in places.NABU Gifhorn: Das Gro√üe Moor Individual parts of the moor have their own names like St√ºder Moor, Hestenmoor or Wei√ües Moor. Location The Gro√ües Moor lies north of the town of Gifhorn. To the east it is bordered by the Elbe Lateral Canal. To the south is the village of Triangel, to the west the moor extends as far as Wesendorf. To the north is the village of Sch√∂new√∂rde. The former fen colony (Moorkolonie) of Neudorf- Platendorf extends from the south into the Gro√ües Moor and its six-kilometre- long main street is the longest straight village high street in Lower Saxony. Use Peat cutting in the Gro√ües Moor Until the end of the 17th century only the areas around the edge of the moor were used as cattle meadows and for peat extraction. Until about 1870 the central and northern parts were left almost undisturbed. Later, work began on the construction of drainage canals and the industrial cutting of peat, which reached its zenith after 1945. In the 1960s there were about 14 peatworks, which extracted around 60,000 tonnes of fuel peat and 150,000 tonnes of fertiliser peat per annum. In Westerbeck (Gemeinde Sassenburg) there is only one peatworks left today that cuts peat on an industrial scale.The peat railway in Westerbeck In summer 2003, under the guidance of NABU, the Gifhorn district organisation began a large mammal pasture creation project. On an area of initially back-bredaurochs (ancient cattle) and Konik ponies (primitive Polish horses) have been settled.Beweidungsprojetkt des NABU Gifhorn The existing grasslands were partly given over to grazing by Moorschnucke sheep and extensively mowed. Flora and fauna View towards the moor In 1984 part of the region - an area of - was placed under conservation. It is one of the largest nature reserves in Lower Saxony. An area of has been designated for the protection of the white-faced darter as a special area of conservation; a further was designated as a Special Protection Area for birds. By stopping the artificial drainage a refuge for plants and animals that thrive in wet areas is being created. In addition the regeneration of raised bog is being encouraged. This has produced areas of moor grass, cross-leaved heath and cottongrass. In the Gro√ües Moor there was once the great population of black grouse in Germany. In 1963 there were still 850 black grouse, in 1982 only 20 were left and since then they have become extinct in the area. In the Gro√ües Moor there used to be around 150 animal species and 40 types of vascular plant, that are endangered in Lower Saxony of which eleven are threatened with extinction. These include the adder, crane, nightjar, woodlark, snipe, shrike and stonechat.NABU about conservation measures Nature trails Two nature trails start in Westerbeck, a village within the municipality of Sassenburg. These run outside the nature reserve in the southern part of the Gro√ües Moor. One is a 12 km long cycle path and the other a 5 km long walking trail. The region can also be visited using the Moor Railway.Maps of the nature trails 1975 forest fire catastrophe On 8 August 1975 stubble burning near the village of St√ºde got out of control. The fire spread very quickly and jumped over the Elbe Lateral Canal, thus setting the Gro√ües Moor on fire. On the first day of the fire a fire engine was overwhelmed by a rolling barrage near Neudorf-Platendorf. Two firefighters suffered serious burns. At the same time other fires broke out on the L√ºneburg Heath, which led to a fire disaster and became known in the national news as the \\"fire on the L√ºneburg Heath\\". Not until 9 days later, on 17 August 1975, was the fire in the forests finally extinguished. The peat fire on the Gro√ües Moor continued to smoulder underground for weeks afterwards.

It occupies land immediately to the north of the A9 road and General Wade's Military Road. Recent research has suggested Dunachton as a potential location for the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 in which the Picts permanently secured independence from the Northumbrians. History The Dunachton Stone. Class I Pictish stone St Drosten's Chapel, Dunachton The area around Dunachton shows evidence of human occupation in prehistory, with flintwork and whetstones being found in the vicinity.Wordsworth and Harden The name Dunachton derives from Dun Neachdain the fort of Nechtan. Nechtan's identity is unknown, but it is likely he was one of several of the early Pictish Kings that went by that name.Seton p200 Dunachton had some importance in the Early Medieval period. It is the site of an early class I Pictish stone which was discovered in 1870, having been recycled as a lintel stone in a farmstead building. Dunachton is first documented as 'Dwnachtan' in 1381,Registrum episcopatus Moraviensis p93; p188 in reference to the 'capelle de Nachtan', the Chapel of Nechtan,Registrum episcopatus Moraviensis p93; p184 which was dedicated to St Drostan. Recent research has pointed to the possibility that Dunachton may have been the correct site of the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685, when Bridei mac Bille, king of the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu defeated Ecgfrith of Northumbria, securing Pictish independence from Northumbria. The battle site was previously thought to be somewhere in the vicinity of Dunnichen in Angus, but reappraisal of the scant documentary evidence along with the reappraisal of Fortriu as being north of the Grampian Mountains has led to the suggestion that Dunachton is the true location.Woolf Dunachton Lodge was built on the remains of Dunachton Castle.Canmore Record: Dunachton Lodge The landowners were originally the MacNivens, who as a sept of the MacNaughtons, claim descent from Nechtan. The barony subsequently came into possession of the Clan Mackintosh in the early 16th century through the marriage of Isabel MacNiven, the heiress of the Barony of Dunachton to William Mackintosh, cousin of the chief of the clan Mackintosh, and later chief of Clan Mackintosh and the wider Chattan Confederation.Shaw p77; Seton p201; Adam and Innes p163 A centuries-old feud between the Mackintoshes and Clan MacDonald of Keppoch came to a head in 1688 at the Battle of Maol Ruadh. Dunachton Castle was destroyed the following year by Coll MacDonald under the auspices of the Jacobite cause, provoking a public rebuke from Dundee.Roberts p180 It was never rebuilt.Shaw p77 Dunachton was bought in the 1950s by Andrew Forbes-Leith, who later inherited the baronetcy of Fyvie.

Her version of hooponopono was influenced by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China, and Edgar Cayce. The combination of Hawaiian traditions, praying to the Divine Creator, and connecting problems with Reincarnation and Karma resulted in a unique new problem solving process, that was self-help rather than the traditional Hawaiian group process. She had no qualms about adapting traditional concepts to contemporary applications, though she was criticized by some Hawaiian purists. \\"Her system uses hooponopono techniques to create a working partnership among the three parts of the mind or self, which she calls by Hawaiian names, as well as by the terms subconscious, conscious, and superconscious.\\"Dye Bob, Pitzer Pat She presented trainings and lectures on hooponopono to the United Nations,Chai, Makana Risser, Na Moolelo Lomilomi: The Traditions of Hawaiian Massage & Healing, p. 47, Bishop Museum Press (2005) in nearly a dozen states in the U.S., and in more than 14 countries, among them Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Russia, and Japan.U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka, In Memory of Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona, Congressional Record, Proceedings and Debates of the 102d Congress, Second Session, Vol. 138, No. 43 (March 25, 1992) She presented to schools of higher learning, such as the University of Hawaii and Johns Hopkins University, to medical facilities, religious institutions and business organizations.

(Freedom of the Cosmos). In 1990, she started Pacifica Seminars in Germany. Simeona wrote three textbooks Self-Identity through Hooponopono, Basic 1 (128 pg), Basic 2 (to use after two years of practicing) and Basic 3 (to use after five years). The recommended waiting times for Basic 2 and 3 was for developing deep respect for the \\"Divine presence.\\" In 1990, the English original of Basic 1, 8th edition, was officially translated and printed in German and French.Simeona, Morrnah, Selbst-Identit√§t durch Hooponopono, 128 pg, Pacifica Seminars (1990)Simeona, Morrnah, L'Identit√© de Soi-M√™me par Hooponopono, 128 pg, Pacifica Seminars (1990) In late fall 1990, her last journey for lectures and seminars took her through Europe to Jerusalem.

She raised $25,000 to refurbish and restore it, and as a result it was moved and placed on display in the Russell Senate Office Building (now in the Capitol Visitor Center) where, Akaka said, it would serve as a remembrance of Simeona.

In Queen Mary's reign he obtained the benefice of Middle Chinnock, Somerset, the prebend of Comba Octava in the church of Wells, and the head-mastership of the grammar school at Wells. Soon after the accession of Elizabeth he left for Tournai, where in 1562 he was admitted into the Society of Jesus by Everard Mercurian. After he had passed his novitiate he was sent into Ireland with Richard Creagh as a missionary for several years and there taught at a Jesuit school at Limerick.McCoog, Thomas M., \\"The Society of Jesus in the Three Kingdoms\\", The Cambridge Companion to the Jesuits, (Thomas Worcester, ed.), Cambridge University Press, 2008, Then he went to Leuven, where he became acquainted with Robert Parsons, whom he persuaded to join the Jesuit order. In 1577 he was professed of the four vows at Rome. Subsequently he visited Sweden and Poland in company with Antonio Possevino in order to settle some affairs relating to the order. While living in Poland he was elected by the provincial meeting as procurator to the fourth general congregation, and took part in the election of Claudio Acquaviva as general of the Jesuits (1581). After the congregation was over he remained as confessor to the English College, Rome. Good died at Naples on 5 July (N. S.) 1586, and was buried in the college of the Jesuits in that city.

In 2009, McLellan Day published Playing With Fire, which followed the life of NHL superstar Theoren Fleury. The book broke the story of the sexual abuse Fleury survived at the hands of his junior hockey coach Graham James. Playing With Fire sold more than 80,000 copies within six weeks of its release and became a bestseller. The book led to a one-man play (written by McLellan Day) and an HBO documentary. McLellan Day profiled another troubled NHL superstar with her second hockey book Tough Guy. She partnered with NHL enforcer Bob Probert to recount his personal battles with alcohol and drug addiction. Probert died while collaborating on the book, but with the encouragement of his widow Dani, the book was completed and published on October 26, 2010. In 2012, partnered with long-time CBC Hockey host Ron MacLean on Cornered, which followed his broadcast career that led him to co-host Don Cherry's Coach‚Äôs Corner segment on Hockey Night In Canada. In 2015, McLellan Day reteamed with MacLean on Ron MacLean‚Äôs Hockey Towns. In 2016, she worked with Wayne Gretzky on 99: Stories of the Game ‚Äì in which Gretzky recounted memorable and noteworthy hockey stories. McLellan Day focused her next books on two of the most famous goalies in the NHL. Calling The Shots was the portrait of NHL All-Star-turned- broadcaster Kelly Hrudey. In addition to his accomplishments on the ice, Hrudey also detailed his personal battles with anxiety. A year later, Cujo: The Untold Story of My Life On and Off the Ice chronicled the life and career of Curtis Joseph. It debuted at #1 in October 2018.

The BCAM headquarters are in Alda. Mazarredo, 14 in Bilbao, the capital of the province of Biscay in the Basque Country of northern Spain. Background In January 2007, the Department of Education, Universities and Research of the Basque Government set up Ikerbasque, the Basque Foundation for Science, which was charged with three objectives: the attraction and recovery of front-rank, consolidated researchers; the creation of new research centers with standards of excellence, and social outreach for science. The creation and current activity of BCAM ‚Äì the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics - fall within the framework of the second of these objectives. In early 2008, Ikerbasque commissioned Enrique Zuazua to carry out a prospective study on the viability of setting up a center for mathematical research in the Basque Country. In March, 2008, the Ikerbasque Board of Trustees decided to go ahead with the creation of such a center as part of the BERC program (Basque Excellent Research Centres), later to become known as BCAM ‚Äì Basque Center for Applied Mathematics. At the same time, the first international call for submissions for posts of director, managers and scientists was made.Official call of BERC ProgramOfficial centers grantees list The center is located in the province of Biscay, given the extensive industrial fabric that the region has had traditionally as well as its current development of R+D+i activities. BCAM was officially created as a non-profit Association on September 1, 2008, and backed by the following three institutions: Ikerbasque, the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Innobasque, the Basque Foundation for Innovation and The Biscay Government.

The rapid rise of search media, particularly Google, is part of new media history and draws attention to issues of access and to relationships between commercial interests and media. History of term In 2003, John Battelle and Alex Salkever first introduced the term \\"googlization\\" to mean the dominance of Google over nearly all forms of informational commerce on the web. Initially specializing in text-based Internet searching, Google has expanded its services to include image searching, web-based email, online mapping, video sharing, news delivery, instant messaging, mobile phones, and services aimed at the academic community. Google has entered partnerships with established media interests such as Time Warner AOL, News Corporation, The New York Times, and various news agencies such as Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, and the UK Press Association. Google has therefore become a giant with complex entanglements with traditional and new media. Definition The term Googlization is not universally accepted as a definition for this phenomenon. According to Harro Haijboer, Googlization seems to be an undisputed term, most of the time the term is taken for fact without critically investigating it. ‚ÄúThe term may be valid in current development but, after a critical look at the history of search engines, may not be as correctly formulated as one might think. My main questions are if the term Googlization is correct in a historical perspective? If Microsoft search engines (MSN, Live Search and Bing) are Googlized? ‚Ä¶or if Google is \\"Microsoftized\\"? I suspected to find evidence that both search engines (Microsoft and Google) have had their influence onto each other. There is no way of saying if Googlization has fully taken place on Microsoft search or that there has been a form of \\"Microsoftization\\" on the part of Google. In this light the term Googlization seems to be inappropriate and should be rethought of.‚Äù. Many information professionals would define the term as ‚Äòdigitizing a library or making something into a Google product.‚Äô. However, the definition is constantly and rapidly changing. Googlization can also mean that ever \\"increasing amounts of accessible information [are] available on the Internet; Google makes it easy and convenient to find in one place\\", however, Google only makes information which already exists more accessible, rather than creating new information. Development Since 2000, media scholars have analyzed and are aware of the impact of Googlization to modern human society. Geert Lovink argues against the society's growing dependency on Google search retrieval. Richard A. Rogers points out that Googlization connotes media concentration‚Äîan important political economy style critique of Google's taking over of one service after another online; Liz Losh also claims that the Googlization of the BNF has brought considerable public attention in major magazine and newspapers in France. The Googlization of Everything, a book published in March 2011 by Siva Vaidhyanathan, provides a critical interpretation of how Google is disrupting culture, commerce, and community. In Vaidhyanathan's own words \\"the book will answer three key questions: What does the world look like through the lens of Google?; How is Google's ubiquity affecting the production and dissemination of knowledge?; and how has the corporation altered the rules and practices that govern other companies, institutions, and states?\\". Siva Vaidhyanathan defines Googlization as how \\"...since the search engine first appeared and spread through word of mouth for a dozen years, Google has permeated our culture...Google is used as a noun and a verb everywhere from adolescent conversations to scripts for Sex and the City\\". The author, Siva Vaidhyanathan, also has a blog where he documented the development of the book and any developments or news about Googlization and Google in general. His basic argument is that we may approve of Google today, but the company very easily could use our information against us in ways that are beneficial to its business, not society. Both the book and the blog are subtitled \\"How One Company is Disrupting Culture, Commerce, and Community‚Ä¶ and Why we Should Worry.\\" Criticisms of googlization The founders of Google have encountered hostility to their enterprise almost since its inception, both in the form of general press criticism and actual legal action. Various lawsuits have included infringement of copyright law; its dealings with advertising companies and in the volume of advertising that its users encounter. Google has been notorious for its use of PageRank, an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google: \\"PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.\\" The Googlization of Everything \\"Despite the pragmatic devotion to the technological virtues of speed, precision, comprehensiveness, and honesty in computer-generated results\\" Google has on occasion imposed human intervention and judgement, \\"from within the system, rather than rely on the slow-changing collective judgement of the users.\\" A prominent example of this occurred in April 2004, when the first search result, Wikipedia's entry for \\"Jew\\", was replaced with the homepage of an anti-semitic website called Jew Watch. Google also intervened with the PageRank algorithm when pages denying that the slaughter of 6million Jews occurred during World War II were high first-page results for the Google search \\"Holocaust\\" or \\"Jew\\". Another controversial event in Google's past occurred in early February 2010, when Google deleted years worth of archives from six popular music blogs due to receiving several DMCA notices from music copyright holders alleging that music was being shared illegally. Despite Google's general market dominance, some of its offshoots and additional projects have been less than successful. Nexus One (direct-to-customer sales) and Google Buzz (social networking site) all encountered problems when they were first established, problems which they are still struggling with. Defense of googlization Google's corporate mission is \\"to organize the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accessible and useful\\". Amongst ordinary internet users, Google is viewed fairly favorably as a search tool and as a company in general. About 82percent of Americans expressed a favorable opinion of Google overall, according to one national survey. In late March 2010, Google discontinued its local domain for China while continuing to offer their uncensored Hong Kong-based domain. Google had initially offered a censored version of their search engine in China. They reversed this decision when they decided that it was in conflict with their mission and their ideals. Speaking for Google, one of its founders, Sergey Brin, said \\"One of the reasons I am glad we are making this move in China is that the China situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls.\\" In another interview, Brin said \\"For us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet. We believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the Internet.\\" When Google went public in 2004, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin promised Google would commit to philanthropy by dedicating 1% of its profit, 1% of its equity, and its employees' time to charitable effort, including Google.org. Page wrote investors that Google's philanthropy could someday \\"eclipse Google itself in terms of overall world impact.\\" See also * Cocacolonization * Criticism of Google * Don't be evil * McDonaldization * New media * Surveillance capitalism * Uberisation References External links * The Googlization of Information: Google‚Äôs Influential Reach Over Information * De-Googlization: A Librarian‚Äôs Challenge with Information Monopoly Category:Google Category:Neologisms he:◊í◊ï◊í◊ú (◊ó◊ë◊®◊î)#◊í◊ï◊í◊ú◊ô◊ñ◊¶◊ô◊î ","title":"Googlization"},{"id":"24386469","text":"Grontmij was an engineering consultancy based in the Netherlands.

Services include oncology, orthopedics/sports medicine and physical therapy, obstetrics/gynecology, general surgery, imaging services/radiology, pulmonology, primary care, gastroenterology, urology, sleep therapy, dermatology, vein care and wound care. History Mon Health Medical Center's roots can be traced back to the early 1900s with the establishment of the privately owned City Hospital at the corner of Wiley and Prospect streets in Morgantown, WV. City Hospital was of wood-frame construction and considered to be vulnerable to fire. In 1937 Dr. E. Frank Heiskell, a surgeon at City Hospital and family doctor to thousands of coal miners in the north-central West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania areas, and being concerned with the safety of those patients while hospitalized at City Hospital, used his life savings to begin construction of a massive steel, limestone and marble fireproof hospital to replace the wooden structure. Dr. Heiskell named the new, state-of-the art facility \\"Heiskell Memorial Hospital\\" in honor of his mother, Winifred Heiskell, and opened its doors in 1939. Dr. Heiskell added a Nursing School to supply Heiskell Memorial with well-trained nurses, and he operated the facilities until the early 1950s, when the Pallotine Order of the Roman Catholic Church purchased the hospital and renamed it \\"St. Vincent Pallotti Hospital.\\"\\"Mon General has huge family,\\" Celebrating 50 Years of Caring, The Dominion Post, April 26, 1994, p. 4 Dr. Heiskell's son, Dr. Edgar F.

Andrew Heiskell, M.D., also a surgeon, would join the staff of Monongalia General Hospital in 1973 and continues his practice there as of 2017. The efforts to create Monongalia County Hospital, later to be named Mon General Hospital and eventually Mon Health Medical Center, to serve the medically indigent were spearheaded in the early 1920s by the volunteer Women's Hospital Association and officially sanctioned by the county government with the appointment of a voluntary board in 1923.Boyd, Lawrence. \\"Mon General 50 Years of Caring, 1943-1993,\\" p. 10 The county hospital was located in a portion of the County Poor House.

Gunnerside Gill (or Ghyll) is a small valley in the Yorkshire Dales which branches off Swaledale into moorland to the north of Gunnerside. The site of intensive lead mining in the 18th and 19th centuries, the valley still contains much evidence of its industrial past. Streams were dammed, and the water released as a torrent to scour soil off the surface and reveal lead ore (galena) seams. The resultant scars are known as hushes (perhaps an onomatopoeia of the sound that the water made). Bunton, Friarfold, and Gorton hushes are on the east side of the valley, with the North Hush being on the opposite side. Large areas of the upper valley are covered in spoil heaps from the mining activity, and a number of buildings remain. Many of the buildings and mine structures are scheduled ancient monuments. Waterfalls in Botcher Gill, a tributary of Gunnerside Beck, contain numerous fossils. The Sir Francis Mine in the lower reaches of the gill. The building to the right is the remains of the mine offices. The Sir Francis mine opened further down the valley in 1864 to exploit deeper seams, and was the first to use compressed air drills.

History  The name of the city was created by two different native languages of Ecuador: Spanish and Quechua. The name of the cacique from the tribe of the anama√©s is Gonza and the name of the coveted territory, which means favorite to the god of the water, is Anama or Munam√°. Another meaning of the name is break of hills, because the city is located on the ‚ÄûAndes‚Äôs Mountains‚Äú. After the Spanish conquest came some Dominicans, who have founded \\"The doctrine of Santo Domingo de Gonzanam√°\\". This was formed from different big confederations: * Colambos *Colcas * Purunumas *Sacapalcas * Changaiminas * Lanzacas *Quilangas *Nambocolas *Anganumas * Luginumas * Chalangas During the colonization, the citizens of Gonzanam√° reacted. They did not want to be submitted by the Spanish people. This was when the town decided to write the Declaration of Independence on 17 February 1822. At the beginning Gonzanam√° was just a rural parish from the canton of Loja. On 27 September 1943 the Government of Dr. Carlos Arroyo del Rio created legislative Decree number 928 for it to become a big canton. This was officially published on the 30 September 1943.  Location  *Altitude: 1980 meters *Area of the town: 712 km2 *It is located in the middle of Loja Province. The borders are: * To the north: Catamayo * To the south: Quilanga * To the east: Catamayo and Loja * To the west: Paltas and Calvas Distance from Gonzanam√° to Loja (capital city of Loja Province):_ 81 km  Government  The first authority is a called mayor, who is selected every 5 years. It has a municipality. The current mayor is Ing. Norman Omar Espinoza. It is divided into: * One urban parish: Gonzanam√° * Four rural parishes: Nambacola, Purunuma, Salcapalca and Changaimina * Eighty neighborhoods *The basic services are: *Drinking water * Sewerage * Electricity * Telephony  Population  The population represent 3.7% from all the population of Loja and it grows every year about 1.3%. 89.7% of the population are residents of the rural area and it is characterized of young people, because 45.8% of them are under 20. The 14.987 inhabitants are divided as: *Urban area: 1.539 *Rural area: 13.448 Most of the people dedicated their lives to the agriculture of tomatoes, sugar cane and other products. Cattle raising is another way to survive for the inhabitants of Gonzanam√°, especially in the area of Colca. Timber production is very high and one of the most popular trees is the pine. Hand craftsmanship is also practiced. The native language is Spanish. Climate  Gonzanam√° has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cwb). The light showers and small storms are very common. Gonzanam√° was devastated by an earthquake on the last century, which also toppled the principal church of the town. Temperature:_ 18 ¬∞C (11 ¬∞C ‚Äì 22 ¬∞C)  Culture  Typical food * Pea soup and green bananas with coffee or colada * Beef stew with coffee or colada * Sponge cake with milk or coffee * Marzipan with milk or coffee There are also many parties, which are celebrated every year. Agricultural, livestock and craft show The date of the party will be planned every year. Special guests will be invited and parades-competitions of horses. At the party dimantina (a mix of fresh milk and alcohol) will be offered for all the people. The exhibition of beautiful crafts is also a part of this party. *11 September: The anniversary of Changaimina as a parish. *13 September: The anniversary of Purunuma as a parish. *24 June: The anniversary of Nambacola as a parish. * 8 December: The anniversary of Sacapalca as a parish. At many of these parties the Queen of the parish will be selected. Another tradition is choosing a symbol mother, who has for two years been Clemencia Simancas.  Education  The lessons started in the mountain range and the Amazon at the same time (1 September). The school year is divided into two parts, each lasting 5 months. The highest school score is 10/10 points. A list of school supplies is required for all students, it is composed by: *School supplies: notebooks, folders, pens and others. *Personal cleaning supplies: a small tower, soap, toilet paper and damp paper. There are four elementary schools, four high schools, one weekend school and also a few state universities.

He had a long and distinguished career, seeing action during the war with America at the Battle of the Saintes, and was commanding small ships during the interwar years and by the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France. He graduated to larger ships, despite the loss of a frigate under his command in 1794, and was commanding in British waters by 1798. His interception of a Swedish convoy in the English Channel further strained relations between Britain and Sweden, though Lawford was also to be involved in the breakup of the League of Armed Neutrality, when he formed part of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen. Another highlight was the capture of a Spanish frigate carrying an immensely valuable cargo of specie. Lawford commanded several ships of the French and Spanish coasts throughout the rest of the wars, until being promoted to flag rank in 1811. He received further promotions throughout his long life, and the award of the KCB for his actions at Copenhagen, the only captain who fought at the battle to receive any honours related to it. He died three years later at the age of 86, having by then spent 65 years serving the navy. Early career Lawford was baptised 3 July 1757 in Portsea, the eldest son of John Lawford of Gosport and Sarah Gover of Portsea. He entered the navy at an early age. He served during the war with America, and was first lieutenant aboard the 90-gun at the Battle of the Saintes. In October 1788 he commissioned the brig and commanded her for the next two years. Lawford then took command of the 16-gun sloop during the Spanish Armament and was stationed initially in the English Channel, before departing for Jamaica on 22 October 1790, where he spent the next two years. He was promoted to post-captain on the outbreak of war with France in 1793, and took command of the newly captured 36-gun . He sailed as an escort for a convoy to Britain on 5 February the following year, but his command was short-lived as Convert was wrecked three days later on a reef off the East End of Grand Cayman; the wreck later referred to as the Wreck of the Ten Sail. While court martialled as a result of the shipwreck, Lawford was acquitted and the event did not adversely affect his career. Lawford remained in service to the Royal Navy and in January 1798 took command of the 64-gun . His time aboard her was brief, and in March he handed her over to Captain John Bligh and took up command of Bligh's old ship, the 50-gun . Command Lawford and Romney became involved in an incident with a convoy of Swedish merchants sailing from the Mediterranean with cargoes of pitch, hemp, iron, deals and tar. Lawford intercepted the convoy in the English Channel on 30 June, suspecting that the supplies were bound for French forces. The convoy resisted, but Lawford brought them to after a short action and took them to a British port. There most of the ships were condemned, though some were allowed to sail to Portugal. The question of the right of belligerent powers to stop and search neutral merchants on the high seas was firmly upheld by Britain, though incidents such as this strained relations with the northern Kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and Russia, and was a contributing factor to the formation of the League of Armed Neutrality two years later. Lawford took Romney to join Vice-Admiral Andrew Mitchell's squadron in Den Helder in August 1799, and was present at the Vlieter Incident on 30 August. The Battle of Copenhagen, by Nicholas Pocock Lawford took command of the 64-gun in August 1800, and went out with the fleet sent out under Sir Hyde Parker to compel the Danes to abandon the League of Armed Neutrality. Polyphemus was part of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron sent in to attack the Danish fleet at anchor at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. Polyphemus was not part of Nelson's original plan, but he had to improvise when ran aground on shoals at the entrance to the harbour, and could not free herself. Polyphemus was signalled to take her place, and she anchored at the south of the line, opposite the Provestenen and engaged for the rest of the battle. She eventually sustained casualties of six killed and twenty-five wounded. Polyphemus returned to Britain and was paid off into ordinary in April 1802, and after being refitted at Chatham Dockyard between March and September 1804, was recommissioned under Lawford. Lawford served with the Channel Fleet and on 7 December 1804 engaged the Spanish 36-gun Santa Gertruyda off Cape St Mary. The Santa Gertruyda was captured, and found to be shipping 1,125,000 dollars of specie from Peru and Mexico to Spain. Lawford commissioned the 74-gun in June 1805, and moved from there to command the 74-gun HMS Impetueux in October 1806. He served initially in the English Channel, followed by service in the North Sea in 1809 and then off Portugal from March 1810. Lawford was superseded on 1 August 1811, when he was promoted to rear-admiral. Later life Lawford was advanced to vice- admiral in 1819, and a full admiral in 1832. In August 1838 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. His award of the KCB was the only honorary reward specifically for gallantry at Copenhagen 37 years previously, made to any of the captains who were present. Admiral Sir John Lawford died at his home at Grove Road, St John's Wood on 22 December 1842 at the age of 86. He had married in 1803, and on his death had served in the navy for 65 years.

Written by Robert Port and filmed around the Los Angeles Center Studios, the episode features a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent investigating the apparent suicide of a former girlfriend while beginning a new relationship. Port based his story on real-life instances. He also was inspired to include acoustic testing and genomic research in the script. Within the series, it launches a storyline that focused on FBI Special Agent Don Eppes's (Rob Morrow) personal life. Appearing once before, Michelle Nolden reprises her role of Assistant US Attorney Robin Brooks. Her role was expanded to explore Don's relationships. \\"Guns and Roses\\" first aired in the United States on April 21, 2006. Critics gave the episode a mixed reception. One critic disliked the episode's plot while another liked the subplot. Plot summary Assistant US Attorney Robin Brooks (Michelle Nolden) approaches FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) at a gun range and thanks him for his help during a previous case. Don receives a phone call to a crime scene while on a date with Robin. When he arrives, he learns that his former girlfriend from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Agent Nikki Davis (Sandra Lindquist), was found dead, supposedly from a suicide. Don, not believing the preliminary findings, asks Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), his brother and a FBI math consultant, to mathematically determine whether she was inclined to commit suicide. Early evidence reveals that she was to retire soon and that the last person she called was Don. The team learns that her husband ATF Agent Richard Davis (Matthew John Armstrong) was supposed to be in Texas but was instead in Mexico. Don goes back to Nikki Davis's house, where Richard Davis, who had just returned from Mexico, walks in on Don. Richard Davis tells Don that she had been diagnosed with cancer and was treating it with expensive experimental drugs from Mexico, hence Richard Davis' visits there. Charlie's use of a modified version of the Holmes-Rahe stress scale indicates that, due to her involvement in community activities and her excellent record with the ATF, Nikki Davis probably did not commit suicide. At the Davises' house, Charlie, his friend and colleague Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), and FBI Special Agent David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) then attempt to match the pattern caught by microphones found around the neighborhood with the sound from Nikki Davis' service revolver. Charlie, Larry, and David's test reveals that a second person was in the room the night she died. Coupled with evidence that Richard Davis was involved in weapons smuggling, Charlie's evidence confirms Don's suspicion that she was murdered. Meanwhile, the FBI team learns that someone tipped off the biker gang under ATF investigation for a series of bank robberies involving high-powered guns. Don goes to Robin to ask her for the ATF's file, but she is upset with him for leaving their date. Once Don tells her the truth about his phone call, she agrees to help him. Don, David, and FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) go to the informant's house and find both the informant and Richard Davis dead. They conclude that Richard Davis was at the house to find his wife's killer and that Nikki Davis's killer is eliminating witnesses and investigators. Upon a tip from the Los Angeles Police Department, the FBI team arrests the ringleader of the gang. Don considers holding him without evidence, but Robin tells him not to compromise the investigation. With Charlie's analysis of the DNA found in the Davises' bedroom, the team learns that one of her own teammates, ATF Agent Rho (Eric Steinberg), was behind Nikki Davis' death. While Agent Rho and the biker gang commit another heist, Don and his team arrive on the scene and after a tense gunfight, the bike gang along with Agent Rho are finally arrested. Afterward, Charlie expresses his concerns about Don's ability to handle the stresses of FBI work to their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and they conclude that Don should be able to handle the stresses of his work because of his family ties. Don, taking into consideration Alan's earlier suggestion about dating again, goes to Robin's house to see her. Production Writing Robert Port wrote \\"Guns and Roses\\", and he and Numb3rs technical consultant/writer Mark Llewellyn, a retired FBI agent, wrote the story. They based the episode on the common occurrence of law enforcement officers committing suicide. Port found the use of the Holmes-Rahe stress scale and incorporated it into the episode. They referenced a previous case to set up the situation where Charlie questions Don's belief that Davis could not have committed suicide. The tension between the FBI and the ATF and the ATF's practice session were based on real-life tension between the agencies and the real-life practice sessions. Port constantly included the word \\"Mexico\\" in the dialogue to connect the story's subplots. Inspired by an article about the group, Port and Andrew Black, one of the show's researchers, consulted with DNAPrint Genomics, a company which used DNA to identify suspects by their geographical origin. Black also contributed Larry's objection to the use of DNA profiling. Port also consulted with National Geographic geneticist Spencer Wells, who provided the equations for the episode. Show creator Nicolas Falacci's comment about the use of an acoustics test in the JFK assassination inspired Port to include one in the episode. Port consulted Paul Ginsberg, an acoustics engineer, for details about the test. Dr. Gary Lorden, one of the math consultants, provided the equations for the audience-vision comparing figure skating ratings to the case. Filming The crew filmed around the LA Center Studios, the studios where Numb3rs filmed. Originally, the crew wanted to shoot some scenes, such as the scene where Charlie and Amita discuss Don's social life, at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). They were unable to do so since they had used the 18 days that the university allotted them earlier in the season. They then decided to film those scenes at the studio. The shootout toward the end of the episode, also filmed at the LA Center Studios, took two days to film. The crew also filmed the first scene featuring Don and Robin at a local gun range. Casting notes After reading about FBI agents' lives, actor Rob Morrow asked the producers to explore the impact of FBI work on Don's personal and social life. Writers planned for Don to have a relationship with someone who was not a regular cast member. Michelle Nolden, who had previously worked with Morrow on Showtime's Street Time, was cast as AUSA Robin Brooks. The episode marked Nolden's second appearance, with the first being in \\"The O.G.\\" Also, Port and Llewellyn had written the scene where Charlie, Larry, David performed the acoustics test with Bill Nye in mind. Nye was unable to shoot the scene due to a speaking engagement, so the scene was written for Larry. Reception Over 12.09 million people in the United States watched \\"Guns and Roses\\". The episode received a mixed reception from critics. Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict called the episode a \\"dark story\\". David Hochman of TVGuide.com stated that the romantic aspect of the episode was \\"promising\\" and that it was Don's \\"biggest personal story line yet\\".

The terahertz frequency range used in materials research is usually defined as 0.1 to 10 THz.This corresponds to wavelengths below the millimeter range, specifically between 3 millimeters (EHF band) and .03 millimeters; the long-wavelength edge of far-infrared light. This bandwidth is also known as the terahertz gap because it is noticeably underutilized.The terahertz gap is the set of frequencies in the terahertz region (bandwidth) where unavailable materials have hindered construction of components and systems that might otherwise be universally available. This is because terahertz waves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies higher than microwaves but lower than infrared radiation and visible light. These characteristics mean that it is difficult to influence terahertz radiation with conventional electronic components and devices. Electronics technology controls the flow of electrons, and is well developed for microwaves and radio frequencies. Likewise, the terahertz gap also borders optical or photonic wavelengths; the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet ranges (or spectrums), where well developed lens technologies also exist. However, the terahertz wavelength, or frequency range, appears to be useful for security screening, medical imaging, wireless communications systems, non- destructive evaluation, and chemical identification, as well as submillimeter astronomy. Finally, as a non-ionizing radiation it does not have the risks inherent in X-ray screening. Also see index for Presented Projects for Applied Optics 2009}} and NEAR-Lab Thz measurement facility, Portland State University.What is Submillimeter Astronomy?. Arizona Radio Observatory. 2013 About metamaterials Terahertz waves lie at the far end of the infrared band, just before the start of the microwave band. Currently, a fundamental lack in naturally occurring materials that allow for the desired electromagnetic response has led to constructing new artificial composite materials, termed metamaterials. The metamaterials are based on a lattice structure which mimics crystal structures. However, the lattice structure of this new material consists of rudimentary elements much larger than atoms or single molecules, but is an artificial, rather than a naturally occurring structure. Yet, the interaction achieved is below the dimensions of the terahertz radiation wave. In addition, the desired results are based on the resonant frequency of fabricated fundamental elements. The appeal and usefulness is derived from a resonant response that can be tailored for specific applications, and can be controlled electrically or optically. Or the response can be as a passive material. The development of electromagnetic, artificial-lattice structured materials, termed metamaterials, has led to the realization of phenomena that cannot be obtained with natural materials. This is observed, for example, with a natural glass lens, which interacts with light (the electromagnetic wave) in a way that appears to be one-handed, while light is delivered in a two-handed manner. In other words, light consists of an electric field and magnetic field. The interaction of a conventional lens, or other natural materials, with light is heavily dominated by the interaction with the electric field (one-handed). The magnetic interaction in lens material is essentially nil. This results in common optical limitations such as a diffraction barrier. Moreover, there is a fundamental lack of natural materials that strongly interact with light's magnetic field. Metamaterials, a synthetic composite structure, overcomes this limitation. In addition, the choice of interactions can be invented and re-invented during fabrication, within the laws of physics. Hence, the capabilities of interaction with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is light, are broadened. Terahertz technology Terahertz frequencies, or submillimeter wavelengths, which exist between microwave frequencies and infrared wavelengths can be metaphorically termed \\"unclaimed territory\\" where almost no devices exist. Because there are limits to propagating the terahertz band through the atmosphere, the commercial sector has remained uninvolved with such technological development. However, terahertz devices have been useful in the remote sensing and spectroscopy areas. Moreover, a rich vein of knowledge has been amassed via submillimeter observation techniques. In particular, interdisciplinary researchers involved with astronomy, chemistry, earth science, planetary science, and space science, have studied thermal emission lines for a diverse and large assortment of gas molecules. The amount of information obtained is specifically amenable to this particular band of electromagnetic radiation. Indeed, the cosmos is suffused in terahertz energy, and meanwhile, almost all of it appears to be overlooked, disregarded, or simply unidentified. Terahertz metamaterial devices Development of metamaterials has traversed the electromagnetic spectrum up to terahertz and infrared frequencies, but does not yet include the visible light spectrum. This is because, for example, it is easier to build a structure with larger fundamental elements that can control microwaves. The fundamental elements for terahertz and infrared frequencies have been progressively scaled to smaller sizes. In the future, visible light will require elements to be scaled even smaller, for capable control by metamaterials. Along with the ability to now interact at terahertz frequencies is the desire to build, deploy, and integrate THz metamaterial applications universally into society. This is because, as explained above, components and systems with terahertz capabilities will fill a technologically relevant void. Because no known natural materials are available that can accomplish this, artificially constructed materials must now take their place. Research has begun with first, demonstrating the practical terahertz metamaterial. Moreover, since, many materials do not respond to THz radiation naturally, it is necessary then to build the electromagnetic devices which enable the construction of useful applied technologies operating within this range. These are devices such as directed light sources, lenses, switches,Switching: The controlling or routing of signals in circuits to execute logical or arithmetic operations or to transmit data between specific points in a network. Note: Switching may be performed by electronic, optical, or electromechanical devices. Source: from Federal Standard 1037C modulators and sensors. This void also includes phase-shifting and beam-steering devicesBeam steering: is changing the direction of the main lobe of a radiation pattern. Note: In radio systems, beam steering may be accomplished by switching antenna elements or by changing the relative phases of the radio frequency radiation driving the elements. In optical systems, beam steering may be accomplished by changing the refractive index of the medium through which the beam is transmitted or by the use of mirrors or lenses. Source: from Federal Standard 1037C Real world applications in the THz band are still in infancy Moderate progress has been achieved. Terahertz metamaterial devices have been demonstrated in the laboratory as tunable far-infrared filters, optical switching modulators, and metamaterial absorbers. The recent existence of a terahertz radiating source in general are THz quantum cascade lasers, optically pumped THz lasers, backward wave oscillators (BWO) and frequency multiplied sources. However, technologies to control and manipulate THz waves are lagging behind other frequency domains of the spectrum of light. Furthermore, research into technologies which utilize THz frequencies show the capabilities for advanced sensing techniques. In areas where other wavelengths are limited, THz frequencies appear to fill the near future gap for advancements in security, public health, biomedicine, defense, communication, and quality control in manufacturing. This terahertz band has the distinction of being non-invasive and will therefore not disrupt or perturb the structure of the object being radiated. At the same time this frequency band demonstrates capabilities such as passing through and imaging the contents of a plastic container, penetrating a few millimeters of human skin tissue without ill effects, passing through clothing to detect hidden objects on personnel, and the detection of chemical and biological agents as novel approaches for counter-terrorism. Terahertz metamaterials, because they interact at the appropriate THz frequencies, seem to be one answer in developing materials which use THz radiation. Researchers believe that artificial magnetic (paramagnetic) structures, or hybrid structures that combine natural and artificial magnetic materials, can play a key role in terahertz devices. Some THz metamaterial devices are compact cavities, adaptive optics and lenses, tunable mirrors, isolators, and converters. Challenges in this field Generating THz electromagnetic radiation Without available terahertz sources, other applications are held back. In contrast, semiconductor devices have become integrated into everyday living. This means that commercial and scientific applications for generating the appropriate frequency bands of light commensurate with the semiconductor application or device are in wide use. Visible and infrared lasers are at the core of information technology. Moreover, at the other end of the spectrum, microwave and radio-frequency emitters enable wireless communications. However, applications for the terahertz regime, previously defined as the terahertz gap of 0.1 to 10 THz, is an impoverished regime by comparison. Sources for generating the required THz frequencies (or wavelength) exist, but other challenges hinder their usefulness. Terahertz laser devices are not compact and therefore lack portability and are not easily integrated into systems. In addition, low-power-consumption, solid state terahertz sources are lacking. Furthermore, the current devices also have one or more shortcomings of low power output, poor tuning abilities, and may require cryogenic liquids for operation (liquid helium). Additionally, this lack of appropriate sources hinders opportunities in spectroscopy, remote sensing, free space communications, and medical imaging. Meanwhile, potential terahertz frequency applications are being researched globally. Two recently developed technologies, Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and quantum cascade lasers could possibly be part of a multitude of development platforms worldwide. However, the devices and components necessary to effectively manipulate terahertz radiation require much more development beyond what has been accomplished to date (2012). Magnetic field interaction As briefly mentioned above, naturally occurring materials such as conventional lenses and glass prisms are unable to significantly interact with the magnetic field of light. The significant interaction (permittivity) occurs with the electric field. In natural materials, any useful magnetic interaction will taper off in the gigahertz range of frequencies. Compared to interaction with the electric field, the magnetic component is imperceptible when in terahertz, infrared, and visible light. So, a notable step occurred with the invention of a practical metamaterial at microwave frequencies,It was essentially a proof of principle demonstration, which was later commonly applied to the higher- frequency domain of terahertz and infrared. See negative index metamaterials. because the rudimentary elements of metamaterials have demonstrated a coupling and inductive response to the magnetic component commensurate with the electric coupling and response. This demonstrated the occurrence of an artificial magnetism,See main article: Paramagnetism and was later applied to terahertz and infrared electromagnetic wave (or light). In the terahertz and infrared domain, it is a response that has not been discovered in nature. Moreover, because the metamaterial is artificially fabricated during each step and phase of construction, this gives ability to choose how light, or the terahertz electromagnetic wave, will travel through the material and be transmitted. This degree of choice is not possible with conventional materials. The control is also derived from electrical-magnetic coupling and response of rudimentary elements that are smaller than the length of the electromagnetic wave travelling through the assembled metamaterial. Electromagnetic radiation, which includes light, carries energy and momentum that may be imparted to matter with which it interacts. The radiation and matter have a symbiotic relationship. Radiation does not simply act on a material, nor is it simply acted on upon by a given material; radiation interacts with matter. The magnetic interaction, or induced coupling, of any material can be translated into permeability. The permeability of naturally occurring materials is a positive value. A unique ability of metamaterials is to achieve permeability values less than zero (or negative values), which are not accessible in nature. Negative permeability was first achieved at microwave frequencies with the first metamaterials. A few years later, negative permeability was demonstrated in the terahertz regime. Materials which can couple magnetically are particularly rare at terahertz or optical frequencies. Published research pertaining to some natural magnetic materials states that these materials do respond to frequencies above the microwave range, but the response is usually weak, and limited to a narrow band of frequencies. This reduces the possible useful terahertz devices. It was noted that the realization of magnetism at THz and higher frequencies will substantially affect terahertz optics and their applications. This has to do with magnetic coupling at the atomic level. This drawback can be overcome by using metamaterials that mirror atomic magnetic coupling, on a scale of magnitudes larger than the atom. The first THz metamaterials The first terahertz metamaterials able to achieve a desired magnetic response, which included negative values for permeability, were passive materials. Because of this, \\"tuning\\" was achieved by fabricating a new material, with slightly altered dimensions to create a new response. However, the notable advance, or practical achievement, is actually demonstrating the manipulation of terahertz radiation with metamaterials. For the first demonstration, more than one metamaterial structure was fabricated. However, the demonstration showed a range of 0.6 to 1.8 terahertz. The results were believed to also show that the effect can be tuned throughout the terahertz frequency regime by scaling the dimensions of the structure. This was followed by a demonstrations at 6 THz, and 100 THz. With the first demonstration, scaling of elements, and spacing, allowed for success with the terahertz range of frequencies. As with metamaterials in lower frequency ranges, these elements were non-magnetic materials, but were conducting elements. The design allows a resonance that occurs with the electric and magnetic components simultaneously. And notable is the strong magnetic response of these artificially constructed materials. For the elements to respond at resonance, at specified frequencies, this is arranged by specifically designing the element. The elements are then placed in a repeating pattern, as is common for metamaterials. In this case, the now combined and arrayed elements, along with attention to spacing, comprise a flat, rectangular, (planar) structured metamaterial. Since it was designed to operate at terahertz frequencies, photolithography is used to etch the elements onto a substrate. Magnetic responses and refractive index Schematic setup of an ellipsometry experiment. The split-ring resonator (SRR) is a common metamaterial in use for a variety of experiments. Magnetic responses (permeability) at terahertz frequencies can be achieved with a structure composed of non-magnetic elements, such as copper-wire SRR, which demonstrate different responses centered around a resonant frequency. Split ring resonators show a capability for tuning across the terahertz regime. Furthermore, the repeating structure made up the constituent materials follows the same strategy of averaging the electromagnetic field as it manipulates and transmits the terahertz radiation This averaging technique is called an effective medium response. Effective permeability ¬µ-eff is boosted from the inductance of the rings and the capacitance occurs at the gaps of the split rings. In this terahertz experiment ellipsometry is applied, rather than waveguides. In other words, a light source in free space, emits a polarized beam of radiation which is then reflected off the sample (see images to theright). The emitted polarization is intended, and angle of polarization is known. A polarization change is reflected (off the sample material) is then measured. Information on the phase difference (if any) and the reflected polarization is considered. The local magnetic field of the cell material can be understood as a magnetic response. Below resonance the local magnetic field increases This magnetic response stays in phase with the electric field. Because the SRR cell is actually a non-magnetic material, this local magnetic response is temporary and will retain magnetic characteristics only so long as there is an externally applied magnetic field. Thus the total magnetization will drop to zero when the applied field is removed. In addition, the local magnetic response is actually a fraction of the total magnetic field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. Likewise there is an aggregate linear response over the whole material. This tends to mimic alignments and spins at the atomic level. With increasing frequency that approaches resonance over time the induced currents in the looped wire can no longer keep up with the applied field and the local response begins to lag. Then as the frequency increases further the induced local field response lags further until it is completely out of phase with the excitation field. This results in a magnetic permeability that is falling below unity and includes values less than zero. The linear coupling between the induced local field and the fluctuating applied field is in contrast to the non-linear characteristics of ferromagnetism Later, a magnetic response in these materials were demonstrated at 100 terahertz, and in the infrared regime. Proving the magnetic response was an important step towards later controlling the refractive index. Finally, negative index of refraction was achieved for terahertz wavelengths at 200 terahertz using layer pairs metallic nanorods in parallel. This work is also complemented by surface plasmon studies in the terahertz regime. Work also continues with studies of applying external controls such as electronic switching and semiconductor structures to control transmission and reflection properties. Reconfigurable terahertz metamaterials Electromagnetic metamaterials show promise to fill the Terahertz gap (0.1 ‚Äì 10 THz). The terahertz gap is caused by two general shortfalls. First, almost no naturally occurring materials are available for applications which would utilize terahertz frequency sources. Second is the inability to translate the successes with EM metamaterials in the microwave and optical domain, to the terahertz domain. Moreover, the majority of research has focused on the passive properties of artificial periodic THz transmission, as determined by the patterning of the metamaterial elements e.g., the effects of the size and shape of inclusions, metal film thickness, hole geometry, periodicity, etc. It has been shown that the resonance can also be affected by depositing a dielectric layer on the metal hole arrays and by doping a semiconductor substrate, both of which result in significant shifting of the resonance frequency. However, little work has focused on the \\"active\\" manipulation of the extraordinary optical transmission though it is essential to realize many applications. Answering this need, there are proposals for \\"active metamaterials\\" which can proactively control the proportion of transmission and reflection components of the source (EM) radiation. Strategies include illuminating the structure with laser light, varying an external static magnetic field where the current does not vary, and by using an external bias voltage supply (semiconductor controlled). These methods lead to the possibilities of high-sensitive spectroscopy, higher power terahertz generation, short-range secure THz communication, an even more sensitive detection through terahertz capabilities. Furthermore, these include the development of techniques for, more sensitive terahertz detection, and more effective control and manipulation of terahertz waves. Employing MEM technology By combining metamaterial elements ‚Äì specifically, split ring resonators ‚Äì with Microelectromechanical systems technology ‚Äì has enabled the creation of non-planar flexible composites and micromechanically active structures where the orientation of the electromagnetically resonant elements can be precisely controlled with respect to the incident field. Dynamic electric and magnetic metamaterial response at THz frequencies The theory, simulation, and demonstration of a dynamic response of metamaterial parameters were shown for the first time with a planar array of split ring resonators (SRRs). Survey of terahertz metamaterial devices Terahertz metamaterials are making possible the study of novel devices. Alternate copy here. Novel amplifier designs Section of a terahertz, folded-waveguide traveling-wave tube circuit with hole arrays on walls. Image from NASA Glenn Research Center. Terahertz planar traveling-wave tube circuit with metamaterial embedded in substrate. Image from NASA Glenn Research Center In the terahertz compact moderate power amplifiers are not available. This results in a region that is underutilized, and the lack of novel amplifiers can be directly attributed as one of the causes. Research work has involved investigating, creating, and designing light-weight slow-wave vacuum electronics devices based on traveling wave tube amplifiers. These are designs that involve folded waveguide, slow- wave circuits, in which the terahertz wave meanders through a serpentine path while interacting with a linear electron beam. Designs of folded-waveguide traveling-wave tubes are at frequencies of 670, 850, and 1030 GHz. In order to ameliorate the power limitations due to small dimensions and high attenuation, novel planar circuit designs are also being investigated. In-house work at the NASA Glenn Research Center has investigated the use of metamaterials‚Äîengineered materials with unique electromagnetic properties to increase the power and efficiency of terahertz amplification in two types of vacuum electronics slow wave circuits. The first type of circuit has a folded waveguide geometry in which anisotropic dielectrics and holey metamaterials are which consist of arrays of subwavelength holes (see image to the right). The second type of circuit has a planar geometry with a meander transmission line to carry the electromagnetic wave and a metamaterial structure embedded in the substrate. Computational results are more promising with this circuit. Preliminary results suggest that the metamaterial structure is effective in decreasing the electric field magnitude in the substrate and increasing the magnitude in the region above the meander line, where it can interact with an electron sheet beam. In addition, the planar circuit is less difficult to fabricate and can enable a higher current. More work is needed to investigate other planar geometries, optimize the electric-field/electron-beam interaction, and design focusing magnet geometries for the sheet beam. This section uses public domain material from NASA Technical Reports service Novel terahertz sensors and phase modulators The possibility of controlling radiations in the terahertz regime is leading to analysis of designs for sensing devices, and phase modulators. Devices that can apply this radiation would be particularly useful. Various strategies are analyzed or tested for tuning metamaterials that may function as sensors. Likewise linear phase shift can be accomplished by using control devices.

The aviation museum in Maracay is one of the largest in Latin America, with over 40 aircraft on display. History The idea of an \\"Aeronautical Museum\\" dates from 1963 when a high-ranking officer of Aeronautics, Luis Hern√°n Paredes, suggested its organization after the Ministry of Defense decided to move its airforce base from downtown Maracay to the outskirts of Palo Negro. The initial proposal were welcomed and immediately approved assigning the already existing hangars as the location of the museum. The commanding General, Francisco Miliani Aranguren, designated a committee as well as technical advisors towards the end of October 1963. On 10 December 1963 Venezuelan President R√≥mulo Betancourt inaugurated the museum in a ceremony in situ. On 9 December 1976 a Hall of Fame was added where military memorabilia dating back to the country's independence were collected from around the country and stored in the museum. The museum was later named after Colonel Luis Hern√°n Paredes, who initiated the proposal.  Aircraft collection  ¬´La Vaca Sagrada¬ª or Holy Cow, the plane that Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez flew escaping Venezuela in 1958.

None of Angel's passengers, his second wife Marie Angel, Gustavo Heny and Miquel Angel Delgado, were injured during the landing. In 1970, the Flamingo monoplane was disassembled into parts and lifted down by Venezuelan military helicopters to the aviation museum in Maracay where it was part of an aviation fair. Re-assembly of the original aircraft was especially challenging, with several parts of the craft missing after thirty years standing on the mountaintop. The aircraft was later moved to the airport at Ciudad Bolivar where it remains displayed in front of the passenger terminal. The location and care of Angel's plane remains controversial, with sections of the Venezuelan military decidedly in favor of returning the airplane to the museum in Maracay, replacing it with a replica at Ciudad Bolivar airport.

In Search of Clematis lanuginosa, Clematis International, 2009, pp 41-51 Clematis lanuginosa is a twice-bearing clematis that blooms once in spring and again in summer. In the USA it grows best in American Horticultural Society zones 9 to 1, which covers much of the USA. It is best known as a parent species for many of the large-flowered varieties of Clematis. One example of these would be Jackman's Clematis C. jackmanii. The cultivar 'Candida' has 8-inch white blossoms. Clematis wilt Clematis lanuginosa is one of the species of Clematis that is susceptible to the fungal plant pathogen Phoma clematidina,Howells, J., Choosing your Clematis, Garden Art Press, 2003, p115 which produces the sometimes fatal disease known commonly as \\"clematis wilt\\". As C. lanuginosa and hybrids derived from it have been used extensively in the breeding of new large flowered Clematis cultivars, this susceptibility to the disease has been passed to many Clematis commonly grown in gardens.

Hardstone carving is a general term in art history and archaeology for the artistic carving of predominantly semi-precious stones (but also of gemstones), such as jade, rock crystal (clear quartz), agate, onyx, jasper, serpentinite, or carnelian, and for an object made in this way. Normally the objects are small, and the category overlaps with both jewellery and sculpture. Hardstone carving is sometimes referred to by the Italian term pietre dure;This catalogue provides a comprehensive history of pietre dure, a virtuoso form of hardstone carving that reached an artistic peak in Italy in the 16th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe. however, pietra dura (with an \\"a\\") is the common term used for stone inlay work, which causes some confusion.That confusion is a good reason for not using the term pietre dure. See pietra dura for more on the distinction. From the Neolithic period until about the 19th century such objects were among the most highly prized in a wide variety of cultures, often attributed special powers or religious significance, but today coverage in non-specialist art history tends to be relegated to a catch-all decorative arts or \\"minor arts\\" category. The types of objects carved have included those with ritual or religious purposes, engraved gems as signet rings and other kinds of seal, handles, belt hooks and similar items, vessels and purely decorative objects. Scope of the term serpentine with inlaid gold fish, 1st century BCE or CE, with 9th-century mounts Hardstone carving falls under the general category of glyptic art, which covers small carvings and sculpture in all categories of stone. The definition in this context of \\"hardstone\\" is unscientific and not very rigid, but excludes \\"soft\\" stones such as soapstone (steatite) and minerals such as alabaster, both widely used for carving, as well as typical stones for building and monumental sculpture, such as marble and other types of limestone, and sandstone. These are typically not capable of a fine finish in very small carvings, and would wear in prolonged use. In other contexts, such as architecture, \\"hard stone\\" and \\"soft stone\\" have different meanings, referring to actual measured hardness using the Mohs scale of mineral hardness and other measures. Some rocks used in architecture and monumental sculpture, such as granite, are at least as hard as the gemstones, and others such as malachite are relatively soft but counted as hardstones because of their rarity and fine colour. Essentially, any stone that is often used in jewellery is likely to count as a hardstone. Hard organic minerals such as amber and jet are included, as well as the mineraloid obsidian. Hardstones normally have to be drilled rather than worked with edged tools to achieve a fine finish. Geologically speaking, most of the gemstones traditionally carved in the West are varieties of quartz, including: chalcedony, agate, amethyst, sard, onyx, carnelian, heliotrope, jasper, and quartz in its uncoloured and transparent form, known as rock crystal. The various materials called jade have been dominant in East Asian and Mesoamerican carving. Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur. For example, in the Uruk period of Sumerian culture (4th millennium BCE) heavy vases, cups and ewers of sandstone and limestone have been found, but were not for common use, as the people of Uruk had well-developed pottery. History Han Dynasty jade bi Asia and the Islamic world The art is very ancient, going back to the Indus Valley Civilization and beyond, and major traditions include cylinder seals and other small carvings in the Ancient Near East, which were also made in softer stones. Inlays of semi- precious stones were often used for decoration or highlights in sculptures of other materials, for example statues often had eyes inlaid with white shell and blue lapis lazuli or another stone.Louvre, Sumerian example, c. 2400 BCE Chinese jade carving begins with the carving of ritual objects, including blades for ji and dagger-axes clearly never intended for use, and the \\"Six Ritual Jades\\" including the bi and cong, which according to much later literature represented heaven and earth respectively.Pope-Henessey, Chapter IV on the six ritual jades, Chapter V on blades These are found from the Neolithic Liangzhu culture (3400-2250 BCE) onwards, and blades from the 2nd millennium BCE Shang Dynasty on.Howard, 19-22 Traditional Chinese culture attaches strong powers to jade; the jade burial suits in which aristocrats of the Han Dynasty (206 BCE‚Äì220 CE) were buried were intended to preserve the body from decay.Pope-Henessey, Chapter II on The Significance of Jade Fatimid carved rock crystal ewer, c. 1000, with 11th-century Italian lid. The Chinese and other cultures often attributed specific properties for detecting and neutralizing poison to gemstones, a belief still alive in the European Renaissance, as shown by the works of Georgius Agricola, the \\"father of mineralogy\\".De Natura Fossilium, Book l. The English word \\"jade\\" derives (via the Spanish piedra de ijada) from the Aztec belief that the mineral cured ailments of the kidneys and sides.Clark, 33 The Han period also saw the beginning of the tradition of fine decorative jade carving which has lasted until modern times, though the fine carving of other hardstones did not develop until the 17th century, and then appears to have been produced in different workshops and styles from those for jade.Watson, 77, Google books In general whiteish nephrite jade was the most highly regarded in China until about 1800, when the deeper and brighter green of the best jadeite became more highly favoured. There are related Asian traditions of Korean jade carving, in Southeast Asia and, to a much lesser extent, Japan. Smallish Sassanian carvings are known, mostly for seals or jewellery; the central medallion of the \\"Cup of Chosroes\\" (gallery) is one of the largest. Egyptian carving of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040. In 1062 the Cairo palace of the Fatimid Caliphate was looted by his mercenaries, and the examples found in European treasuries, like the one illustrated, may have been acquired as the booty was dispersed. The rock crystal used in Egypt was apparently traded from East Africa.Jones & Mitchell, 120-121 Until recently it was thought that jade carving was introduced to the central Asian Islamic world in the Timurid period, but it is becoming clearer that archers' thumb rings, knife hilts, and various other objects had been carved for centuries, even millennia before, though in limited numbers.Keene, 193-99 Islamic jades and other carvings reached a particular peak in the Mughal Empire, where apart from portable carvings inlaid panels of carved stones were included in buildings such as the Taj Mahal.Markel The great wealth of the Mughal court allowed precious stones like rubies and emeralds to be inset freely in objects. The court workshops of the Ottoman Empire also produced lavish and elaborate objects, in similar styles but without reaching the artistic peaks of Mughal carving.There are several examples in: Rogers J.M. and Ward R.M.; S√ºleyman the Magnificent, 1988, 136-9, British Museum Publications File:Jade ornament.JPG|Chinese jade ornament, Western Han dynasty File:Jade ornament with grape design.jpg|Chinese jade hair ornament, 1115‚Äì1234 File:Coupe de Chosro√®s.JPG|\\"Cup of Chosroes\\", from Sassanian Persia.

From the early civilizations of the near East descended the carving of vessels and small statues in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and subsequent Western art, and also Sassanian Persia; however it is not very significant in the art of ancient Egypt, outside jewellery, as alabaster was a more common material. The jade signet ring of Tutankhamun has been called a \\"unique specimen\\" of Egyptian jade.If it is indeed jade, as seems to be the case. see Keene, 194-5 Hardstone carving more often refers to vessels and figures than smaller engraved gems for seal rings or made as obj√©ts d'art, which were the main artistic expression of hardstone carving in the Greek classical and Hellenistic periods, and are regarded separately. From the Hellenistic period elaborate vessels in semi-precious stone begin to appear, mostly carved, some in cameo. The Cup of the Ptolemies and Farnese Cup both appear to have been made in Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt, as does a simpler fluted sardonyx cup in Washington which, like the Cup of the Ptolemies, was adapted to be a Christian chalice, and given elaborate gold and jewelled mounts by Abbot Suger for his Abbey of St Denis about 1140.The mounts of the Cup of the Ptolemies were lost in the French Revolution; other hardstone treasures from St Denis are in the Louvre. For a full catalogue description of the Washington cup, see Luchs, 4-12 From the Late Antique plainer shapes for vessels appear, concentrating on showing the natural patterns of figured stones - survivals of these are hard to date, and mostly have survived in church treasuries with medieval mounts in goldsmith work. The best collection of Byzantine liturgical vessels is in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice, some of them booty from the Fourth Crusade.Angold, 252 & 254 Google books Byzantine artists maintained a tradition throughout the Middle Ages, often working in clear rock crystal. There are a few large pieces from Carolingian art, including the Lothair Crystal, and then a continuing tradition of rock crystal work, often used undecorated in reliquaries and other pieces in the same way as modern glass, for which they are often mistaken by modern viewers. By the end of the Middle Ages a wider variety of stones and objects are seen, used for both religious objects and secular ones. Detail of 19th-century pietra dura panel The Opificio delle pietre dure (\\"Hardstone workshop\\") founded by the Medici in Florence in 1588 soon became the leading workshop in Europe, and developed the pietra dura style of multi-coloured inlays, which use coloured marbles as well as gemstones. They also produced vessels and small sculptures from a single piece of stone, often mounted with gold, which was also a speciality of Milanese workshops.See external link to Metropolitan Museum of Artexhibition feature. Other rulers followed their example, including Peter the Great, whose Peterhof Lapidary Works, founded in 1721, began the passion among Russian royalty and aristocrats for hardstones. Engraved gem production had already revived, centred on Venice but with artists in many countries, and gems of very high quality continued to be produced until the mid-19th century. The Mannerist court taste of the 16th century delighted in extravagant vessels for serving fruit or sweetmeats, or display as table centrepieces or on sideboards, with hardstones augmented with mounts and bases in precious metal, enamel and jewels. One collection that has remained mostly together is the \\"Dauphin's Treasure\\" of Louis, Dauphin of France (1661‚Äì1711), which passed to his son Philip V of Spain; over 120 objects are now displayed together in the Museo del Prado, many of which were already over a century old in the Dauphin's lifetime.Prado The Dauphin‚Äôs Treasure In contrast to the vast malachite vases that rather typify Russian carving (picture below),See here for several more the last notable modern producer was Faberg√© in pre- Revolutionary Russia.

File:The Punishment of Tityus, a rock crystal intaglio by Giovanni Bernardi, the British Museum.jpg|The Punishment of Tityos, a rock crystal intaglio engraved gem by Giovanni Bernardi Pre-Columbian and other traditions Olmec face mask in jade Beyond the Old World, hardstone carving was important in various Pre-Columbian cultures, including jade in Mesoamerica and obsidian in Mesoamerica. Because its colour had associations with water and vegetation, jade was also a symbol of life to many cultures; the Maya placed jade beads in the mouths of the dead. Lacking iron, jade was the hardest material the Pre-Columbians were able to work with, apart from emery. A particular type of object running through the long history of Mesoamerican cultures from the Olmec to the Maya and Aztec is the face \\"mask\\" in semi-precious stone (they do not seem to have been for actually wearing), either carved from a single piece or of pieces inlaid on a backing of another material. Curators refer to \\"Olmec-style\\" face masks as despite being Olmec in style, to date no example has been recovered in a controlled archaeological Olmec context. However they have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), which would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the Aztecs buried it, suggesting these were valued and collected as Roman antiquities were in Europe.Artworld University of East Anglia collections, see also Lapidiary Journal article, & MMA The Aztecs' own masks are more typically of turquoise inlay, the Mayans' of jade inlay (see gallery). Another supposed type of Pre-Columbian hardstone carving is the rock crystal skull; however experts are now satisfied that all known large (life-size) examples are 19th-century forgeries, though some miniature ones may be genuinely Pre-Columbian. The MƒÅori people of New Zealand, developed the carving of pounamu (jade) for weapons, tools and ornaments to a high standard.\\"Pounamu ‚Äì jade or greenstone\\" in Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand Techniques Neoclassical vase in malachite in the Hermitage Palace, Saint Petersburg Most hardstones, including jade and quartz varieties, have a crystalline structure that does not allow detailed carving by edged tools without great wastage and a poor finish. Working them has always been very time-consuming, which together with the cost of rare materials often traded from very far away, has accounted for the great expense of these objects. After sawing and perhaps chiselling to reach the approximate shape, stones were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe, and by grinding- wheels. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity, and was known in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by cutters in antiquity. The Chinese sometimes tipped their straight drills with less-valued diamonds.Clark, 75 A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear how they learned this technique. Mughal carvers also used drills.Markell Inlay sections could be sawed by bow saws. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.Kornbluth, 8-16 quotes passages from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity - since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.Thoresen, \\"Gemstone enhancement\\" Imitations As a highly prestigious artform using expensive materials, many different techniques for imitating hardstone carvings have been developed, some of which have themselves created significant artistic traditions. Celadon ware, with a jade coloured glaze, was important in China and Korea, and in early periods used for shapes typical of jade objects. Roman cameo glass was invented to imitate cameo gems, with the advantage that consistent layers were possible even in objects in the round. The small group of 11th(?)-century Hedwig glasses are inspired by Fatimid rock-crystal vessels. In the Italian Renaissance agate glass was perfected to imitate agate vessels with multicoloured figuration.agate glass. An inventory of the treasures of John, Duke of Berry already records such a vase in 1416, but no example from this early seems to have survived. Ceramics have often been decorated to imitate gemstones, and wood, plaster and other materials painted to imitate stones. Scagliola developed in Italy to imitate pietra dura inlays on plaster; less elaborate forms are called marbleizing. Medieval illuminated manuscripts often imitated both inlaid stone and engraved gems, and after printing took over paper marbling continued as a manual craft for decorating end-papers and covers.

Applied at the kerbside, it combined environmental and consumer packaging surveys to provide customers with a measurement of the ease with which specific types of packaging could be locally recycled. The process was invented by Michael Butler of Dawlish in 2005, and operated for free. Top of PullApart‚Äôs Home Page. The waste hierarchy Methodology As PullApart was applied to existing local authority-installed recycling bin refuse collection systems, its scoring scheme was dependent on individual local authorities‚Äô own packaging disassembly practices. Sample packaging was disassembled, according to the Local Authority‚Äôs process, rearranged and its components graded for ease of recycling. The raw information from this exercise was also made available to the public. A final, consumer-oriented \\"PAC\\" (PullApart Code) score was achieved by measuring what proportion of a product's components was recyclable from the kerbside. The PAC score is represented by 13 stages of ‚Äòtraffic light‚Äô grading. Broader aims PullApart‚Äôs stated aims are to encourage, manufactures, retailers, food and agricultural producers to give greater weight to the ease of disposal and recycling in their packaging designs. Weighting the consumers point of view equally to that of packaging manufactures, retailers and recyclers, in the handling of domestic waste products for kerbside collections. To provide consumers with information enabling product choice (ethical consumerism), that's easy, local and totally kerbside recyclable. Furnishing an unambiguous tool, that measures the differences between those mentioned above, assisting in the optimisation of products for the goal of near Zero waste.

It is associated with spatial transpositions, usually symmetrical, of stimuli from one side of the body (or of the space) to the opposite one. Thus a touch to the left side of the body will be reported as a touch to the right side, which is also known as somatosensory allochiria. If the auditory or visual senses are affected, sounds (a person's voice for instance) will be reported as being heard on the opposite side to that on which they occur and objects presented visually will be reported as having been presented on the opposite side. Often patients may express allochiria in their drawing while copying an image. Allochiria often co-occurs with unilateral neglect and, like hemispatial neglect, the disorder arises commonly from damage to the right parietal lobe. Allochiria is often confused with alloesthesia, also known as false allochiria. True allochiria is a symptom of dyschiria and unilateral neglect. Dyschiria is a disorder in the localization of sensation due to various degrees of dissociation and cause impairment in one side causing the inability to tell which side of the body was touched. The term is from the Greek meaning \\"other hand\\". Definitional criteria Animation. Parietal lobe (red). Allochiria has been observed mainly in the context of neglect which is usually due to a lesion that affects the right parietal lobe. In patients with allochiria, their sensibility is retained completely but the patient is not clear as to which side of the body has been touched. Their power of localization is retained but error exists to the side touched and they often refer the irritation to the corresponding part of the limb. In the patients' mind there is doubt or error as to which side of the body is touched. There are multiple definitions of allochiria. According to Musser, allochiria is the reference of a sensory stimulus to the corresponding location on the opposite location on the opposite side of the body. Judson Bury says that a patient may refer to an impression on one side to a corresponding place on the opposite side of the body. Thus, if a patient is pricked on one limb, he may say that he feels it on the other. Overall, even though different author's definition differs on points such as the type of stimulus, and the symmetry between the site of the stimulus and the seat of its localization, they all agree that an essential feature of allochiria is the deflection of a sensation to the wrong side of the body, which is true allochiria. In none of these definitions is any stress laid on the state of the patient's knowledge of a right or left side and the symptoms are seen as an error in localization. Obsersteiner laid stress that there is in allochiria no defect in vertical localization but merely confusion in the patient's mind between the opposite sides of the body and come to look upon the symptom as simply any form of bad mistake in localization. There is in the patient's mind doubt or error as to the side touched while sensibility including the power of localization is otherwise retained. Allochiria has been described as occurring in nerve lesions, Hemiplegia, disseminated sclerosis Multiple sclerosis, tabes dorsalis, unilateral injury to the spinal cord, M√©ni√®re's disease, hysteria, symmetrical gangrene,http://medical.yourdictionary.com/symmetrical-gangrene and in connection with touch, pain, the \\"muscle sense,\\" the temperature sense, sight, smell, taste, hearing, and the electrical reactions. Allochiria can occur in relation to any or every segment of the body. In some cases allochiria may be bilateral, and in others it may be restricted to certain regions of the body, or even only to one part of the body. Allochiria is marked to have connections with a variety of senses and sometimes only certain kinds of stimuli can arouse the appropriate feeling of one sidedness. Types Electromotor allochiria This is seen when there is a cross of electrical reflexes as a muscle is stimulated. Electromotor allochiria has been observed in the face, lower limbs, and upper limbs. In these cases, a stimulus presented on the affected side caused contraction of the opposite facial muscles with a current so weak that the healthy facial did not react. Another example is that pressure on one forearm caused movement of the opposite forearm. The central fact is that an electrical stimulus may manifest its effect at a distant part of the nervous system. This distant part may be on the same side of the body or on the opposite side, naturally it is more often on the opposite side because the representation of corresponding contralateral limbs in the spinal cord are nearer to each other than homolateral limbs. This has nothing to do with the confusion of the two sides that occurs in the patients mind when allochiria is present. Motor allochiria If patient asked to carry out a movement on effect side he does so with the corresponding part of the opposite side fully under the impression that he has correctly performed the required movement. Reflex allochiria Patients with reflex allochiria respond to a stimulation of the sole of the foot or in the inner part of the thigh as being evoked as the corresponding reflex on the opposite side only. Auditory allochiria In cases of auditory allochiria, observations recorded that when a tuning fork was held constantly to one ear, the patient responded with a series of symptoms, including pain and deafness, in the opposite ear. Visual allochiria In visual allochiria, objects situated on one side of the visual field are perceived in the contralateral visual field. In one of the two cases ever recorded, the visual impression received by the right open eye was regularly referred to the left eye, and the patient maintained that she perceived the impression with the left eye that in fact was shut. In the other case, a colored object held in front of the left eye was recognized and the patient maintained that she saw the color with the right eye. Gustatory allochiria In a case of gustatory allochiria, a substance placed on one side of the tongue was said to have been tasted on the opposite side. Also, touches on that side of the tongue were also referred to the opposite side. In this type of allochiria, it is difficult to see how one can in this case dissociate the reference of taste from that of touch. Alloesthesia Alloesthesia (i.e., allesthesia) (Greek: allache = elsewhere + aistheesis = perception) is also known as \\"false allochiria\\" and many dictionaries list the same definition as allochiria and even give same Greek lexical roots. The term allesthesia was introduced by T. Grainger Stewart in an article published in the British Medical Journal in 1894. The cases that Stewart found were mainly related to sensation and he observed consistent horizontal movement. Alloesthesia is a case of mistaken or incomplete perception of a stimulus and maybe accompanied by other failures in perception such as defective localization. In a case-study, in which the condition was incorrectly described as allochiria, a stimulus applied to the inside of the cheek was referred to the outside. In another case, a touch to the index finger was referred to the thumb. False allochiria may occur in bilateral affections of nerves such as multiple neuritis, and although no such case has yet been recorded it is still clear that the condition above is not related to allochiria. Dyschiria In dyschiria the failure to determine the correct side is a specific failure and is quite independent of any other failure as regards to perception of stimulus. In other words, the patient may recognize every single feature concerning a single stimulus‚Äîits precise nature, position, etc.‚Äîexcept the one point of its side. Evidence goes to show that there is present a mental defect of the specific feeling. Dyschiria has many forms which include achiria, allochiria, and synchiria. Achiria Achiria is referred to as simple allochiria and is the term proposed to show the failure to regard feelings of sidedness or handedness. Achiria has sensory, motor, and introspective components. For the sensory achiria, a stimulus applied to the affected part arouses no feeling of sidedness. The stimulus is presented to the side of the body that the person with the disorder has no notion. For the motor component, if a patient is asked to carry out any movement with the limb in question he is unable to do so unless is indicated in some other way than by the use of the words right and left. Reason for this is that he has lost the knowledge of the meaning of these words either altogether or at all events when they are applied to limbs concerned. For the introspective component a patient loses memory for feeling of part of the body that the stimulus is presented and declares that though he knows he has a part he cannot feel it. Allochiria Allochiria is when a stimuli presented on one side is constantly referred to the corresponding point of the opposite side. Allochiria has sensory, motor, and introspective manifestations. In sensory cases, a point to which they are referred on the opposite side corresponds exactly with the symmetrical point touched at fact which in itself disposes of the view that allochiria is in any way merely a disturbance of localization. For cases of motor allochiria, if a patient is asked to carry out a movement on effect side, he does so with the corresponding part of the opposite side fully under the impression that he has correctly performed the required movement. For the introspective cases the patient can appreciate a given feeling of sidedness only when the opposite limb is moved or stimulated. Synchiria Synchiria is a form of dyschiria in which a stimulus applied to one side of the body is felt on both sides. Synchiria has sensory, motor, and introspective signs. The sensory component refers to a stimulus applied to the affected part evokes two simultaneous sensations which are referred to the corresponding points on both sides of the body. The motor symptom is when a patient is asked to carry out movement on affected side he does so on both sides though in doing so he gets only the feeling of sidedness of the affected part. The introspective component shows that a patient is unable to appreciate the affected feeling of sidedness alone apart from the simultaneously appreciated feeling of the corresponding opposite side though he can appreciate it when he moves both limbs together under the impression that he is moving only the affected one. Experiences Drawing of a clock by a subject with hemispatial neglect allochiria There are many cases that patients have shown symptoms of allochiria. Allochiria in constructional tasks is commonly seen when neglect patients transpose the elements on the left side to the right side but fail to see or fix their mistakes. Some cases in which patients have shown allochiria is in copying and drawing clocks from memory. A defect of mental representations may lead the patients to transpose all the elements to the ipsilesional side in drawing tasks. In these drawing and memory tasks, patients with allochiria have a tendency to place all of the hours to the right half of the clock. There are different kinds of spatial transpositions that exist in these drawing tasks in patients with allochiria. The figure shows an example of allochiria in the clock drawing of a patient with hemispatial neglect. The patient omitted the left side of objects when drawing a clock. Even though the patient could verbally express that the clock face has a left side, he or she would fail to notice that the drawing was incomplete. This implies that drawing tasks can play an important role in differentiating the specific impairment of the brain lesion, and not just saying that a patient has dementia. Here is a case study of a patient that is showing neglect symptoms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1RPkp7rdnw Diagnosis When diagnosing allochiria, it is important to consider the sensory and the motor aspects of the problem. In absence of knowledge there are a number of ways in which the various symptoms may be overlooked or misinterpreted and as the condition goes frequently unrecognized. One rare example in medicine that causes a wrong diagnosis of allochiria is due to the unawareness of a few simple facts than to any failure in judgment. It is evident that the details of the sensory symptoms get overlooked when testing a patient's localizing capacity. The observer neglects to inquire expressly as to the side to which the sensation is referred. This is evident when patients with allochiria show no fault in sensorial perception and localization. However, even if the patient mentions the wrong side, it is sometimes being just regarded as a slip of the tongue and matter may not be pursued any further. Looking at the motor aspect of allochiria, the symptoms again are described in a misleading way because the symptoms are less obvious. Unless motor manifestations are carefully analyzed, they may be interpreted as clumsiness or weakness. Moreover, when patients complained of weakness and awkwardness of right side‚Äîexaminations apparently confirmed that the truth of this statement and defect was marked as acts consciously performed and was present only in relation to such acts. If a patient says that he cannot tell on which side the certain stimulus is applied‚Äîexistence of allochiria is confirmed, provided that sensibility is intact. Diagnostic value Allochiria represents a psychical affection and the occurrence of any form of allochiria should be regarded as a positive indication of the presence of hysteria. Recognition of the allochiria may throw light upon a number of symptoms that would otherwise be misinterpreted as paresis, aboulia, and defective sensibility. This enables a correct analysis to be made of the precise defects present and serve as a guide toward the original focus of the whole affection and proving an important step in the exact psychological diagnosis that is an essential preliminary to the scientific treatment of hysteria. Theory There are multiple theories that explain the outcome of allochiria. The current and most widely accepted explanation of allochiria is Hammond's Theory. This theory assumes that there is an almost complete decussation of sensory fibers within the grey matter. He concludes that with a lesion on one posterior side, this would reach center in the corresponding hemisphere, and thus, the sensation is then referred by this hemisphere to the opposite side of the body. Hammond goes on to say that if another unilateral lesion supervened at a different level from the first, the sensation that was previously deflected to the wrong hemisphere was now redirected by meeting with another obstacle and so arrived at its proper hemisphere. Allochiria occurs equally with unilateral and bilateral lesions as long as they are asymmetrical. Another theory is Huber's theory which assumes that an appearance of a new lesion on the opposite side from that of the block redirecting the impulse towards its original destination. Disappearance of symptoms due to retrogression of the lesion and track are cleared.

The nightingale is one common English bird which is virtually absent from Cornwall. The tidal estuaries along the coasts contain large numbers of wading birds, while marshland bird species frequently settle in the bogs and mires inland. Bodmin Moor is a breeding ground for species such as lapwing, snipe and curlew. On and around the rivers, sand martins and kingfishers are often seen. The sea cliffs host many marine bird species with the Cornish chough recently returning to the county after a long absence. This rare bird holds the honour of appearing on the Cornish coat of arms and being the county animal of Cornwall. * Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, the nominate subspecies and smallest form, is endemic to the British Isles, but restricted to Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the far west of Wales and Scotland,Madge (1994) although it has recently recolonised Cornwall after an absence of many years. North Cornwall Cornish chough (P. p. pyrrhocorax) flying in west Cornwall A kestrel in flight near the cliffs at Tintagel The birds of the coast at Tintagel are well worth observing: in 1935 an anonymous writer mentions Willapark as the scene of spectacular flocks of seabirds (eight species); inland he describes the crows (including the Cornish chough and the raven) and falcons which frequent the district.Armstrong, W. J. C. (1935) A Rambler's Guide to Tintagel and Camelford, 2nd ed. [Boscastle: the Author]; pp. 89-95 (by the 1950s there were no longer choughs to be seen). This bird is emblematic of Cornwall and is also said to embody the spirit of King Arthur. B. H.

Camel Valley With the large areas of salt marsh on the estuary, the River Camel provides an excellent location for birds. Large flocks of waders can be seen in winter, preyed on by local peregrines, and a migrant osprey often pauses a few days to fish in spring and autumn.Bere, Rennie (1982) The Nature of Cornwall. Buckingham: Barracuda Books Mute swans nest at several locations, particularly near to the bridge in Wadebridge where there is often a nest on a small island a few yards downstream of the bridge. Ducks are also found on the river with shelduck, shoveller and mallard on the estuary and teal further upstream. The Camel estuary was one of the first places in England to be colonised by little egrets, the birds being particularly seen on mudflats at low tide. Other rarities include an American belted kingfisher seen in the 1980s for only the second time in England. Upstream on the River Camel, and on several of its tributaries, kingfishers can be seen, while the Cornwall Wildlife Trust reserve at Hawkes Wood is noted for nuthatches and tawney owls. There are two birdwatching hides on the River Camel. Tregunna Hide (Grid reference SW 969 738) is owned by Cornwall County Council and is located on the Camel Trail and is open to the public. Burniere Hide (Grid Reference SW 982 740) is owned by the Cornwall Birdwatching and Preservation Society (CBWPS) and is only open to members. In addition, the CBWPS own the Walmsley Sanctuary which covers over on the River Amble, a tributary of the River Camel, with a further 2 hides for use by its members. The sanctuary is nationally important for wintering waders and wildfowl. West Cornwall Gwennap Head is renowned for its relative abundance of passing marine bird species such as Manx and sooty shearwaters, skuas, petrels and whimbrels. In addition, a colony of breeding gannets are close by. Therefore, the headland is favoured by birdwatchers and many travel the length and breadth of Britain to track rare seabirds. Annually, the Seawatch SW survey aims to record the numbers of such species from a designated location close to the cliff edge on Gwennap Head. The district of west Penwith being almost isolated from the rest of Cornwall has fewer resident species than the latter and those resident are generally in smaller numbers. However the only colonies of kittiwakes in the county are to be found in west Penwith and the only breeding records of blue- headed and yellow wagtails are also from there.Ryves, B. H. (1948) Bird Life in Cornwall. London: Collins; pp. 20-21 Isles of Scilly Because of the Gulf Stream, Scilly has a particularly mild climate - residents can grow sub- tropical plants there. Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and Siberia. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many North American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago. Scilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American passerines. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island sees a significant increase in numbers of visiting birders. Ornithologists William Wagstaff, commonly known as Will Wagstaff, is a leading ornithologist and naturalist in the Isles of Scilly, and also an author. His popular guided wildlife walksRadio Scilly have made him both a well-known and popular figure in the islands.Sea Salt Cornwall Feature Guardian Article Originally from South Wales, Wagstaff has lived on the Isles of Scilly since 1981. he serves as Honorary President and Chairman of the Isles of Scilly Bird Group.

The film was written and directed by Ning Jingwu and stars Wang Jishuai in the titular role. Lala's Guns' international sales were picked up by the Taiwan-based 3 Dots Entertainment. The film's world showed at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival as part of its Generation 14plus program.  Plot  Lala's Gun is the story of a boy from the village of Biasha in Congjiang County, where resides a branch of Miao minority. As part of the village's tradition, every boy upon reaching the age of fifteen was to receive a gun from his father as a symbol of reaching manhood. Lala, however, was raised by his grandmother after being abandoned by his father followed by his mother's death. As his 15th birthday approached, Lala departed Biasha and started a journey of searching the father he hadn't seen for years.  Reception  The film's limited exposure to international markets has garnered it some above average reviews. Though many western critics have faulted the film for its simplistic story, even while praising the film's lush visuals and nuanced portrayal of the Miao people.

The report further found that over the previous 12 years there had been almost 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other UN personnel around the world. AP found the abuse to be much greater than originally thought. After the AP report, U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, urged all countries to hold UN peacekeepers accountable for any sexual abuse and exploitation. As early as 2004, Amnesty International reported that under-age girls were being kidnapped, tortured and forced into prostitution in Kosovo with UN and NATO personnel being the customers driving the demand for the sex slaves. The UN's department of peacekeeping in New York acknowledged at that time that \\"peacekeepers have come to be seen as part of the problem in trafficking rather than the solution\\". Rapid increase in prostitution Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in Cambodia, Mozambique, Bosnia, and Kosovo after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. Instances of abuse in Cambodia caused widespread outrage after many of the abused women and girls also ended up contracting HIV/AIDS and other diseases that were not prevalent among the local population. A Kosovo victims support group reported that of the local prostitutes, a third were under 14, and 80% were under 18. Amnesty said the victims were routinely raped \\"as a means of control and coercion\\" and kept in terrible conditions as slaves by their \\"owners\\"; sometimes kept in darkened rooms unable to go out. In Haiti, the Sri Lankan peacekeepers wanted girls and boys as young as 12 for sex. \\"I did not even have breasts,\\" said Victim No. 1, a girl. She reported to UN investigators that from ages 12 to 15 she had sex with over 40 peacekeepers, including someone called \\"Commandant\\" who paid her 75 cents. She stated that she slept in UN trucks on the UN base. In Haiti, 134 peacekeepers from Sri Lanka operated the child sex ring, luring children with candy and cash, according to the AP. After a U.N. report incriminated the peacekeepers, most were sent back to Sri Lanka, but none served any jail time. Canadian government analysis Internal Canadian government documents reports dated 2016 suggest that The United Nations has \\"glaring gaps\\" in its procedures for tracking and prosecuting peacekeepers accused of exploitation and sexual abuse, and that only a small fraction of cases may be reported. The Toronto Star obtained the memo which reads in part: \\"Events in (the Central African Republic) and the data coming out of the (Secretary General‚Äôs 2016) annual report point to a system that is lacking in efficiency, transparency and coherency.\\" The memo goes on to say: \\"Part of the answer to these deficiencies lies in establishing enduring, system-wide structures but the nature of UN governance makes this a challenging endeavor. In addition, as we continue to unpack how member states themselves can better approach this issue from pre- deployment training to punishing perpetrators to victims‚Äô assistance, there must also be a greater willingness by individual countries to examine and address internal shortfalls.\\" In 2016 a UN report named 21 countries that had 69 credible reports of incidents in 2015. It documented 69 allegations in 2015 alone. One briefing note obtained by the Star pointed to \\"unique, structural factors within the UN system\\" complicated goals of greater transparency and enforcement. \\"Although military personnel are covered by military codes of conduct and justice systems, UN police and civilian staff accused of SEA in the field may face only minor disciplinary measures, such as repatriation and being barred from future deployments,\\" the unclassified document reads. 1996 UN study In the 1996 UN study The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children, former first lady of Mozambique Gra√ßa Machel documented: \\"In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in child prostitution.\\" Eight years later, Gita Sahgal spoke out with regard to the fact that prostitution and sex abuse crops up wherever humanitarian intervention efforts are set up. She observed: \\"The issue with the UN is that peacekeeping operations unfortunately seem to be doing the same thing that other militaries do. Even the guardians have to be guarded.\\" (see \\"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\\") Involvement in brothels There was one highly publicised case where members of the UN peacekeeping force were accused of direct involvement in the procurement of sex slaves for a local brothel in Bosnia. The use of agents for procurement and management of brothels has allowed the military to believe itself shielded from the issue of sexual slavery and human trafficking. Some NATO troops and private contractors of the firm DynCorp have been linked to prostitution and forced prostitution in Bosnia and Kosovo, as have some UN employees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they were accused of the sexual abuse of girls. In 2010, a film, The Whistleblower, directed by Larysa Kondracki, aired on the affair, based on Nebraskan police officer Kathryn Bolkovac,http://www.bolkovac.com/ who served as a peacekeeper in post-war Bosnia and outed the U.N. for covering up the sex scandal. The film featured Rachel Weisz, Monica Bellucci, Vanessa Redgrave, and many others.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896872/ Actions of a few Proponents of peacekeeping argue that the actions of a few should not incriminate the many participants in the mission, yet NATO and the UN have come under criticism for not taking the issue of forced prostitution linked to peacekeeping missions seriously enough. Troops in Haiti, Sudan and Central African Republic Most recently, UN troops in Haiti and Sudan have been accused of sexual abuse of children. In 2015, a UN report interviewed over 200 Haitian women‚Äîa third of whom were minors‚Äîwho told they were forced to have sex with UN soldiers in exchange of material aid. In Central African Republic at least 98 girls said they had been sexually abused by international peacekeepers. UN identified 41 troops from Burundi and Gabon accused of sexual abuse and exploitation in Central African Republic in 2014 and 2015. The identified troops have now left the country.

It is quite similar to Don, shortened from Pedro Dom, the name applied to the Five of trumps from the game Pedro, but with the game score resembling the 9-card Don variation, played in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The object The aim of the game is to score points by winning tricks containing valuable cards which may give an immediate score to the team that wins the trick to which they have been played. Further points are pegged after the end of the play by the team that has collected more than half of the \\"muck\\" in their tricks. There are 88 points in each deal - 80 phat plus 8 for the muck. Rank of the cards Phat is played by four players sitting crosswise in two partnerships. The cards rank A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 in every suit. A standard 52-card pack is used and 13 cards are dealt to each of the player, one at a time. Points are recorded on a yard-long board pretty much resembling a Cribbage board. The game Each player cuts a card from the stock and whoever cuts the lowest card will pitch first. The dealer will be the player to the right of the pitcher and the turn to deal and play passes always to the left. The trump is determined by the first card led by the pitcher and subsequently players must follow suit if possible, but otherwise may play any card. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led, or by the highest trump if any are played, and the winner of each trick then leads to the next. Phat score During the play, the following cards won in tricks entitle the trick-winner to peg his side the corresponding points as follows: *9...................18 trump - 9 non-trump *5...................10 trump - 5 non-trump *Trump Ace.......4 *Trump King......3 *Trump Queen...2 *Trump Jack......1 Muck score Trick-play ended, each side counts the card-point value of all counting-cards it has won in tricks on the following basis: *Each Ace........4 *Each King.......3 *Each Queen....2 *Each Jack.......1 *Each 10.........10 The side having the greater aggregate value pegs eight holes on the Phat board and the game continues until one side wins by reaching or exceeding a score of 181 points. Variation Don A variant generally called Nine-card Don, also Big Don, Long Don, Welsh Don. Four players sitting crosswise in partnerships receive 9 cards each from a 52-card pack. The aim is to score cards in tricks. The game is 91 or 121 up and the scores are pegged on a Cribbage board. The cards rank are as follows: {border=\\"1\\" |align=\\"center\\" ----- |+ align=\\"center\\" Table of Point Value for Trumps and the Plain Suit |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" Nine |align=\\"left\\" the teams scores 9 points |align=\\"center\\" Ace |align=\\"left\\" the team counts 4 points toward the game score |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" Five |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 10 points |align=\\"center\\" King |align=\\"left\\" the team counts 3 points toward the game score |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" Ace |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 4 points |align=\\"center\\" Queen |align=\\"left\\" the team counts 2 points toward the game score |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" King |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 3 points |align=\\"center\\" Jack |align=\\"left\\" the team counts 1 point toward the game score |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" Queen |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 2 points |align=\\"center\\" 10 |align=\\"left\\" the team counts 10 points toward the game score |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" Jack |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 1 point |align=\\"center\\" 9, 8, 7, 6' |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 0 each |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" 10, 8, 7, 6 |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 0 each |align=\\"center\\" 5 |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 5 points |align=\\"center\\" ----- |align=\\"center\\" 4, 3, 2 |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 0 each |align=\\"center\\" 4, 3, 2 |align=\\"left\\" the team scores 0 each |align=\\"center\\" } One player from each team cuts a card from the pack and whoever cuts the highest card will pitch first. The dealer will be the player to the right of the pitcher and the turn to deal and play passes always to the left. The player to the dealer's left leads first and the suit he plays establishes trumps. Others must follow suit if possible, otherwise may play any card. The trick is taken by the highest card led or by the highest trump if any are played. Each trick-winner leads to the next. During play, each side pegs immediately the value of any trump counters and Fives taken in tricks. After play, each side counts all counting cards taken in tricks (Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, 10s - as shown in the table above) known as the game score. The side with the greater total pegs 8 extra. A slight variation is that a side will claim 6 points for the highest total plus one for the highest trump and another one for the jack of trumps (meaning that sometimes only 7 bonus points are scored). Another variation is to score 5 points for the highest total and one for high trump, one for low trump and one for jack of trumps (again meaning that sometimes only 7 bonus points are scored).

The relationship between alcohol and breast cancer is clear: drinking alcoholic beverages, including wine, beer, or liquor, is a risk factor for breast cancer, as well as some other forms of cancer. Drinking alcohol causes more than 100,000 cases of breast cancer worldwide every year. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has declared that there is sufficient scientific evidence to classify alcoholic beverages a Group 1 carcinogen that causes breast cancer in women.Alcohol consumption and ethyl carbamate International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (2007: Lyon, France) Group 1 carcinogens are the substances with the clearest scientific evidence that they cause cancer, such as smoking tobacco. A woman drinking an average of two units of alcohol per day has 8% higher risk of developing breast cancer than a woman who drinks an average of one unit of alcohol per day.Non-Technical Summary Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) Even light consumption of alcohol ‚Äì one to three drinks per week ‚Äì increases the risk of breast cancer. Heavy drinkers are also more likely to die from breast cancer than non-drinkers and light drinkers. Also, the more alcohol a woman consumes, the more likely she is to be diagnosed with a recurrence after initial treatment. Mechanism The mechanisms of increased breast cancer risk by alcohol are not clear, and may be: *Increased estrogen and androgen levels *Enhanced mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenics *Increased mammary DNA damage *Greater metastatic potential of breast cancer cells Their magnitude likely depends on the amount of alcohol consumed. Susceptibility to the breast cancer risk of alcohol may also be increased by other dietary factors, (e.g. folate deficiency), lifestyle habits (including use of hormone replacement therapy), or biological characteristics (e.g. as hormone receptor expression in tumor cells). In daughters of drinking mothers Studies suggest that drinking alcohol during pregnancy may affect the likelihood of breast cancer in daughters. \\"For women who are pregnant, ingestion of alcohol, even in moderation, may lead to elevated circulating oestradiol levels, either through a reduction of melatonin or some other mechanism. This may then affect the developing mammary tissue such that the lifetime risk of breast cancer is raised in their daughters.\\" Light and moderate drinking Light drinking is one to three alcoholic drinks per week, and moderate drinking is about one drink per day. Both light and moderate drinking is associated with a higher risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer. However, the increased risk caused by light drinking is small compared to heavy drinking.  Recurrence  Drinking or not drinking alcohol does not solely determine whether breast cancer will recur after treatment. However, the more a woman drinks, the more likely the cancer is to recur. In men In men, breast cancer is rare, with an incidence of fewer than one case per 100,000 men.Male Breast Cancer Population studies have returned mixed results about excessive consumption of alcohol as a risk factor. One study suggests that alcohol consumption may increase risk at a rate of 16% per 10g daily alcohol consumption. Others have shown no effect at all, though these studies had small populations of alcoholics.  Epidemiology  Worldwide, alcohol consumption causes approximately 144,000 women to be diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Approximately 38,000 women die from alcohol-induced breast cancer each year. About 80% of these women were heavy or moderate drinkers.

Notable investigations US raid on Yakla, Yemen On January 29, 2017, a United States-led Special Operations Forces operation was carried out in Yakla Village, Qifah District, in the Al Bayda province in central Yemen. It was the first raid authorized by President Donald Trump, The US military initially denied there were any civilian casualties, but later declared it was investigating if they occurred. An investigation by the Bureau on the ground found that 9 children under the age of 13, with the youngest victim a three- month-old baby were killed. Beside the nine children killed, one pregnant woman was also killed. The Bureau's story was picked up by the Guardian, Newsweek and many other media outlets. Bell Pottinger operations in Iraq The Bureau working with the Sunday Times revealed on October 2, 2016 that the Pentagon paid British PR firm Bell Pottinger $540 million to create fake terrorist videos, fake news articles for Arab news channels and propaganda videos. An investigation by Abigail Fielding Smith and Crofton Black revealed the details of the multimillion-pound operation. Bell Pottinger was paid by the US Department of Defence (DoD) for five contracts from May 2007 to December 2011, according to The Times and the Bureau. Lord Bell confirmed Bell Pottinger reported to the Pentagon, the CIA and the U.S. National Security Council on its work in Iraq. Deaths from antibiotic resistance The Bureau is running a continuing investigation into the threat posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria. In December 2016 Madlen Davies working with the Sunday Telegraph revealed that superbugs were killing at least twice as many people as the government estimated.

Conviction  As well as the prison sentence and fine, Du received a five-year ban from taking high-profile posts in any listed company or dealing in any further of the type of business which resulted in his conviction. He is also expected to pay $0.93 million costs incurred by the Securities and Futures Commission's investigation into his actions.  Reaction  Then-CEO of the SFC Martin Wheatley said that \\"This sentence sends the strongest possible message that insider dealing is not tolerated in Hong Kong and those found guilty can expect lengthy terms of imprisonment\\".

Jesse Sublett (born May 15, 1954)\\"Biographical Note\\" at Jesse Sublett Papers , Witliff Collections, Alkek Library, Texas State University‚ÄìSan Marcos (retrieved September 18, 2009). is a musician and writer from Austin, Texas. As a musician he is best known for his long-running rock trio, The Skunks. His essays and journalism have appeared in a wide range of publications, and he is also known for his mystery novels featuring a bass-playing sleuth named Martin Fender.Stayton Bonner, \\"A Statewide Investigation\\", Texas Observer, January 11, 2008. Early life Jesse Sublett was born in Johnson City, Texas, where he was valedictorian at Lyndon B. Johnson High School. He attended Southwest Texas State University for two years, then moved to Austin in 1974. Music career Sublett founded The Skunks in January 1978 with bandmates Bill Blackmon and Eddie Munoz. Soon thereafter, The Skunks and The Violators (a band that included Sublett on bass guitar along with Kathy Valentine (later of the Go-Go's), Carla Olson, and Marilyn Dean) made their Austin debut at a University of Texas area club called Raul's,Barry Shank, Dissonant Identities: The Rock'N'Roll Scene in Austin, Texas (Wesleyan University Press, 1994) (), p. 102-104 (excerpt available at Google Books).Margaret Moser, \\"Yesterday When I Was Younger Than Yesterday\\", Austin Chronicle, December 15, 2008. marking the beginning of the punk/new wave scene in Austin.Jan Reid, The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock (new ed., University of Texas Press, 2004), , pp.282-283 (excerpt available at Google Books). Sublett left The Violators after six months to concentrate on the Skunks, and the Violators disbanded thereafter, but the Skunks recorded numerous singles, EP's and LP's, and played across the US, including the punk meccas of New York City, CBGB's and Max's Kansas City. Sublett sang and played electric bass in the band. He also wrote most of the band's original material.See the Skunks compilation CD, \\"Earthquake Shake: Live,\\" 2000, or their other releases Munoz left the band at the end of 1978 to join the Plimsouls. With his replacement on guitar, Jon Dee Graham, the band saw some touring success as headliners and as opening act for The Clash, The Ramones, and John Cale.Andy Langer, \\"Out of the Shadows\\", Austin Chronicle, July 28, 1997. The band more or less disbanded in 1983 but more recently have performed annual reunion shows at their favorite Austin club, the Continental Club.Joe Gross, \\"The Skunks play Continental Club Dec. 26\\", Austin Music Source at Austin360.com, December 15, 2008. Sublett is also credited with naming the \\"New Sincerity\\" movement of alternative rock bands that arose in Austin from about 1985 to 1990, and who were perceived as reacting to the more ironic outlook of punk rock and New Wave bands. He used the phrase during a casual conversation with his friend, local music writer Margaret Moser. Moser began using the term in print, and it ended up becoming the catch phrase for these bands.Barry Shank, Dissonant Identities: The Rock'N'Roll Scene in Austin, Texas (Wesleyan University Press, 1994) (), p. 148‚Äì149 & p.271 n.84 (excerpt available at Google Books).\\"Jesse's Music Bio\\" at Jesse Sublett's Little Black Book (retrieved September 18, 2009).

History  Until the 1980s, Vardun had over 300 Bulgarian dwellings and several gypsies dwellings. It was separated from the village of Cherkovna. Later on urbanization processes incited movements toward the chief Bulgarian towns. Gradually, gypsies began to settle in Vardun. Nowadays, they form the majority of the population. Vardun survived as a Bulgarian settlement (without other nationalities) during the several waves of prosecutions against Bulgarians. After the disastrous Tarnovo rebellions (1593 and 1680), Turks converted many villages in the region to Mohammedanism. Many people from Vardun were killed or banished. Despite all these, Vardun survived. The Turkish Empire moved Muslim nomadic tribes from Asia to this region and tried change its Bulgarian race. Thanks to their statute of \\"Voynugans\\" (also known as –í–æ–π–Ω—É—Ü–∏), Vardunians had a privilege and advantage ‚Äì they could possess land. During the Turk yoke, the land belonging to Vardunians was more than the land of all its neighbour Muslim villages. Muslims there were working as farm- hands on the Varduns' land. In his History of Gabrovo as a settlement with a special martial statute, 12th to 19th centuries Boris Stanimirov pointed out how freedom-loving and confident Vardun Bulgarians were. Having such virtues, they managed to put fear on Deliorman and Gerlovo Turks, demonstrating superiority to them. In an Ottoman tax register from the 16th century, some men from Vardun were recorded with their titles. One of them was logotur (logotet) Bahno. With regard to this is the interpretation of Stefan Chureshki in his publication \\"The list of Bulgarian princes\\", where he talks about a tzar‚Äôs inscription from 1281 found near Vardun. Two bolyars were mentioned there ‚Äì Pagan (or Gagan after another reading) and Hinto - according to their rule over \\"the mountain\\" (it is supposed to be the near Preslavska mountain).  Geography  Vardun is in the north part of Gerlovo area, a valley enclosed by the Balkans from the south, and by the Preslavska mountain from the northeast. Westward is the hilly Tozluk area and the Lisa mountain. Gerlovo was one of the most guarded regions in the medieval Bulgaria. In the Preslavska mountain alone (about 20 km distance), there had been remains of more than 10 strongholds. Right next to Vardun, there were two strongholds: \\"Kaleto\\"Bulgarian Castles (1,5 km from Vardun) and \\"Erpeka\\" (about 2,5 km from Vardun) ‚Äì this was built on an upland and had at least two fortified belts. Between both strongholds is situated a place named Holuma which was settled and part of Vardun before the Turkish invasion. There were several other strongholds near to Vardun: the big stronghold \\"Gradishteto\\". It is within 5 km from Vardun before Prolaz. \\"Hisarlaka\\" was another stronghold near Paidushko village (within 7 km from Vardun). \\"Krumovo kale\\" stronghold (or \\"Misionis\\" as it is claimed after some recent investigations) ‚Äì this is the only excavated stronghold in the region because it is within 8 km from the chief town of Targovishte (as far as it is from Vardun). These three strongholds were keeping guard over the Boaza passage. Eastwards there were: the big stronghold \\"Tepeto\\" (within 4 km from Vardun) near Cherkovna, \\"Chanakkale\\" stronghold (within 9 km from Vardun) near Tarnovca and \\"Kaleto\\" stronghold (within 6 km from Vardun) near Koprec. Other strongholds (poorly examined as well) in the Preslavska mountain were \\"Beloto gradishte\\" in the Dervishki passage, the strongholds near villages Ovcharovo, Dolna Kabda and others inside the mountain. In Gerlov was so called Tsika (or Chika) (Œ§Œ∂ŒØŒ∫Œ±œÇ). A modern interpretation (based on unknown premises) claims that Tsika was the capital of the tribe of Severs. The chronicle of Theophanes Confessor from 9th century says that Tsika was the capital (if a settlement is meant) or the inner (metropolitan) region of the Bulgarian state where the palaces (Œ±œÖŒª·Ω¥ŒΩ) were. Honours Vardun Point on Graham Land, Antarctica is named after the village.

and a small graph (H), and produces a graph that approximately inherits the size of the large one but the degree of the small one. An important property of the zig-zag product is that if H is a good expander, then the expansion of the resulting graph is only slightly worse than the expansion of G. Roughly speaking, the zig-zag product G \\\\circ H replaces each vertex of G with a copy (cloud) of H, and connects the vertices by moving a small step (zig) inside a cloud, followed by a big step (zag) between two clouds, and finally performs another small step inside the destination cloud. The zigzag product was introduced by . When the zig-zag product was first introduced, it was used for the explicit construction of constant degree expanders and extractors. Later on the zig-zag product was used in computational complexity theory to prove that symmetric logspace and logspace are equal . Definition Let G be a D-regular graph on [N] with rotation map \\\\mathrm{Rot}_G and let H be a d-regular graph on [D] with rotation map \\\\mathrm{Rot}_H. The zig-zag product G \\\\circ H is defined to be the d^{2}-regular graph on [N] \\\\times [D] whose rotation map \\\\mathrm{Rot}_{G \\\\circ H} is as follows: \\\\mathrm{Rot}_{G \\\\circ H}((v,a),(i,j)): # Let (a',i') = \\\\mathrm{Rot}_{H} (a,i). # Let (w,b')=\\\\mathrm{Rot}_{G}(v,a'). # Let (b,j')=\\\\mathrm{Rot}_{H}(b',j). # Output ((w,b),(j',i')). Properties Reduction of the degree It is immediate from the definition of the zigzag product that it transforms a graph G to a new graph which is d^{2}-regular. Thus if G is a significantly larger than H, the zigzag product will reduce the degree of G. Roughly speaking, by amplifying each vertex of G into a cloud of the size of H the product in fact splits the edges of each original vertex between the vertices of the cloud that replace it. Spectral gap preservation The expansion of a graph can be measured by its spectral gap, with an important property of the zigzag product the preservation of the spectral gap. That is, if H is a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù expander (has a large spectral gap) then the expansion of the zigzag product is close to the original expansion of G. Formally: Define a (N,D,\\\\lambda)-graph as any D-regular graph on N vertices, whose second largest eigenvalue (of the associated random walk) has absolute value at most \\\\lambda. Let G_{1} be a (N_{1},D_{1},\\\\lambda_{1})-graph and G_{2} be a (D_{1},D_{2},\\\\lambda_{2})-graph, then G_{1} \\\\circ G_{2} is a (N_{1}\\\\cdot D_{1},D_{2}^{2},f(\\\\lambda_{1},\\\\lambda_{2}))-graph, where f(\\\\lambda_{1},\\\\lambda_{2})<\\\\lambda_{1}+\\\\lambda_{2}+\\\\lambda_{2}^{2}. Connectivity preservation The zigzag product G \\\\circ H operates separately on each connected component of G. Formally speaking, given two graphs: G, a D-regular graph on [N] and H, a d-regular graph on [D] \\\\- if S\\\\subseteq[N] is a connected component of G then G|_{S} \\\\circ H=G\\\\circ H|_{S\\\\times D}, where G|_{S} is the subgraph of G induced by S (i.e., the graph on S which contains all of the edges in G between vertices in S). Applications Construction of constant degree expanders In 2002 Omer Reingold, Salil Vadhan, and Avi Wigderson gave a simple, explicit combinatorial construction of constant-degree expander graphs. The construction is iterative, and needs as a basic building block a single, expander of constant size. In each iteration the zigzag product is used in order to generate another graph whose size is increased but its degree and expansion remains unchanged. This process continues, yielding arbitrarily large expanders. From the properties of the zigzag product mentioned above, we see that the product of a large graph with a small graph, inherits a size similar to the large graph, and degree similar to the small graph, while preserving its expansion properties from both, thus enabling to increase the size of the expander without deleterious effects. Solving the undirected s-t connectivity problem in logarithmic space In 2005 Omer Reingold introduced an algorithm that solves the undirected st-connectivity problem, the problem of testing whether there is a path between two given vertices in an undirected graph, using only logarithmic space. The algorithm relies heavily on the zigzag product. Roughly speaking, in order to solve the undirected s-t connectivity problem in logarithmic space, the input graph is transformed, using a combination of powering and the zigzag product, into a constant-degree regular graph with a logarithmic diameter. The power product increases the expansion (hence reduces the diameter) at the price of increasing the degree, and the zigzag product is used to reduce the degree while preserving the expansion.

Composites of two or more plastics can also be used to increase strength and UV stability of a fence. Synthetic fencing was first introduced to the agricultural industry in the 1980s as a low cost/durable solution for long lasting horse fencing. Now, synthetic fencing is used for agricultural fencing, horse race track running rail, and residential use. Synthetic fencing is generally available preformed, in a wide variety of styles. It tends to be easy to clean, resists weathering and has low maintenance requirements. However, it also can be more expensive than comparable materials, and cheaper products can be less sturdy than more traditional fence materials. Some types may become brittle, faded or degrade in quality after long exposure to extreme hot or cold conditions. Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and other UV stabilisers have proven to be a beneficial additives in the manufacturing process of vinyl. This has greatly improved the durability of vinyl by providing essential UV protection from the sun's harmful rays, preventing premature ageing and cracking of the product, making it more durable than other materials such as wood. Synthetic materials used for residential fences can be in a solid cast form, or a reinforced hollow rail design that resembles sawn timber, Most commonly extruded profiles. Higher quality vinyl fence components are ribbed or include reinforcements, often of aluminium, for added strength. For agricultural use, synthetic fencing can consist of a heavy synthetic strapping product inlaid with cable, synthetic-coated high-tensile wire, or a synthetic coating over a wood or metal rail or plank. Residential synthetic fencing products are usually hollow, and thus too fragile to contain livestock, but some designs may be suitable for containing dogs or other pets. Residential grade rails are also made of a thinner material. Synthetic fences are used as the side-rails along horse racecourses, because they make a good visual barrier for the horses, but are unlikely to cause injury if horses break through them. Synthetic fence profiles are made in a wide range of sizes and shapes. They come in many different colors which are integrated during the extrusion process, which means they do not require painting. Usually this ability to resist discoloration leads many manufacturers to offer very long warranties, from decades up to \\"lifetime\\" for some brands. Synthetic fence posts are placed into pre-dug holes, or sometimes the synthetic post is fitted over a pre-set post of wood, rebar, or pipe for additional sturdiness. Rails or pickets are inserted into specifically designed slots and grooves within the rails. Synthetic fence materials are often in the form of rigid rails or posts, but flexible forms are also used, including mesh for hazard fencing or deer fencing, or string, rope or tape of polypropylene interwoven with stainless steel wires for electric fences (\\"electric braid\\").

Kelley was a pro-slavery advocate during the Kansas-Missouri border war, a state senator in Kansas during the government formed under the Lecompton Constitution, and served as the fifth U.S. marshal of the Montana Territory.  Biography  Kelley was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, January 11, 1831. At the age of ten years he was sent to Newport, New Hampshire, to attend a preparatory school before entering Dartmouth College. Disliking the rigid discipline enforced at the preparatory school, he ran away. He had no money nor acquaintance in New Hampshire, but managed to reach Lowell, Massachusetts, where he went to work on the Advertiser. Knowing that if discovered by his parents he would be obliged to return to the preparatory school, he did not communicate with them for a period of five years, during which time he remained steadily at his post at the Advertiser, learning all the details of the printing business. When he learned that his family had moved to Missouri, he joined them there in 1848, and for four years was employed as salesman in a mercantile house. In 1852 Kelley started a Democratic newspaper at Liberty, Missouri, called the Democratic Platform, and continued its publication until the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, when he discontinued the Platform and established a pro-slavery paper in Atchison, Kansas, called the Squatter Sovereign. Dr. J. H. Stringfellow joined Kelley in this venture as partner and associate editor. This was in 1855, during the intense excitement attending the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska. The paper was the leading organ of the Democratic party in Kansas, and was strongly pro- Southern and pro-slavery. Concerning his experience at the time, Kelley said: \\"There was no such thing as concession at the time. We were all extremists, whether advocating or opposing slavery. During my editorial life I was in constant strife with political opponents.\\"  Confederate service  Kelley was elected a member of the State Senate under the Lecompton Constitution for the counties of Atchison and Doniphan. On the defeat of the Lecompton Constitution by Congress, Kelley sold out his interest in the Squatter Sovereign and moved to Doniphan County, Kansas, where he married Miss Mary L. Foreman, and where his first child (Mrs. Kate Napton) was born. He next engaged in merchandising in Kansas City, and was thus employed when the Civil War broke out. The first company of Union soldiers that entered the city took possession of his store and carried off all his goods. Soon after he joined the Missouri State Guards as a private, and served under General Sterling Price. After the Battle of Pea Ridge he was promoted to a captaincy. The colonel, lieutenant colonel, and major of the regiment were killed in battle, and by right of seniority he commanded the regiment for a long time. On returning from a campaign in Mississippi, the regiment was reorganized, and Kelley was assigned to the recruiting service, after which his connection with the Confederate army terminated.  U.S. marshal  During the war Kelley's property was confiscated by the government, and he never made any effort to recover it. After leaving the Confederate service he, with his family, emigrated to Montana and arrived in Alder Gulch in 1863.Guide to the Robert S. Kelly Papers at the University of Montana From Alder Gulch he went to Helena, and for some time mined in Grizzly Gulch. In 1866 he went to Bear Gulch, where he remained a short time, after which he moved to Deer Lodge, where he and his family finally settled. For several years after he moved to Deer Lodge he engaged in mercantile pursuits in partnership with Mr. J. S. Pemberton, in which business he continued for about five years. He then became engaged extensively in mining operations. He took on placer mining grounds at Pioneer City and in Squaw Gulch, about 1872, and was engaged in working these placers until the last few years of his life, when he was disposed of the principal part of his interests. He was one of the original incorporators of the Rock Creek Ditch Co., organized in an early day, and still at the time of his death had an interest in that company. He was at the time of his death largely interested in the Southern Cross and other mining claims in the neighborhood of Cable, Montana. In 1885 Kelley was appointed by President Grover Cleveland the 5th United States Marshal for Montana, and served in that office with official integrity until the day President Benjamin Harrison was inaugurated, when he resigned, believing that the party in power should have control of all the Federal patronage and be held responsible for it.  Children  When Robert Kelley died, he left his wife and seven children. Four of his children were married, Mrs. Kate Napton, wife of the District Court Clerk; Mrs. Nannie Joslyn, wife of Hon. C.D. Joslyn, manager of the E. L. Bonner store at Deer Lodge; Robert Lee Kelley and Mrs. Georgia Hoss, wife of Lon R. Hoss of Spokane Falls. The three other children were young - Florence, Howard and Lamar.  Death  Hon. Robert S. Kelley died in Deer Lodge, Montana on September 19, 1890 of heart disease.

Plot 2004 (flash-sideways timeline) In flash sideways, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) flees LAX in a taxicab she has hijacked, in which a pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is a passenger. The cab driver (David H. Lawrence XVII) bails and Kate lets Claire go, keeping all of Claire's possession in her haste. She drives to a chop shop, where a mechanic (Jeff Kober) frees her from handcuffs. While searching for a new outfit, Kate learns that Claire is pregnant.

The Others, led by Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his translator Lennon (John Hawkes), wish to speak with Sayid, privately. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), however, wishes to go with them and starts a fight. James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) seizes the opportunity to obtain a gun and announce his departure from the temple, explicitly telling Kate not to follow him. The Others send Kate, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and two of their own, including Aldo (Rob McElhenney), to bring Sawyer back. Meanwhile, Dogen brings Sayid to a room, where ash is blown on him, followed by being given an electric shock and then burned with a poker. Dogen later explains to Jack that he has diagnosed Sayid as being infected and gives Jack a pill for Sayid to take. Jack refuses and takes the pill himself, which Dogen hurriedly forces him to regurgitate, revealing that the pill is in fact poison. He explains that the infection, upon reaching Sayid's heart, will remove any trace of the person he once was, and adds that it has happened to Jack's half-sister, Claire. In the jungle, Kate, Jin and the Others come across a trap; Kate activates the trap and overcomes the Others. Jin and Kate split up; Kate follows Sawyer's trail, while Jin begins to search for his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim). Kate finds Sawyer at the Dharma Initiative's barracks, in the house where he and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) had previously lived for three years. He retrieves an engagement ring he had hidden and later talks with Kate at Dharma's dock. He explains that he planned to propose to Juliet and that he blames himself for her death, saying that he convinced her to stay on the island with him because he was lonely. Meanwhile, Jin is caught by the Others, who want to kill him instead of taking him back. Jin runs off but is caught in a beartrap.

Right to life Both at the United Nations and at the various international conferences, the Holy See has promoted the \\"Culture of life\\", opposing efforts to legalize or endorse abortion and euthanasia through internationally legally binding instruments or non-binding declarations, advocating for the abolition of death penalty at the global level, and seeking to ban research on human embryos. At the United Nations General Assembly, the Holy See stated that: Human cloning At the international level, the Holy See has underlined the ethical problems raised by some current forms of biomedical research.Benedict XVI, Address to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, 7 Jan 2008: The Holy See has been particularly active in the area of human cloning. In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes,Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations, the Views of the Holy See on Human Embryonic Cloning, 17 Jul 2003 para. 2 : which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one,Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Instruction Dignitas Personae on certain bioethical questions, 8 Sep 2008, para 30: and proposed banning all forms of human cloning.See generally UNGA Ad Hoc Committee on an international convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings The Holy See objected to the \\"production of millions of human embryos with the intention of destroying them as part of the process of using them for scientific research\\" and to the instrumentalization and victimization of women, specially of the poorest women, in the process of harvesting the necessary human eggs.Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations, the Views of the Holy See on Human Embryonic Cloning, 17 Jul 2003, para.5 . See also Statement of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See on Human Cloning, 30 Sep 2003 and Statement of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See on Human Cloning, 21 Oct 2004. These efforts lead to the successful adoption, in March 2005, of a United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning, which calls upon all member states of the UN \\"to prohibit all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life\\". Death penalty In 2007, the Holy See argued at the United Nations that the death penalty should be used exceptionally, only when its use is necessary to protect society against an aggressor, a situation which is \\"practically non-existent\\" today, since societies have other ways of protecting their citizens. In addition, it noted that capital punishment is frequently discriminatory, since it is imposed most often on the poorest and on members of religious, ethnic and racial minorities; and that it is irreversible, since it excludes all possibilities of recourse and restoration in the event of a miscarriage of justice.Statements of the Holy See on draft resolution A/C.3/62/L.29 ‚ÄúMoratorium on the use of the death penalty‚Äù, 62nd session of the UN General Assembly, 15 Nov 2007 Consequently, the Holy See worked for the adoption of a UN moratorium on the death penalty. At his Address to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See of 7 Jan 2008, Pope Benedict XVI said: Freedom of conscience and religion Following Vatican Council II,Vatican Council II, Declaration of Religious Freedom 'Dignitatis Humanae', 7 December 1965, para. 2: > This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious > freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on > the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such > wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own > beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with > others, within due limits. The council further declares that the right to > religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person > as this dignity is known through the revealed word of God and by reason > itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom is to be > recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it > is to become a civil right. the Holy See has uphold, at the international level, the centrality of the freedom of conscience and religion among all Human RightsBenedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 5: \\"It could be said that among the fundamental rights and freedoms rooted in the dignity of the person, religious freedom enjoys a special status. When religious freedom is acknowledged, the dignity of the human person is respected at its root, and the ethos and institutions of peoples are strengthened. On the other hand, whenever religious freedom is denied, and attempts are made to hinder people from professing their religion or faith and living accordingly, human dignity is offended, with a resulting threat to justice and peace, which are grounded in that right social order established in the light of Supreme Truth and Supreme Goodness.\\" since, in its view, those freedoms impinge on essence of the Human person.Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 2: > The right to religious freedom is rooted in the very dignity of the human > person, whose transcendent nature must not be ignored or overlooked. God > created man and woman in his own image and likeness (cf. Gen 1:27). For this > reason each person is endowed with the sacred right to a full life, also > from a spiritual standpoint. Without the acknowledgement of his spiritual > being, without openness to the transcendent, the human person withdraws > within himself, fails to find answers to the heart‚Äôs deepest questions about > life‚Äôs meaning, fails to appropriate lasting ethical values and principles, > and fails even to experience authentic freedom and to build a just society. Pope Benedict XVI noted that \\"religious freedom expresses what is unique about the human person, for it allows us to direct our personal and social life to God, in whose light the identity, meaning and purpose of the person are fully understood. To deny or arbitrarily restrict this freedom is to foster a reductive vision of the human person; to eclipse the public role of religion is to create a society which is unjust, inasmuch as it fails to take account of the true nature of the human person; it is to stifle the growth of the authentic and lasting peace of the whole human family.\\"Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 1. Thus, the respect for freedom of religion is at the basis of the respect for all other human rights.Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 3: > Religious freedom is at the origin of moral freedom. Openness to truth and > perfect goodness, openness to God, is rooted in human nature; it confers > full dignity on each individual and is the guarantee of full mutual respect > between persons. Religious freedom should be understood, then, not merely as > immunity from coercion, but even more fundamentally as an ability to order > one‚Äôs own choices in accordance with truth. Freedom and respect are > inseparable; indeed, ‚Äúin exercising their rights, individuals and social > groups are bound by the moral law to have regard for the rights of others, > their own duties to others and the common good of all‚Äù(Vatican Council II, > Declaration of Religious Freedom 'Dignitatis Humanae', 7 December 1965, > para. 7.). Consequently, the Holy See has called upon States to comply with their international commitments to respect those rights. It has stated: > Recognition of the dignity of each and every person, which the Human Rights > Council was formed to protect and promote, entails full respect for the > inner and transcendent dimension of the human person, which is an integral > part of what it means to be a human being. Through the free exercise of > conscience and moral decision making, human beings are able to transform > themselves into living members of social life whose good will, charity and > hope promote the dignity and wellbeing of every member of the human family. > Intrinsically linked to freedom of conscience is the freedom of religion by > which human beings are able to pursue the most important relationship of > their life, that is, their relationship with God. Freedom of religion > necessarily entails the freedom to ascribe to a set of beliefs, to adopt or > change one‚Äôs religion, to profess one‚Äôs faith and to practice fully that > faith openly and publicly. Governments have a solemn responsibility to > safeguard rather than ridicule this inalienable right. Since the State is > not the author of any fundamental human right, it must respect that intimate > and fundamental sanctuary of human freedom, the conscience, and to allow > each conscience its fullest and highest expression in the free exercise of > religious faith.Archbishop Francis Chullikatt, Permanent Observer of the > Holy See to the United Nations, 65th session of the United Nations General > Assembly, Statement on the Report of the Human Rights Council, New York, 3 > November 2010. In parallel, the Holy See condemns the violation to the freedom of religion, specially when suffered by Christians: > It is painful to think that in some areas of the world it is impossible to > profess one‚Äôs religion freely except at the risk of life and personal > liberty. In other areas we see more subtle and sophisticated forms of > prejudice and hostility towards believers and religious symbols. At present, > Christians are the religious group which suffers most from persecution on > account of its faith. Many Christians experience daily affronts and often > live in fear because of their pursuit of truth, their faith in Jesus Christ > and their heartfelt plea for respect for religious freedom. This situation > is unacceptable, since it represents an insult to God and to human dignity; > furthermore, it is a threat to security and peace, and an obstacle to the > achievement of authentic and integral human development.Benedict XVI, > Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, > the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 1. In this context, the Holy See has stressed the duty of both governments and private individuals \\"to promote tolerance, mutual understanding and respect among the followers of the various faith traditions.\\"Archbishop Francis Chullikatt, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations, 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Statement on the Report of the Human Rights Council, New York, 3 November 2010. At the same time, the Holy See has condemned religious fanaticism and violence as a prevention of the freedom of religion,Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 7: > The exploitation of religious freedom to disguise hidden interests, such as > the subversion of the established order, the hoarding of resources or the > grip on power of a single group, can cause enormous harm to societies. > Fanaticism, fundamentalism and practices contrary to human dignity can never > be justified, even less so in the name of religion. The profession of a > religion cannot be exploited or imposed by force. States and the various > human communities must never forget that religious freedom is the condition > for the pursuit of truth, and truth does not impose itself by violence but > ‚Äúby the force of its own truth‚Äù as well as \\"every form of hostility to religion that would restrict the public role of believers in civil and political life.\\"Benedict XVI, Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace: Religious Freedom, the Path to Peace, 1 Jan 2011, para. 7: > It should be clear that religious fundamentalism and secularism are alike in > that both represent extreme forms of a rejection of legitimate pluralism and > the principle of secularity. Both absolutize a reductive and partial vision > of the human person, favouring in the one case forms of religious > integralism and, in the other, of rationalism. A society that would > violently impose or, on the contrary, reject religion is not only unjust to > individuals and to God, but also to itself.

Society too, as an > expression of the person and of all his or her constitutive dimensions, must > live and organize itself in a way that favours openness to transcendence. > Precisely for this reason, the laws and institutions of a society cannot be > shaped in such a way as to ignore the religious dimension of its citizens or > to prescind completely from it.

Sexual and reproductive rights Faced with a coordinated effort to incorporate sexual and reproductive rights within the body of internationally recognized human rights,On the coordinated effort see: Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change, US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003): See also: Amnesty International, Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights ; International Women‚Äôs Health Coalition and the United Nations, Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights , Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory. (Sexual Rights and Reproductive Rights), Women's Health Collection, (2003) and Shanthi Dairiam, Applying the CEDAW Convention for the recognition of women's health rights, Arrows For Change, (2002). the Holy See has become the major advocate at the international level of traditional sexual mores and marriage. Traditional family At the various international conferences, the Holy See argued that the traditional family, based on a stable and loving relationship between a man and a woman, is necessary for the responsible transmission and nurturing of new life. Consequently, society must recognize the traditional family's contribution to society's own good through appropriate cultural, fiscal and social policy. At the 1994 Cairo Conference, the Holy See argued that global population policy should ultimately be guided by the Respect for life and for the dignity of the human person so as to ‚Äúfoster the family based on marriage and must sustain parents, fathers and mothers, in their mutual and responsible decisions with regard to the procreation and education of children.‚Äù Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994 Conversely, the Holy See has opposed ‚Äúany attempts to weaken the family or to propose a radical redefining of its structure, such as assigning the status of family to other life-style forms.‚ÄùHoly See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994 This position has been reiterated by Pope Benedict XVI, see, e.g. Benedict XVI, Address to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, 8 Jan 2007: Sexual orientation In particular, the Holy See has opposed the use of the terms ‚ÄúSexual orientation‚Äù and ‚ÄúGender identity‚Äù in international human rights instruments, since, due to the fact that there is no agreed definition of those terms in international law, their use could favor of a redefinition of the family.Declaration of the Holy See on the proposed United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, 18 Dec 2008 In its view, the term gender, whenever used, should be understood as male and female as grounded on the biological sexual identity. On these bases, in 2008, the Holy See opposed the adoption of a proposed declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity by the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, the Holy See has condemned all forms of violence against homosexual persons and has called for the elimination of criminal penalties against them.Declaration of the Holy See on the proposed United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, 18 Dec 2008 Responsible sexual behavior The Holy See condemned irresponsible sexual behavior, which, in its view, victimizes mostly women and children, and which is fostered by today's ‚Äúattitudes of sexual permissiveness, which focus above all on personal pleasure and gratification.‚Äù Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994 It has further argued that traditional sexual mores are the best way to prevent Sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS. As Archbishop Javier Lozano Barrag√°n, ‚Äúhealth minister‚Äú of the Holy See stated at a UN special session on AIDS: In the same vein, during his 2009 trip to Africa, Pope Benedict XVI argued that the spread of AIDS ‚Äúcannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.\\" Benedict XVI, Interview during his fight to Africa, 17 March 2009 Family planning The Holy See underlined that responsible parenthood entails responsibility and demands discipline and self-restrain, Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994 particularly in the area of sexual behavior. The Holy See opposed efforts to endorse Family planning methods which separate what, in its view, are the two essential dimensions of human sexuality: the transmission of life and the loving care of parents. At the Cairo Conference, the Holy See opposed the term family planning services which encompass sterilization, since it was often abused, especially when promoted among the poor or the illiterate.Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994 At the conclusion of the 1995 Beijing Conference on Women, the Holy See reiterated that use of the term widest range of family planning services should not be interpreted as endorsing family planning methods or services that it considers morally unacceptable, that do not respect the liberty of spouses, human dignity or the human rights of those concerned.In particular, it could not be understood as endorsing contraception or the use of Condoms, either as a family planning measure or in HIV/AIDS prevention. In addition, the Holy See argued the education of children and adolescents, including in the area of sexual behavior, is primordially the responsibility of their parents, and not of the State; and it urged the international community to guarantee the parents the full exercise of this rights and to assist them to carry out their responsibilities.Holy See opening statement at the Cairo Conference, 7 Set 1994 See also *Holy See and the United Nations *Foreign relations of the Holy See *Legal status of the Holy See *Catholic social teaching *Social teachings of the papacy References Category:Holy See Category:Foreign policy Category:Foreign relations of the Holy See + ","title":"Multilateral foreign policy of the Holy See"},{"id":"24387734","text":"Drohi () is a 1948 Telugu-language drama film directed by L.

He played college football at Rutgers University, and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. High school career Davis attended Piscataway Township High School in New Jersey, where he played for the Piscataway Chiefs high school football team. He was a three-year starter and recorded more than 70 pancake blocks for his career. In his sophomore season, Davis was a teammate to fellow NFL players Kyle Wilson, and Malcolm Jenkins and helped the team to an undefeated season, and its third consecutive state title. Davis played in the U.S. Army All- American Bowl and was earned First-team All-American honors by USA Today. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Davis was listed as the No. 1 offensive tackle prospect in the nation. He was also listed as the top prospect coming out of high school in the nation. He was also regarded as the top prospect from New Jersey and received over 50 scholarship offers, he chose Rutgers over Ohio State, becoming the first No. 1 prospect from New Jersey to sign with head coach Greg Schiano at Rutgers, and the highest rated since Nate Robinson in 2003. College career In his freshman year at Rutgers, Davis played in all 13 games on the year. He was named starting right guard for the sixth game of the season and started the final eight games of the 2007 season. He earned First-team Freshman All-American honors by the Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and Rivals.com, and Second-team All- American laurels from Scout.com. Davis was moved to left tackle before the 2008 season, and started 12 games at that position. He was named to the Second-team All-Big East by the league‚Äôs head coaches and a First-team All-Big East honoree by the media. In 2009, Davis was First-team All-Big East and Second-team All-America. Professional career After the 2009 St. Petersburg Bowl, Davis said on the field that he scheduled a news conference for December 22, to announce his NFL plans. At that news conference, he declared his intentions to enter the 2010 NFL Draft, and said he would hire an agent. Davis was drafted with the 11th overall pick by the San Francisco 49ers after the 49ers traded up from the 13th overall pick with the Denver Broncos in order to select Davis. On July 30, 2010, Davis signed a five-year contract worth $37.5 million, with $15.95 million guaranteed. At the end of the 2012 season, Davis and the 49ers appeared in Super Bowl XLVII.

On June 5, 2015, Davis announced he would not be playing during the 2015 season, stating he wanted time to \\"let his brain and body heal\\". He vowed a return after the break, however, claiming he wanted to return as the best right tackle in the league. On July 25, 2016, Davis filed reinstatement paperwork aiming to return to the team by the start of training camp. On July 30, Davis was officially reinstated by the league and re-joined the 49ers in time for their training camp. On September 26, 2016, Davis announced his decision to retire again from the league, and was subsequently placed on the reserve/left squad list.

Although it was Cushing's only book, it is of some literary value because it presents alternative historiographical perspectives on the late pontiff, who has been sharply criticized by other writers. It is an almost hagiographic biography, written shortly after the death of Pacelli. Pope of Peace Cushing depicted him as the \\"Pope of Peace\\", who, armed only with the spiritual weapons of his office triumphed over insidious attacks, that seemed about to destroy the center of Christendom. Nations, paid him respect and the faithful, throughout the world, were inspired to resist the disintegration forces, that were working for the collapse of worldly empires. As a person, Pius XII was a simple but true priest, a pastor, selflessly dedicated to the highest interests of the Church and the greater glory of God.Cushing, p. 49 Priest, warrior and diplomat * Armed only with the spiritual weapons of his office and fortified by the promise of Christ that the gates of hell would not prevail against the Church. He triumphed over insidious attacks of the secularists and coarser invectives of the atheists. His name became a rallying point for all men of good will who seek the blessings of peace with justice.Cushing, p. 11 * During five years of bloody warfare, that international diplomacy was unable to avert, the Pope of Peace, skillfully, patiently and prayerfully warded off the attacks that seemed about to destroy the center of Christendom. With unshakable courage, he remained within the narrow limits in which he possessed diplomatic immunity. From the contending nations, he commanded respect for the cause of Christ. Within the souls of the faithful, throughout the world, he inspired determination to resist the disintegration forces, that were working for the collapse of worldly empires.Cushing, pp. 44-45 * What was uppermost in my mind is that he was to the very end a true priest, He edified those who knew him most intimately by the austerity and fervor of his personal life. He was truly universal in his outlook ‚Ä¶ More than anything he was a pastor, a Good Shepard of souls, selflessly dedicated to the highest interests of the Church and the greater glory of God.Cushing, pp. 47, 49 Historical value of the book After this publication, Cushing abstained from publishing any further books. The book continues to have value, however, because it contains a large appendix with detailed explanations of all Vatican offices and Curia congregations, and legal entities of the Vatican, many of which do not exist anymore. Others have new names. Therefore, the Cushing book provides an encyclopedic introduction into the Vatican, as it existed before Vatican II. This is relevant, because many papal documents before 1958 refer to these entities and congregations.

She was married to Canadian singer Paul Anka. Anka is featured in the Swedish reality show ().  Career  Anka made a brief appearance in the American film Dumb and Dumber, credited as Anna √Öberg. She had two lines, both in Swedish: () and (). She has also played minor roles in the films The Specialist and Drop Zone. Anka has released a workout and training book called The 30-minute pregnancy workout book: The Complete Light Weight Program for Fitness.   In 2009, Anka became known to a wider public in the reality show where she was one of three Swedish women who lived in Hollywood. The program, which was shown on Swedish TV3, had the highest ratings ever and set a new viewer-record for a program made by TV3.  Newsmill article  On 16 September 2009, Anka was interviewed on Swedish news site, Newsmill, in an article called \\"\\" (\\"\\"). The article described Swedish fathers as \\"tragic with their diaper changes and their equality\\" and Swedish women in general as shabby, petty, unintelligent and having lost touch with their natural femininity. A resounding appeal was made for the choice of a housewife lifestyle like Anka's own, and she affirmed her wish to become the role model that Sweden needed. It was later revealed and acknowledged by the publishers that the piece had been ghost-written by site editors after a phone talk with Anka in order to increase attention. The article received more than 100,000 hits, a first for Newsmill, and several responses, including from Nalin Pekgul.  Personal life  Originally named Danuta Anna Ko≈Çodziejska, Anna Anka was born in what was then the Polish People's Republic. Her mother died during childbirth. At the age of three, Anka was adopted by a Swedish couple named √Öberg living in Bjuv, Sweden. She moved to the United States in 1994 to work as a model after placing eighth in the international Miss Hawaiian Tropic pageant. Her participation in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic pageant barred her from participating in the Miss Sweden pageant that year. Previous reports stated that Anka participated in Miss Sweden in 1994 but Veckorevyn‚Äîwhich was the owner and operator of the Miss Sweden beauty pageant at the time‚Äîfound no evidence of her participating in either the 1993 or 1994 pageants, though she did participate in Miss Scania's 1993 pageant. Six years later, in 1999, she was hired as the personal trainer of musician Paul Anka. They married in 2008, at which point she became a full- time housewife with her two children, a son she had with Paul Anka in 2005 and an older daughter from her first marriage with Louis Yeager. In December 2009, Paul Anka filed for divorce after Anna Anka called the police during an argument with him over her decision to fire one of their housekeepers. According to Anna, Paul had pointed a gun at her the day before and threatened her and her nanny; Paul denied the allegation and filed a defamation lawsuit in February 2010 against her in response, both for it and other allegations. Subsequent review of their mansion's surveillance footage provided no evidence of any such event. Regardless, Anna obtained a restraining order against him a day after he filed suit. Among other allegations, Paul also alleged in his suit that previously‚Äîduring an argument in November 2009‚Äîpolice arrested Anna for felony domestic battery after wounding him, but Paul insisted at the time that the charges be dropped. The suit was dismissed with prejudice five months later, in July 2010, thereby barring relitigation. Later that year, two years after marrying, Paul and Anna Anka divorced. By August 2014, Anna Anka said she was on good terms with Paul, though not with her first husband. In June 2017, Anka lost custody of her son after a ruling which assigned custody to Paul Anka without any mandate for guaranteed visitation or family therapy. In August 2017, Anna Anka appealed the decision, which Paul Anka criticized.

He was a university lecturer before joining the National Institute of Sports (NIS). He was appointed the Sole Administrator of the Nigeria Football Association in 1992. After success in this position, he was then posted to the Federal Ministry of Sports as Director of Sports Development. Adamu was involved in the administration and organization of the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria and the Nations Cup in 2000. In December 2000 Adamu was named President for the Organising Committee for the 8th All-Africa Games (COJA). The games were held in Abuja, October 2003, in the newly constructed Abuja Stadium. Adamu advised the government to sell this stadium immediately after the games in order to forestall the vandalisation typical of publicly owned buildings. Subsequently, there was controversy about the conduct of the games organizers. In 2005, Adamu was picked as a member of the organizing committee for the first ever World Cup Finals in Africa to be hosted in South Africa 2010. In 2006, Adamu led the transformation of the Sports Ministry to the National Sports Commission (NSC). Adamu became an Executive Committee member of FIFA and the Confederation of African Football.

Family and background  Born in Edinburgh on 27 May 1921 to Alexander and Charlotte Watson, Margaret Watson was the youngest of five children. She chose to join the army rather than stay at home as a 'land girl'. Though she gained several promotions, she frequently got into trouble and earned her several demotions. Based in Europe during World War II, she once missed her return flight from a weekend's leave. She was forced to return by a convoluted route, arriving back at base seven days late, by which time the plane she had originally been intended to take had been shot down, and she had been presumed dead by her comrades. She married George Henderson in St. Mary's Cathedral, Palmerston Place, Edinburgh on 9 August 1947, and shortly after they moved to London, living initially in Barnet. Henderson gave birth to two children, Robin (born 1950) and Pamela (born 1957). In due time she became a grandmother to Lorna (born 1974), Michael (born 1976), and Elizabeth (born 1981).  Scottish country dancing  Margaret excelled at Scottish country dancing, and invented many dances that subsequently won prizes. No-one she entered for a medal ever failed. She qualified as a dancing teacher in 1963, and by 1967 she was already attracting local attention, meriting a full page article as personality of the month in the Middlesex Chronicle under the headline of ‚ÄúShe keeps the Scots dancing‚Äù. Her influence on the style of Scottish country dancing was dramatic. She paid great attention to the basics such as correct footwork, timing, posture and the like. Prior to her involvement, competition dance sets had become rather narrow, squashed and cramped, based on the conditions in a crowded ceilidh. Henderson tried to make the best use of the space available for her sets and deliberately left a large space between the opposing lines, creating a square set with plenty of room to dance. This approach brought her success in local dance competitions and examinations. Her style caught on with other dance groups and became commonplace. Margaret wrote many dances but chose only to publish the better ones such as: The Changing of the Guard; Donald MacNeil; Doon the Watter; Kith and Kin; The Longhope Strathspey; River Orchey; Sandy Watson; Scotch on the Rocks; The Travelling Tinker; Welcome to Feltham;. In 1973 and 1979 she won the Jack McConachie Memorial Sword Competition, an annual competition for the composition of Scottish country dances, run by the ISTD (Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing). The winner in 1973 was The Brig O' Bogendreep and in 1979 was Crystal Jig.  Retirement  Margaret retired from paid employment as a dancing teacher at the age of 60, but continued teaching as a hobby, enjoying many happy years with The Feltham and District Scottish Association. She died on Tuesday 13 February 2007, a few days after suffering a huge stroke. Her funeral took place at Hanworth Crematorium two weeks later; her ashes were scattered in the grounds of Hanworth Crematorium at the same spot as those of her late husband, George.

He exhibited alongside some of the most famous artists of the day. At present his contributions to figurative abstract art are being recovered by scholars and critics. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Biography Born in New York City to a family of printmakers, Trunk spent much of his life in the family‚Äôs home at 135 Essex Street in Brooklyn. He became interested in art while a child at the Dominican Convent School, and as a young adult took night classes in art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Trunk joined the Army during World War I and served in Europe with the 176th Pursuit Squadron. Upon his return to the states, Trunk resumed his study of painting, working under John Sloan and Hayley Lever at the Art Students League in 1919. He studied with Henry Lee McFee at the League‚Äôs summer workshops in Woodstock, New York. According to Meredith Ward, Trunk learned about cubism as a form from McFee, and that with the encouragement of Lever (and critical notice from Forbes Watson in the mid-1920s), Trunk selected watercolor as his main medium.Ward, Meredith. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù Catalog, Herman Trunk: Paintings and Watercolors. Herschl & Adler Galleries, Inc. 4 March ‚Äì 15 April 1989. 5-9. In a 1935 interview in the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper, Trunk explained, ‚ÄúWith water color . . . you can get a thing done after you have figured out its content and form ‚Äì while you still feel it. But oils ‚Äì by the time you‚Äôre half through, most of the emotion may have died.‚ÄùSmith, Bertha. An Artist Who is Not a Bit Arty: Herman Trunk is a Regular Person Despite the Attention his Works are Getting in the Modern Field.‚Äù Brooklyn Eagle. 2 June 1935. Exhibits and Emphases In the 1920s Trunk‚Äôs work appeared in exhibitions by the Art Students League of New York, the Society of Independent Artists, the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Brooklyn Society of Independent Artists. In 1925, New York gallery owner F. Valentine Dudensing became interested in Trunk, and thereafter Trunk showed quite frequently with Dudensing. His first one-man show at Dudensing Galleries took place in November‚ÄìDecember 1928, and garnered many positive reviews: ‚ÄúHis is a picture offering beauty, in a deliberate arrangement to achieve that effect. The beauty though is alive, for it is veined with the blood of poetry and energy‚Äù.Strauss, Frances. Brooklyn Citizen. Nov. 25, 1928. His work was frequently compared to Charles Demuth, but once Trunk‚Äôs skill with color determination and line design emerged, he was recognized as having a ‚Äústyle extremely individual‚Äù.The Arts. Dec. 1928. Another critic explained that, ‚ÄúHe has a remarkable flair for reducing natural objects to their essential shapes and primary colors ‚Äì a process saved from any posterlike suggestion because of the sensitive treatment and appreciation for subtleties of color and design‚Äù.Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Nov. 25, 1928. In the 1930s and 1940s, Trunk‚Äôs work moved increasingly towards geometric and architectural experiments, as his fame grew within the art community in New York City. In 1931, Zoltan Hecht‚Äôs School for the New Age reproduced one of Trunk‚Äôs sailboat images as a hand-hooked rug,Art historian Cynthia Fowler is currently completing a book on this subject.

Letter to Herman Trunk. 10 Dec. 1931. 1 pg. ts. (Smithsonian Archives). Trunk joined many museum exhibitions, including the first and second biennial exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1932 and 1934. In 1933, his work appeared in the Venice Biennale as part of the Whitney Exhibit; he was the only artist from Brooklyn to be included. During the same period he participated in group exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum. The depression intervened, and Trunk Brothers printmakers collapsed, as did Dudensing‚Äôs gallery. The artist showed in 1938 with the Collectors of American Art in New York.Catalog, Collectors of American Art: Paintings and Watercolors, 6 April ‚Äì 6 May 1938 (Smithsonian Archives). Trunk worked with Marion Grant, of Grant Studios in Brooklyn, holding a one-man exhibition there in March 1939. The New York Sun said of the Grant exhibit, ‚ÄúHe will paint in the same composition the outside of a house and its interior as well, present within a single frame three seasons at once, and yet in either case contrive to weld the whole into a decorative entity. It is much like the fragmentary, unrelated, yet overlapping, glimpses that come in dreams, or the way logically disconnected, though vividly realized bits of experience, flash on the drowsing memory when it is not focused intently on any particular thing. With all it is vastly interesting and to be appreciated must be seen‚Äù.Catalog, Grant Studios: Herman Trunk Exhibit, 11‚Äì27 March 1939. (Smithsonian Archives.) After World War I, Trunk‚Äôs work included paintings which Meredith Ward describes as ‚Äústrikingly proto-Pop,‚ÄùWard, Meredith. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù p. 8. and marks Trunk as a forerunner of the 1960s Pop art genre. Resurgence of Interest in Trunk During the 1920s and 1930s, Trunk exhibited alongside some of the most prominent artists in American modernism, those that critics remember today, including Charles Demuth, John Marin, Stuart Davis, Joseph Stella, Joseph Pollet, Edward Hopper, Arthur Dove, and many more.Catalog, The Modern Americans: The New Dudensing Galleries. 1928. (Smithsonian Archives).Catalog, Whitney Museum of American Art Second Biennial Exhibition: Watercolors and Pastels. 18 February ‚Äì 18 March 1936. (Smithsonian Archives). His work was supported by Juliana Force, Frederick C. Bartlett, Chester Holmes Aldrich, H.C. Richardson, Nathaniel Pousette-Dart, Edward Root, Forbes Watson, and others. In a January 20, 1928 letter to Stella Bowen, Ford Madox Ford praised Trunk's work as \\"really remarkable.\\" The Correspondence of Ford Madox Ford and Stella Bowen, Eds. Sondra J. Stang and Karen Cochran, 1993. P. 378. Trunk‚Äôs recovery as a major American modernist painter began with the spring 1989 exhibition at Herschl & Adler Galleries. There are many reasons Trunk had been overlooked by art historians until the current moment: his background and commitments were traditional, as he was a devoted husband and father. He was nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Candlelight Painter‚Äù by the media in the 1920s since he maintained his job as a printmaker and painted at night.Ward, Meredith. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù p. 7. In addition, Trunk was a faithful Catholic during a period of virulent anti-Catholic sentiment. Reconsideration of Trunk‚Äôs commitment to his Catholic faith and its impact on his art is examined by art historian Cynthia Fowler in the 2009 exhibition Herman Trunk: Catholic Modernist and the accompanying exhibition catalogue.Cynthia Fowler, ed., \\"Herman Trunk: Catholic Modernist\\" (Boston: Emmanuel College, 2009). A discussion of Trunk's still-life paintings, the work for which he is best known, is also examined in this catalogue by art historian Dena Gilby. In addition, an October 2009 conference in honor of Trunk at Emmanuel College, ‚ÄúEarly American Modernism and Religion,‚Äù turned its attention towards the role of faith to the artistic movement. Most important to understanding Trunk‚Äôs lack of visibility today may very well be the fact that a World War I injury rendered Trunk nearly deaf, and as a result social networking at galleries and shows was difficult for him. At present, interest in Trunk is building. Two shows appeared in 2009. Emmanuel College in Boston held ‚ÄúHerman Trunk: Catholic Modernist‚Äù in September and October; and in October through December Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts hosted ‚ÄúHerman Trunk (1894-1963) and the Modernist Still Life.\\" His work as a Catholic artist also has drawn attention from the National Museum of Catholic Art and History. In December 2011, Cynthia Fowler published, \\"Herman Trunk's Cubist Crucifix: A Case Study,\\" in Religion and the Arts, a publication of Boston College.[Cynthia Fowler, \\"Herman Trunk's Cubist Crucifix: A Case Study.\\" Religion and the Arts 15.5 (December 2011): 628-647.] Trunk's Papers and Private Collections The Smithsonian Archives of American Art holds Trunk‚Äôs papers, which include the following: \\"Letters, writings, photographs, printed material, and a DVD videorecording relating to Trunk's career as a modernist painter.

It could trace its lineage back to 1803, when it was raised as the 2nd Battalion, 21st Bengal Native Infantry. The regiment was known by a number of different names: the 42nd Bengal Native Infantry 1824‚Äì1842, the 42nd Bengal Native (Light) Infantry 1842‚Äì1861, the 5th Bengal Native (Light) Infantry 1861‚Äì1885 and the 5th Bengal (Light) Infantry 1885‚Äì1903. Its final designation 5th Light Infantry was a result of the Kitchener Reforms of the Indian Army, when all the old presidency titles (Bengal) were removed. During World War I the regiment was stationed in Singapore and was notorious for its involvement in the 1915 Singapore Mutiny. The regiment was disbanded in 1922, after another set of reforms of the post World War I Indian Army. History up to 1914 First raised in 1803,R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 6 Singapore Mutiny the regiment was awarded the distinction of becoming light infantry in 1843.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 3 Singapore Mutiny As the 42nd Bengal Native (Light) Infantry the regiment carried as battle honours \\"Arakan, Afghanistan and Kandahar 1842\\", \\"Ghunze 1842\\", and \\"Kabul and Moodkee, Ferozeshah and Sobroan 1857\\". The 42nd BNI was one of only twelve infantry regiments of the old Bengal Army to remain fully loyal to the British East India Company and to escape mutiny or disbandment during the Indian Mutiny of 1857‚Äì58. It was then renumbered as the 5th Bengal Native (Light) Infantry. As noted above the regimental title underwent several subsequent changes until it became the 5th Light Infantry in 1903. Throughout its history the 5th LI was known to its Indian soldiers as \\"Jansen-ki-Paltan\\" or Johnson's Regiment after its first commander (Captain Jeremiah). After serving in the Second Afghan War of 1879‚Äì80 and the Third Burmese War of 1885‚Äì87, the regiment saw only garrison duty until World War I. In 1914 the regiment was stationed at Nowgong in the Central Provinces. From there they were posted to Singapore in October to replace a British battalion. The regimental centre was at Benares and for enlistment and training purposes the 5th LI was linked with the 17th Infantry and the 18th Infantry.John Gaylor, page 8 Sons of John Company, Unusually for Indian Army regiments of the period, the 5th Light Infantry was an entirely Muslim unit. The regiment comprised Ranghars (Muslims of Rajput origin) making up the Right Wing, and Pathans making up the Left Wing.So designated from their respective positions on parade. Numbering 800 men at full strength, the regiment was commanded by both British and Indian officers.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 244 Singapore Mutiny Singapore Mutiny Following the entry of Turkey into the War in October 1914 the loyalty of the Muslim troops who made up a large proportion of the Indian Army came under some strain. In most regiments this did not cause major problems.Philip Mason, page 427 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", However the 5th Light Infantry had, since its arrival in Singapore, been plagued by internal discord and there were intelligence reports that agents of the Indian revolutionary group Ghadr were trying to foment rebellion amongst Muslim soldiers from Bengal, Delhi and UP areas.Peter Hopkirk, article 'The Great Game and its military dimensions:A review of the Singapore Mutiny by the 5th Indian Native Light Infantry (Bengal)', in the Proceedings of the Special Indian Mutiny Seminar Delhi, 1987 Also, Colonel Martin, newly promoted to command, was unpopular with his officersR.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, pages 4‚Äì5 Singapore Mutiny and there was further discord between factions amongst the sepoys focussing on issues of promotion, pay and other conditions of service.Hopkirk Garrison duties in Singapore included guarding German internees who attempted with some success to persuade the Indian soldiers that Britain was losing the War. Some of the sepoys attended a mosque where the resident local Maulvi preached that Turkey was the seat of the Khalifa of Islam and that no Muslim should fight against him.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 224 Singapore Mutiny Finally, in mid-February 1915 the regiment received orders to embark for further garrison duty in Hong Kong.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 31 Singapore Mutiny With poor communication between British officers and sepoys, and morale already low, the rumour that they were being sent to fight the Turks spread amongst the sepoys.http://www.country- data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-11789.html On 15 February while final preparations were being made for departure,R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 40 Singapore Mutiny mutiny broke out amongst four companies of the eight comprising the 5th LI. During the hours that followed about 40 British and local soldiers and civilians were killed by the mutineers, including two officers of the regiment. About half of the Indian personnel of the regiment did not take part in the mutiny but scattered in confusion and could not be brought to act against their fellow sepoys. Sepoys who rallied to their officers at Colonel Martin's bungalow overlooking the barracks, were registered and ordered to disperse \\"to a safe place\\" to avoid nighttime confusion between mutineers and loyalists.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 93 Singapore Mutiny On the 17 and 18 February local volunteer units together with sailors and marines from Russian, Japanese and French warships operating near Singapore moved to disperse the mutineers, who after the first day of violence had broken up into small groups seeking to escape from Singapore. The Sultan of Johore provided units of the Johore Military Forces to round up mutineers who had escaped to the Malaya mainland.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, page 193 Singapore Mutiny Following suppression of the mutiny, more than two hundred men were brought to court martial. Forty-seven mutineers were executed, some in public. Amongst those shot by firing squad were two Indian officers accused of leading the mutiny. A further 184 sepoys were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of up to life.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, pages 195‚Äì207 Singapore Mutiny Colonel Martin was the subject of severe criticism by a subsequent court of inquiry and retired from the Army.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, pages 216‚Äì220 Singapore Mutiny Post mutiny On 3 July 1915 the remnants of the 5th LI ‚Äì seven British and Indian officers and 588 other ranks ‚Äì sailed from Singapore to West Africa where they arrived in time to see active service in the German Cameroons. Following the German surrender the regiment was transferred to German East Africa (modern Tanzania) where it saw further action in the Lindi area. In 1917 the 5th LI was moved to Aden, then under threat by Turkish forces. Finally it returned to its cantonments in India during 1918.R.W.E. Harper & Harry Miller, pages 228‚Äì229 Singapore Mutiny, Following the departure of the regiment from Singapore members of the Ahir community were recruited to replace the Ranghars who had formerly comprised the Right Wing. A second wartime battalion was raised but spent the war in India, providing drafts for the overseas 1st Battalion, before being disbanded in 1919.John Gaylor, page 336 Sons of John Company, In spite of its credible performance in Africa during 1915‚Äì17, the 5th Light Infantry was amongst those regiments disbanded after the war as part of a general restructuring of the Indian Army.

It extends those libraries with a model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller architecture and tools for testing and deployment. Because it does not depend on server components, it can be combined with any web-service interface and server-side language like ASP.NET, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, or Ruby.  History  The first release of JavaScriptMVC was published in May 2008. JavaScriptMVC 2.0 became stable in June 2009 and is based directly on jQuery, mainly to keep the code size small and to focus on its unique features. Version 3.0 was released in December 2010. CanJS, JavaScriptMVC's extracted MVC parts, was released in April 2012. In May 2015, JavaScriptMVC was rebranded as DoneJS with an extended feature set and scope.  Controller  A controller is a list of functions that gets called back when the appropriate event happens. The name of the function provides a description of when the function should be called. By naming functions in the correct way, the Controller recognizes them as Actions and hooks them up correctly, for example: $.Controller('TodosController',{ \\".todo mouseover\\": function(el, ev){ el.css(\\"backgroundColor\\",\\"red\\") }, \\".todo mouseout\\": function(el, ev){ el.css(\\"backgroundColor\\",\\"\\") }, \\"#create_todo click\\" : function(){ this.find(\\"ol\\").append(\\"New Todo\\"); } }); A controller can also handle OpenAjax events, for example: $.Controller('TodosController',{ \\"main.test subscribe\\": function(ev, publisherData){ // TODO: do something }, \\"other.event subscribe\\": function(ev, publisherData){ // TODO: do something } });  View  JavaScriptMVC uses EJS templates to render HTML data in controllers and inject them into the DOM. The syntax was inspired by ERuby and is similar to PHP or other server-side template engines. For example, file \\"test.ejs\\" ( data = [ \\"Hello\\", \\"World\\" ] ): <% for (var i=0, len = data.length; i < len; i++) { %> * <%= data[i] %> <% } %> produces the following \\"output\\": * Hello * World  Model  The Model class provides basic functionality to organize the application's data layer. $.Model('Todo', { findAll: '/todos', findOne: '/todos/{id}', create: '/todos', update: '/todos/{id}', destroy : '/todos/{id}' },{});  Tests  JavaScriptMVC also comes with a comprehensive test plug-in that supports classic unit tests for models, as well as functional tests, that are required to deal with event driven architectures. Tests can be run on the command line with Rhino, using Selenium and during development with the integrated test console pop-up window.

It is situated on the main N1 route. Origin, architecture and history The town was established in 1843 in South Africa's inland plateau. It was founded to meet the religious needs of a growing farming community, but unlike most Karoo towns the church was not built as the physical focal point of the village; rather, the centrepiece is the village square. Unusually for this arid region, it was built astride a river which has been cited as the reason for the irregular street grid.History of Richmond The town has a substantial number of well-preserved houses and public buildings of Victorian and Edwardian Karoo style, with additions of verandahs dating from the 1920s. The Dutch Reformed Church building, the spiritual if not the physical centre around which the town evolved, dates from 1847, with a tower completed in 1909. It celebrated a centenary in 2009. The naming of the town originated in the desire of the townsfolk to honour the new Governor of the Cape, Sir Peregrine Maitland, who took office in 1844. Maitland declined, however, suggesting instead that it be named after his father-in-law, the Duke of Richmond. It was officially named Richmond in October 1845. It was a resort town for European aristocratic patients of lung diseases such as whooping cough and tuberculosis in the 1800s due to its clean air and mineral rich waters. Notable residents * Richmond was the birthplace of medical pioneer Dr Albert Hoffa, hailed as the founder of modern orthopaedics, author of a famous textbook and some of whose techniques are still in use. Born in Richmond on 31 March 1859, the son of a local doctor, he studied medicine in Germany. In 1886 Hoffa was appointed as lecturer at the University of W√ºrzburg, later becoming Professor and moving to Berlin. He died in 1907.K D Thomann. 1991. A modern textbook is 100 years old.

He was the 2016 Europe's Strongest Man champion. Early life Shahlaei was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the son of an Iranian father from Kermanshah and an English mother from Newcastle upon Tyne. He attended Balcarras School, and later moved to Stroud, Gloucestershire. Strongman career Shahlaei started strongman training in 2005 and entered his first novice competition that year, where he finished 8th. Within two years, he entered his first Britain's Strongest Man (\\"BSM\\"), having won the Midlands qualifier. In that competition, he made a huge impact, making it to the final, only to tear his biceps in the tyre flip, which forced him to withdraw. He won the Midlands qualifier again in 2008, and once again made the final, this time finishing 4th behind Jimmy Marku, Terry Hollands, and Mark Felix. This placing landed him an invite to the World's Strongest Man in 2008. He did not make the final. In 2009, four years after beginning strongman, he became the UKSC Midlands Strongest Man and also won the UKSC England's Strongest Man, citing this, alongside his WSM 2008 squat win, as the greatest moment of his career (the WSM qualifier titled \\"England's Strongest Man\\", which replaced the Britain's Strongest Man contest in 2009, was won by Terry Hollands and Shahlaei did not compete in that). His favourite strongman event is the farmer's walk because it is a good test of natural strength, whereas his least favourite strongman event is the Atlas stones.

The queen's pyramids were often constructed to the south of the king's pyramid, but a quarry located to the south of Khufu's pyramid caused the location of the smaller pyramids to shift to the east. Reisner placed the construction of the pyramid of Meritites in circa year 15 of the reign of Khufu. The construction of her pyramid would have started very soon after the construction of Pyramid G1-a. The queen's pyramids are part of the East Field at Giza, which also includes some royal mastabas.George Andrew Reisner, A History of the Giza Necropolis I, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1942, pp 70‚Äì74, retrieved from Giza Digital Library: History of the Giza Necropolis Series Pyramid G1-a (the northernmost of three small pyramids east of the Great Pyramid of Giza) was at first thought to belong to Meritites, but it is now thought to belong to Khufu‚Äôs mother, Hetepheres I.

Henderson taught sculpture at the Edinburgh College of Art for almost twenty years and was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1973. Biography  Ann Henderson was born into a farming family at Ormlie, near Thurso. While a pupil at the Miller Academy, her art teacher recognised and encouraged her creative flair and was influential in persuading Ann‚Äôs parents to allow her to study sculpture. In 1940 Henderson became a student at the Sculpture School of the Edinburgh College of Art, graduating in 1945 (the only woman in her year). For achieving high results in her Diploma of Sculpture she was awarded a Post-graduate scholarship. This enabled her to embark on further studies in the Sculpture School and as a result, she was awarded a major travel scholarship that took her to Paris. There she studied under the French sculptor Marcel Gimond at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1941 her family had moved to a farm at Culrain in Easter Ross and it was to this property that Henderson returned as a student during her college holidays. Before embarking on her scholarship travels, Henderson worked for a year as a Junior Assistant Teacher in the Sculpture School, returning to this position after her travel year. She was later promoted to Lecturer and subsequently to Senior Lecturer. Henderson introduced new experimental teaching courses to the Sculpture School. Henderson‚Äôs sculptures would often begin life in her studio as clay maquettes. She embraced new materials and was one of the first sculptors in Scotland to use polyester resin and fiberglass in any significant way. Her sculptures ranged from the figurative to the abstract as the influences of realism gave way to that of cubism and abstraction. Picasso‚Äôs cubist approach and joy in combining materials are reflected in her large plaster and bark sculpture ‚ÄòHen Wife‚Äô constructed in the forest. \\"Hen Wife\\" Her later development towards a smooth uncomplicated form is illustrated in an untitled figure (see the image, right). She said of her work simply that she liked to reflect the life around her. \\"Untitled Figure\\" Henderson‚Äôs sculptures have been exhibited in many of the important galleries in the United Kingdom including the annual exhibitions of the Society of Scottish Artists, the Royal Scottish Academy, the Royal Academy, London, and in Paris. Her academic successes included three RSA Annual Exhibition awards: The Keith Prize given for the best work by a student; the Ottilie Helen Wallace Prize for best work by a woman artist and the coveted Guthrie Award for the most outstanding work by a young Scottish artist. The Guthrie Award money enabled Ann to study in Greece for three months. Later she would become a member of the Scottish Arts Council‚Äôs ‚Äòyoung artists‚Äô awards panel. In 1969 Henderson was instrumental in mounting an International Open Air Exhibition of Sculpture in Dunfermline, believed to be one of the first of its kind in Scotland. This was a venue she returned to in 1972 when she organised a second open-air exhibition. Henderson was also responsible for an imaginative scheme while convener for the RSA commemorative Exhibition In 1976. She died before the exhibition took place but her ideas were realised through her associates on the committee. While Henderson‚Äôs studio in Edinburgh was central to her creative practice she also spent time at her Highland croft. There, she and her business partner would breed and show Highland ponies which won prizes at agricultural shows including the Royal Highland Show. While on the croft she worked on her sculptures in a makeshift studio space. Before her death, she completed the reconstruction of a superb studio but sadly illness was to rob her of the opportunity to use it. Ann died on 14 April 1976 in her 55th year. Bill Scott her friend and colleague wrote of Ann after her death in the RSA Annual Report 1976: ‚ÄúWe have lost a sculptor of maturity, energy, and influence, an artist whose reticent authority and breadth of vision were above question...‚Äù  Studies and Teaching Career  * 1940-1945 Diploma of Sculpture, Edinburgh College of Art * 1945-1946 Post-graduate Scholarship ‚ÄòHighly Commended‚Äô.

He served as an apprentice with Austin Organs, Inc. and in 1938 started his own organbuilding shop in Kansas City. While serving in the U.S. military in Europe in World War II he studied organs in England and France; these were described in several articles he wrote for The American Organist. He was a charter member of the Organ Historical Society, and helped found the American Institute of Organbuilders. During his career, which spanned roughly sixty years, he built or restored nearly 140 organs across the U.S. He specialized in voicing techniques that used pipe nicking. In the 1940s he experimented with making pipes from aluminum tubing. He officially retired to California in 1986, but in 1989 rebuilt his 1957 organ at St. John's Episcopal Church in Waterbury, Connecticut, which had been damaged by a tornado.

Twisted Wheel released one studio album (Twisted Wheel) which charted at No. 45 in the UK Albums Chart. They have also had three singles titled \\"She's A Weapon\\", \\"Lucy The Castle\\" and \\"We Are Us\\". Despite having little success in the charts, the band are highly regarded by many including Oasis's Liam and Noel Gallagher as well as Paul Weller all of whom have invited them on their recent UK tours. Lees was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. Fellow Twisted Wheel rocker Jonny Brown was originally in a band called 'The Children' with Rick; however, the band failed and the two school friends decided to form another band called Twisted Wheel. After meeting at Leeds Festival one year, the band was completed as they found their drummer Adam Clarke. In January, Twisted Wheel were signed by Columbia Records which led to them supporting Kasabian, Oasis and Paul Weller during 2008 and 2009. In the summer of 2010, it was announced on Twisted Wheel's Facebook page that Lees had left the band. In 2012 he formed Howling Rhythm with younger brother Max, a music agency, and signed bands 'The Gramotones' and \\"The Wax Collection\\" to it. Alongside managing the band, Howling Rhythm clubnights are now a common sight in Manchester, playing 1960s / 1970s soul, motown and funk.

It was raised in 1759 as the 3rd Battalion of Coast Sepoys, and formed part of the Madras Army. It was designated as the 62nd Punjabis in 1903 and became 1st Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to the Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 1st battalion, Punjab Regiment. It is the senior-most surviving infantry battalion of the British Indian Army. Early history The regiment had its antecedents in the old Madras Army of the British East India Company, which was largely responsible for the British conquest of south and central India. It was raised at Madras in September 1759, as the 3rd Battalion of Coast Sepoys from existing companies of sepoys that had been raised a year earlier. The men were mostly enlisted from South India and consisted of Muslims and Hindus. The regiment was actively engaged in the wars against the French, Mysore and the Marathas. Their first major engagement was the decisive Battle of Wandiwash in 1760, which ended French colonial ambitions in India. This was followed by forty years of constant warfare against the Sultans of Mysore, and then the Marathas chieftains. In the Second Maratha War of 1803-05, the regiment fought in the Battle of Assaye under General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. Its performance at Assaye was much appreciated and it was permitted to display the word \\"Assaye\\" with the device of an elephant on their colours and appointments. It was again engaged against the Marathas during the Third Maratha War of 1817-19, which decisively broke the Maratha power in India. In 1840, the regiment took part in the First Anglo-Chinese War, where it again performed well and as a reward, was authorized to bear a golden dragon wearing the imperial crown upon its regimental colours. In the latter part of the 19th century, the regiment did not see much action, although it saw active service in Burma. 62nd Punjabis In 1902, the regiment, now designated as the 2nd Madras Infantry, was reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Rajputs. Next year, as a result of the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener, all Madras units had 60 added to their numbers, and the regiment's designation was changed to 62nd Punjabis. During the First World War, the 62nd Punjabis were sent to Egypt as part of the 10th Indian Division to protect the Suez Canal. The regiment played a major role in repulsing the Turkish offensive of 1915. After operating in the British colony of Aden later that year, they arrived in Mesopotamia on 31 December 1915. Here, they were engaged in fierce fighting on the Tigris Front, as the British made desperate efforts to raise the Siege of Kut al Amara, and later, during the British advance northwards. The regiment took part in the Battles of Hanna, Dujaila Redoubt and the Hai Salient. After serving on the Persian frontier for the rest of the war, the regiment returned to India in 1920. It suffered a total of 840 casualties during the war. Captain Claude Auchinleck, later Field Marshal and the last Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, served with the 62nd Punjabis in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Subsequent history 330px After the First World War, the 62nd Punjabis were grouped with the 66th, 76th, 82nd and 84th Punjabis, and the 1st Brahmans to form the 1st Punjab Regiment in 1922. The battalion was redesignated as 1st Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, 1/1st Punjab initially served in Iraq and then moved to North Africa in November 1941 to join the 5th Indian Division, only to take part in the British withdrawal following Rommel's offensive in January 1942. The battalion was converted into motorized infantry and deployed at Ruweisat Ridge, where in July, it took part in halting Rommel's final offensive in North Africa at El Alamein by the Eighth Army led by General Claude Auchinleck. It then participated in the British counter-attack in October, which turned the tide of war in North Africa. In October 1943, 1/1st Punjab arrived in Burma, where it fought in the Second Arakan Campaign and took part in the Reconquest of Burma. It fought in the Battles of Kohima, Tiddim Road and numerous actions in the Irrawaddy Basin until the final Allied victory in August 1945. It then served in the Dutch East Indies as part of the Allied occupation forces. In 1947, 1/1st Punjab was allocated to Pakistan Army. During the 1948 Kashmir War with India, it served at Chakothi. In 1956, the 1st Punjab Regiment was merged with the 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 1/1st Punjab was redesignated as 1 Punjab.

In October, the 66th Punjabis joined Major General Charles Townshend's 6th Indian Division in its advance towards Baghdad. It fought in the Battle of Ctesiphon and then retired towards Kut al Amara, where it was besieged by the Turks with the rest of the 6th Division.

The battalion was redesignated as 5th Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, 5/1st Punjab fought in the Burmese Campaign. After the Japanese invasion of Burma, the battalion fought in a number of rear-guard actions, as the British retreated a thousand miles to India. In 1944, it fought in the Second Arakan Campaign, and then took part in the Reconquest of Burma. After the war, the battalion was sent to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. In 1947, the 1st Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 5/1st Punjab was redesignated as 4 Punjab.

It was raised by Captain Donald Macdonald at Vellore on 12 August 1794, as the 34th Battalion of Madras Native Infantry. It was designated as the 84th Punjabis in 1903 and became the 10th (Training) Battalion, 1st Punjab Regiment in 1922. In 1943, it was converted into the 1st Punjab Regimental Centre. In 1947, the 1st Punjab Regiment was allocated to the Pakistan Army. In 1956, the 1st, 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regimental Centres where amalgamated to form the Punjab Regimental Centre. Early history The regiment had its antecedents in the old Madras Army of the British East India Company, which was largely responsible for the British conquest of south and central India. It was raised at Vellore in August 1794, as the 34th Madras Battalion. The regiment's first action was during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War near Mallavelly on 27 March 1799. On 4 May, it fought in the Battle of Seringapatam, where Tipu Sultan made his last stand. The regiment's next major action was in the Second Maratha War, where it fought in the Battle of Assaye on 3 September 1803, under General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. The regiment's performance was much appreciated during the day's fierce fighting, where it suffered 228 casualties. As a reward, it was permitted to display the word \\"Assaye\\" with the device of an elephant on their colours and appointments. In 1810, it took part in the expeditions to Bourbon Island and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was again engaged against the Marathas during the Third Maratha War of 1817‚Äì19, which decisively broke the Maratha power in India. In the latter part of the 19th century, the regiment did not see much action, although it saw active service in Burma.350px 84th Punjabis In 1902, the regiment, now designated as the 24th Madras Infantry, was reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Rajputs. Next year, as a result of the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener, all Madras units had 60 added to their numbers, and the regiment's designation was changed to 84th Punjabis. During the first three years of the First World War, the 84th Punjabis remained deployed on the North West Frontier of India. In March 1917, they were dispatched to Mesopotamia, where it operated on the Euphrates Line. By now, the Turkish Army in Mesopotamia had been largely defeated and the regiment did not see any significant fighting. In November 1918, it moved to Salonika in Greece and then six weeks later to the Russian Transcaucasia in support of the White Russian forces fighting the Bolsheviks. After spending 1919‚Äì20 in Turkey as part of the Allied occupation forces, it returned home in October 1920. Subsequent history After the First World War, the 84th Punjabis were grouped with the 62nd, 66th, 76th and 82nd Punjabis, and the 1st Brahmans to form the 1st Punjab Regiment in 1922. The battalion was redesignated as 10th Battalion, 1st Punjab Regiment and became the Training Battalion of the regiment, based at Jhelum. During the Second World War, 10/1st Punjab was converted into the 1st Punjab Regimental Centre. In 1947, the 1st Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army, and in 1956, it was merged with the 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment.

Volcanic eruptions of Mt Matavanu (1905 - 1911) in central Savai'i swept northwards towards the coast and destroyed villages in its path. The lava flowed over of countryside to the sea and also destroyed another village Salago. The depth of the lava flow in some parts was 400 feet. A Catholic church and a meetinghouse of the LDS Church were also buried. Sale'aula land was covered by lava that reached other villages to the east including Mauga and Samalae'ulu. The colonial German administration acquired land on the main island Upolu and resettled villagers at Salamumu and Leauva'a. Today, those villagers are still part of the Gaga'emauga electoral district on Savai'i. Today, a few families have re-built homes upon the lava fields where there is sparse volcanic vegetation.

Early life and high school career Tomecka was born in Gliwice, Upper Silesia during a period of martial law resulting from crackdowns by the People's Republic of Poland on the Solidarity movement and other pro-democracy and anti-communist movements. Due to the instability and general difficulties associated with life in Poland, Tomecka emigrated with her family to the United States in 1984, eventually settling in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. At Shrewsbury High School, she was a multiple letter-winner in soccer, basketball, and track and field. She led the Shrewsbury High School girls' soccer team to the MIAA Division 1 Central Massachusetts championship in 1999, her senior year, where they lost to perennial power Ludlow in the Central Massachusetts-Western Massachusetts championship game, who then lost to Newton North in the state championship game. That season, she was both a Parade Magazine All-American and an NSCAA All-American; she was also an NSCAA All-American in 1998. As a youth club player, she was part of state championship teams for Fuller Hamlet Soccer Club in 1997 and 1999. Her successes led her to the University of North Carolina. University career Under the tutelage of famed coach Anson Dorrance, Tomecka was a four-year starter for the Tar Heels, earning a spot on the ACC All-Freshman Team in 2000 while winning a national championship. In 2003, alongside Hermann Trophy winner Cat Reddick and top scorer Heather O'Reilly, Tomecka captained the team that went an unprecedented 27‚Äì0‚Äì0 for the best record in NCAA women's soccer history, winning another national championship. During the offseason, she played for Boston Renegades of the W-League from 2000 through 2002. She graduated from UNC with a B.S. in biology in 2004.http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/w-soccer/mtt/tomecka_maggie00.html Post-university and professional career Tomecka had intended to play in the professional Women's United Soccer Association, but the league ceased operations at the conclusion of the 2003 season. Due to the lack of a professional league in the United States, she enrolled in medical school at Ross University School of Medicine. After completing two years at the Ross University campus in Dominica, she had a strong desire to resume playing soccer, so she returned to the United States in 2006 and signed with New Jersey Wildcats of the W-League, while continuing her medical school career. She then joined the Women's Premier Soccer League in 2007, playing for New York Athletic Club, and again in 2008 with SoccerPlus Connecticut. 2008 also saw Tomecka earn her Doctor of Medicine from Ross University. Tomecka was completing her residency at UNC Health Care when her Connecticut Reds coach Tony DiCicco invited her to try out for the Boston Breakers. Boston Breakers Tomecka successfully completed her tryout and was signed by Boston Breakers to a developmental contract on March 25, 2009. In June 2009, the Breakers promoted her on a full-time basis, and she started the final matches of the season at defensive midfield. In total, she appeared for the club in 11 games (6 starts, 653 total minutes). International career Tomecka has represented the United States at the Under-18 and Under-21 levels. As she has not appeared for the United States senior team, she remains eligible to play for both the United States and Poland.

CinemaDNG supports stereoscopic cameras and multiple audio channels. CinemaDNG specifies directory structures containing one or more video clips, and specifies requirements and constraints for the open format files, (DNG, TIFF, XMP, and/or MXF), within those directories, that contain the content of those clips.Adobe Labs: CinemaDNG - Image Data Format Specification (Version 1.0.0.0) (PDF) CinemaDNG is different from the Adobe DNG (Digital Negative) format that is primarily used as a raw image format for still cameras. However, each CinemaDNG image is encoded using that DNG image format. The image stream can then be stored in one of two formats: either as video essence using frame-based wrapping in an MXF file, or as a sequence of DNG image files in a specified file directory. Each clip uses just one of these formats, but the set of clips in a movie may use both. Rationale The purpose of CinemaDNG is to streamline workflows and help ensure easy archiving and exchange. There are several advantages from using raw image data for cinema, just as there are for still photography, but like the latter the presence of proprietary raw formats can inhibit the required integration. Movie development typically involves complicated workflows involving many stages and multiple suppliers of software and hardware components.Adobe Labs: CinemaDNG Workflow - Using the CinemaDNG File Format in Cinema Workflows (PDF) All of these indicate the desirability of using open formats. The ability to store images either within an MXF wrapper or as a DNG- sequence, with the ability to transfer from one to the other, provides extra flexibility. An additional benefit of using DNG is that there can be interchange between a CinemaDNG workflow and a still camera workflow. One use is to extract stills from a movie for publicity or other purposes. The DNG images that Adobe provided in the short example of how to store a video clip as a sequence of DNG files,Adobe Labs Downloads: CinemaDNG (see \\"Tangible deliverables\\"), were taken with a Canon EOS 30D dSLR camera, (and converted to DNG), rather than with a more conventional movie camera. This shows how any boundaries between different types of photography are weak, and illustrates why such open formats are important for the workflows of the future.

However, they have repeatedly emphasized that it will be an open format, and Adobe has stated \\"CinemaDNG uses documented, vendor-neutral, standard formats for video and imaging ‚Äì DNG, TIFF/EP, and MXF. The format is unencrypted and free from intellectual property encumbrances or license requirements\\".Adobe Labs: CinemaDNG File Format It is reasonable to speculate that eventually CinemaDNG will become a formal standard, based on the history of DNG itself which has been submitted to ISO for use in the revision of ISO 12234-2 (TIFF/EP). Rather than creating entirely new file formats, the strategy for CinemaDNG is primarily to specify how to package files and other data-sets, of existing open and/or standard formats, in consistent ways, so that not only can individual components of a movie be interchanged and archived, but so can sets of clips with all their associated video, audio, and metadata files. The emphasis is on having a systematic structure that supports the very complicated workflows, involving many stages and suppliers and software and hardware components, of movie development. The CinemaDNG specification is largely about this systematic directory structure and the requirements and constraints that ensure that individual files fit within it. If CinemaDNG follows the same sort of path to standardization as DNG, (or indeed, PDF), there will first be a period while the specification is tested in the marketplace to ensure that it works in practise as well as theory. It will then be revised accordingly, so that whatever is standardized will be credible, well supported by products, and ready for immediate use. In November 2014 Blackmagic Design introduced an extension to the CinemaDNG format in the form of a lossy compression scheme used in their URSA cameras. This format uses a 12-bit Huffman Coding by patching jpeg-9a for 12-bit support. These CinemaDNG files are supported by Blackmagic Design's own DaVinci Resolve software, slimRAW and Fast CinemaDNG Processor. The adoption of CinemaDNG among camera manufacturers appears to be hindered by Red Digital Camera‚Äôs patent US9245314, which covers in-camera recording of lossless compressed raw video. There had been an unsuccessful attempt to invalidate the patent.Unified Patents: IPR2019-01065 - Apple Inc. et al. v. Red. Com, LLC et al.

The episode aired on October 11, 2009 on Fox Broadcasting Company. In the episode, Cleveland, concerned that Cleveland Jr has no friends, invites his neighbor Lester‚Äôs son Ernie to their house. Ernie becomes attached to the family and Cleveland calls child services to have Ernie taken back home. When the plan backfires, Cleveland helps Lester get his son back. The episode was written by Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller and directed by Oreste Canestrelli. It was viewed by approximately 7.8 million viewers in its original airing. Plot Cleveland notices how friendless his son, Cleveland Jr. is compared to Rallo and Roberta, and sets out to find him a good friend. However, trying to find a friend for Cleveland Jr. gets a little difficult. Cleveland finds a kid for his son to play basketball with, but instead, the kid throws the basketball at Cleveland, sending him to the ground. Afterwards he runs off with Cleveland's wallet. Another negative setback happens when Cleveland asks another boy to play with Cleveland Jr., while the boy (who turns out to be an undercover cop) thinks that \\"Cleveland Jr.\\" is Cleveland's nickname for his penis and assumes that he is trying to solicit sex. Finally, Cleveland finds out that Lester's son, Ernie has no friends, which Cleveland realizes is a perfect opportunity to have his son make friends with another friendless child. It goes well, but things take a turn for the worse. Ernie leaves his family and joins the Brown family, much to their dismay. Ernie is unsanitary and disgusting, which pushes Donna to make Cleveland call child services and get Ernie back in his home. When a child service employee shows up, he brings Ernie back to his family, but instantly takes him away after he finds out how horrific Ernie's home is. Lester finds out that Cleveland called child services on Ernie, which messes up the relationship between the two. Cleveland decides to get Ernie back, after he finds Cleveland Jr. miserable. Lester takes Cleveland (and some of Lester's redneck buddies) to Ernie's foster home, to get him back. But negotiations quickly turn sour, before matters turn into a shootout, but the foster parents are armed to the teeth. In the midst of the fight, in which most of the rednecks die, Cleveland convinces the child worker that he could check in on Ernie from time-to-time. Unfortunately, the worker was shot by a stray bullet before he could fully sign the release form, though Cleveland finishes signing for him. Though Lester has got legal custody of his son, the fosters outnumber him. Luckily, Cleveland shoots down a chandelier on them, trapping them. Lester and Cleveland become friends again, and things end happily despite all the deaths. Meanwhile, Holt and Tim go to Vegas. Tim, who insinuates he is on ecstasy (which he mistakes for aspirin), has a great time, while Holt begs with the bouncer to let him in, despite looking underage and leaving his ID at his mom's house. Reception In its original broadcast on October 11, 2009 on Fox, this episode was watched by 4.32 million U.S. viewers and acquired a 6.3/10 rating/share.TV ratings: NFL games score for CBS and NBC Sunday - From Inside the Box - Zap2it The A.V.

Ackman Professor of Public Economics at Harvard University. Some of Chetty's recent papers have studied equality of opportunity in the United States and the long-term impact of teachers on students' performance. Offered tenure at the age of 28, Chetty became one of the youngest tenured faculty in the history of Harvard's economics department. He is a recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal and a 2012 MacArthur Fellow. Currently, he is also an advisory editor of the Journal of Public Economics. Education and early career Chetty was born in New Delhi, India and lived there until the age of nine. His family immigrated to the United States in 1988. Chetty graduated from University School of Milwaukee in 1997 and earned his AB from Harvard University in 2000. He continued at Harvard to earn his PhD in 2003 with a thesis titled Consumption commitments, risk preferences, and optimal unemployment insurance. As a sophomore in college, Chetty was told by his mentor Martin Feldstein to pursue his own ideas after proposing a counterintuitive idea that higher interest rates sometimes lead to higher investment. In 2003, at the age of 23, Chetty became an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, becoming a tenured associate professor there at 27. In 2009, Chetty returned to Harvard, where he was the Bloomberg Professor of Economics and the director of the Lab for Economic Applications and Policy. In 2015, Chetty moved to Stanford, where he became a professor in the Economics Department. In June 2018, Raj Chetty's frequent coauthor John Friedman announced that Chetty will be returning to Harvard. Research In recent work with John Friedman and Jonah Rockoff, Chetty found that test-score based value-added measures are not substantially biased by unobserved student characteristics and that the students of high value-added teachers have markedly better outcomes later in life. Drawing on these findings, Chetty testified in the landmark case Vergara v. California in support of the plaintiffs‚Äô key points: that teacher quality has a direct impact on students‚Äô achievements and that the current dismissal and seniority statutes have disparate impact on minority and low-income students. Chetty is also known for research showing that economic mobility varies enormously within the United States and for work on the optimal level of unemployment benefits. Recognition In 2008, The Economist and The New York Times listed Chetty as one of the top eight young economists in the world. Chetty is among the most cited young economists in the world. In 2010, he received the Young Labor Economist Award from the Institute for the Study of Labor for his paper \\"Moral Hazard Versus Liquidity and Optimal Unemployment Insurance\\" in the Journal of Political Economy. In 2012, he was one of 23 fellows to receive $500,000 over the following five years from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation as a recipient of one of the Foundation's Genius Grants. Chetty was the recipient of the 2013 John Bates Clark Medal, awarded by the American Economic Association to \\"that American economist under the age of forty who is adjudged to have made a significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.\\"Brenda Cronin, Economist Is Awarded Top Honor in the Field, Wall Street Journal, April 12, 2013 Chetty was awarded the Padma Shri, an award for distinguished service in any field, by the Government of India in 2015. George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen described Chetty in 2017 as \\"the single most influential economist in the world today.\\" Research by Chetty was covered by The New York Times, The Atlantic, Our World in Data, and Vox. In 2018, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 2019, he received an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship, awarded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

When he goes to stop water, he witnesses a young woman Ramya (Sindhu Menon), dead and drowned in the water due to asphyxiation. Eventually the investigation of the death takes place which is done by Assistant Commissioner of Police, Vasudevan (Aadhi), who is an honest and upright police officer, and also Ramya's former lover. Although circumstantial evidence claims it as a suicide, Vasu doubts that it isn't, and starts to investigate it in another angle. Investigation reveals Ramya was known to be in an extramarital affair with an unknown person, and his frequent visit to her flat is confirmed by the neighbors in the apartment. But Vasu is not convinced and he is sure that there is someone behind Ramya‚Äôs death and names him Mr. X. He also remembers his love life with Ramya during their college time. Vasu is denied marriage with Ramya by her father Shriraman (Rajashekar), as he is not willing to get his daughter married a police officer. When Vasu asks her to marry him without the consent of her father, she does not accept and both part ways. Later Ramya marries a rich groom named Bala (Nandha), a businessman. From then on the relationship is entirely cut between Vasu and Ramya. Vasu then becomes a police officer. Meanwhile, strange mishaps begin to take place in the apartment where Ramya died. Kalyani Subramanyam (Lakshmi Ramakrishnan), who resides in the flat opposite to Ramya‚Äôs, dies by electric shock. An ex-army veteran Thiyagarajan (Boys Rajan) on his travel to Pondicherry dies by an umbrella tip piercing his neck. The watchman of the apartment also dies a mysterious death. Vasu is able to relate the deaths with Ramya but doesn't know how exactly, but finds that Water has been the common element in all the deaths. He appoints a few assistants to live in various flats of the apartment and inform him if there is any suspicious activity. The assistants point out that a young man (Krishna) comes there to meet his girlfriend Deepa. Vasu identifies him as Mr. X and follows him to a theatre, but before he tries to catch him, he sees the ‚ÄòMr.X‚Äô banging himself in the restroom mirror. Vasu tries to stop him but an eerie spirit stops him from saving Mr. X. Vasu then sees human footprints walking on water and understands that it is the work of a supernatural entity. Subtle symbols keep appearing to Vasu and he begins to receive premonitions of the killings that are about to take place. The color Red and Water keep appearing together as premonitions and signals to Vasu that a murder is about to take place. Vasu is unable to convince his superiors that the deaths are not accidental. He investigates in the angle of life after death, and finds that a life can contact this world in any medium after the death. It may be also through water. Vasu now understands that Ramya's spirit kills everyone. One night, when Divya (Saranya Mohan), Ramya's sister, visits Vasu in his house to console him for Ramya's death, the latter's spirit possesses her body and reveals the truth of her life after their separation from Vasu. Ramya married Bala and lived happily with him just for a short time. Bala was a person who disliked anything secondhand in his life. He could not digest his wife‚Äôs past relation with her lover Vasu, and hence started to torture her. Ramya‚Äôs maidservant complained of Thiyagarajan in another flat, who was sexually harassing her. Ramya warned the master if he would have repeated this she would inform it to his wife. Ramya advised a girl to stop having a boyfriend as it would spoil her life, and this earned her the dislike of that girl. Ramya‚Äôs opposite apartment woman Kalyani wanted the flat where Ramya lived, for her daughter. The boyfriend created an impression that he had came to visit Ramya to the woman in the opposite flat. She has spun a false story against Ramya, and the master also confirmed it to Bala for taking revenge on her. Therefore, Bala killed Ramya and drowned her in water to make it look like a suicide. Hence the beginning of the movie's plot with confusions among Vasu and other police officers for her death. Hence Ramya's soul killed Kalyani by electric shock, Thiyagarajan by the umbrella tip, and the watchman who supported the false statement against Ramya, Mr. X by dashing him in the mirror and now, she horrifies Mr. X's lover and makes her mentally unstable, yet the girl survives. Vasu warns Bala that he will soon catch him with evidence for mercilessly killing Ramya. Bala‚Äôs friend Vicky alias Vignesh (Srinath) misguides him right from the beginning of the film about the women tendency of varieties and also against Ramya. Vicky later gets killed by Bala himself as he threatened to reveal the truth about the murder. Bala is confident that he can be caught only if he himself admits the crime. One Mid- Night, Bala kidnaps Divya and keeps her in his own car showroom. Vasu comes to save Divya but involves himself into a face-to-face combat with Bala. At the fight, Bala initially gains the upper hand, hits Vasu mercilessly with an iron rod on his head, and then stabs Vasu in his stomach with his own machete. Vasu then loses his power and consciousness, hence Ramya's blood-thirsty spirit possesses Vasu and gives him the upper hand to knock out Bala. Vasu succeeds in saving Divya and then Ramya's spirit leaves him. The very next day, Bala suddenly confesses about the murder of his wife. Hence Vasu gets a chance to prove him as the murderer. Actually, Ramya's spirit had possessed him and made him speak the truth. After the press conference, while Bala is being taken to court, the sky's color begins to appear bizarre and it begins to rain and the petrol is shown to be leaking from the police jeep, in which Bala is being taken to the court, and Vasu sees a red umbrella with water dripping from it. Then the screen fades to black and jeep crashing sound can be heard stating that Ramya did not spare Bala.

With a puzzling structure, the story is told through a series of flashbacks presented from four different perspectives.  Plot  Justin, a ten-year-old boy living in a small town in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region, is awaken in the middle of the night. His mother, Mireille is crying and his widower grandfather, Victor, tells the boy that his father, Ivan, is dead. The next day, Alex, Justin's uncle and Ivan's younger brother, arrives for the funeral accompanied by a young woman, Juliette. Justin notice the tension between the adults. He takes his father's gun and hides it. The story flashes backward and forward to explain what led up to Ivan's death. Alex, who has rebelled against his family by becoming a cop, works in the deprived La Duchere district of Lyon. He begins with his encounter, a year before Ivan's death, when he first meets Juliette, who is brought to his office when she was arrested for shoplifting. He lets her off. He sees her again one day when he visits the sleazy nightclub run by his older brother, Ivan. Ivan is a crime boss and runs a popular club with a drag revue, funding his business through a stolen-auto ring headed up by Jimmy, who is Juliette's brother. The encounter between the siblings on opposite sides of the law is tense, they barely get along. Ivan is happy to show Alex that he is doing much better than him on the wrong side of the law. After their second encounter Alex and Juliette start a tortured affair beginning to meet regularly for sex. He is not in love with her, and their relationship is complicated by the young woman's emotional and sexual involvement with Marie, a professor of philosophy. Alex spies on Marie. Ivan hears about Juliette's relationship with Alex and threatens her. Ivan and his gang, including Juliette, plan the theft of cars in a railway deposit. The heist at the railway marshaling yard goes disastrously wrong when Ivan is shot dead. Juliette, who had been coerced into participating, against Jimmy's wishes, is distraught by Ivan's death. Emotional imbalance and self- destructive, Juliette tries to commit suicide twice, first while staying with her brother and later while visiting Marie, after Ivan's death. Marie has her interned in a psychiatric hospital to recuperate. Alex asks Marie for the address of Juliette's clinic, but she has disappeared. In search of Juliette, Marie visits her housing estate apartment. After Ivan's cremation, Alex makes an effort to connect with his nephew without much success. On a local fair, Justin threatens Alex with a gun. Justin learns the truth about his father's death from his grandfather Victor. Marie visits Alex, who tells her Juliette was involved in the heist and that he is trying to find her. Alex and Marie develop an uneasy friendship as they bid, from a distance, to protect Juliette. Later Alex visits Marie and finds she has become a recluse, writing a book about Juliette. He tells her Juliette is safe because the police are looking for a boy. Later Alex hears that Marie has committed suicide as he receives her manuscript and the tapes of Juliette's voice in the post. Alex goes to see Juliette in Marseilles, but leaves her alone when he sees she is well from a distance. She has built a new life for herself and works in a bookshop. Justin has taken after his father and grandfather and does not like his uncle. By contrast, Justin gets along very well with Jimmy. Jimmy decides to marry Ivan's widow, Mireille.

It is generally considered, with My Favorite Season and Wild Reeds, among T√©chin√©'s best films.Marshall, Andr√© T√©chin√©, p. 1 Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 82% of 11 critics have given the film a positive review, holding an average score of 7/10. On line film critic James Berardinelli called the film \\"strong and keenly- insightful \\". Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \\"T√©chin√© involves us in a subtle, gradual process of discovery; each piece changes the relationship of the others. He is so wise about these criminals, he makes the bad guys in most American films look like cartoon characters.\\" In USA Today Mike Clark commented that in Thieves ‚ÄúDeneuve gives one of her best performances ever, though she's not exactly the movie's focus. Of the many pleasures here, one is trying to guess just who the dramatic focal point is\\". Janet Maslin in the New York Times reported that in the film \\"T√©chin√© explores the intricate connections among these characters with a somber, penetrating wisdom that is the film's main reward.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum from Chicago Reader called the film \\"a Masterpiece\\" The film received five nomination to the Cesar Awards, including the categories of Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress (Catherine Deneuve), Best Young Actor (Beno√Æt Magimel) and Best Young Actress (Laurence C√¥te). It won only in the last category. In addition, Beno√Æt Magimel received the Prix Michel Simon as Best Actor for his performance in Thieves. Production Thieves was directed by Andr√© T√©chin√© in the style of film noir. Its fragmented structure has been compared to a William Faulkner's novel, particularly to The Sound and the Fury (1929).Marshall, Andr√© T√©chin√©, p. 52 The narrative ‚Äî consisting of a prologue, five sections, and an epilogue ‚Äî leaps around in time and switches between the viewpoints of Justin, Alex, Marie, and Juliette. The Sound and the Fury unfolds over four days, likewise, switching narrative perspectives. Both The Sound and the Fury and Thieves also have a central female character who is loved obsessively by two of the narrators: Faulkner's novel has Caddie, who is loved by her brothers Benjy and Quentin, and T√©chin√©'s film has Juliette, who is the love interest of both Alex and Marie.Marshall, Andr√© T√©chin√©, p. 53 The divided time structure emphasize the interlapping relationships between the characters.Marshall, Andr√© T√©chin√©, p. 54 Music The original score for the film was written by Alain Sarde, regular composer in T√©chin√©'s films.

Retrieved on September 18, 2009. Opened in 1998, The school is operated by Chicago Public Schools district. A university-preparatory school, Brooks is named for African-American poet Gwendolyn Brooks. History The site has been in use as a high school since 1915, though Brooks is the fourth high school to occupy the property. George Pullman, upon his death in 1897, bequeathed the sum of $1,200,000 to provide for the building and endowment of a \\"free school of manual training for the benefit of the children of persons living or employed at Pullman.\\" An additional bequest was made by Mrs. Pullman, and the Pullman Free School of Manual Training opened its doors on the site in September 1915. The first year class welcomed 106 boys and girls. Although the town of Pullman had by this time become part of the city of Chicago, the school successfully fulfilled the intentions of its founder by serving the children of employees of the Pullman car works and the Pullman- Roseland communities. It was widely recognized at the time for excellence in vocational instruction and effective training of its students, all of whom were concurrently enrolled in core academic subjects such as English, math, and science. By the late 1940s, the endowment that supported the school could no longer sustain the rising costs of the school's operation as it grew to a student enrollment of 600. According to Pullman's will, the school was prohibited from charging tuition. The school's board decided that the only practicable means of carrying out Pullman's intention was to divert the funds from the school into an educational scholarship foundation. The Free School closed in 1950. The school was immediately taken over by the Augustinians, who established Mendel Catholic High School. The Roman Catholic high school remained in operation from 1951‚Äì88. In 1988, Mendel was closed as the school's population dropped, and the property was sold to the Archdiocese of Chicago, which opened St. Martin de Porres High School. The diocesan school remained open only until 1997 because the school's population had continued to drop. The school and property were then sold to the Chicago Public Schools system, which opened the current school in 1998 as Southside College Preparatory Academy. In 2001, the school was named in honor of Gwendolyn Brooks, who was a South Side resident, former U.S. Poet Laureate, and consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. One of the glass rotundas that anchor the main G.B.C.P.A. building Campus and facilities Brooks is located at 111th and King Drive in the Roseland area which is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, from the Chicago Loop by Lake Calumet. Roseland is near the historically significant Pullman Historic District.

C. Bleijs Adrianus Cyriacus Bleijs (29 March 1842, Hoorn - 12 January 1912, Kerkdriel) also known as A.C. Bleijs or, incorrectly, as A.C. Bleys, was a Dutch architect and painter who is primarily known for designing several Catholic churches. Bleijs was born in Hoorn as the son of a master carpenter who built several houses in that town. Bleijs was trained in architectural skills by architect B. Blanken and engineer H. Linse. In November 1859 he moved to Roermond to join P.J.H. Cuypers‚Äô firm. After a conflict with Cuypers in 1861, for which he refused to apologize, he was forced to leave Cuypers‚Äô firm and went to Antwerp to pursue his further education at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, where in 1862 he was the first winner of the Premier Prix d'Excellence for architecture and where he graduated in 1864. After graduation he returned to Hoorn and started his own office, which in 1880 he moved to Amsterdam. Church of Saint John the Baptist (Pijnacker) For a Catholic architect of that period, Bleijs was unusually eclectic. He did not limit himself to the dominant neo-Gothic style but designed several churches in neo- Romanesque and neo-Renaissance style as well, despite the latter style being controversial in Catholic circles for its supposedly Protestant character. Besides fourteen churches he designed, among other things, two Amsterdam hospitals. His best known work is the St. Nicolas Church in Amsterdam. Among his students were such notable architects as Willem Kromhout and Jan Stuyt. After ca. 1900 no further assignments came, and in 1903 Bleijs closed his office and became a civil servant in 's-Hertogenbosch. He died in Kerkdriel and after a funeral mass at the St. Nicholas Church in Amsterdam he was buried at the Catholic cemetery De Liefde.

Evans played in eighteen international games for Wales, and in 1908 was part of the Welsh team that faced touring Australian team. Evans played in four Home Nations Championships, from 1906 to 1909, and the first two Five Nations Championships, in 1910 and 1911; playing in three Triple Crown winning seasons. Rugby career Born in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire; Evans was a Police Sergeant by occupation,Ammanford Rugby Football Club The early days 1887-1914 and was described as being 'as strong as an ox' and 'unusually fleet of foot'.Bevan (2005), pg 12. He first played rugby for local club team Ammanford RFC. A rugby talent at a young age, Evans was given the captaincy of the Ammanford senior team during the 1902/03 season; while only 19.Jenkins (1991), pg 56. Before his first international cap, Evans had switched from his local club side to Llanelli, the premier team from the west of Wales. Evans made his first international appearance for Wales in the final game of the 1906 Home Nations Championship. Wales had won the previous years Championship, and with victories already established over England and Scotland, a win against Ireland in the last encounter would give the country back-to-back Triple Crown seasons. Three changes were made to the team for the trip to Belfast, all in the forward positions and all three new caps; Evans and two Cardiff players, Dai Westacott and Jack Powell. The game ended in a disappointing loss for Wales, with poor selection decisions blamed. All three new caps found the strains of international rugby too much, and failed to last the pace. Despite a poor debut, Evans was reselected for the next season's Championship, playing in all three matches. Wales finished second in the tournament, losing only one game, against eventual champions Scotland. Evans missed the majority of the 1908 season, joining the team for the final game of the Championship in an away win over Ireland. Although Evans played but a single match of the tournament, Wales won all three games of the 1908 Championship, making Evans a Triple Crown winning player for the first time in his career. The 1908/09 season was the pinnacle of Evans' playing career, at club and country level. The season saw the arrival of the very first touring Australian national team. The Wallabies, as the Australian team was nicknamed, had faced eight club and county teams, winning each match without too much resistance. Llanelli were the ninth opponents, and the game was played at Stradey Park on 17 October. Although records state that Evans was not given the captaincy of Llanelli until the next season, he was given the honour of captaining the team for the game against the Australians. Llanelli won the game 8-3, the first loss of the tour for the Australians and the first win over one of three big Southern Hemisphere international teams for Llanelli. Evans not only led his team that day, but also scored the winning try; and was reported to have crossed the line with three Wallabies clinging on to him in a bid to bring him down. Almost two months later Evans was part of the Wales squad to face the same touring Australians, joined in the pack by fellow Llanelli team-mate James Watts. Wales won by a narrow 9-6 scoreline. The Australian tour match was followed by the 1909 Home Nations Championship, the final tournament before the inclusion of the French team made the competition the Five Nations Championship. Evans played in all three Championship games, plus an early encounter with France, which all resulted in wins for the Wales team, giving Evans his second Triple Crown. The 1909/10 season saw Evans given the club captaincy of Llanelli, and he retained his place in the Welsh international team. The Welsh run of 11 games unbeaten ended during the 1910 Five Nations Championship, with defeat away to England at Twickenham. Although Wales won the remaining three games, they could only finish second in the table to England. Evans' final Championship came in 1911, again selected for the full tournament, Evans was part of his third and final Triple Crown team, plus the first official Grand Slam victory. His final international match was played at the Cardiff Arms Park in Cardiff, in the 1911 Championship decider, against Ireland. In the 16-0 win, Evans scored his first and only international points, with one of three Welsh tries. Evans had played a total of 18 games for his country over a six-season period, finishing on the losing side on only three occasions.

(commonly referred to as Super Smash Bros. 64 or Smash 64) is a crossover fighting video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was first released in Japan on January 21, 1999, in North America on April 26, 1999, and in Europe on November 19, 1999. The first installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, it is a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, including Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Metroid, F-Zero, Mother, Kirby, and Pok√©mon. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skills and the stage's hazards to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately knock opponents off the stage. Super Smash Bros. received mostly positive reviews upon its release. It was a commercial success, selling over five million copies worldwide by 2001, with 2.93 million sold in the United States and 1.97 million sold in Japan. It was given an Editors' Choice award from IGN for the \\"Best Fighting Game\\", and also became a Nintendo 64 Player's Choice title. The game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console, starting with Super Smash Bros. Melee which was released for the GameCube in 2001. Gameplay Ness from alt=A scenery full of platforms, blocks and fences in the style of the Super Mario Bros. video game. On a platform, a boy wearing a baseball cap throws a bolt of lightning and in another stand, a round, pink creature wearing red shoes stands still. The Super Smash Bros. series is a departure from the general genre of fighting games; instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character is knocked progressively farther by attacks. To knock out (KO) an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries. When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time \\"recovering\\" than others. Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but harder for them to recover once sent flying. While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require players to memorize complicated button-input combinations, Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters. Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to move freely. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with larger, more dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible. Various weapons and power-ups can be used in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or dispense additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Pok√© Balls. The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from Metroid and Sector Z from Star Fox. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players move within a two- dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight. In the game's single-player mode, the player battles a series of computer-controlled opponents in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time. While the player can determine the difficulty level and the number of lives, the series of opponents never changes. If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time, they can continue at the cost of a loss of overall points. This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels. The single-player mode also includes two minigames, \\"Break the Targets\\" and \\"Board the Platforms\\", in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms, respectively. A \\"Training Mode\\" is also available in which players can manipulate the environment and experiment against computer opponents without the restrictions of a standard match. Up to four people can play in multiplayer mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free-for-all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team have lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when the timer expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death. During sudden death, all fighters are given 300% damage and the last fighter standing will win the match. Characters The game includes twelve playable characters from popular Nintendo franchises. Characters have a symbol appearing behind their damage meter corresponding to the series to which they belong, such as a Triforce behind Link's and a Pok√© Ball behind Pikachu's. Furthermore, characters have recognizable moves derived from their original series, such as Samus's charged blasters and Link's arsenal of weapons. Eight characters are initially playable, and four additional characters can be unlocked by meeting specific criteria. The character art featured on the game's box art and instruction manual is in the style of a comic book, and the characters are portrayed as toy dolls that come to life to fight. This style has since been omitted in later games, which feature trophies instead of dolls and in-game models rather than hand-drawn art. Development Super Smash Bros. was developed by HAL Laboratory, a Nintendo second-party developer, during 1998. Masahiro Sakurai was interested in making a fighting game for four players. As he did not yet have any original ideas, his first designs were of simple base characters. He made a presentation of what was then called to co-worker Satoru Iwata, who helped him continue. Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well and that he had to think of a way to make his game original. His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters and put them in a fight. Knowing he would not get permission, Sakurai made a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he was sure the game was well-balanced. The prototype he presented featured Mario, Donkey Kong, Samus and Fox as playable characters. The idea was later approved. Although never acknowledged by Nintendo or any developers behind Super Smash Bros., third party sources have identified Namco's 1995 fighting game The Outfoxies as a possible inspiration, with Sakurai also crediting the idea of making a beginner-friendly fighting game to an experience in which he handily defeated a couple of casual gamers on The King of Fighters '95 in an arcade. Multiple characters were planned for the game but were cut during development at some point, including Marth, King Dedede, Bowser, and Mewtwo. All these characters were added to later games. Super Smash Bros. features music from some of Nintendo's popular gaming franchises. While many are newly arranged for the game, some pieces are taken directly from their sources. The music for Super Smash Bros. was composed by Hirokazu Ando, who later returned as sound and music director for Super Smash Bros. Melee. A complete soundtrack was released on CD in Japan through Teichiku Records in 2000. Reception Critically, Super Smash Bros. garnered positive reviews, with most of the praise going towards its multiplayer-player mode, music, \\"original\\" fighting game style, and simple learning curve. There were criticisms, however, such as the game's scoring being difficult to follow and the single-player mode's perceived difficulty and lack of features, with GameSpot former editorial director, Jeff Gerstmann, noting the single-player game \\"won't exactly last a long time\\". Super Smash Bros. was commercially successful, becoming a Nintendo 64 Player's Choice title, selling 1.97 million copies in Japan and 2.93 million in the United States as of 2008.

As a sophomore in 2007 he played in all 13 games as a backup tight end and on special teams. He finished the season with two receptions for 18 yards and a touchdown. As a junior in 2008, McCoy started all 13 games at tight end, making 22 receptions for 256 yards and a touchdown. During his senior year in 2009, McCoy started all 10 games for USC. He missed two games due to nagging injuries, and was named academically ineligible during the season finale against Boston College in the Emerald Bowl. McCoy finished the season with 22 catches for 457 yards and one touchdown. His most productive performance of his senior year came in the game against rival Notre Dame, catching 5 passes for 153 yards. McCoy left USC with 46 career catches, 731 career yards, and three career touchdowns. Professional career Seattle Seahawks McCoy was considered one of the top tight end prospects for the 2010 NFL Draft. He ended up being selected in the sixth round, 185th overall, by the Seattle Seahawks. The move reunited him with his college head coach from USC Pete Carroll who in 2010 took the head coaching job with Seattle. On May 21, 2013, McCoy suffered a torn Achilles' during organized team activities, and underwent surgery three days later. His recovery was expected to take about six to nine months, prompting the Seahawks to waive him injured on May 28. After clearing waivers the following day, McCoy reverted to the reserve/injured list. On July 29, 2014 McCoy suffered another torn Achilles' during training camp, his second in just over a year. The injury resulted in him missing the entire season and postseason. On September 5, 2015, as part of the cutdown to a 53-man roster, the Seahawks terminated McCoy's contract.

Waters from the Green Swamp drain into the river near Supply and flow southward to empty into the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway near Sunset Harbor. The Lockwood Folly Country Club in Varnamtown takes its name from the river. Lockwood Folly Inlet is a nearby inlet connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway and was once the mouth of the Lockwood Folly River prior to construction of the Intracoastal and natural sand shifting. The inlet separates the barrier islands of Oak Island and Holden Beach Isle. Name origin There are two folklore stories that explain the genesis of the name \\"Lockwood Folly\\". The first states that a man by the name of Lockwood began building the \\"boat of his dreams\\" along the banks of the river. Working tirelessly for many months, Lockwood finally completed his sailing ship, but when he tried to float the boat, he discovered that he had made the draft too deep to clear the sandbar at the inlet. So with no way to sail the ship out of the river, Lockwood disappointedly left the ship to rot. The locals began calling the ship \\"Lockwood's Folly\\" and according to the story, eventually the name was applied to both the river and inlet. The second tale tells the story of a group of settlers led by a man named Lockwood that decided to colonize the banks of the river. Lockwood supposedly did not bring enough supplies or got into a dispute with the local Indian tribe and the colony had to be disbanded. According to the story, the remains of the colony were named \\"Lockwood's Folly\\" and later the name came to encompass the nearby river and inlet. The river name appears on a John Ogilby map from 1671, making Lockwood's Folly River one of the oldest named rivers in North Carolina.

Purpose With the expansion of the world wide web and the Internet, computer networks have become very large and complex, making them impossible to manage manually. In response, a suite of network management software was developed to help reduce the burden of managing the growing complexity of computer networks. Network management software usually collects information about network devices (which are called Nodes) using protocols like SNMP, ICMP, CDP etc. This information is then presented to network administrators in an easy to understand and accessible manner to help them quickly identify and remediate problems. Problems may present itself in the form of network faults, performance bottlenecks, compliance issues etc. Some advanced network management software may rectify network problems automatically. Network management software may also help with tasks involved in provisioning new networks, such as installing and configuring new network nodes etc. They may also help with maintenance of existing networks like upgrading software on existing network devices, creating new virtual networks etc. Functions Provisioning: This function enables network managers to provision new network devices in an environment. Automating this step reduces cost and eliminates chances of human error. Mapping or Discovery: This function enables the software to discover the features of a target network. Some features that are usually discovered are: the nodes in a network, the connectivity between these nodes, the vendor types and capabilities for these nodes, the performance characteristics etc. Monitoring: This function enables the network management software to monitor the network for problems and to suggest improvements. The software may poll the devices periodically or register itself to receive alerts from network devices. One mechanism for network devices to volunteer information about itself is by sending an SNMP Trap. Monitoring can reveal faults in the network such as failed or misconfigured nodes, performance bottlenecks, malicious actors, intrusions etc. Configuration management: This function enables the software to ensure that the network configuration is as desired and there is no configuration drift. Regulatory compliance: This function enables the network management software to ensure that the network meets the regulatory standards and complies with applicable laws. Change control: This function enables the software to ensure that the network changes are enacted in a controlled and coordinated manner. Change control can enable audit trails which has applications during a forensic investigation after a network intrusion. Software Asset Management: This function enabled the software to inventory software installed on nodes along with details like version and install date. Additionally, it can also provide software deployment and patch management. Cybersecurity: This function enabled the software to use all the data gathered from the nodes to identify security risks in an IT environment.<  References  Category:Network management ","title":"Network management software"},{"id":"24389377","text":"11 Ursae Minoris b is an extrasolar planet which orbits the K-type giant star 11 Ursae Minoris, located approximately 390 light years away in the constellation Ursa Minor.

Etymology The name of Nizhnyaya Toyma means The Lower Toyma, as opposed to the Upper Toyma, the Verkhnyaya Toyma, also a right tributary of the Northern Dvina. The toponym Toyma occurs in various northern Russian territories, from Toyma in Karelia to the river Toyma in the Republic of Tatarstan.

Geography  The Nizhnyaya Toyma flows through a plain with hills, in the conifer forests (taiga). It was used for timber rafting until the 1990s. The source of the Nizhnyaya Toyma is in the eastern part of Vinogradovsky District. The river initially flows to the south and enters Verkhnetoyemsky District, then turns south-west. The upper valley of the Nizhnyaya Toyma is not populated; the first settlement is the twin villages of Uzlikha and Borovino. Downstream of Borovino, the Nizhnyaya Toyma briefly enters Vinogradovsky District, flows through the village of Shosheltsy, and re-enters Verkhnetoyemsky District. The lower course of the river is populated. The mouth of the Nizhnyaya Toyma is located in the village of Burtsevskaya, the administrative center of Nizhnetoyemsky Selsoviet. This area is famous for its traditional wood painting crafts.

He served as a commissioner of RCAHMS and on the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland. LifeNational Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Reginald Fairlie Born at Kincaple, Fife, he was the son of J. Ogilvy Fairlie of Myres (1848‚Äì1916) and Jane Mary Fairlie. He was educated at the Oratory School in Birmingham. He was apprenticed to Robert Lorimer in 1901, and much of his style echoes that of Lorimer. Ian Gordon Lindsay trained under him (1927‚Äì30). A faithful Roman Catholic, Fairlie designed many war memorials, churches and restorations of castles. From a long list of commissions, only a handful fall outside the borders of Scotland. He set up office at 14 Randolph Place in 1908. He served in Royal Engineers in World War I. His older brother John Ogilvy Fairlie was killed in action on 25 September 1915. With the death of his father on 28 September 1916, Reginald fell heir to the family estate of Myres. In the early 1920s he designed a series of war memorials, largely working with the sculptor Alexander Carrick. After the war (around 1920) he joined forces briefly with the architects Reid and Forbes and worked on some award winning housing schemes including Northfield in Edinburgh. He set up his own office at 7 Ainslie Place (which was also his home) in 1925 but remained linked with Reid and Forbes until 1926. Curiously, James Smith Forbes of Reid and Forbes lodged with Fairlie even after the end of their business partnership. His neighbour at 7 Ainslie Place was Francis Cadell the artist, and they became friends and remained so even after Cadell moved house. He was also close friends with the sculptor Hew Lorimer, whom he possibly met during his connection with Robert Lorimer as Hew was his second son. He pulled Hew into some of his projects, including the prestigious National Library project, where Hew provided the figurative sculpture on the frontage. He generously passed the commission for the restoration of Iona Abbey to his friend and employee Ian Gordon Lindsay in 1938. Fairlie lived the life of a bachelor, with a personal servant, Robertson, serving him faithfully until death in 1938. He leased Inchrye Abbey from 1931 to 1939 for shooting parties and falconry. Work ceased on most projects during World War II, including his major commission for the National Library. The work on the library did not resume until 1950. In 1946 Fairlie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir David Russell, Sir James C Irvine, Sir Ernest Wedderburn, and Robert James Douglas Graham. Fairlie died in St. Raphael‚Äôs Nursing Home in the Grange, Edinburgh, but was buried with his parents in the Eastern Cemetery in St Andrews. His grave stone was carved by his friend Hew Lorimer. It lies on the eastern wall, towards the south-east corner. Achievements Fairlie rose to the position of chairman of the Directorate of Ancient Monuments. In 1933 he became elected a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1937 he received a doctorate from the University of St Andrews (LLD) for his work on St Salvator‚Äôs Chapel there. He was also a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission and the Forestry Commission.

Forces involved were Chiricahua Apache warriors and mounted Confederate States militia. The battle occurred in a pass of the Florida Mountains within Confederate Arizona, now southwestern New Mexico. The exact date of the engagement is unknown. Background Mangas Coloradas, Chief of the Gila River Apaches, fought Confederate soldiers throughout Arizona's rebellious period. The Arizona Guards, a force of Confederate militia, recruited in Traditional Arizona, were in action almost immediately after their induction into service on August 1, 1861. In early August, a group of Arizonans known as the Ake Party were traveling from the Tucson region to the western shores of the Rio Grande near Mesilla. Most of them had left their town of Tubac after the siege of their old presidio. By mid-August they had nearly made it to the river when they were ambushed by a force of Apache warriors. This engagement became known as the Battle of Cookes Canyon. Word of the engagement and the plunder of hundreds of heads of livestock led to the Arizona Guards' involvement in this Apache campaign. Battle As soon as Thomas J. Mastin, captain of the Arizona Guards, received the Ake Party's distress call, he realized that a nighttime pursuit would likely lead to an ambush of the pursuers. Captain Mastin ordered the pursuit to begin the next morning. Mastin did not head for Cook Canyon, however, as he had a hunch as to where the Apaches were headed with their stolen property. Instead, he ordered the militia to proceed to the passes over the Florida Mountains, near the Mexican border. Mastin knew that the Apaches could not travel very fast with stolen livestock. The captain and thirty-five of his men arrived at the base of the mountains early the next day. There they settled themselves in the foothills and awaited the fleeing Apaches. Mastin's hunch had paid off. The Arizona Guards occupied their new post in the Florida Mountains for only a short time when their pickets reported the approach of the native warriors. The Arizonans charged the Apaches as they entered the pass, and a running fight ensued. The Apaches were routed, and much of the livestock was recaptured. As many as eight of the Apaches were killed, with no loss to the Confederate forces. The Arizona Guards pursued the Apaches back to Cooke's Canyon, where they attempted to regroup. A small skirmish was fought with no casualties inflicted to either side. The Apaches retreated to their usual strongholds in northern Mexico. Aftermath Governor John R. Baylor heard of the Arizona Guard's victory in the Florida Mountains, however the success was overshadowed by two defeats at the hands of Mescalero Apaches within ten days of the Florida Mountains battle. These engagements occurred at and near Fort Davis, Texas, so Baylor's men were not involved in the fighting. Captain Mastin would go on to lead the Arizona Guards to victory at the Battle of Pinos Altos, where he was mortally wounded.

The federation was established on 15 July 1971 as a result of the Police Act (NI) 1970. There are 6800 members as of June 2016 according to their website and the current chairman is Mark Lindsay. The make-up of the federation is designed with similarity to political constituency. Representatives are provided for five larger regional divisions and various districts within. A fixed number of representatives are allocated to each district and to each region with a predetermined percentage within the ranks of constable, sergeant, inspector and part-time officer. Only four of the regions are based on the geography of Northern Ireland with Region 5 being dedicated to officers of Training Branch, Road Policing, Urban Region TSG, Headquarters, and Crime Operations. Regions 1 to 4 are allocated representation on an equal basis of region, district and officer count whereas Region 5 has additional allocation rules based on each department. Region 1 is based exclusively in the Greater Belfast area with four districts. Region 2 covers the south east and is divided into eight districts. Region 3 covers the west and is divided into eight districts. Region 4 covers the north and is divided into nine districts. Meetings take place on six obligatory occasions each year with further meetings occurring upon approval. The federation votes internally to elect a Central Committee comprising 10 constables, 5 sergeants, 3 inspectors and one part-time officer. The Central Committee then elects four full-time officials from its members. These positions include Chairman, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, and Treasurer. Federation offices are based in Garnerville and positions are open to election once every three years. The federation seeks to provide \\"Welfare and Efficiency\\" for the police service with its main activities performed in maintaining the RUC Benevolent Fund and providing legal advice. Representatives meet the Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Office, and the Security Minister regularly as well as the occasional meet with the Prime Minister. Negotiations involve pay, pensions, and general conditions as well as consultation on all levels of service within the PSNI. The federation is a member of the Luxembourg based European Confederation of Police (EUROCOP) which serves as a go-between for the European Parliament and forum for matters of mutual concern including terrorism, pay and working conditions.Map of Members, EuroCOP Representatives also attend conferences regularly in the United Kingdom, United States of America, and Republic of Ireland including the International Law Enforcement Committee. Annual reports are produced as well as various reports and press releases, much like news reports. Obligations fall under five general categories, General Services, Health & Safety, Health Services, PFNI Applications, and Travel Services. These services branch out as the provision of, General Services: Police Treatment Centers, Credit Union, Discipline Coordination, Police Federation Lottery, Police Rehabilitation and Retraining Trust, Retired Members Card, Benefits Scheme, and RUC Benevolent Fund, Health & Safety: Health & Safety Role, Legislation information, and Appeal Boards, Health Services: BUPA Dental Plan, Critical Illness Plan, and Private Health Scheme, PFNI Applications: Legal Advice Applications, and Lottery Funding Applications, Travel Services: Family Travel insurance, Hotelshop, and Stenaline special rates. The federation represents the police service on a similar basis to that of a trade union although the police force has no legal right to some civil actions such as a strike action. In 1999, in response to the Patton Report, the federation produced a statement supporting radical changes to facilitate peace. With a view to recruiting Catholics for the police force, the statement suggested voluntary severance to make jobs available. It went on to plea for extra investment in constable and sergeant training and promised that, the then Royal Ulster Constabulary, had changed and was committed to evolving to meet demands and standards. The statement expressed opposition to changing the name of the police service, now the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) as a proud tradition and memorial to those officers injured or killed in connection with The Troubles, as well as opposition to changing the dark green uniform or symbols of harp and crown as representative of either community. Other views expressed the preference for neutral working areas, to be an unarmed force (in common with the Garda S√≠och√°na and UK Police in Britain), freedom from political direction, that accepting former paramilitaries or terrorists into the police is unacceptable and that a divided police force was unfeasible within such a small population.Statement issued by the Police Federation in response to the Patten Report, 9 September 1999, CAIN Web Service References External links * Police Federation for Northern Ireland website Category:European Confederation of Police Category:Police unions Category:Law enforcement in Northern Ireland Category:Police Service of Northern Ireland Category:Government of Northern Ireland Category:Society of Northern Ireland ","title":"Police Federation for Northern Ireland"},{"id":"24389644","text":"Indian Lake is a lake in Cass County in southwestern Michigan in the United States.

Hordern in collaboration with Frederick Duke of Richmond and Gordon, and built in 1936 by Heston Aircraft Company at Heston Aerodrome near London. The aircraft was planned to be manufactured and marketed by Hordern-Richmond Aircraft Ltd that was formed by the co-designers in April 1937. Construction was primarily wooden, with plywood skinned frames. The wings were cantilever, and could be folded outboard of the engines. The fixed main undercarriage legs were inline with the engines, with no brakes and a simple tail skid. The Autoplane was fitted with a control system by which all manoeuvres could be carried out using one hand. At the top of each of the normal control columns there was a small wheel which took the place of the more usual rudder bar or pedals. No wing flaps or pilot-operated trimmers were provided. Operational history Registered G-AEOG, an Authorisation to Fly was issued on 16 October 1936, and the Autoplane was piloted by Edmund Hordern on its first flight at Heston Aerodrome on 28 October 1936. It was based at Goodwood airfield after flight testing at Heston. It was owned by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon until 14 April 1938, and then by Hordern-Richmond Aircraft Ltd at Denham Aerodrome. The aircraft's colour scheme is believed to be as follows: Fuselage, fin, rudder and nacelles dark blue, lettering G-AEOG with a white outline. Wings and stabiliser silver with dark blue lettering. It was grounded during World War II. Hordern-Richmond merged with Lang Propellers of Weybridge, and a new factory was built at Haddenham, near Thame, Buckinghamshire. The engineless remains of the Autoplane were stored in the roof of the Haddenham factory, but further details of its fate are not known.http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&pagetype;=65&appid;=1&mode;=reg&fullregmark;=AEOG Specifications Notes References * Jackson, A.J. 1974.

The park comprises a hilly heathland south of the small town of Rebild, situated in the geographic region of the Himmerland on the peninsula of Jutland.Rold Skov and Rebild Bakker (The Rough Guide to Denmark) The forest of Rold Skov surrounds the hills on three sides, but the heathland is to be protected in its natural state. The Rebild Festival is held in the national park every 4 July. Rebild National Park is not included in the Danish National Park laws of 2007, but the heath is still to be protected and it can use the name National Park nonetheless. The park is one of two original national parks in Denmark, the other one being 'National Park Dybb√∏l Skanser' from 1924, now called 'Historiecenter Dybb√∏l Banke' (English: Dybb√∏l Banke Museum and History Centre).What is a Danish National Park? Danish Nature Agency Dybb√∏l Banke Museum and History Centre Rebild Bakker houses a number of museums.  History  The heaths of Rebild Hills (Danish: Rebild Bakker) was previously owned and used by the local peasants as pastures for their cattle, but it was bought up in the year 1911 and presented as a gift to the state of Denmark, to be administered on certain conditions (stipulations). The founder of the Rebild National Park was Dr. Max Henius, a Danish-American who emigrated to the United States in 1881 and settled in Chicago. In 1911, almost of the hilly countryside were bought with funds raised by Danish Americans. One of the Chicago-based Danish Americans included Jens Peder Poulsen Fuglsang, born in Virring Denmark in 1871. In 1912, Max Henius (accompanied by Fuglsang, whose name in Danish means \\"birdsong\\") presented the deed to the land to his Majesty King Christian X as a permanent memorial to Danish Americans. Sadly, Fuglsang died at sea aboard the ocean liner SS Oscar II on his return trip to America in August 1912. Later the Danish government added to the land, that now features a beautiful natural park.Max Henius (The Rebild National Park Society) The first Rebild Festival took place in 1912, when King Christian X spoke to a crowd of 10,000. The day has been celebrated every single year since then, with the exception of the periods during World War I and World War II. American sculptor Georg J. Lober created an emblem for the Danish National Park in Rebild in 1912 and also made a bronze relief of Abraham Lincoln located in Rebild Park.Society History (The Rebild National Park Society Inc) In 1925, Mindeparken was inaugurated in the city of Aarhus by King Christian X and it was planned to celebrate the Danish-American gatherings as well as visiting Danish citizens living abroad there. As the Rebild Festival gained momentum, Mindeparken was dropped and used for other purposes.  Stipulations  The park was given to the Danish state, as a present with three conditions: *That the area should remain in a natural state *That it would be open to the public *That Danish-Americans could celebrate American holidays at the park.  Current activities  Rebild National Park is the site of what is commonly believed to be the largest annual 4th of July celebration held outside the United States. Since 1912, The Rebild National Park Society Inc., a Danish-American friendship organization, has held a 4 July weekend festival that serves as a homecoming for Danish-Americans. This has helped make Rebild Park one of Denmark's major tourist attractions. The Rebild Festival traditionally features the hoisting of the U.S. and Danish flags while the two countries' national anthems echo in the surrounding hills. The annual Fourth of July celebration was the subject of the television documentary Rebildfest 1990, which featured actor Richard Chamberlain.Tourist information in Rebild (Tourist in Denmark)Fourth of July in Denmark (U.S. Senator Bill Nelson)Rebildfest 1990 (IMDb.com, Inc) Rebild National Park also houses an annual Christmas market on Advent Sunday with around 5,000 visitors.

Established in 1947, its members include those companies or individuals who employ or are eligible to use Land Mobile Radio Service (LMRS) two-way radios. They help manage radio frequency spectrum, perform engineering services, and prepare and certify applications for submission to the FCC. In 1997, FIT was certified to coordinate and file applications on behalf of all business and special emergency entities. History FIT was organized early in 1947 to represent the needs of the forest products industry to the Federal Communication Commission. The forest industry operates in remote regions where commercial wireless systems are not available; according to the FCC, this lack of coverage is one of the most commonly cited reasons for having a Private Land Mobile Radio (PLMR) system. Among the forestry industries, private radio service is chiefly used by the lumber and paper industries. In 1982, the United States Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934, permitting the FCC to certify private companies as frequency coordinators in order to develop and manage the Land Mobile Radio Service spectrum. FIT was among the pioneers using computer databases to manage LMRS frequencies. Until February 1997, private land mobile radio frequencies below 512 MHz were divided among ten separate radio services: the Industrial Radio Services (Power, Petroleum, Forest Products, Film & Video Production, Relay Press, Special Industrial, Business, Manufacturers, Telephone Maintenance) and the Land Transportation Radio Services (Motor Carrier, Railroad, Taxicab, Automobile Emergency). As part of a \\"refarming\\" initiative to use these frequencies more efficiently, the FCC consolidated these services into one Industrial/Business Radio Pool. As a former coordinator for the Forest Products pool, FIT could then coordinate frequencies throughout the Industrial/Business Radio Pool, along with the other former coordinators. In November 2001, Nextel Communications proposed that the FCC relocate certain users of the 800 MHz radio band to address interference problems between commercial users and public-safety radio services. Along with the National Association of Manufacturers, MRFAC (another frequency coordinator), the American Petroleum Institute, and others, FIT protested Nextel's proposal. FIT endorsed a \\"consensus plan\\" alternative. In 2004, the FCC extended FIT's frequency-coordination authority to the 929‚Äì930 MHz paging frequencies and the PLMR Special Emergency frequencies below 512 MHz. FIT was the only group to protest a proposal removing the FCC's rule against high-powered mobile repeaters in the Industrial/Business Pool frequencies below 450 MHz in 2010, citing concerns that without the rule, licensees might engage in a \\"power war\\", creating interference. The FCC understood, but did not share, FIT's concern.

Dolich has more than five decades of experience in the professional sports industry, including executive positions in the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB. Dolich was born on February 18, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Valley Stream South High School before receiving his undergraduate degree in government from American University in Washington D.C. Dolich then earned a master's degree in sports management from Ohio University. 1970s After earning his masters in 1971, Dolich worked for the NBA‚Äôs Philadelphia 76ers as the administrative assistant to the general manager from 1971‚Äì1974. He created the ‚ÄúYear of the Uniform‚Äù merchandising program and also served as the team‚Äôs promotional coordinator. The 76ers set an NBA record in 1972‚Äì73 going 9‚Äì73. This is the worst record in NBA History which stands to this day. From 1974‚Äì1976, Dolich served as the business manager of the Maryland Arrows of the National Lacrosse League. At the time, the Arrows were a new franchise in a start-up professional league, and Dolich ran the business and marketing operations. While Dolich was in Maryland, the Arrows were among the league leaders in attendance. Dolich then took his skills to the NHL, where he served as the director of marketing for the Washington Capitals from 1976‚Äì1978. With the Capitals, Dolich directed all aspects of the team‚Äôs marketing and sales affairs. He also negotiated and optimized the team‚Äôs relationships with radio and television rights holders. At the end of the decade, Dolich tried his hand and succeeded in the professional soccer world. He was the executive vice president and general manager of the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League. Dolich was with the Diplomats from 1978‚Äì1980, during which he ran the business and team aspects of the club. In his two-plus years, the team averaged more than 18,000 fans per game and Dolich created one of the league‚Äôs premier marketing organizations. Oakland Athletics (1980‚Äì1994) Dolich spent the next 15 years of his career with Major League Baseball‚Äôs Oakland A‚Äôs. When Dolich arrived in Oakland, the A‚Äôs ranked last in attendance in the league and Dolich was charged with rejuvenating interest in the team. In his first 13 years, Dolich increased season ticket sales from 326 to 16,000 and attendance from 850,000 to 2.9 million. Dolich was elevated to the position of executive vice president in 1993, and in this capacity he helped generate $58 million of annual revenue for the club. He was a member of the team‚Äôs executive council that was charged by ownership with running the business operation on a daily basis, as well as the lead negotiator in both corporate sponsor and broadcasting contracts. During this time, Dolich established relationships with wide variety of community-based organizations in the Bay Area. He was the team spokesperson in all business and marketing related matters with media and served on Major League Baseball Properties Board of Directors. Dolich's creative marketing campaigns, which included the now famous \\"Billy Ball\\" radio and TV ads, helped change the sports marketing landscape in the Bay Area. While Dolich was in Oakland, the A‚Äôs made three consecutive appearances in the World Series, including a sweep of the San Francisco Giants in 1989 to win the ‚ÄúBattle of the Bay‚Äù and the world championship. Life in California After leaving the Athletics, Dolich spent one year as the President/COO of the NBA‚Äôs Golden State Warriors, where he helped transition the team‚Äôs management group to new ownership. He was responsible for the team‚Äôs day-to-day operations, and repositioned the Warriors marketing, merchandising, community relations, game entertainment and arena operations. In 1995, Dolich took a step out on his own and opened a company, Dolich & Associates. The Alameda, California, based group worked in the business development side of the sports and lifestyle entertainment industry, emphasizing strategic planning, management, marketing, sales, promotions, public relations and career counseling. Clients included: Nike, the Oakland A‚Äôs, Seattle Mariners, San Jose Sharks, Questec, the 1994 U.S. World Cup, Cal Athletic Department, Stanford Athletic Department, Northern Virginia Baseball, Reno Air Races, Sun Microsystems, Cable Car Basketball Classic, America One, Ladies League Baseball, Ladbroke Racing and the Sacramento River Cats. Then, from 1998 to 2000, Dolich worked as the executive vice president for Tickets.com in Costa Mesa, California. At Tickets.com, he was responsible for developing and implementing the company‚Äôs multi-regional marketing and sales strategies. Vancouver/Memphis Grizzlies (2000‚Äì2007) In 2000, Dolich returned to the NBA to serve as the Memphis Grizzlies president of business operations.
