He was the first minister in Norwalk, and continued in charge of the settlement's church for forty-one years, until his death in 1693. In addition to his spiritual leadership, he also served as the civic leader and school teacher of the settlement.  Early life and family  He was born in Fremington (near Barnstable), Devonshire, England, on July 22, 1621, the son of Theophilus Jeffrey Hanford and Eglin Hatherly.  Life in America  His mother, Eglin Hatherly Hanford, with Thomas' sisters, Margaret and Elizabeth, departed from London aboard the ship Planter on April 8, 1635. They arrived in Boston on June 7, 1635. Thomas followed his mother at a later time in order to finish his studies in England. However, it appears that he did not finish in England, as he completed his studies in Massachusetts Bay Colony with Charles Chauncy, who later became the second president of Harvard University. By 1643, he was in Scituate, Massachusetts, which was founded by his mother's brother, Timothy Hatherly. He became a freeman of Massachusetts in 1650. In 1651 he went to Roxbury, to teach school. He taught for four months, but became discouraged by his students and quit in June 1652, citing ill health.New Haven Town Records: General Court for New Haven, November 14, 1651, November 17, 1651, March 11, 1651/2, and June 7, 1652.  Life in Norwalk  In 1652, Hanford, being \\"an orthodox and approved minister,\\" was invited to join the settlement at Norwalk as the first minister of the First Congregational Church. He was ordained in Hartford on May 18, 1654. The town gave him a lot of four acres, and built him a house. He was also given an island by a Winnipauk Indian named Sagamore, which today is called Sheffield Island. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.

While they wait for the new Emperor to return from his education, Whimbrel notices through his telescope, activity approaching from the East - a railway line is being built from the far off 'City of Scoffers'.

It is a long strip of land just east of the more famous Canadian Rocky Mountain parks, which is managed for industrial and economic goals, rather than aesthetic and conservation goals as in the parks. The area had been recommended for protection as early as 1896 when S. Dennis, the chief inspector of surveys for Department of the Interior, wrote a letter to the secretary of the department, stating that \\"the permanency of our water supply is largely dependent upon the preservation of the forests at present covering the watershed, and this protection can only be secured by prohibiting the cutting of the timber.\\"http://albertawilderness.ca/issues/wildlands/areas-of-concern/south- ghost/history Surveyor William Pearce was an early and influential advocate of preserving the region, and convinced the government to set aside a large part of the region from the agricultural settlement occurring elsewhere in the Canadian West. His continued efforts persuade the Canadian government, in 1902, to enlarge adjacent Rocky Mountain Park (later Banff National Park) to twice its modern size. The Rocky Mountains Forest Reserve was first created in 1910 by the federal government of Canada by privy council order #939http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/CulturingWilderness/#map32 to protect the headwaters of the rivers which supply most of the Canadian prairies with fresh water. Since its inception the area has always been managed to allow industrial activity, particularly logging and mining, with must less importance placed on recreational or conservation uses, in contrast to the neighbouring national parks. Nevertheless, water has been a recurring theme, with the protection of the headwaters always being the stated priority of government agencies. A 1911 report on the area by the Department of the Interior describes it as The size and shape of the reserve changed repeatedly and dramatically in its early years. In its original configuration in 1910 the forest reserve constituted two disconnected pieces of land, neither of which are part of the modern reserve: the more northerly part was north of Jasper National Park (today the Willmore Wilderness) and the southerly section was between Jasper Park and Rocky Mountain Park (today the northern third of Banff National Park). In 1911, Jasper and Rocky Mountain parks were reduced in size and the land transferred to the Rocky Mountains Forest Reserve. The reserve was expanded eastwards in 1913. In 1917 Rocky Mountain Park and in 1927 Jasper Park were greatly expanded at the expense of the reserve. In 1929 and 1930, the park boundaries were adjusted slightly giving the Kananaskis valley back to the reserve. With the passage of the Alberta Natural Resources Act, 1930 management of the parks and reserve became separated as all public lands (outside of national parks and military bases) in Alberta were transferred from the federal to the provincial government, including the reserve. Water management was still a shared responsibility until the 1970s, however. In 1948, the province designated all of its forested lands the \\"Green Area\\", including the eastern slopes. The provincial government did not enact legislation to formalize its management of the region as a forest reserve until the Forest Reserves Act of 1964, which provides \\"for the maintenance of water supply and the conservation of forests and other vegetation.\\" Since the provincial government acquired the reserve, its area has slowly been reduced as other land-use regimes have been established in various smaller parcels of the land, such as the Willmore Wilderness Park established 1950s, the three strict wilderness areas (Ghost River, Siffleur, and White Goat) established in the 1960s, the Kananaskis Country parks system established in the 1970s, and the numerous small parks and recreation areas along the David Thompson corridor established over several decades. In 1979 the McLean Creek watershed, along with the Ghost‚ÄìWaiparous farther north, were designated Forest Land-Use Zones (FLUZes) where off-road vehicles (ORVs) are permitted, and since that time ORV use in the area has expanded dramatically, causing groups such as the Ghost River Watershed Alliance and the public at large to express concern about stream-bed erosion and other disturbances.https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/province-makes-changes-to-preserve- public-lands-in-ghost-valley-1.3029833 References Category:Alberta's Rockies Category:Forests of the Rocky Mountains Category:Forests of Alberta Category:Land management Category:Hills of Alberta Category:Government of Alberta Category:Protected areas of the Rocky Mountains Category:Forest conservation Category:Protected areas of Alberta ","title":"Rocky Mountains Forest Reserve"},{"id":"42384323","text":"Freeport High School is a public high school in Freeport, Walton County, Florida, United States.Freeport High School website The school's mascot is the Bulldog.

He resigned in protest following the 2020 Beirut Explosion. Founder and president of the Independence Movement, member of the March 14 Coalition leadership, active participant of the 2005 Cedar Revolution as well as key precursor movements, including the Qornet Shehwan Gathering and Bristol Gathering. He is the son of former Lebanese President Ren√© Moawad, assassinated on 22 November 1989. Founding member and executive director of the Ren√© Moawad Foundation, and member of the Maronite Foundation in the World. Civic involvement further includes supporting employment and entrepreneurship in via initiatives such as FORAS: Fostering Entrepreneurship and Employment in North Lebanon and BIAT (Business Incubation Association in Tripoli), as well as several social initiatives to protect and ameliorate the conditions of underprivileged populations in Lebanon. Moawad is involved in a range of civic and social initiatives to stimulate Lebanese youth and ameliorate the conditions of underprivileged populations in the country. He is also founding member and the executive director of the Ren√© Moawad Foundation. Early life and education Moawad was born on 4 June 1972 in Lebanon. He comes from a notable Maronite family from Zgharta in northern Lebanon. Moawad attended the school at the College Notre-Dame de Jamhour in Lebanon, graduating from the French Baccalaureate program with honors in 1990. He completed his higher education in France, attending the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) and obtaining a master's degree in public law at Sorbonne University. Career =Political Involvement= Moawad is the founder and president of the Independence Movement, launched in 2005. The Independence Movement began as a grassroots initiative as part of the Cedar Revolution, before it evolved into a structured political organization that aims to defend Lebanese sovereignty, independence, democracy, state institutions, and liberties. The movement equally advocates human and economic sustainable development, reforms and modernization of state institutions, reinforcement of governmental transparency and accountability, as well as civic engagement and participation in public life. Moawad was actively involved in several key movements that paved the way towards the Cedar Revolution. He was a founding member of the Qornet Shehwan Gathering. This political opposition grouping formed in 2001 was the primary opposition force to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon affiliated with the Maronite Church, advocating Syrian withdrawal, full Lebanese independence and sovereignty, as well as the implementation of the Taif Accord of 1989. The group gathered key Christian figures, including Lebanese Minister Pierre Amine Gemayel, and Members of Parliament Gebran Tueni and Antoine Ghanem, all of which were assassinated for their political opposition. Moawad was a founding member of the Bristol Gathering in 2005, the largest multi-sectarian opposition bloc in the history of Lebanon at the time, formed following the illegal extension of former Lebanese President Emile Lahoud‚Äôs term imposed by the Syrian government. Key founding political groups included the Kornet Chehwan Gathering, the Free Patriotic Movement, the Progressive Socialist Party, and the Future Movement. Following the 2005 Cedar Revolution, Moawad joined the leadership of the March 14 coalition, participated in the Doha Conference of May 2008, that came as a result of the 7 May events that saw Hezbollah militarily invade the capital and parts of the Chouf area. The conference produced the Doha Accord to end an 18-month-long political crisis. Shortly after, Moawad ran as a candidate for the 2009 parliamentary elections on behalf of the coalition, attaining 47% of the vote in the Zgharta ‚Äì Zawye district. The Parliamentary Elections were postponed 3 times, over this course Moawad underwent various attempts to politically encircle him in the hope to limit his growing public influence, which were finally represented in the 2018 Elections where Moawad came in 2nd in Zgharta District and his party, the Independence Movement, cemented itself as the 4th largest power in the North 3 electoral sector (which includes Zgharta, Koura, Beshari and Batroun). Moawad's political involvement carries on his family's legacy. His father Ren√© Moawad was the first Lebanese president elected following the Taif Accord of 1989 that ended the Lebanese civil war. His presidency only lasted 17 days. He was murdered on Lebanese Independence Day, 22 November 1989. His assassination is widely believed to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government, however, no formal investigation has been undertaken until present. His assassination was a detrimental blow to national reconciliation, Lebanese sovereignty, and ushered in a 15-year Syrian hegemony. His mother Nayla Moawad went on to play a central role in championing women civic and political empowerment. She took on his father's position in the National Assembly and was then re-elected to that position in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2005. She then served as the Lebanese Minister of Social Affairs from 2005 until 2008. She is known for her opposition to Syrian hegemony as well as championing democratic values, civic liberties, woman empowerment, and human rights. Shortly after the 2020 Beirut explosions, on 9 August 2020, Moawad announced his resignation from parliament.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/hundreds-protesters-injured- anger-simmers-beirut-live-200808234355971.html Moawad was the seventh member of parliament to step down after the explosions. =Civic Involvement= Moawad's civic involvement began in 1997, co-leading a campaign named \\"Baladi, Baladati, Baladiyati\\" calling for municipal elections that had been suspended in Lebanon since 1964. A circulated petition gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures, in conjunction with events held across the country. The campaign succeeded in pressuring for local elections, held for the first time in 35 years in June 1998. In 1990, he cofounded the Ren√© Moawad Foundation and continues to act as executive director. The non-profit and non-governmental organization, named after his father, advocates a society built on democratic values, social justice, and national unity. The foundation is currently one of the most prominent Lebanese NGOs in agricultural, social, and economic development, including education, health care, and building individual and institutional capacities. The foundation's key activities include the Business Incubation Association in Tripoli (BIAT), a non-profit organization, launched by the Ren√© Moawad Foundation and the Chamber of Commerce of Tripoli, established with the assistance of the Integrated SME support program, a European Union funded project at the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade. The center's mission is to identify, incubate, host, assist, and promote growth potential sectors in north Lebanon. In 1993, Moawad participated in founding the Ren√© Moawad Foundation ‚Äì USA based in Washington DC, financing development programs in Lebanon. Annual fundraising initiatives gather high- profile members of the Lebanese diaspora and key American figures. Moawad sits on the board of the Maronite Foundation in the World, founded by former Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir under the patronage of the church, to engage the Lebanese diaspora in order to preserve their Lebanese patrimony by reclaiming their Lebanese identity and citizenship. In addition, Moawad has launched several social initiatives to protect and ameliorate the conditions of marginalized populations, including low cost distribution of academic materials to students, supporting registration fees for students in public and semi-private schools and restoring houses for underprivileged families in partnership with Habitat for Humanity. He is the founder and president of FORAS: Fostering Entrepreneurship and Employment in North Lebanon. The association is dedicated to enhancing and supporting Lebanese human resources, a central tenet of the country's economy, offering job seekers an interactive range of soft and professional capacity building and abilities strengthening programs, with the collaboration and participation of international and local academics, professionals, cultural centers, and training centers. Personal life Moawad married Marielle Kosremelli in 2000. They have four children together, Nayla, Rene, Yara and Malek.

Cohen from a script by Jane Murfin, based on the short story of the same name by George Kibbe Turner. The film starred Olive Borden and Morgan Farley, while the later-famed gossip columnist, Hedda Hopper played Borden's mother. Plot Judy Page is a young society girl who falls in love with an architect who works in her father's architectural firm, Dick Carroll. She lives in Greenwich Village in New York City, and one night after a party at her apartment, she runs off with Dick to get married. They are intercepted by Judy's mother at the apartment, who, not realizing they have already been married, insists that Judy return with her to their estate in the country. Dick remains behind in Judy's apartment. In the country, Judy is being courted by Tom Stribbling, who has insinuated himself to be close to Judy, at the expense of all other suitors. Dick learns that Judy's parents are going to be away, and visits Judy at her parents' estate. He has words with Stribbling, after which he makes plans to meet with Judy in the coming days at her apartment. When Tom learns of the meeting, he sends a telegram to Dick, forging that it is from Judy, cancelling the rendezvous. At the appointed time of the meeting, Stribbling shows up, instead of Dick. When Judy makes it clear she wants nothing to do with him, Stribbling attempts to force himself on her. In the ensuing struggle, Stribbling trips, falling out of Judy's window to his death. Just as Stribbling trips, Dick has arrived at the apartment, to witness his fall. Afraid that Judy will be blamed for Stribbling's death, Dick takes the blame, but the truth comes out during the brief police investigation, and Judy is cleared of any wrongdoing. Also during the investigation it is revealed that Judy and Dick are already married, much to the astonishment of her parents. After their initial shock, they give their blessing to the couple.

Sankara came to power in what was then the Republic of Upper Volta in a popularly supported 1983 military coup, and ruled until his assassination in a coup led by Blaise Compaor√© in 1987. There is a strong political dissonance between the movements which ascribe to Sankara's political legacy and ideals, a fact which the Burkinab√© opposition politician B√©n√©wend√© Stanislas Sankara ‚Äì no relation ‚Äì described in 2001 as being \\"due to a lack of definition of the concept.\\" The Sankarists range from communists and more moderate socialists to democratic socialism and populists. History During his time in power, Sankara ‚Äì a well-known war veteran noted for his charisma ‚Äì attempted to bring about what he called the \\"Democratic and Popular Revolution\\" (), a radical transformation of society. A number of organizations were formed to implement this revolution, among them the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals and the Pioneers of the Revolution. A vast number of reforms were enacted in the newly renamed Burkina Faso between 1983 and 1987, most of which were undone after the military coup which ousted and killed Sankara. Prior to his death, the Burkinab√© government faced significant allegations of human rights abuses from Amnesty International and other international organizations, including extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions and torture of political opponents. Even after the death of Thomas Sankara his legacy lived on, much due to his charismatic personal image. Sometimes dubbed the \\"Che Guevara of Africa\\" due to his similarities in style to the Argentinian revolutionary and the inspiration he took from the Cuban Revolution, Sankara became known for his frugal living, motorcycle riding, guitar playing, and opposition to the cult of personality, all personal traits which set him aside from contemporary African statesmen. For example, when asked why he didn't want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other leaders on the continent, he replied \\"There are seven million Thomas Sankaras.\\" Ideologically, Sankara was a pan-Africanist and anti-imperialist who sought to reclaim the African identity of his nation and opposed neocolonialism, and a communist who studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. One of the first groups to connect ideologically with the label of \\"Sankarism\\" was the Sankarist Movement, formed in exile in Paris only weeks after Sankara's assassination on 15 October 1987. Since then, self-identified Sankarist political parties and other organizations have been a common feature within the Burkinab√© opposition movement against the government of President Compaor√©. Many Sankarist leaders have a past in either Sankara's government or in the organizations he created. For example, Ernest Nongma Ou√©draogo ‚Äì leader of the Sankarist Pan-African Convention ‚Äì was Minister of Security under Sankara, and Sams‚ÄôK Le Jah ‚Äì leader of the Citizens' Broom () ‚Äì received his political education as a teenager in the Pioneer movement. The Sankarists have been prominent in both the 2011 Burkinab√© protests and the 2014 Burkinab√© uprising. The latter successfully overthrew President Blaise Compaor√© in late October 2014, forcing the leader to resign and flee the country to the Ivory Coast and causing a military takeover. Thomas Sankara has been cited as a major inspiration for the protesters, some going as far as dubbing the uprising the \\"Revolution 2.0\\" in reference to Sankara's \\"Democratic and Popular Revolution\\" during the 1980s. Sankarist organisations =Burkina Faso= Historical and current Sankarist groups include: * Burkinab√© Party for Refoundation * Burkinab√© Socialist Bloc * Convergence for Social Democracy * Convergence of Hope * Current of Democrats Faithful to the Ideal of Thomas Sankara * Democratic and Popular Rally * Movement for Tolerance and Progress * National Patriots' Party * Party of Social Democracy * Sankara Collective * Sankarist Democratic Front * Sankarist Movement * Sankarist Pan-African Convention * Social Forces Front * The Citizens' Broom * Union for Rebirth / Sankarist Movement * Union of Sankarist Parties =Abroad= The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is a Black nationalist, far-left political party in South Africa, founded in 2013 by Julius Malema, the controversial former President of the African National Congress Youth League. The party is currently the third-largest party in both houses of the South African parliament, receiving 1,169,259 votes and a 6.35% share of the vote in the 2014 general election. The EFF claims to take significant inspiration from Sankara in terms of both style and ideology. In a May 2014 column, the prominent EFF member Jackie Shandu declared his party a \\"proudly Sankarist formation\\". Expelled from that party, Andile Mngxitama founded Black First Land First in 2015, with black consciousness and Pan- Africanist policies and a Sankarist leadership ethos. Didier Awadi, a Senegalese hip hop musician and one of the most prominent rappers in Francophone West Africa, describes Thomas Sankara as his greatest inspiration politically. He has recorded several songs referring to Sankara, and visited the killed leader's family in Burkina Faso. In 2003 he formed \\"Studio Sankara\\", a music label and recording studio.

The values CPP stands for or the guiding principles of Nkrumaism today are those which have guided it throughout its existence. Social justice, Pan-Africanism, Self Determination, African Personality, Anti- Imperialism.\\" Nkrumaism is a syncretic ideology which blends different sources together while not necessarily borrowing their entire frameworks. In his work, Nkrumah blended different sources from within Africa, the canon of Western philosophy, and black intellectuals in North America and Europe, like Marcus Garvey and George Padmore. Particularly important in founding this ideology were his study and meetings with C. L. R. James, W. E. B. Du Bois and Father Divine. Aside from the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist framework, this blending of ideas largely only took bits and pieces of other philosophical systems and even its use of traditional African cultural concepts were often stretched to fit into the larger theory. While a major focus of the ideology was ending colonial relationships on the African continent, many of the ideas were utopian, diverting the scientific nature of the Marxist political analysis which it claims to support. Beliefs Like other African political ideologies at the time, the central focus of Nkrumaism was on decolonization across Africa. The central contention of Nkrumaism was that African countries, united with one another, needed to adopt socialist political structures which were consistent with the traditional African values of egalitarianism. In Nkrumah's idealized view, pre-colonial African societies did not have individual ownership or class structures, but instead were organized largely around the value of what Nkrumah called \\"communalism.\\" While colonial structures had damaged these communal, egalitarian values, they had not fully supplanted them. Nkrumism then argued that a return to these values through socialist political structures would both heal the disruption caused by colonial structures and allow further development of African societies. The pan-African aspects of Nkrumah's ideology were justified by a claim that all African societies had largely shared in the communalism prior to colonialism and that in the neocolonial structures that replaced formal colonies, only African unity would create real autonomy. In Nkrumah's argument, four basic pillars formed the applied aspects of this theory: state ownership of the means of production, a one-party democracy, fostering a classless economic system, and pan-African unity. While embracing much of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist philosophy and Soviet political structures at the time, the ideology differed in some key respects. First, while Marxism‚ÄìLeninism saw revolution as the only way to replace class structures with a socialist egalitarian system, Nkrumah saw reform as the more appropriate case for Africa. He argued that Ghana, and most of the rest of Africa, had never developed the class distinctions which Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin saw in Europe and thus reform could reestablish preexisting egalitarianism suited to a post-colonial context. Nkrumah wrote that: > From the ancestral lines of communalism, the passage to socialism lies in > reform, because the underlying principles are the same. But when this > passage carries one through colonialism the reform is revolutionary since > the passage from colonialism to genuine independence is an act of > revolution. But because of the continuity of communalism with socialism, in > communalistic society, socialism is not a revolutionary creed, but a > restatement in contemporary idiom of the principles underlying communalism. He would change this idea after the 1966 coup seeing revolution as increasingly necessary. Second, while Nkrumah believed in the materialism and economic determinism of Marxism, he argued that focusing on the economic system was only appropriate after achieving independence throughout Africa and that the political struggle was the first order in colonial and neocolonial contexts. Impact The ideology of Nkrumaism formed a key part of the personality cult around Nkrumah and the party-building efforts of his political party, the CPP. His arguments were widely published and these had an impact within the Gold Coast colony, independent Ghana, and other parts of Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. The CPP, founded by Nkrumah in 1949, became a vocal proponent for the teaching and application of Nkrumaism. When he became president in the 1960s, his Minister for Presidential Affairs, Tawia Adamafio, established study groups on Nkrumahism which many civil servants joined to advance their careers. At the same time, the CPP established Ghana Young Pioneers groups for school age children where Nkrumaism was taught. While the tenets were promoted through these various party efforts, applying all aspects of the ideology proved to be difficult for Nkrumah while President of the country. Because of this, some consider Nkrumaism to be \\"first of all a cultural phenomenon\\" in Ghana with little impact on the actual politics of the country. Criticisms Henry Bretton argues that Nkrumaism was not a coherent ideology, but a vague framework supporting the cult of personality and the centralized rule of Nkrumah. He writes: \\"Nkrumaism was a verbalization of the requirements of the personal political machine. Professional scribes and amateurs, along with the Ghanaian Left, were set to the task of providing the coherence and internal consistency required to give a semblance of philosophy to the chaotic assemblage of ideas and fantasies borrowed from all parts of the world and from all periods of history, frequently out of context.\\" In contrast, Yuri Smertin criticized early works by Nkrumah from a Marxist perspective for distorting scientific socialism by combining religious and traditional elements.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Joliette, Quebec. After the war she was transferred to the Chilean Navy in 1946 and renamed Iquique. She served with the Chilean Navy until 1968. Joliette was ordered in October 1941 as part of the River-class building program. She was laid down on 19 July 1943 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City and launched 12 November 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN on 14 June 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up at Bermuda, Joliette joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-1 at St. John's as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. In September 1944 she transferred to escort group EG 25 based out of Derry. Upon returning to Derry following her first round trip to Halifax, Joliette ran aground in Lough Foyle. The damage was significant and required five months repair at Belfast beginning 5 December 1944 and taking until 5 April 1945. After the extensive layoff, Joliette was sent to work up at Tobermory. She returned to Canada in June 1945 and was paid off 19 November 1945 at Sydney and placed in reserve at Shelburne. Postwar service Joliette was transferred to the Chilean Navy in 1946. She was renamed Iquique, for Iquique, Chile. She was the second ship to bear the name. Iquique carried the Chilean expedition to establish Captain Arturo Prat Base on Greenwich Island, the first Chilean base in Antarctica. She served with the Chilean Navy until 1966, when she was sold and scrapped in 1968. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Cape Malay slaves in Cape Town removed their teeth in order to oppose people who made use of slaves and potential enslavers. Slaves had their teeth inspected before being auctioned off. Pulling out ones‚Äô teeth was, therefore, an act of defiance amongst those who become known as Coloureds and has occasionally been done by White and Chinese South Africans in the area. Reception For many years, Cape Town residents had their upper front teeth extracted due to regional cultural fashion. A 2003 study performed by the University of Cape Town found that the main reasons for extracting teeth were fashion and peer pressure followed by gangsterism and medical purposes. The dental modification is particularly popular in the Cape Flats section of Cape Town. In an interview of 2,167 Coloured people in the Western Cape, 41% have had teeth extracted. Of those who have undergone the procedure, 44.8% were male. Children as young as 11 have had their front teeth extracted for aesthetics. Other reasons for a passion gap include the belief of improved oral sex and kissing. Another belief is that fishermen extract their teeth to whistle louder to one another. Though the practice is still popular in the region today, perception is changing. Some employers specifically forbid the display of a passion gap. History Dental modification in Southern Africa has been documented for 1500 years. Other forms of dental modification are more prevalent in the northern regions of Africa. Deliberate incisor removal in Western Cape remains an exception. During the mid-seventeenth century, slaves often removed their teeth as a means to \\"take back control of their own bodies\\". Medical implications While there are no specific medical problems caused by aesthetic dental extraction, the passion gap is described by anaesthesiologists in the region as a potential cause for difficult intubation.

He was Minister of Music and the Arts at the First Church of Christ in Wethersfield, Connecticut, where he co-founded the Albert Schweitzer Organ Festival USA and directed it from 1997 to 2015.  Life and career  A native of Austin, Texas, Spicer was a 1968 graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he was an Artist/Scholar under Alexander McCurdy and a devotee of Virgil Fox. Spicer received his first musical training from his parents, performing on the organ in church at the early age of eight. While at Curtis, Spicer was a classmate and friend of the organist colleague, Dr. Keith Chapman (organist for the famed John Wanamaker organ, center city Philadelphia, PA). Spicer also completed Graduate studies at Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wynnewood, PA. From 1967 to about 1982, Spicer was Organist-Choirmaster at the Wayne Presbyterian Church in Wayne, Pennsylvania. While at Wayne, Spicer helped to further the studies of future professional musicians, including: Diane Meredith Belcher (Organist), David Wetherill (principal Horn, Philadelphia Orchestra), Anne Martindale Williams (principal Cello, Pittsburg Symphony), Sally Nelson Kuhns (associate principal Trumpet, Oregon Symphony), Bob Hower (Trombone, University of Adelaide, Australia), and Jay Krush (Tuba and composer, Phila, PA). At the same time, two members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Donald McComas (associate principal Trumpet) and his wife, Sharlene McComas (Flute), were members of Wayne Presbyterian Church and often performed with Spicer as soloists and orchestral performers at Wayne. A gifted conductor, Spicer presented many oratorio concerts with orchestra throughout his career, including several premiere performances of: Verdi's Requiem, Berlioz's Requiem, Sir William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah Oratorio, and Gian Carlo Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors (among others). From about 1982 to 1986, Spicer was the Director of Music at the First Presbyterian Church in Lincoln, Nebraska, before he assumed the Wethersfield position in 1986. Also a teacher, Spicer mentored numerous younger organists, and held the distinction of having three of his students (including Diane Meredith Belcher) win full scholarships to his alma mater, the Curtis Institute of Music. Spicer trained and inspired hundreds of children and youth to perform in his church choirs. He prompted and demonstrated excellence at all times, while extracting the highest levels of performance from those he was teaching and conducting. Spicer regularly referenced the importance of diction and pronunciation while singing. Spicer emphasized the importance of phrasing and pauses in singing while maintaining long, open tones (where appropriate) in order to project sound effectively. He also referred to the hymn known as the \\"Old 100th\\" as being the \\"Old Tooth\\" (by merely placing a cross-bar across the number \\"1\\"). Spicer was extremely serious about music, and excellence in music, but he also liked to have fun, being an ever-present, jovial person. Spicer served on the faculty of Tunxis Community College in Farmington, Connecticut. In 1997, Spicer co-founded, with Harold Robles, the annual Albert Schweitzer Organ Festival USA. The festival competition attracts outstanding young organists, both high school and young professionals, from across the country. Spicer died of cancer in Malvern, Pennsylvania, on January 18, 2017. He was survived by his wife Dana and their blended family of seven children, sixteen grandchildren and two great- grandchildren. His wife, Dana, is a native of Wayne, Pennsylvania.

Linguistic evidence suggests he may have been from Bavaria and worked in Thuringia or elsewhere in northern Germany. Der j√ºngere Titurel survives in eleven complete manuscripts and about fifty fragments. It is a cohesive continuation in over 6,300 lines of Wolfram von Eschenbach's fragmentary Titurel, and builds on the love story of Sigune and Schionatulander found in his Parzival. It is \\"saga with a worldwide sweep encompassing an enormous cast of characters [and a] message of Christian virtue.\\" Throughout the poem Albrecht pretends to be the famed Wolfram, and for a long time modern scholars thought the latter was the author of Der j√ºngere Titurel. It is now recognised that seven stanzas‚Äîthe so- called Hinweisstrophen (reference stanzas)‚Äîreveal the author to be other than Wolfram and stanza 5883 even names him as \\"Albrecht\\". The dating of Der j√ºngere Titurel to the early 1270s is tentative and based largely on a fragment of a dedicatory poem, the so-called Verfasserfragment (author fragment). The late medieval writer Ulrich F√ºetrer regarded Albrecht as one of the greatest poets of the German language. He also identifies him as the author of the two lost works. Der j√ºngere Titurel was popular enough to be printed at Strasbourg in 1477. Ulrich's opinion of it was followed by most scholars, and it was often (erroneously) labelled the greatest accomplishment of Wolfram. In 1829 Karl Lachmann denigrated the poem while correcting its attribution. Its reputation remained low until the late twentieth century.

The body known as the Grand National Assembly (Bulgaria: –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ —Å—ä–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ - Veliko Narodno Subranie) was convened for a second time in Svishtov in order to consider the amendments to the constitution proposed by prince Alexander I of Battenberg. The proposed amendments were an echo from the Conservative's requests during the first constitutional assembly elections back in 1879. The amendments proposed included restricting civil liberties, reducing the size of the National Assembly, making the franchise indirect and introducing a state council. These amendments would, in effect, suspend the constitution and turn Bulgaria into an authoritarian dictatorship. Campaign At first the Liberal Party was not perturbed by the proposed amendments as they believed the Bulgarian people were opposed to them and stood behind the Liberal Party. Believing this would be reflected in the election results, the Liberal Party was confident it would dominate the new assembly. This confidence evaporated when Russia decided to back the prince during the election. Russian soldiers were available at the polls to \\"help illiterates\\" and to \\"preserve order\\", though they placed little restraint on pro-Battenburgist thugs who congregated around polling stations. Results Having \\"practiced all the latest modes of bulldozing known to the enlightened citizens\\", the pro-Battenberg conservatives were able to secure the majority they wanted. Only two electoral districts returned liberal deputies and not all of them reached the assembly. Aftermath On July 1 the GNA convened in Svishtov. The overwhelming conservative majority supported the constitutional amendments, taking less than two hours to pass all of them. The Prince Alexander had in effect carried out a coup d'√©tat. Following the coup, many infuriated liberals left Bulgaria. Battenberg's regime was weak from the get-go, however, as the real power was being absorbed by the two Russian generals dispatched from Saint-Petersburg, Leonid Sobolev and Alexander Kaulbars.

County boards of supervisors were asked to convene functional classification boards in order to review the classification all of the highway miles within each respective county. Control of roads that were classified as trunk roads or trunk collector roads were transferred to the counties, while roads classified as arteries or arterial collectors were transferred to the state department of transportation. The vast majority of transfers took place in 1980. Background The 67th Iowa General Assembly passed a bill in 1978 that changed how the state department of transportation (DOT) classified highways and how they were funded throughout the state. The bill enacted an existing framework for county boards of supervisors to create reclassification boards that could appeal to a state board if certain changes to the road network were not satisfactory. The state's road use tax fund, which is the mechanism for allocating funds to the different levels of government for different levels of road, had both its inputs and outputs modified. The general fuel tax was raised from for 1978 (equivalent to in ), and to for 1979 (equivalent to in ). The state was attempting to offset the effects the 1970s energy crisis and the 1973‚Äì75 recession which strained state budgets by reducing income due to reduced demand for gasoline and increasing inflation. The idea was for the DOT to save operational money by offloading minor highways to the respective counties. In 1979, Iowa had the 9th largest public road system in the United States with over of roadways, of which were primary highways, comprising Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways. State planners sought to offload nearly one-third of the primary system. Naturally, county officials, whose road budgets were similarly strained, balked at the idea. The Iowa Code provided a manner for determining the class of a particular highway. Each county was to appoint a three-member board, one of whom was to be a state DOT employee, one a county engineer or supervisor, and the other a municipal leader chosen by a majority of mayors in the county. The board was to classify each mile of roads and streets in the county into one of twelve categories. Only three categories applied to primary highways‚Äìfreeways and expressways, arterials, and arterial connectors. The freeway-expressway and arterial systems had limits on total mileage, , respectively. The only other requirement of the reclassification boards was to ensure network continuity between counties. Ultimately, these boards found about of minor highways that were on the primary system and of major highways on the secondary system. County officials were not keen on the idea of taking over more highway miles from the state when their own road budgets were tight. Clarke County officials sued the state classification board when it suggested the county take over an portion of U.S. Highway 69 (US 69). They felt the DOT was attempting to dump unwanted highway miles, which were also in poor condition, on a county unwilling to accept them. Some counties felt pressure to accept roads from the state that the DOT had not maintained adequately. Grundy County had some success by reclassifying some roads slated for transfer, such as Iowa Highway 214 (Iowa 214) into Wellsburg. That highway was reclassified as an arterial collector extension, keeping in spirit with an agreement it had with the DOT to maintain the highway until \\"Interstate 520\\" was built. Other counties had appeals heard at the DOT headquarters in Ames. Construction of new highways, such as Interstate 380 (I-380) would cause a chain reaction in other state highways. It was predicted in 1979 that opening I-380 in the Cedar Rapids area would cause Iowa 150 to lose its status as a primary highway because the route ran roughly parallel to the planned Interstate Highway's corridor. Indeed, when I-380 opened to traffic in 1984, Iowa 150 was rerouted away from Cedar Rapids over Iowa 101 to Vinton. One section of Iowa 150 along Collins Road in Cedar Rapids was still classified as an arterial connector; it became Iowa 100\\\\. One provision in the Iowa Code required whichever agency maintained a section of highway previously to either repair the highway in question or to pay an appropriate amount of money equal to the costs of repairing the road to the agency receiving the road. In Johnson County, state and county officials had difficulty reaching an agreement on a former segment of Iowa 1, by then renumbered Iowa 979\\\\. County officials wanted the state to take over County Road W66 (CR W66) from I-80 to the west overlook of Coralville Lake. The state countered with an offer to pay to upgrade Iowa 979 as well as have the county take over three other highways in the county. The two sides were not any closer 18 months later when the DOT was ready to open a new four-lane US 218 south of Iowa City. The routes for which no agreement could be made were ultimately kept by the DOT and assigned new route numbers, as was the case with Iowa 979\\\\.

Had it been built, it would have had the largest span of any airplane to date.Rose, Bill; Secret Projects: Flying Wings and Tailless Aircraft. Hinckley, UK: Midland Publishing, 2010. . The wing was of crescent form, similar to the British Handley Page Victor V-bomber, but unlike the British design it was tailless. Power was derived from the heat generated by a nuclear reactor and transferred to four jet engines where it would superheat the air passing through to provide thrust. The craft would be capable of staying airborne for long periods of time. At low altitudes the jets would burn conventional aviation fuel. In order to get airborne in the first place it required 182 additional vertical lift engines. Two variants were studied, a logistics support aircraft and an airborne aircraft carrier. The logistics support variant had a conventional heavy transport role, carrying hundreds of troops and their equipment to the battle zone. The airborne aircraft carrier could carry up to 22 fighter aircraft externally and had an internal dock capable of handling two air-to-ground shuttle transport aircraft.

These set of norms has been evolved with the consensus of political parties who have consented to abide by the principles embodied in the said code in its letter and spirit. The Model Code of Conduct comes into force immediately on announcement of the election schedule by the commission for the need of ensuring free and fair elections.http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/MCC- ENGLISH_28022014.pdf Its main purpose is to ensure that ruling parties, at the Centre and in the States, do not misuse their position of advantage to gain an unfair edge. It is designed to avert practices which are deemed corrupt under model code of conduct . For example, politicians should not make hate speeches, putting one community against another or make promises about new projects that may sway a voter. For the 2019 Indian general election the code came into force on 10 March 2019 when the Commission announced the dates and remains in force till the end of the electoral process. Highlights The main points of the code of conduct are: # The government may not lay any new ground for projects or public initiatives once the Model Code of Conduct comes into force. #Government bodies are not to participate in any recruitment process during the electoral process. # The contesting candidates and their campaigners must respect the home life of their rivals and should not disturb them by holding road shows or demonstrations in front of their houses. The code tells the candidates to keep it away. # The election campaign rallies and road shows must not hinder the road traffic. # Candidates are asked to refrain from distributing liquor to voters. It is a widely known fact in India that during election campaigning, liquor may be distributed to the voters. # The election code in force hinders the government or ruling party leaders from launching new welfare programs like construction of roads, provision of drinking water facilities etc. or any ribbon-cutting ceremonies. # The code instructs that public spaces like meeting grounds, helipads, government guest houses and bungalows should be equally shared among the contesting candidates. These public spaces should not be monopolized by a few candidates. # On polling day, all party candidates should cooperate with the poll-duty officials at the voting booths for an orderly voting process. Candidates should not display their election symbols near and around the poll booths on the polling day. No one should enter the booths without a valid pass from the Election Commission. # There will be poll observers to whom any complaints can be reported or submitted. # The ruling party should not use its seat of power for the campaign purposes. # The ruling party ministers should not make any ad-hoc appointment of officials, which may influence the voters to vote in favor of the party in power. # Before using loud speakers during their poll campaigning, candidates and political parties must obtain permission or license from the local authorities. The candidates should inform the local police for conducting election rallies to enable the police authorities to make required security arrangements.

It is politically known as \\"Central Cluster\\" in the West District of Makati. It is different from the civic center of Makati known as \\"Makati Poblacion\\" which is situated at the north-east portion of the district. It is bounded by EDSA, Gil Puyat Avenue, Arnaiz Avenue, and Chino Roces Avenue. The whole district occupies barangays of San Antonio, San Lorenzo, Bel-Air, and Urdaneta. Many of the skyscrapers in Metro Manila are in this area. PBCom Tower along Ayala Avenue, 259 meters high, is the country's tallest office building. It is the headquarters of the Philippine Bank of Communications, or PBCom. The business district is also considered as one of the most vibrant commercial districts in Southeast Asia. It contains the Ayala Center, one of the region's major shopping centers. The financial district is managed by two groups - the Makati Commercial Estates Association (MaCEA) and the Ayala Property Management Corporation (APMC).  History  = Pre-war period = Downtown Makati started out as part of the wide municipality of Santa Ana de Sapa (part of the City of Manila today) and became a town of its own in 1670, then as San Pedro de Macati in honor of its patron, Saint Peter. In 1851, Don Jos√© Bonifacio Roxas (a member of the Ayala- Roxas family) purchased the farm estate of \\"Hacienda San Pedro de Macati\\" from the Jesuits for 52,800 pesos. The western portion of the estate is now what is called the downtown. Since then, Makati and its development remain close to the Zobel de Ayala family. Plaque on the Nielson Tower, Ayala Triangle In 1901, the Americans declared the whole area south of the Pasig River, including the whole Hacienda San Pedro de Macati (Downtown), down to Barangay Ayala Alabang, a US military reservation; thus establishing Fort McKinley, which is now known as Fort Bonifacio. That same year, the whole town, with a population of 25,000, was incorporated from the then Province of Manila to the new province of Rizal with Marcelino Magsaysay serving as the town president. In the 1930s, the first airport in Luzon island, Nielson Field, opened in what is now the Ayala Triangle within the hacienda. The airport was officially inaugurated in 1938, and Philippine Airlines began its operations there in 1941. The tracks of what is now the Philippine National Railways reached the town very early in the decade, which is located at the western portion of the downtown at present, with three stations serving commuters and residents. = Postwar period = After the destruction of World War II that brought upon Makati, the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. As Nielson Field closed down in 1948 the plan was set for the building of the central business district. The first centrally planned communities from the Ayalas' farm estate were established in the 1950s. And some of the gated communities (Urdaneta, San Lorenzo, San Antonio, and Bel-Air Villages) that were developed grew into commercial areas and office parks. The multiple-lane Ayala Avenue was completed in 1958, which once part of the runway of the first commercial airport in the country, the Nielson Airport. The downtown was developed into high density residential and commercial areas according to specific zoning regulations. In the early 1960s, Ayala Corporation commissioned some of the first high-rise buildings to rise along Ayala Avenue from one of the country's best known architects, Leandro V. Locsin. The Makati Stock Exchange (MkSE) was established on May 27, 1963 with its trading area located along Ayala Avenue in downtown. Although both the MSE (Manila Stock Exchange) and the MkSE traded the same stocks of the same companies, the bourses were separate stock exchanges for nearly 30 years until December 23, 1992, when both exchanges were unified to become the present-day Philippine Stock Exchange. Downtown Makati has been the financial capital of the Philippines since the late 1960s, owing to congestion, relative lack of expansion area, that downtown Manila being almost fully built up, higher land prices & taxes and urban decay in Manila. The downtown district rapidly developed during the terms of town mayors Maximo Estrella, Rafael Ba√±ola and Jose Luciano, who encouraged the massive development of the town and welcomed foreign and local investors to what was tagged as the nation's number one municipality at that time. Ba√±ola's mayorship saw the building of the Ayala Center complex in the mid 1960s. = Martial Law era = Rufino Pacific Tower, tallest steel-framed building in the country, built in 1994 In 1972, Ferdinand Marcos imposed Martial law in the Philippines. The formal announcement of the proclamation was made in the evening of September 23. But the economic activity in the downtown was still ongoing, with Nemesio Yabut as the then town mayor, preparing the district for Makati's full integration as a part of the new region of Metro Manila (the National Capital Region officially) and as a founding member of the Metropolitan Manila Commission, which it achieved with the commission's formal establishment on November 7, 1975, ending Makati's many years as a town under Rizal Province. Following the assassination of Ninoy Aquino in 1983, the downtown area was one of the many places of rallies and mass demonstrations that were the basis of the People Power Revolution against the dictatorship of then-President Marcos in 1986. It was that decade that witnessed the emergence of a so-called moderate opposition, with the Makati Business Club, against Marcos' ailing authoritarian regime. Established in 1980, the MBC, a union of executives from business entities operating in the district, was then a voice of opposition to the dictatorship, and it was one of the leading organizers of what was then dubbed the Confetti Revolution, so-named due to the yellow confetti from torn phone directories thrown along Ayala Avenue from the buildings in the wide road, whenever the rallies would happen. =Late 1980s= After the death of Mayor Nemesio Yabut during the People Power Revolution, Corazon Aquino, Ninoy's widow and the country's first female president, appointed Jejomar Binay as the acting mayor of the town of Makati and was elected as mayor in 1988. Having spent his childhood in the municipality and himself a veteran of the Confetti Revolution and of the opposition activities during the Marcos administration, his first term bore witness to the events of the coup d'√©tat attempt in December 1989, which hit the district directly. =1990s = In the 1990s, the country's first skyscrapers started to rise here in the business district. The country's first skyscrapers that rose in the downtown are the Pacific Star Building, The Peak Tower, Pacific Plaza, and the Rufino Pacific Tower. By virtue of Republic Act 7854, passed by Congress in late December 1994 and signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on January 2, 1995, became the City of Makati. On February 4, 1995, the character of the new city was ratified in a plebiscite with 91% of voters in favor of cityhood. The whole people of Makati especially the businessmen in downtown celebrated the remarkable event. Ayala Triangle with the city's new slogan - \\"Make it Happen, Make it Makati.\\" =21st century= In the early 2000s, the downtown was a primary target of political rallies and terrorist attacks. On May 17, 2000 at 5:02 p.m., Glorietta inside Ayala Center was bombed injuring 12 persons, mostly teenagers. According to local authorities, the homemade bomb was placed in front of a toilet beside a video arcade. It was said to be the precursor of the May 21, 2000 SM Megamall bombing and the December 30, 2000 Rizal Day bombings. From August 2000 to January 2001, a wave of protests against the former president Joseph Estrada happened in the district. The anti-Estrada protests in Makati focused on Ayala Avenue, which cuts from EDSA to Buendia (now Gil Puyat Avenue). In 2003, The Oakwood mutiny took place in the Oakwood Premier (now Ascott Makati), within the Glorietta complex, and on 2007, the Manila Peninsula siege took place at The Peninsula Manila. Bith happened at the Makati CBD to call for former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to step down. The 2007 Glorietta explosion ripped through the Glorietta 2 on October 19, 2007. The death toll in the explosion was 11, while 120 were injured. Although there were conflicting reports as to the cause, it was concluded that the explosion was caused by a faulty liquefied petroleum gas tank located in a Chinese restaurant. In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and the power of United States financial institutions, spread from New York City to other parts of the world, including the Philippines. The movement's supporters' first action was held on October 14, when protesters marched in Makati City from the Ninoy Aquino monument on Ayala Avenue to the American Chamber of Commerce. The movement here in the country is called \\"Occupy Philippines\\", which has other protests held in the US Embassy and Rizal Park in Manila after the protest in Makati.

He worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture for over four decades, studying diseases of crop plants, and was a colleague of Orator F. Cook. He also made major contributions to the natural history of Central America and the West Indies, naming over 500 species of millipedes in total. He co-described with Cook the leggiest animal on earth: Illacme plenipes, with over 700 legs. Biography Harold Loomis was born in the Mertensia neighborhood of Farmington, New York in 1896. He worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1914 until his retirement in 1958, some 44 years, and was director of the U.S. Plant Introduction Station at Chapman Field, from 1931 to 1958. He was primarily involved in the production of natural rubber, and also worked on diseases of corn and cotton. He was a charter member of the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, and served many years on its board of directors. He also collected plants and lichen from the American southwest, often contributing specimens along with botanist Robert Hibbs Peebles. in 1939 Loomis described the tropical palm tree Astrocaryum alatum (\\"Coquillo\\"). His other area of research was in arthropods. Loomis was an honorary research fellow in entomology at the Smithsonian Institution, and an active research collaborator with the National Museum of Natural History, and Florida State Collection of Arthropods in Gainesville. Early in his career he began working with fellow botanist/entomologist Orator F. Cook. In 1919 Loomis accompanied Cook on an expedition to China to study crops as well as collect millipedes, and in 1928 Loomis and Cook described the millipede with the greatest number of legs known, Illacme plenipes of California. With individuals possessing up to 750 legs (375 pairs), Illacme has more legs than any animal known. Loomis later described another species from Panama with 700 legs. Loomis' specialty was in the millipedes of Central America and the Caribbean, and over his career he named more than 500 species, at least 127 new genera, 2 new subfamilies, and 9 new families, including Messicobolidae, Tingupidae, and Tridontomidae, with only a few taxa named with co-authors. He produced 64 scientific papers on arthropods and 50 on millipedes. The eminent myriapodologist Richard L. Hoffman wrote of Loomis: \\"(H)is monographs on the faunas of Hispaniola (1936) and Panama (1964) stand out as oases in a desert of chaotic short descriptive papers. His 1968 checklist of the Mesamerican species is beyond praise for its fundamental reference value.\\" p. 8 In terms of numbers of species described, Loomis ranks as one of the ten most prolific millipede taxonomists in history.

From the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 until the early 1990s, Chinese-foreign marriages were seen as outside the norm. While data from the PRC‚Äôs Ministry of Civil Affairs indicates that the number of couples registering a Chinese-foreign marriage in mainland China was almost ten times greater in 2010 than in 1979, the figures for registered Chinese-foreign marriages are still relatively small compared to couples registered in a domestic marriage. The data also suggests that most Chinese-foreign marriages are intra-national rather than international in character. An article published by Elaine Jeffreys and Wang Pan, ‚ÄòChinese-foreign Marriage in Mainland China‚Äô, in the University of Nottingham‚Äôs China Policy Institute Blog notes that ‚Äúthe most common type of Chinese-foreign marriage registered in mainland China until the late 2000s was between a mainland Chinese woman and a man from Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan.‚Äù The article also reveals that these types of marriages are more common in Chinese women than they are in men. The article states: ‚ÄúOver 8,000 women registered such a marriage in 1979. That figure rose to nearly 68,000 women in 2001 declining to below 40,000 in 2010, less than in the mid-1990s. The proportion of men from mainland China registering a marriage with a foreign bride in mainland China is low: 250 men in 1979, rising to a peak of around 20,000 men in 2005, and declining to less than 12,000 in 2010.‚Äù  Common types of Chinese-foreign marriage  The PRC‚Äôs marriage registration regulations divide Chinese-foreign marriages into three different categories: #marriage between PRC citizens (‰∏≠ÂõΩÂÖ¨Ê∞ë) residing in mainland China (ÂÜÖÂú∞Â±ÖÊ∞ë) and Overseas Chinese (Âçé‰æ®), i.e., Chinese citizens who reside in another country #marriage between citizens of mainland China and citizens of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, i.e., territories that the PRC government claims as part of China, but which have separate legal jurisdictions; and #marriage between citizens of mainland China and foreign nationals (Â§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫, literally people from another country), which may include former PRC citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship (Â§ñÁ±çÂçé‰∫∫). Attributing factors New opportunities created by China‚Äôs rapid economic growth have been a significant factor in shaping the nature of Chinese-foreign marriage in mainland China over the recent years. Since the advent of Chinese- foreign marriages, most have been registered in provinces and cities, on China‚Äôs eastern seaboard, with an early history of economic development, such as Guangdong (nearly 370,000 marriages in total); Fujian (nearly 227,000); Zhejiang (around 57,000), and Shanghai (nearly 63,000). Geographically, these provinces are close to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and have had relatively long history of trade connections. Similarly, the northern provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin, and the city of Beijing have also recorded substantial numbers of registered Chinese-foreign marriage between 1979 and 2010. During this period, there were around 53,000 Chinese-foreign marriages registered in Heilongjiang, 50,000 in Jilin, and 20,600 in Beijing. This is attributed to the close geographic proximity of these areas to economic powerhouses, such as Japan and Korea. In contrast, the number of Chinese-foreign marriages registered in the economically undeveloped areas of western China is negligible. Jeffreys and Wang (2014) highlight that between 1979 and 2010; around 1,900 Chinese-foreign marriages were registered in the province of Gansu, 690 in Ningxia, 360 in Qinghai, and 200 in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Despite these marriages being classified as \\"Chinese-foreign marriages\\", the above data suggests that they are intracultural, rather than, international in nature. In his article The rise of international marriage and divorce in contemporary Korea, Professor Doo-Sub Kim (2010) gives weight to this observation by highlighting the surge in cross-border marriages registered in South Korea between Chinese and South Korean nationals. Between 1990 and 2005, there was an increase of over 35,000 cross-border marriages registered in South Korea, with China becoming the main sending country for such marriages by the mid-1990s. According to the Ministry of Justice, Republic of Korea, the majority of these marriages are between Korean men and Han Chinese women.

Kondiah Raju (7 November 1898 ‚Äì 27 July 1976) was a popular Calendar artisthttp://www.asianart.com/exhibitions/body_city/culture.html well known for his depictions of Hindu Gods and Goddesses in a typical style, amalgamating the features of contemporary calendar art and traditional South Indian paintings. He reached the peak of his fame during the heyday of the lithographic printing presses in Sivakasi. Kondiah Raju has an important place in the evolution of Indian Calendar art, which gained popular attention with Ravi Varma and continued on through artists such as S. M. Pandit, Mulgaonkar and others in the 20th century. In addition to his painting skills he also displayed a spiritual streak, as also a starkly austere simplicity, that prompted many of his students to call him an 'artist-saint'. Brief Biography Kovilpatti Kondiah Raju was born on 7 November 1898 in a house at Malaiya Perumal Koil Street, Mylapore, Chennai to a family of traditional artisans. His father C. Kuppaswami Raju was a Siddha medical practitioner. Before his death in 1912, Kuppaswami made arrangements for the young Kondiah Raju to learn the traditional skill of the Raju community - Religious painting. Kondiah Raju initially learnt painting from several teachers, including Murugesa Naiyakar and N. Subba Naidu, a well known artist from Madurai. In 1916, Kondiah Raju joined the Government School of Arts and Crafts. In 1920, he joined the Ramana Maharishi Ashram at Thiruvannamalai, further evidence of his spiritual trait that would characterise his near nomadic life and resurface time and again in him. Kondiah, after leaving the Ashram, joined a \\"village drama\\" troupe, (or boys' company as they were called in those days of all Men drama troupes). A commercial advertisement for Ganesar Mark Soda painted by C. Kondiah Raju Eventually, Kondaiah Raju and his group began to work for the newly set up litho printing presses of Sivakasi. His Gajendra Motcham, Meenakshi Kalyanam and many other religious prints are considered unrivalled masterpieces and continue to adorn the puja rooms of South Indian households and smaller shrines across the Tamil country. So pervasive are his prints that many South Indians would visualise and recognise not only the many deities, but also leaders of the Indian freedom movement,Bharat Mata India's Freedom Movement in Popular Art by Erwin Neumayer published by Oxford University Press contemporary political leaders and other important personalities only as depicted in his prints. His prints have been collected internationally and are even archived in the Victoria and Albert Museum,https://collections.vam.ac.uk/name/kondiah-raju-c/280/ H. Daniel Smith Poster Archive, Syracuse University library.http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/s/smith_poster.htm#otherfindaid When Kondiah Raju died on 27 July 1976, his pupils spoke of him with awe, calling him an 'artist-saint'. Contemporary media accounts of his death describe him as a 'Brahmachari whose students were like his children'. Though he had earned a fortune through his artistic commissions, he never married, distributed his wealth to others, and lived a simple life like a saint with one shirt, one veshti and one towel. In 1971, he would even turn down an offer to travel to Chennai to receive a Government award recognising his contributions to art. Career Kondiah Raju painted for most of the printers in Sivakasi and Madurai including the Sri Kalaimagal Industries,Studies in Hindu and Buddhist Art edited by P. K. Mishra, Abhinav Publications Madurai; Coronation Litho Works, Sivakasi; Premier Litho Works; Sivakasi.https://sites.google.com/site/kondiahraju/home Sivakasi, which is only a few kilometres from Kovilpatti, had its first lithographic printing press in the mid fifties. By 1979, Sivakasi would have 350 photo-offset machines and more than 1000 litho and letter press units in operation. Thanks to the untiring efforts of the Nadar industrialists' community Sivakasi had been transformed from a humdrum village-town to a major industrial centre, prompting the sobriquet - 'India's Little Japan' (Kutti Japan' in Tamil).Gods in the Bazaar: The Economies of Indian Calendar Art by Kajri Jain published by Duke University Press Kondaiah Raju and his students reaped the rich benefits of their proximity to Sivakasi. His paintings were also printed in many of the Tamil magazines and Deepavali malars (special issues). His latter years were spent in Kovilpatti, Tamil Nadu where he established the \\"Devi Art Studio\\". The Studio in addition to paintings would also involve itself in Photography. Kondiah Raju had a number of pupils who assisted him and would automatically sign in their master's name on all their works during their training. Many like T. S. Subbaiah continued to sign Kondiah Raju's name above his own, even after becoming an established artist and even after the death of his master! His most popular students were M. Ramalingam, T. S. Arunachalam, T. S. Subbaiah, S. Parani Chittar who would establish themselves as master artists in their own right. In addition to the popular religious calendar art Kondiah Raju and his students continued to paint for advertisements, name boards, etc. for many shops and establishments in and around Kovilpatti. T. S. Arunachalam who later took over the studio was well known for \\"photo retouching\\" a skill that was important for recycling popular designs in the lithographic printing industry. Many other students of Kondaiah Raju would open studios of their own, dealing in paintings and photography. Influences His depictions were mostly influenced not only by Ravi Varma's compositions of the Gods and Goddesses but also by the popular art of Tanjore painting in which his community, the Rajus of Tanjore and Tiruchi had distinguished themselves. The Rajus who had migrated to Tamil Nadu from Andhra under the patronage of the Nayaka kings, had popularised painting techniques related ceiling and wall paintings in temples, decoration of processional , modelling of stucco sculptures on temple and . The Rajus along with the Naidus were also known for their paintings and portraits on wooden panels, glass and mica with delicate gesso work highlighted by gold foils and semi-precious gems. These paintings which would be called Tanjore paintings were not only characterised by the rigorous canons of traditional iconography but also by Islamic artistic techniques and European fashions. Though many of Kondiah Raju's paintings bear a resemblance with Ravi Varma's paintings, he went further in his treatment of religious subjects by emphasising characteristics of the main subject in line with the depictions in temple and traditional Tanjore paintings. His calendar art unlike Ravi Varma or any other artist, was in a style quite reminiscent of the traditional iconic and formal representation of deities in South Indian paintings as opposed to the western fashion adopted by Ravi Varma or S. M. Pandit. In Kondiah's paintings the central deity is emphasised by providing it a well-lit, central and prominent position and relegating the surroundings to static objects like pillars, lamps, etc. Further it should also be remembered that Kondiah Raju like his forebear Ravi Varma was compelled to stick to not only the canonical iconography traditionally prescribed for the Hindu divinities but also cater to the tastes of the burgeoning Indian middle classes.http://www.tasveergharindia.net/cmsdesk/essay/97/index_1.html In another major innovation, he would with his students herald the introduction of German tempera colours in lieu of oil colours for painting in South Indian calendar art. Subsequently, the introduction of Camlin watercolours would ensure that the artist could execute his paintings with greater speed and ease.

Doran is an American politician who was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1981 to 1995. He later worked as a bank executive and math tutor. In 2014 he pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and served 3 years in prison; he was scheduled to finish his sentence in 2017. Early life Doran was born on March 26, 1956, in Boston. He attended Lexington High School, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the London School of Economics. Political career Doran began his political career as a Lexington Town Meeting Member in 1975. In 1978 he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent state representative Lincoln P. Cole. In 1980 he defeated Cole to become the representative for the 15th Middlesex District. During his freshman term, Doran was an active participant in the House budget debate. At the beginning of his second term, Doran was a leader of a bipartisan coalition of more than fifty representatives who sought to reform the House rules. Their proposed changes included limiting sessions to the hours between 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., requiring that agendas be published for all formal sessions, that all conference reports be distributed 24 hours before floor action, and allowing television and radio journalists to broadcast formal House sessions. He also was a leading supporter of overhauling the prevailing-wage law, which required the Commonwealth and municipal governments to pay union wages on contractual jobs, such as construction or snow removal. While serving in the House, Doran had a parking lot concession in Cape Cod and spent most of the summer running it. =Ethics Committee= In 1989, Speaker George Keverian chose Doran to chair the House Ethics Committee. In 1990, the committee chose to take no action against Keverian after he admitted to hiring subordinates to do remodeling work on his house and accepting free rugs from a legislative vendor. The committee concluded that the conflict of interest law Keverian admitted to violating does not exist in the House ethics code and therefore took no disciplinary action against him. In 1991, the committee voted 6 to 5 to remove Kevin Fitzgerald from his position as majority whip for having accepted a $200,000 inheritance from a troubled homeless woman. Doran sided with two other Democrats and three Republicans in favor of sanctioning Fitzgerald. In 1994, the committee was on the verge of recommending the expulsion of representative John McNeil due to charges that he solicited sex from one of his former interns. However, Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger and US Attorney John Pappalardo requested that the committee suspend its work due to fears that taking testimony from witnesses during a quasijudicial hearing could jeopardize their cases (which included extortion, bribery, money laundering, and mail fraud) against McNeil. Post-political career In 1994, Doran chose not to run for reelection and instead entered the banking industry as a vice president at Fleet Mortgage, a subsidiary of Fleet Financial Group. At Fleet, Doran oversaw the company's New England mortgage operations. In August 2012, Doran began working as a math tutor at MATCH Public Charter Middle School in Jamaica Plain. He was later diagnosed with stage three melanoma and began chemotherapy. =Methamphetamine trafficking= On May 21, 2013, Doran received a package at the school. State Police, acting on a tip, detained Doran on the street and obtained the package from the school front desk. The package contained two heat-sealed baggies containing 480 grams of crystal meth. Authorities then obtained a warrant to search Doran's home. There they found an additional 38 grams of meth, about $10,000 in cash, and a digital scale and other items consistent with drug distribution. He was arrested on charges of trafficking methamphetamine and violating the state's law against drugs in a school zone. The drugs had a street value of about $50,000 On March 31, 2014, Doran pleaded guilty to trafficking in methamphetamine and money laundering. He was sentenced to three years in prison followed by two years of probation. According to one of his defense attorneys, Doran was a \\"terrible addict\\" who had sought treatment and been substance-free since his arrest. Due to the similarities, Doran's case has been compared to the television show Breaking Bad and Doran has been compared to its protagonist, Walter White. Like White, Doran was a teacher who began dealing crystal meth after being diagnosed with cancer. Both men also underwent chemotherapy and are bald as a result.

Hassall opened the first Sunday School in Australia in 1813 in his father's house at Parramatta.  Early life  Thomas Hassall was born in Coventry, London , the eldest son of missionaries Rowland and Elizabeth Hassall. He sailed with them as a three- year old to Tahiti aboard the ship Duff in 1796 with missionaries approved by the directors of the recently formed London Missionary Society. Fifteen months later the Hassall family with Thomas and younger brother Samuel, sailed to the newly founded settlement of New South Wales, arriving in Sydney on 14 May 1798 aboard Nautilus. The Hassall family settled in Parramatta during which time the missionary's eldest son, Thomas, came to the attention of the Reverend Samuel Marsden. Initially Thomas was employed as a clerk in the offices of Sydney merchant Robert Campbell and afterwards Captain James Birnie. However Thomas Hassall gained success in establishing the first Sunday school in Australia for children in his father's house at Parramatta and Marsden recommended the young man enter the ministry.  Sunday School Movement  Thomas Hassall opened up the family home on the corner of George and Charles Street Parramatta to Sunday school classes in May 1813 initially to a small group, including convict children. Thomas requested permission from Marsden to accommodate the school at St John's church Parramatta as numbers continued to grow. There were more than 200 children including Aboriginal children. Teachers included Thomas‚Äô father, Rowland Hassall, and Rev. Marsden's children Ann, Elizabeth and Charles Simeon Marsden. Thomas Hassall then formalised the Sunday school movement with ‚Äúrequirements and rules‚Äù established and printed for the guidance of teachers.  Training for the Ministry in Wales  Having resolved to enter the Ministry, Hassall sailed for England in the Kangaroo in 1817, to undergo his training, the first Australian candidate for ordination. Hassall studied at the Diocesan College, Lampeter, Wales under the direction of Principal Rev Dr. Williams. Hassall was ordained deacon by Dr Howley the Bishop of London on 15 April 1821, and ordained priest three months later by the Bishop of Ely in June 1821. Receiving his appointment as Colonial Chaplain, Hassall returned to NSW arriving in Sydney aboard the convict ship Mary in January 1822.  Life and Ministry in New South Wales  = Parramatta = Thomas Hassall took up his position as Rev Marden's curate at St John's Parramatta, preaching his first Australian sermon there on 3 February 1822. He married Marden's eldest daughter Anne Marsden on 12 August 1822 and continued as his curate until 1824. = Port Macquarie = In June 1824 Hassall was appointed chaplain to the penal settlement of Port Macquarie. Rev Marsden corresponded with Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane encouraging the appointment. = Bathurst = In 1826 Hassall was appointed to the Bathurst district. Living on his property Lampeter farm at O‚ÄôConnell Plains he rode every Sunday to the town of Bathurst to hold Church services, returning in the evening to preach at ‚ÄòSalem Chapel‚Äô which he built in close proximity to his residence. = Cowpastures = In 1827 Hassall was appointed to the new parish of Cowpastures which he described as ‚ÄúAustralia beyond Liverpool‚Äù. This was to be his centre of operations for the remainder of his life. At this time Hassall purchased Denbigh estate at Cobbitty which became his headquarters. Here be built Heber Chapel in 1828 which served for many years until St Paul's Cobbitty was established in 1842.

Early life  Damaji, also known as Damaji II, was the third son of Pilaji Rao Gaekwad. His father Pilaji was an adopted son of Damaji I, who had received the hereditary title Shamsher Bahadur from Chhattrapati Shahu. Pilaji himself had received another hereditary title, Sena Khas Khel.  Rebellion against the Peshwa  The Gaekwads were originally lieutenants of the Dabhade family, the Maratha chiefs of Gujarat and holders of the senapati (commander-in-chief) title. In 1731, Trimbak Rao Dabhade was killed for rebelling against Peshwa Baji Rao. The Peshwa allowed the Dabhades to retain their title and territories in Gujarat, on the condition that they would remit half of their revenues to the Maratha Chhatrapati's treasury. His minor brother Yashwant Rao Dabhade was appointed as the senapati, with his mother Umabai Dabhade exercising the executive powers. Pilaji, and after his death in 1732, Damaji held the actual military power as Yashwant Rao was a minor. Even as he grew up, Yashwant Rao got addicted to alcohol and opium, and Damaji gradually increased his power during this time. Umabai initially pretended reconciliation with Peshwa Bajirao, but maintained a grudge against him for killing her son. After Bajirao's death, she pleaded with the new Peshwa Balaji Rao, to release the Dabhades from the revenue-sharing covenant. When he refused to do so, she sided with Tarabai in a rebellion against the Peshwa. When Balaji Baji Rao left for the Mughal frontier, Tarabai imprisoned Chhatrapati Rajaram II and Umabai dispatched Damaji Gaekwad with a 15,000-strong force to support her. On 13 March, the Peshwa loyalist Trimbakrao Purandare set out from Pune to intercept Damaji. His force was shortly supplemented by contingents led by Balwantrao Mehendale and Bapuji Retharekar, and grew into a 20,000-strong army. Despite being numerically inferior, Damaji's army defeated them at Nimb, a small town north of Satara. A victorious Damaji then reached Satara, where he was received by Tarabai. However, Trimbakrao re-formed his army. On 15 March, he launched a fresh attack on Damaji's troops, who were encamped on the banks of the Venna River. Damaji was defeated in this battle, and forced to retreat with heavy losses. Trimbakrao continued pursuing him, eventually trapping him a gorge in the Krishna River valley. Meanwhile, the Peshwa returned from the Mughal frontier, and joined Trimbakrao. Damaji's Maratha troops deserted him, while his Gujarati troops lost hope in an unfamiliar locality. He was, therefore, compelled to declare ceasefire and meet Peshwa to discuss the terms of a peace treaty. The Peshwa demanded half of Gujarat's territories in addition to a war indemnity of 2,500,000. Damaji refused to sign an agreement, stating that he was only a subordinate, and asked Peshwa to consult Umabai. On 30 April, the Peshwa launched a surprise evening attack on Damaji's camp, which surrendered without resistance. In May 1751, the Peshwa arrested Damaji Gaekwad and his relatives, and sent them to Pune. Sometime later, the Dabhades were also arrested, and deprived of their jagirs and titles. In Pune, the Peshwa repeatedly pressurized Damaji to cede half of Gujarat on behalf of Yashwant Rao Dabhade. Damaji kept refusing, and on 19 July 1751, the Peshwa placed him and his dewan Ramchandra Baswant in strict confinement. On 14 November, he sent them to a captivity in Lohagad. A few weeks later, Ramchandra Baswant managed to escape and reached Gujarat, where he met Damaji's relatives at the Songadh fort. The Peshwa put Damaji in iron chains at Lohagad, and sent a force under his brother Raghunathrao to Gujarat. Raghunathrao managed to recover revenues from Surat, but could not advance north of the Tapti river. Meanwhile, the Peshwa suffered setbacks in some other battles, and decided to seek reconciliation with the Gaekwads.  As the Maratha chief in Gujarat  Damajino Dero, a memorial dedicated to him located at Savli, Gujarat In March 1752, Damaji finally agreed to abandon Dabhades in favour of the Peshwa. In return, he was made the Maratha chief of Gujarat, and the Peshwa offered him assistance in expelling the Mughals from Gujarat. Gaekwad promised to pay an annual tribute of 525,000 to Peshwa in addition to a one-time payment of 1,500,000. He was also asked to maintain a cavalry of 20,000 horses in service of the Peshwa. The Dabhade family was respectfully removed from power, and provided an annual maintenance expense by Gaekwad. On 10 December 1752, Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao dispatched an army from Pune to Gujarat, under the commandment of Raghunathrao. This army was joined by Damaji's troops, resulting in the formation of a 50,000-strong Maratha army. The Marathas sieged Ahmedabad, where the Mughal Governor Jawan Mard Khan Babi put up a strong defence. Babi surrendered Ahmedabad in March 1753 after a long siege. The Peshwa appointed Shripatrao Bapuji as the Governor of Ahmedabad; a part of the city was given to Damaji. In July 1756, the Nawab of Cambay Momin Khan invaded Ahmedabad with Mughal support, while Shripatrao was away in Pune. The Peshwa sent a force led by Sadashiv Shenvi, which regained control of Ahmedabad with Damaji's help. Subsequently, the town remained under the Marathas until the First Anglo- Maratha War. The British later handed it over to Damaji's son Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad after the Treaty of Salbai in 1782. He died at Patan on 18 August 1768.

United States, 572 U.S. 93 (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a railroad right-of-way granted under the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 is an easement. Therefore, when a railroad abandons such a right-of-way, the easement disappears, and the land owner regains unburdened use of the land.  Background  = Historical context = From the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, the United States rapidly expanded westward. Responding to the California Gold Rush, Congress took steps to encourage the development, settlement, and full possession of the West. Doing so required reliable, efficient ways to transport people and property to and through them. Congress therefore passed numerous acts encouraging railroad development.Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, From 1850 to 1871, these acts typically allocated rights-of-way to specific named railroads. These rights-of-way were initially construed as an \\"absolute\\" grant in \\"both the fee and possession\\".Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Roberts, Later they were construed to convey \\"a limited fee, made on an implied condition of reverter\\" to the United States if the railroad stopped using the land for railroad purposes.Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Townsend, Public opinion began to turn against these generous grants in the late 1860s. By the 1870s, legislators instead preferred to reserve public lands for settlers.Marvin Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States, An 1872 House resolution endorsed the change: > Resolved, that in the judgment of this House the policy of granting > subsidies in public lands to railroads and other corporations ought to be > discontinued, and that every consideration of public policy and equal > justice to the whole people requires that the public lands should be held > for the purpose of securing homesteads to actual settlers, and for > educational purposes, as may be provided by law.Cong. Globe, 42nd Cong., 2d > Sess., 1585 (1872) Starting in 1871, Congress began granting specific railroads right of way through public lands, with no accompanying land subsidies. The passing of railroad-specific legislation ended with the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875, generalizing the process to any qualified railroad.General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875, 8 Stat. 482, 43 U. S. C. ¬ß¬ß934‚Äì939 The 1875 Act's provisions for issuing new rights of way remained in effect until repealed in 1976.Federal Land Policy and Management Act, ¬ß706(a), 90 Stat. 2793 = Facts = In 1908 the Laramie Hahn's Peak & Pacific Railway Company acquired a right-of-way under the 1875 Act. LHP&P; finished construction of a railroad along this right-of-way in 1911. In 1976 Melvin and Lulu Brandt received a land patent from the United States for 83 acres in Fox Park, Wyoming within Medicine Bow National Forest. The patent conveyed fee simple title to the land, with several reservations. One reservation preserved LHP&P;'s right of way, stating the land grant was: > SUBJECT TO those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted to the > Laramie Hahn's Peak & Pacific Railway Company, its successors or assigns by > permit Cheyenne 04128 under the Act of March 3, 1875, 43 U.S.C. 934‚Äì939. The railroad ultimately passed to the Wyoming and Colorado Railroad, who formally abandoned it (including the portion through Brandt's property) in 2004. The Forest Service proposed constructing what would later become the Medicine Bow Rail Trail along the right-of-way in 2005, and in 2006 the United States filed suit to quiet title to the right-of-way in its favor. The United States resolved its claims against all land owners but Brandt along the right of way. Marvin Brandt (Melvin Brandt's son), represented by the Mountain States Legal Foundation, disputed the government's claim and filed a counterclaim on behalf of the family trust that owned the land. Brandt asserted that the railroad's right-of-way was an easement that had disappeared when the railroad abandoned it, leaving his land no longer burdened by the easement. The United States argued in response that the right-of-way instead reverted to the United States when abandoned by the railroad. = In lower courts = The District Court granted summary judgment to the United States. It acknowledged a circuit split among the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and the Court of Federal Claims on the question of whether 1875 Act rights of way reverted to the United States on abandonment. The court, residing within the Tenth Circuit, then followed that circuit's precedent, ruling against Brandt and quieting title in the United States.2008 WL 7185272 (D Wyo., Apr. 8, 2008) (unpublished), reproduced at 10-56 in Petition for Writ of Certiorari. On appeal the Tenth Circuit affirmed. The court of appeals also acknowledged the circuit split while adhering to circuit precedent. Brandt petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The United States in response argued that the lower courts were correct, but the Court should nonetheless hear the case to resolve the circuit split. On October 1, 2013, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.  Supreme Court  = Opinion = Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts held that the railroad rights-of-way granted under the 1875 Act are common law easements, which upon termination leave the underlying land unburdened. Roberts observed that the United States lost its case largely because it had successfully argued in Great Northern Railway Co. v. United States, , that 1875 Act rights of way were easements. In that case Great Northern had wished to drill for oil and gas upon its right of way. At the Supreme Court, the United States argued that the language, legislative history, and subsequent construction of the 1875 Act confirmed that only an easement (which would not permit drilling) had been granted. The Court agreed with the United States.Great Northern Railway Co. v. United States, Roberts declined to endorse the United States's \\"stark change in position\\". Roberts also observed that Great Northern \\"specifically disavowed\\" the characterization of 1875 Act rights-of-way as reverting to the United States on abandonment in Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, . (This case and Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Townsend, , had been key precedents in the United States's argument.) The Court in Great Northern considered Stringham not \\"controlling\\" because the Stringham Court had seemingly made its decision without being informed of the policy shift from land subsidies to mere easements in 1871. Roberts went on to write that under well-settled property law, an easement disappears upon abandonment, and the land owner regains full use of his property. Therefore, when the United States patented land to Brandt subject to the railroad right-of-way, without explicitly reserving any interest in the right-of-way, it gave up any future interest in the railroad corridor. In this case, the railroad's easement was extinguished upon abandonment, leaving Brandt's land unburdened. = Dissent = Dissenting alone, Justice Sotomayor argued that the Court had misconstrued Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Townsend, , and Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, . Where the majority argued Great Northern \\"disavowed\\" those cases, Sotomayor instead read Great Northern to hold that \\"the right of way did not confer one particular attribute of fee title.\\" Sotomayor argued that the majority was wrong to analyze the rights of way under the common law. Instead she concluded that traditional common law terms acquire different meanings in the unique context of railroad rights of way. Sotomayor also disagreed that the United States's position contradicted its position in Great Northern, pointing to language in its brief in Great Northern that qualified its description of the rights of way as easements. Sotomayor in closing criticized the decision for \\"undermin[ing] the legality of thousands of miles of former rights of way that the public now enjoys as means of transportation and recreation\\", noting that ensuing lawsuits \\"may well cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars\\" in rail trail-related takings claims.  Subsequent developments  At oral argument neither the United States nor Brandt could say how many abandoned rights of way would be affected by a decision in Brandt's favor, due to the age of the rights of way and the distributed manner in which records had been kept. It is thus unclear how many new takings claims will be filed in response to the decision. Assessments of the impact of the decision upon existing rail-trails vary. The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy has argued that relatively few existing rail-trails will be affected by the Court's decision. Some states believe their trails will be unaffected. Others remain uncertain about the decision's impact on existing trails. The Court's decision has also had impact beyond the rail-trail context, strongly influencing a proposed settlement in Texas litigation over railroads' allowing telecommunication companies to lay fiber-optic cable within rights of way.

Plot  Film is all about Malla - a florist, a Samaritan, soft-natured person beloved by people; contrast to this is his son Shiva who grows-up in goons' abode; a father who sacrifices his life for his son and at the end son taking revenge on the culprits. Malla reminds us of his earlier films Anjada Gandu and Puntanja in some sequences. This film has everything from love to trust, affection, sorrow, action, cruelty, comedy and glamour to make Malla a tasty feast for all classes. Known for unusual ideas and sets, he demonstrated them here too - he sleeps on a hand shaped bed and makes out with the beauty.

Malla was produced by Ramu, under his production house, while Ravichandran directed it. He stated: \\"The audience can expect to see the earlier Ravichandran in Malla. The film will have all gimmicks and heroisms of a Ravichandran-starrer and I want the cine-goers to take something back home after seeing the film. The film will touch the hearts of all the cine-goers. It will entertain, make people laugh and cry.\\" He added that he would star as the eponymous lead Mallikarjuna \\"Malla\\", who has a love for flowers.

It is believed to have originated in Ambon city. Colo- colo is similar to Manado's dabu-dabu, as they both use many chopped red chili peppers, bird's eye chili, shallots, red and green tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and sugar, mixed with fresh calamansi juice or locally known as lemon cui or jeruk kesturi. (sometimes replaced by kaffir lime or lemon juice). The main difference is that colo-colo recipe often includes additional ingredients, such as chopped lemon basil, kenari nut, and tahi minyak or ampas minyak (black-colored cooking coconut oil residue), or caramelized rarobang (watery residue of coconut oil-making process). As the result, colo-colo is darker and more oily than dabu-dabu. However, today, because of the rarity and difficulty to acquire traditional cooking oil residue and caramelized rarobang, this oily agent is often replaced by widely available and practical kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) mixed with margarine, coconut oil or cooking oil. As z result, today colo-colo is often mistaken for another Indonesian common condiment, sambal kecap. Maluku archipelago is famous for its rich collection of seafoods, and colo-colo is usually served as condiment for seafood, especially various recipes of ikan bakar (grilled fish) and ikan goreng (fried fish). Popular grilled seafood such as kakap merah (red snapper), baronang (rabbitfish), cakalang (skipjack tuna), cumi-cumi (squid) and udang (shrimp) are served with colo-colo as coating or dipping sauce.

History Ensemble of churches in Lukh The foundation date of Lukh is not known, but it was a fortress in the Middle Ages and served to protect the Northeastern Rus from Tatars. The ramparts of the fortress from the 14th century have been preserved in the settlement. Lukh was first mentioned in 1342 as a village shown on a map. It belonged to Metropolitan Cyprian, and in 1498 the Lukh Principality was established and given to Prince Fyodor Belsky. Whereas subordinate to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and then the Tsardom of Russia, the principality existed until 1584, when it was abolished and merged into the Tsardom of Russia. During the Time of Troubles, in 1608, Lukh accepted False Dmitry II as a Tsar, and until the end of 1609 was several times conquered by the forces by Vasili Shuysky, which were subsequently driven back from the town. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Lukh was listed as a town in Moscow Governorate. When the governorate was divided into provinces, Lukh became a part of Yuryev-Polsky Province. In 1778, Kostroma Viceroyalty (known since 1796 as Kostroma Governorate) was established, and Lukh, which was the administrative center of Lukhsky Uyezd, became a part of it. In 1797, Lukhsky Uyezd was abolished, and Lukh became a part of Yuryevetsky Uyezd but retained the town status. In 1925, it lost the town status and downgraded into selo. The status changed followed the initiative of the citizens of Lukh, who though that the Soviet legislation of the time was unfavorable towards possible agricultural activities in towns, and it would be more advantageous to have a rural locality. In 1918, Yuryevetsky District was transferred to newly established Ivanovo-Voznesensk Governorate. On June 10, 1929 governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Lukh became a part of Puchezhsky District of Ivanovo Industrial Oblast. It was a part of Kineshemsky Okrug. On January 25, 1935 Lukhsky District with the administrative center in Luk was established. On March 11, 1936 Ivanovo Industrial Oblast was abolished and split into Ivanovo and Yaroslavl Oblasts. In 1959, Lukh was granted urban- type settlement status. Economy =Industry= There are enterprises of food, construction, and textile industries in Lukh. =Transportation= Lukh is connected by roads with Vichuga, Puchezh, and also has access to the highway which connects Shuya and Chkalovsk via Verkhny Landekh. There is a regular bus traffic. Culture and recreation Lukh contains six cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally thirty objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are the ramparts of the Lukh Fortress, as well as four churches built in the end of the 17th and in the 18th centuries: The Assumption Cathedral, the Trinity Cathedral, the Resurrection Church, and the Transfiguration Church.

Written in Arabic, it is the ninth book by Kadhim, who works as a Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bahrain. Written in two stages, before and during the Arab Spring, the book discusses this wave of protests from two sides; the past and the future. The past is divided into three waves, each of them corresponding to an era of hope and aspiration. First is the enlightenment wave, followed by the revolutionary wave and finally the democratic wave. The author then tackles the Arab Spring and argues that it is not the time for celebration, but an important station in the long way towards democracy. The book was positively received by reviewers in several Bahraini media outlets such as Al-Wasat, Al Ayam and al- Bilad. In addition, the pan-Arab Al-Hayat and Kuwaiti Al Rai newspapers gave it favorable reviews. There were mild criticisms for the book, mainly concerned with its scope. Every critic thought it should have expanded more on a certain aspect. Background The Arab Spring was a wave of protests, uprisings and revolutions that erupted at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011. Starting from the Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid and spreading throughout the country, the Tunisian Revolution began in mid-December 2010 and was soon faced with government repression. On 14 January 2011, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. Inspired by the events, the Egyptians organized similar protests on 25 January, which also swelled and spread all over the country. After several failed attempts to stop the movement, President Hosni Mubarak announced his resignation and transferred power to the army on 11 February. These events \\"jolted the rest of the region\\" and several other Arab countries were quick to follow suit. In Yemen, small-scale protests started shortly after the Tunisian Revolution. Protesters were emboldened by the fall of Mubarak and their numbers grew. The president, Ali Abdullah Saleh was able to remain in power for months before signing an agreement in November by which he handed over power, but remained a political player. In Bahrain, protests erupted on 14 February and were met by repression. A month later, the government called in troops from neighboring Persian Gulf countries to put down protests and announced a state of emergency. In Libya, protests started on 17 February in the eastern city of Benghazi. They developed into a civil war that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands. In September, six months after the UN Security Council‚Äìsanctioned NATO military intervention, the de facto ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed. In Syria, protests erupted in mid-March and were met by government repression. The brutal repression radicalized the opposition and the country slid into full scale civil war that has left more than 100,000 killed by July 2013. Less significant protests also occurred in Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The initial hopes of democratic change have faced several setbacks in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia. A report by Freedom House in 2012 suggested that while Tunisia was showing significant improvements, Egypt's improvements were limited and there were declines in some areas. Bahrain on the other hand was scoring record declines and was ranked lowest. The situation in Yemen was not much better than Bahrain. Inspiration and writing Kadhim began writing the book in December 2010, a time he described as gloomy with no hope of change in the Arab World. Then, when the Arab Spring began, he was deeply shaken by the rapid developments and the early victories achieved in Tunisia and Egypt, and described them as \\"a rain that fell suddenly on a barren desert\\". Therefore, he decided to stop writing and rethink the book's thesis, which until then had been influenced by the previous gloomy atmosphere. The stop was only expected to last for few months or a year at most until the events unfolded. But Kadhim only resumed writing in September 2012, a time when some countries were still in upheaval, while others were in transition. He was determined and motivated to re-examine the original thesis, to defend the Arab Spring, and most importantly to defend \\"the hope that this Spring had revived\\". Content The book discusses the Arab Spring from two sides: the past and the future. The author argues that the Arab Spring was a result of a past which extends to the nineteenth century, which he names the \\"memory of hope\\". He then divides this long period into three eras: enlightenment wave of hope, revolutionary wave of hope and democratic wave of hope. Each of these waves is then discussed in detail. = The enlightenment wave of hope = This wave started at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It was characterized by the hope that al- Nahda (Arab Renaissance) and enlightenment would allow the region catch up with more developed nations. Although they differed in ideology and worldview, the common theme among the enlightenment intellectuals was their belief in gradual progress without sudden leaps even if it takes decades. They did not support violence or revolution, but preferred peaceful methods such as education and science to bring about change. Most of them saw the Western world as a model to follow and imitate; some even called for full Europeanization. Another shared theme was their attempt to explain the backwardness of the Arab world and the progress of the Western world by one grand cause, each of them claiming to have found this cause. Despite the long time-frame and successive generations of this wave, the author concludes that it failed to achieve its goals. = The revolutionary wave of hope = This wave started in the middle of the twentieth century and was characterized by the hope to achieve al-Nahda via rapid radical changes. Its theorists criticized the previous gradual approach as futile. They thought that the Arab world was held back from progress by two major forces: foreign colonialism and local tyranny. Thus, they supported national liberation movements and revolutions. To them, revolution was the only way to overcome the backwardness of the Arab world. The Western world was no more a model to follow, instead Third World counties that resisted imperialism such as Vietnam and Cuba became the models. Following the defeat of Arab armies in the 1948 Palestine war, the Arab world went into an era of political assassinations and military coups that culminated in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which brought Gamal Abdel Nasser into the leadership of Egypt. Nasser's ascend to power was a turning point in the history of the region and the revolutionary wave had spread to Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. This wave however faced a historic defeat in the 1967 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The author states that this defeat was worse than that of 1948 and had signaled the end of the Nasserite revolutionary wave, which was replaced by the Islamist wave. This wave reached its climax in early 1980s after the Islamic Revolution in Iran and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which turned Afghanistan into a hub for Mujahideen. The Arab revolutions that succeeded did not bring al-Nadha nor freedom, instead they had turned into authoritarian regimes. These developments and the 8-year Iran‚ÄìIraq War have struck a fatal blow to the Arab revolutionary wave of hope. = The democratic wave of hope = This wave began at the end of the 1980s after the Revolutions of 1989. Its main theme was the hope that civil society, not enlightenment or revolution would pave the way for democracy in the Arab world. Civil society was seen as essential for emergence of democracy and that once a strong civil society developed, democracy was sure to follow. It was hoped that democracy would be achieved by the end of 1990s or early twenty-first century at most. The Saddam Hussein-ordered Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War have formed a strong reaction against tyranny, which was seen as the main cause of the crisis. It also weakened authoritarian regimes and gave civil society more space to maneuver. The number of non-governmental organizations in the Arab world jumped from less than 20,000 in the mid-1960s to over 70,000 in the late 1980s to 300,000 in 2008. Despite all of these developments, there was no significant democratic change in any Arab state throughout this period. =The beginning of Arab Spring = In this chapter, the author argues that the grand narrative of democratic change was being weakened and replaced by small narratives of quality of life and personal consumption of commodities and services. Arab states used these narratives to polish their tarnished legitimacy. However, these small narratives were not sustainable. Dissatisfaction and despair were very high. This situation was ready to explode at any moment and was ignited by Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation. Although the Arab Spring began with great hopes for change, these hopes were replaced by fear and then by frustration. Setbacks such as the struggle between Islamists and seculars, 2012 Benghazi attack and Reactions to Innocence of Muslims have diminished much of the initial hope. The author concludes by arguing that change is hard and that one should not rush to think that the Arab Spring is the \\"time of festival\\". Instead the author blames this rush and exaggerated expectations for the diminishing of hope. He adds that although the way forward is long and hard (the events of early 2011 being an important station in it), we should hold on to the hope rescued by the Arab Spring and believe that a better future can be built by our own hands. Characters Rifa'a al-Tahtawi, the pioneer of the enlightenment wave of hope Gamal Abdel Nasser was a main figure in the revolutionary wave of hope For each wave, the author cites a number of characters as its thinkers and intellectuals.

Unlike Kadhim's three previous books, which were published gradually as articles in the media, no parts of Saving Hope were published before the official release. The cover of the 314 pages book showed a Tunisian woman waving the V sign. The book has received favorable reviews in various media outlets. Writing for Al-Wasat, Mohammed Jalal praised the book's title and subtitle saying they reflected positiveness and reality. He also stated that Saving Hope was Kadhim's most important book so far. Writing for the same newspaper, Habib Haidar expressed his admire to the large amount of sources Kadhim used and was able to plot in a homogeneous way that is easy to read. He also noted that two thirds of the book were dedicated to the \\"memory of hope\\" and only 100 pages discussed the Arab Spring. Hassan Madan reviewed the book in 5 articles published in Al Ayam. He considered it the first Bahraini attempt to analyze the roots of the Arab Spring. He noted that throughout the book, the author had argued against Lyotard's proposal by stating that local narratives had reached an impasse. While praising his division of the \\"memory of hope\\", Madan thought that Kadhim should have expanded more about the divisions between the first and the second wave and should have explored more about Marxist parties in the Arab world. Writing for the same newspaper, Mahir Abdulqadir praised the thesis of the book, stating that unlike many of the superficial analysis of the Arab Spring, Kadhim succeeded in tackling and examining the Arabic subconscious while keeping the reader in suspense until the last pages. He however criticized the book for not covering the \\"West aggressive attitude to the [Arab] Renaissance\\". One attendant of a cultural seminar about the book criticized it for lacking Islamic theorizing, while another described it as too optimistic. Overall comments were however positive. Writing for Al-Bilad newspaper, Mohammed al-Mahfodh stated that the book was well worth reading and stopping by. A review by Al-Hayat warned against judging the book from its optimistic cover image or title. It praised the book and described it as a \\"thoughtful and interesting study\\". Fahad al- Hindal praised the author's critical reading of the three waves of hope in a review published in Al Rai newspaper.

George Holmes Life Born in 1662 at Skipton-in- Craven, Yorkshire, Holmes became, in about 1695, clerk to Sir William Petyt, Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London. For nearly sixty years he acted as deputy to Petyt, and his successors Richard Topham and David Polhill. He was also barrack-master at the Tower, a Fellow of the Royal Society, an early member of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and a member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding. Thomas Madox worked closely with Holmes on his edition of the Dialogus de Scaccario; and Browne Willis, De Blossiers Tovey, William Richardson, and other antiquaries acknowledged his assistance. From October 1707 until his death he was employed, on the nomination of Lord Halifax, chairman of committees in the House of Commons, to arrange the records deposited in the Tower, at a salary of ¬£200. He died 16 February 1749, and his collection of books, prints, and coins was sold that year by Abraham Langford. Works Holmes prepared the initial 17 volumes of the second edition of Rymer's F≈ìdera, (20 vols., London 1727‚Äì35). He collated the documents with the originals in the Tower of London, and supplied omissions in the first edition. The additions made by Holmes are considered to be of a higher quality than those by Robert Sanderson, Rymer's earlier editor. The final three volumes were the same for both editions. Volume 17 of the second edition had a general index to the preceding volumes. A project of Peter Le Neve from the early 1720s to catalogue old British coins involved Holmes with James Hill. The ambitions to make a complete numismatic history fell through. Family Holmes married the daughter of a sword-cutler in Fleet Street named Marshall. His wife, who survived him, received ¬£200 from the government and ¬£200 for her husband's manuscripts relating to the public records, which were deposited among the official documents at the Tower of London. An only son, George, received his education at Eton College, and was clerk under his father; he died at the age of 25.

Their feature film directorial debut, it had its world premiere on September 9, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it won a special jury citation for Best Canadian First Feature Film. Lee and Prowse star as two friends whose goal to film themselves traveling the world is cut short when one of them contracts a mysterious disease. Afflicted received a theatrical and video-on-demand release on April 4, 2014. Plot Childhood friends Clif Prowse and Derek Lee have decided to venture around the world to film their travel web series Ends of the Earth. The trip is Derek's last wish, as he has an AVM, which could cause his death at any moment. Clif and Derek stop in Barcelona to meet with old friends currently on tour with their band. After their initially uneventful stay, Derek picks up a woman by the name of Audrey after telling her about his AVM. Later that night, Clif bursts into Derek's hotel room as a prank, only to discover Derek bleeding and semiconscious, and no sign of Audrey. Though Derek doesn't remember anything about the attack, they assume that Audrey planned to rob him. Upon getting to Italy, Derek passes out and sleeps for an entire day. Clif awakens him the next afternoon for lunch. At the restaurant, Derek hungrily devours his pasta dish and then suddenly projectile vomits. Later, at a vineyard, Derek has an extreme reaction to sunlight, and is forced to flee inside, covered in burns. Back at the hotel room, Clif attempts to calm Derek down, only for Derek to explosively punch clean through the corner of a stone wall with his bare hands. Over the next few days, Derek displays superhuman strength, speed and agility. Clif attempts to persuade Derek to stop their trip and go home, but Derek continues to insist that there is nothing wrong with him. As Derek grows sicker due to not being able to eat, he finally agrees to go to a hospital. On the way, the two are almost hit by a car. Derek fights with the angry driver and passenger, completely overpowering them both. Then he licks their blood off his hand. Clif correctly deduces that Derek has contracted vampirism, but researching it online proves unhelpful. Derek first tries drinking blood obtained from a butcher, and then kills and drinks the blood from someone's pet piglet, only to vomit out the blood on both occasions. Realizing that Derek needs human blood, he and Clif attempt to rob an ambulance, which proves unsuccessful, and they retreat back to the hotel. Derek enters a catatonic state, and Clif decides to cut his own arm to give Derek some human blood, but discovers that Derek has escaped. Clif attempts to find him, only to be ambushed and killed by the completely inhuman Derek. Upon regaining his senses and realizing that he has killed his friend, Derek shoots himself in the head with a shotgun. Shortly after, however, Derek's head heals with only slight scarring, and he is faced with the fact that he cannot die or be killed. Soon after, Interpol agents attempt to take Derek into custody, forcing him to escape in daylight, carrying only Clif's camera bag. He manages to get back to France and hides in an abandoned warehouse in Paris. Reviewing the footage of his meeting with Audrey, he realizes that her cell phone might be at the hotel where she bit him. After retrieving the cell phone, Derek texts every one of the numbers on the contact list in order to try and lure someone to him. Eventually, he gets a text from a man to come to a room in a building, where Derek goes and finds a bloodstained saw and photographs; one of them showing an old black and white photograph of Audrey. Suddenly Derek is attacked from behind, but thanks to his superior strength, he is able to overpower the attacker, whom he then ties up. Derek sets up a live-stream camera showing Maurice tied up, in order to draw Audrey in. The attacker turns out to be a man by the name Maurice Behar, an acquaintance of Audrey's who is bitter that Audrey turned Derek but not Maurice himself, commenting; \\"Fifty years and you are the first one she turned\\". Maurice nevertheless warns Derek to leave, lest Audrey will soon arrive and kill him. Suddenly, however, Derek's hideout is stormed by the GIGN and Derek is shot to near-death before entering a frenzy state. After slaughtering the whole squad, Derek escapes once again. Audrey finally comes to Derek in the abandoned building, where she attacks him and tells him not to approach her or Maurice ever again, before suddenly relinquishing this approach, telling Derek that he is not feeding properly. She tells the distraught Derek that there is no cure for his condition, adding that she would have cured herself if there were one, to which Derek responds by furiously lashing out at her. The two fight, but Derek is easily overpowered by the more experienced Audrey. Audrey urges him to feed every four to five days, lest he become inhuman again and turns into \\"something much worse\\", and starts beginning to kill indiscriminately and daily. Audrey tells him that he cannot choose not to kill, but he can choose whom to kill, and explains that she chose Derek because she knew he was dying and thought she was being kind. Later, Derek posts his final entry online, in which he explains that he can never contact his family again. He thereafter is shown filming himself feeding on a man who had videos on his cell phone of a sexual assault on a child. In a mid-credits scene, somewhere in Italy, a teenage boy and two teenage girls are seen sneaking into a swimming pool, only to be attacked. The boy gets away, and with his camera running, finds the bloodied corpse of one of the girls, before Clif, now also a vampire, appears and attacks him. Cast Production Filming took place in Barcelona, Paris, Italy, and Vancouver on a budget of $318,000. Funding was raised through a small grant and through Prowse and Lee's family and friends. Afflicted was their first feature-length film, as the two had previous only created short films together. The movie's original concept was initially planned to be a web series akin to Lonelygirl15 or Marble Hornets, where the two would make posts and upload videos that would seem ordinary but grow more bizarre over time. Of the concept, Prowse commented that \\"You'd eventually have all these gaps because eventually the characters would stop posting and then the feature film would be this skeleton key that would click at the very end that you'd present.\\" They chose to make Derek's disease vampirism, as they felt that vampires are usually in \\"very stylized, cinematic, often melodramatic, and romanticized films\\" and were not traditionally filmed otherwise. As the two were not familiar with filming in the found footage genre, Prowse and Lee found the filming challenging and commented that they had a lot of respect for the crews of films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. They commented that their choice to star as the film's protagonists helped make the process easier, as it allowed them more freedom to shoot and re-shoot scenes. Lee commented that his role of \\"Derek\\" was very physically taxing due to the weather in Italy and the demands of the role. Promotion The film's trailer is notable for showing a selection of the characters' \\"travelogue\\" scenes in reverse order: Entry 206, Entry 185, Entry 163, Entry 151, and so on, each scene suggesting the horrors that are growing throughout the story. Germain Lussier of www.slashfilm.com wrote, \\"The Afflicted trailer might be one of the best \\"Hollywood\\" has released in a long time. Unlike traditional trailers, which are presented linearly, this one starts at the beginning, jumps to the end and works backward, showing how two friends' trip around the world goes horribly, horribly wrong.\\" Reception Critical reviews for Afflicted have been mostly positive and as of October 14, 2019, the movie holds a rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with an average score of 6.65/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"It isn't without its share of clich√©s, but Afflicted proves there's still life in the found-footage horror genre\\". We Got This Covered rated the film favorably, as the film did not deal with \\"zombies, plagues, or flesh-eating viruses\\" and had \\"beautiful cinematography and clear, crisp pictures\\" as opposed to \\"swirling cameramen trying to give us motion sickness\\". =Box office= For its opening weekend, Afflicted opened in 44 theatres, and grossed $68,300, for an average of $1,552 per theatre. As of April 13, 2014, Afflicted has grossed $102,851. =Awards= *Best Canadian First Feature Film - Special Jury Citation at the Toronto International Film Festival (2013, won) *Maria Award for Best Special Effects at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival (2013, won) *Maria Award for Best Motion Picture at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival (2013, nominated) *Best Director - Horror Features at the Austin Fantastic Fest (2013, won) *Best Picture - Horror Features at the Austin Fantastic Fest (2013, won) *Best Screenplay - Horror Features at the Austin Fantastic Fest (2013, won) References External links  Category:2013 films Category:2010s horror drama films Category:2013 horror films Category:Canadian supernatural horror films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian vampire films Category:Found footage films Category:Films shot in Barcelona Category:Films shot in Paris Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:CBS Films films Category:2013 directorial debut films Category:2013 drama films ","title":"Afflicted (film)"},{"id":"42388265","text":"Mikhail Borisovich Dobriyan (; 26 June 1947 ‚Äì 16 November 2013) was a Soviet and Russian aerospace engineer and a former director of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Tarusa.List of directors of the SKB KP IKI RAN He was one of the leading figures in the programs of the International Astrophysical Observatory GRANAT and Vega program.Social- political newspaper of the Tarusa loc. gov. ¬´October¬ª.

DVB-S2X is a digital satellite television broadcast standard. It has been standardised by DVB Project in March 2014 as an optional extension of DVB-S2 standard. It will also become an ETSI standard.  Main features  Compared to DVB-S2, efficiency gains up to 51% can be achieved with DVB-S2X. Amongst improvements are: *Higher order modulation schemes (64/128/256APSK) *Smaller roll-off factors of 5%, 10% and 15% *Improved filtering making it possible to have smaller carrier spacing *Channel bonding can combine several different carriers increasing efficiency in DTH applications Channel bonding helps, particularly for UHDTV services. Statistical multiplexing is often used to allow more television services to fit into a single satellite channel. Statistical multiplexing works best when there are many television channels which can share their bandwidth. With UHDTV services, it may only be possible to fit 3 services in a single satellite channel which reduces the effectiveness of statistical multiplexing. Bonding channels increases the number UHDTV services within the bonded channel allowing the statistical multiplexing to work more efficiently. Because of a lack of backwards compatibility with existing DVB-S2 decoders, Belgian company Newtec has developed the 'DVB-S2plus/Extensions' technology, which tries to reconcile the benefits of the DVB-S2X with compatibility to existing systems.  Use cases  In particular for DTH, a possible use case is the launch of UHDTV-1 (e.g. 4k) television services in Ku-/Ka-band that will adopt HEVC encoding.

During the shoot of the film, there was reportedly a clash of opinions between actresses Jyothika and Laila in January 2002, with the pair having to be restrained by the actress-producer of the film, Rambha. Problems continued as the careers of Laila and Rambha began to peter out, prompting distributors to back away from the film, leading to further delays. The film evaded its release date several times and eventually took close to two years to complete, only finally releasing on 10 October 2003. The film gained negative reviews with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu citing that \\"a frivolous storyline, a lackadaisical approach to the screenplay and inept direction mar Three Roses\\", adding that \\"after all the hype and hoopla, speculation and delay, arrives Three Roses, and ironically it is focus that the film lacks.\\" Another critic claimed that \\"the disastrous effects all these problems (changes in cast, production delays) have had on the movie is clearly evident from the final product.\\" Parameswaran's next directorial was Vanakkam Thalaiva with Sathyaraj. His name was credited as Sakthi Paramesh. The film failed at box office. He then directed Thavam with Arun Vijay. The film received negative reviews and eventually became a failure at box office. In 2011, he wrote and produced another movie titled Kaidhi which was made entirely in Malaysia with local technicians. The venture directed by newcomer Seenu released across Malaysia, and Parameshwar felt that the film would increase cross-dialogue about film making between the two countries.http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/itsybitsy/article2018686.ece In 2013, he directed Karumpuli, a story revolving around terrorism with rookie actors including Rathan Mouli.

Jung. Some of these women were early popularizers of Jung's ideas. Even more unflattering were the terms maenads or valkyries.F. McLynn, Carl Gustav Jung (1996) p. 327. After his wife, Emma, chief among the circle of women was Toni Wolff, followed by Jolande Jacobi, Marie-Louise von Franz, Barbara Hannah, Esther Harding, and his secretary, Aniela Jaff√©. Other, more peripheral, figures were Kristine Mann and Hilde Kirsch.B. Burleson, Jung in Africa (2005) p. 48. While in the present context, the term is a pun, the German word jungfrauen means 'maiden' or 'unmarried woman', as the adjective jung means 'young' and the plural noun frauen means 'women'. Public image Mary Bancroft (who was not a member of the group) described the Jungfrauen as \\"vestal virgins\\" hovering around Jung, their sacred flame.P. Bishop, The Dionysian Self (1995) p. 267.

But Manickam continues drinking and goes to a level where he steals Anjalai's jewels before losing his job. During this time, his mother dies in a fire accident after which he vows not to drink anymore. Meanwhile, Manickam falls sick after damaging his liver as a result of excessive drinking. In order to safeguard his life, Anjalai collects money by begging in the streets and donation from the chief minister of the state. Manickam is sent to the United States for treatment. When the couple return to India after Manickam gets cured, he starts drinking again and gets addicted to it. Unable to tolerate his change in behaviour, Anjalai ends her life.

The film was budgeted at a cost of 8.5 million (about 0.277 million in 1992‚Äì93). Despite being launched with much \\"fanfare\\" and media acclaim, the film did not make any impact among the audience as it turned out to be a box-office failure. It won the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues in 1993 and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. The jury noted the film for its \\"effective and purposeful plea for prohibition\\". K. Vijiyan of New Straits Times wrote \\"This is not the usual Visu fare were are used to [...] Visu has made sure this is not just an educational movie with an anti-alcohol message. There is an Indian saying that it is difficult to straighten a dog's tail and the story seems to subscribe to the fatalistic view that drunkards cannot quit.\\".

Sheep milk cheese is a cheese prepared from sheep milk.

Nutrition and production Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, more lactose than cow milk, and is therefore not an alternative for people who are lactose intolerant. Though sheep's milk may be drunk in fresh form, today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making. Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk.p. 343 Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin.

The station is owned and operated by the RNLI and currently operates two inshore lifeboats. They are an called and a called .  History  Up until the 1960s the grounds on which the station is located at Calshot split had been the site of RAF Calshot which was used by the RAF as its main seaplane/flying boat development and training unit in the UK. The base was closed in 1961 and after the RAF had left, Hampshire County Council opened an Education Sea and Land based Activities Centre. The centre was constantly being asked by HM coastguard to use its boats to go out and rescue people in trouble off shore. The administrators of the centre decided that they would contact the RNLI with a view to there being a more formalised rescue service for this busy stretch of water. The RNLI spent a year evaluating this proposition and with a result opened a lifeboat station on the site in 1970. = The first lifeboat = The first lifeboat to be stationed at Calshot was a Keith Nelson-type lifeboat which had the operation number of 40-001. She was called Never Turn Back ‚Äì the RNLI since the Second World War. Authors: Kipling, Ray & Susannah. Publisher: Sutton Publishing. 2006 edition.

The crew used a davit launched boarding boat when called out on service. She was built for the RNLI by Lochin Marine at Newhaven, East Sussex in 1985. Like the Keith Nelson-type she had a Glass reinforced plastic (GRP) hull and had a watertight GRP cabin which gave the boat a self-righting capability. Funding for the lifeboat came from Safeway stores hence her name \\"Safeway\\", and she stayed on service at Calshot until December 2001 when she was withdrawn from service. She was replaced by the former Poole based Brede \\"Inner Wheel\\" which was at the station for only a few months before being replaced by an boat. The Brede-class lifeboat service was short-lived as the class was not considered to be suitable in rough seas and to stress limitations in the GRP hull. = New shore facilities = In 1996 the RNLI invested further to the stations future by constructing new shore facilities at the station. The building was constructed on concrete stanchions to protect the station from flooding. The Hampshire County Council provided a new boarding jetty for use jointly by the lifeboat station and the Calsholt Activity Centre. = 2002 = The lifeboat Margaret Russell Fraser (ON 1108) The next lifeboat to arrive at the station had come across the Solent from the Yarmouth station on the Isle of Wight.

In its place an inshore lifeboat was sent to the station. The Atlantic 85 would co-locate at the station with the already established boat. After improved facilities had been made at the station to accommodate the new lifeboat and its required launch tractor a new lifeboat arrived and the Alexander Coutanche was withdrawn.

The vessel had been en route from Hamble to Ashlett Creek when her engines failed as she tried to negotiate the Ashlett Creek channel. The lifeboat put to anchor at the mouth of the entrance to the creek and three of the crew took to the lifeboats inflatable boarding boat which they had towed to the service, expecting to have to use the small boat as it was to shallow for the lifeboat. By 11pm the three lifeboatmen located one of the crew and took him to safety ashore. half an hour later they had spotted the other two crewman and the Hamble rescue boat. To reach the vessel the lifeboat men, in freezing temperatures, took turns dragging the small inflatable with its small 6 hp engine, through the marshes, sometimes up to chests in the cold water. Eventually reaching the Hamble boat the two crewmen were taken off which was then piloted back to the main lifeboat with great effort and difficulty. The lifeboat got back to station in the early hours of 30 January.

It was one of two works stolen from the private collection of Terence F. Kennedy in London in June 1970 and recovered by the Carabinieri in Italy in April 2014. Description The painting depicts two bowls of brightly coloured apples and grapes on a fringed white linen cloth on a wooden table with a small dog sleeping on the floor in the background. It is signed and dedicated \\"a la Comptesse De N (Nimal)\\". Provenance The painting, along with Pierre Bonnard's Woman With Two Armchairs (La Femme Aux Deux Fauteuils), was stolen from the home of widower Terence F. Kennedy (his wife Mathilda died in 1964) in Regent‚Äôs Park on June 6, 1970. Press reports at the time said that Mr Kennedy's housekeeper was duped by three men, one posing as a policeman and the others as burglar alarm engineers, and that they cut the paintings from their frames while she was making them tea. After the theft the paintings are alleged to have been smuggled through France on the Paris-to-Turin train, and then to have turned up in the lost-and-found railway depot in Turin. It is said they were auctioned in 1975 and that a worker at the Fiat Factory bought the paintings for a small sum. Recovery The paintings are said to have remained in the factory worker's kitchen until an art expert's evaluation in 2014. Once they were identified the Carabinieri took the paintings into custody. Under Italian law the factory worker could have a right to keep them if he could prove that he bought them in good faith. In December 2014 they were returned to him by a court in Rome. Simultaneously, the sole and universal heir of the original owner, Terence F. Kennedy, was found and has since made his claim to title.Article in Antiques Trade Gazette References Category:Paintings by Paul Gauguin Category:1889 paintings Category:Still life paintings Category:Dogs in art Category:Stolen works of art ","title":"Fruits on a Table"},{"id":"42389430","text":"The Jeju Peace Institute (JPI) is a South Korean think tank that was created in 2006 as research institution devoted to the study and promotion of peace on the Korean Peninsula and to foster regional cooperation in East Asia.

He added to his kingdom, the territories of Chanda and Mandla, and portions of Nagpur, Balaghat, Seoni, and Bhandara. He also annexed the adjoining Rajput kingdom of Kherla. The present districts of Chhindwara and Betul also fell under his control. A great warrior, he went on to conquer Pauni, Dongartal, Sivni&Katangi.; History idolizes him as the founder of the Nagpur city. Bakht Buland Shah founded the city of Nagpur by joining the twelve small villages formerly known as Rajapur Barsa or Barasta. In 1702 Many towns and villages were founded. All the smaller villages were merged. After giving a proper shape to his kingdom, he encouraged people to settle and thus facilitated trade & Commerce. His rule epitomizes an era of great reforms. Agriculture, trade, and commerce made considerable advances. He constructed a Mosque in the Fort of Nagpur which initiated the Islamic religion & culture in Nagpur. Bakht Buland starts off in the service of the Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, embracing Islam, and is officially recognised as the raja of Deogarh by the Mughal court. Bakht Bulund Shah is said to later rebel against the Mughals and snatch portions of their territory, during the Mughal war against the Marathas. Introduction A prince of the kingdom of Deogarh-Nagpur. The next Raja of Deogarh was Chand Sultan, who resided principally in the country below the hills, fixing his capital at Nagpur which he made a walled town. On Chand Sultan's death in 1739, Wali Shah, an illegitimate son of Bakht Buland, usurped the throne and Chand Sultan's widow invoked the aid of the Maratha leader Raghuji Bhonsle of Berar in the interest of her sons Akbar Shah and Burhan Shah. The usurper was put to death and the rightful heirs placed on the throne. After 1743, a series of Maratha rulers came to power, starting with Raghoji Bhonsle, who conquered the territories of Deogarh, Chanda and Chhattisgarh by 1751. In 1803 Raghoji II joined the Peshwa against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, but the British prevailed. After Raghoji II's death in 1816, his son Parsaji was deposed and murdered by Mudhoji II. Despite the fact that he had entered into a treaty with the British in the same year, Mudhoji joined the Peshwa in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1817 against the British, but suffered a defeat at Sitabuldi in present-day Nagpur city. The fierce battle was a turning point as it laid the foundations of the downfall of the Bhonsles and paved the way for the British acquisition of Nagpur city. Mudhoji was deposed after a temporary restoration to the throne, after which the British placed Raghoji III the grandchild of Raghoji II, on the throne. During the rule of Raghoji III (which lasted till 1840), the region was administered by a British resident. In 1853, the British took control of Nagpur after Raghoji III died without leaving an heir.

Spain and Mexico P√≠o Pico In 1781, the early non-Indian settlers in Los Angeles included two black people and eight mixed (black/white) people. P√≠o Pico, California's last governor under Mexican rule, was of mixed Spanish, Native American, and African ancestry. Pico spent his last days in Los Angeles, dying in 1894 at the home of his daughter Joaquina Pico Moreno in Los Angeles. He was buried in the old Calvary Cemetery in downtown Los Angeles. Post-Mexican era Blacks and mulattoes did not face legal discrimination until after California was handed over to the United States in 1848. Many white Southerners who came to California during the Gold Rush brought with them racist attitudes and ideals. In 1850, there were twelve black people registered as residents of Los Angeles. Because many blacks were enslaved until abolition in 1865, few blacks migrated to Los Angeles before then. Due to the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad and a settlement increase in 1880, increasing numbers of blacks came to Los Angeles. By 1900, 2,131 African-Americans, the second largest black population in California, lived in Los Angeles.Stanford, p. 7. In 1872, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles (First A.M.E. or FAME) was established under the sponsorship of Biddy Mason, an African American nurse and a California real estate entrepreneur and philanthropist, and her son-in-law Charles Owens. The church now has a membership of more than 19,000 individuals. 20th Century The presences of the Southern Pacific and Transcontinental railroads meant that Los Angeles had a relatively high African-American population for a city in the Western United States; in 1910 it had 7,599 African-Americans. The first branch of the NAACP in California was established in Los Angeles in 1913. Housing segregation was a common practice in the early 20th century. Many private property deeds explicitly banned owners from selling to anyone but caucasians. The African-American population did not significantly increase during the first Great Migration. From approximately 1920 to 1955, Central Avenue was the heart of the African-American community in Los Angeles, with active rhythm and blues and jazz music scenes. Jazz legend Charles Mingus was born in Los Angeles in 1922. Raised largely in the Watts area of Los Angeles, he recorded in a band in Los Angeles in the 1940s. Central Avenue had two all- black segregated fire stations. Fire Station No. 30 and Fire Station No. 14 were segregated in 1924. They remained segregated until 1956 when the Los Angeles Fire Department was integrated. The listing on the National Register says, \\"All-black fire stations were simultaneous representations of racial segregation and sources of community pride.\\" In 1928, World War I veteran William J. Powell founded the Bessie Coleman Aero Club. In 1931, Powell organized the first all-black air show in the United States for the Club in Los Angeles, an event that drew 15,000 visitors. Powell also established a school to train mechanics and pilots. World War II brought the Second Great Migration, tens of thousands of African American migrants, mostly from Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas, who left segregated Southern states in search of better opportunities in California. The African-American population significantly increased in the Second Great Migration of the 1940s as area factories received labor for the effort in World War II. In 1940 the black population was 63,700. William Parker became police chief in 1952. He largely refused to hire Black police officers. During most of his tenure, those already on the force were prohibited from having white partners. The 1965 Watts Riots were triggered by the arrest of a 21-year-old black man named Marquette Frye at 116th Street and Avalon Boulevard for driving drunk. A torrent of built-up rage erupted in the streets of Watts and South Los Angeles. An investigating commission found that the African American citizens felt they had been denied respect and endured substandard housing, education and medical care. The King-Drew Hospital in Willowbrook opened in 1972 as a response to the area having inadequate and insufficient hospital facilities. In 1972, Wattstax, also known as the \\"Black-Woodstock,\\" took place in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Over 100,000 black residents of Los Angeles attended this concert for African American pride. Later, in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert. Tom Bradley speaking at AIDS Walk LA at the Paramount Studios lot in 1988 In 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as Mayor of Los Angeles, a role he'd hold for 20 years. L.A.'s first African American mayor, Bradley served over five terms, prior to the establishment of successive term limits, making him the longest-serving mayor of Los Angeles. In 1991, Rodney King was beaten by police officers. His videotaped beating was controversial, and heightened racial tensions in Los Angeles. Just 13 days after the videotaped beating of King, a 15-year-old African-American girl named Latasha Harlins was shot and killed by a 51-year-old Korean store owner named Soon Ja Du. A jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter, an offense that carries a maximum prison sentence of 16-years. However, trial judge, Joyce Karlin, sentenced Du five years of probation, four hundred hours of community service, and a $500 fine. When four Los Angeles Police Department officers were acquitted of charges associated with the beating of Rodney King, the decision led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The trial of the O. J. Simpson murder case took place in 1994. 21st century In 2004, Singer-songwriter Ray Charles's music studio on Washington Blvd. was declared a historic landmark. He had moved to Los Angeles in 1950. Geography and population =1950s and 1960s= Philip Garcia, a population specialist and the assistant director of institutional research for California State University, stated that a group of communities in South Los Angeles became African-American by the 1950s and 1960s. These communities were Avalon, Baldwin Hills, Central, Exposition Park, Santa Barbara, South Vermont, Watts, and West Adams. Since then the Santa Barbara street was renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.Martinez, Diana. \\"A Changing Population in South-Central L.A., Watts.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 17, 1991.

They were the second largest minority group after the then estimated 815,000 Mexican-Americans. Los Angeles had the west coast's largest black population. Between 1975 and 1980, 96,833 blacks moved to Los Angeles while 73,316 blacks left Los Angeles. Over 5,000 of the blacks moved to the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario area. About 2,000 to 5,000 blacks moved to the Anaheim-Santa Ana-Garden Grove area. James H. Johnson, a University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) associate professor of geography, stated that due to affordable housing, blacks tend to choose \\"what is called the balance of the counties\\" or cities neutral to the existing major cities. In the Inland Empire, blacks tended to move to Rialto instead of Riverside and San Bernardino. Of the blacks who left the City of Los Angeles between 1975 and 1980 who moved away from the Los Angeles area, over 5,000 moved to the Oakland, California area, about 2,000-5,000 went to San Diego, about 1,000-2,000 went to Sacramento, and about 1,000 to 2,000 went to San Jose, California. About 500 to 1,000 blacks moved to Fresno, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Simi Valley, and Ventura. Johnson stated that the areas from Fresno to Ventura are \\"areas that traditionally blacks haven't settled in\\". Many blacks leaving Los Angeles who also California moved to cities in the U.S. South, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Little Rock, New Orleans, and San Antonio. Other cities receiving LA blacks include Chicago, New York City, and Las Vegas. =1990s= In the late 1990s, many African Americans moved away from the traditional African-Americans neighborhoods, which overall reduced the black population of the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. Many African Americans moved to eastern Los Angeles suburbs in Riverside County and San Bernardino County in the Inland Empire, such as Moreno Valley.Texeira, Erin. \\"Migrants From L.A.

According to Denise Hamilton of the Los Angeles Times, as of 1996 \\"there has been no large-scale migration from the traditional black business districts such as Crenshaw, black business people say.\\" During the 1990s, the black population of the Moreno Valley increased by 27,500, and by 1996 13% of Moreno Valley was African American. In addition, in the 1990s many African Americans moved to cities and areas in north Los Angeles County such as Palmdale and Lancaster and closer-in cities in Los Angeles County such as Hawthorne and Long Beach. In the 1990s, the black population of Long Beach increased by 66,800. =21st Century= In 2001, within the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Compton, Ladera Heights, and View Park had the highest concentration of blacks. The cities of Malibu and Newport Beach have the lowest concentrations of blacks.

Notable people Yvonne Brathwaite Burke * Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, an attorney from Los Angeles, became the first African American woman in the California Legislature and in 1972 became the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Congress from the West Coast. She served in Congress from 1973 until the end of 1978. * Nat King Cole * In 1954, Dorothy Dandridge (who was originally from Ohio but settled in Los Angeles) became the first black actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the 1954 film Carmen Jones. Many years passed before the entertainment industry acknowledged Dandridge's legacy. Starting in the 1980s, stars such as Cicely Tyson, Jada Pinkett Smith, Halle Berry, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Kimberly Elise, Loretta Devine, Tasha Smith, and Angela Bassett acknowledged Dandridge's contributions to the role of black Americans in film. * In 1966, Mervyn Dymally, a Los Angeles teacher and politician, became the first African American to serve in the California State Senate. He went on to be elected as Lieutenant Governor in 1974. * Larry Elder * In 1993, Etta James was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Known as \\"The Matriarch of R&B;\\", James is regarded as having bridged the gap between rhythm and blues and rock and roll, and is the winner of six Grammys and 17 Blues Music Awards. She was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Grammy Hall of Fame in both 1999 and 2008. James was born the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, and received her first professional vocal training at age five from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir, at the St. Paul Baptist Church in South Central. * In 1981, two years after being drafted into the Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point. Johnson's career was closely followed by the media and he became a favorite among Los Angeles sports fans. Among his many achievements are three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations and he is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2. Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, broadcaster and motivational speaker. Named by Ebony Magazine as one of America's most influential black businessmen in 2009, Johnson has numerous business interests, and was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years. Johnson also is part of a group of investors that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012 and the Los Angeles Sparks in 2014. * In 1988, Florence Griffith Joyner (also known as Flo-Jo), born and raised in Los Angeles, and a UCLA graduate, won three gold medals at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.

Lewis was one of the biggest sporting celebrities in the world by the start of 1984, but owing to track and field's relatively low profile in America, Lewis was not nearly as well known there. * Tim Moore (comedian) * Tavis Smiley * Maxine Waters Paul Williams, 1943. * The Theme Building, an iconic landmark structure at the Los Angeles International Airport, opened. The structure was designed by a team of architects and engineers headed by William Pereira and Charles Luckman, that also included Paul Williams and Welton Becket. Born in Los Angeles in 1894, Williams studied at the Los Angeles School of Art and Design and at the Los Angeles branch of the New York Beaux-Arts Institute of Design Atelier, subsequently working as a landscape architect. He went on to attend the University of Southern California, School of Engineering, designing several residential buildings while still a student there. Williams became a certified architect in 1921, and the first certified African-American architect west of the Mississippi. * In 2002, Serena Williams, raised in Los Angeles, became the Women's Tennis Association's World No. 1 player. Williams is regarded by some experts and former tennis players to be the greatest female tennis player in history. She has won four Olympic gold medals and is the only female player to have won over $60 million in prize money. Williams is the reigning US Open, WTA Tour Championships and Olympic ladies singles champion. =Lesbian, gay and bisexual= In 2007, 4% of African-American adults in Los Angeles County identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.Moore, p. 190.

He was a leader in the country's craft movement in the 1970s, 80s and 90s and was one of the inaugurators of the design showcase Artiture in 1987. He is a descendant of the NgƒÅti Awa ancestor Te Rangihouhiri and the founding chairman of NgƒÅ Aho, a design initiative that advocates for collaborative and creative practices among professionals within the MƒÅori tribal structure and community. The Whitecliffe College of Arts and Design conferred Wilson with an Honorary Diploma in Art and Design; in 2002 he received an inaugural Toi Iho mark, a registered MƒÅori trademark of authenticity. His design practice, Studio Pasifika, has been in operation since 1993. Wilson is included in Helen Schamroth's 100 New Zealand Craft Artists, Douglas Lloyd Jenkins' At Home: A Century of New Zealand Design, and Michael Smythe's New Zealand by Design: a History of New Zealand Product Design.  Background  Wilson's ancestry embraces both of New Zealand's founding cultures, MƒÅori and European. His maternal grandparents were Italian, and his paternal grandfather, a Scot named Andrew Wilson, married Anahera Kingi. He was born and raised in the South Island and enrolled at Victoria University of Wellington in 1963 to study law. Soon bored with his legal studies, he found employment as a sales representative for a MƒÅori publishing company, during which he trained in organization and methods. Following a trip overseas where he indulged his fascination with art in the cathedrals and museums of Europe, he returned to his birthplace, Christchurch. His woodworking occurred out of necessity when Wilson and his wife, Jenney, purchased a small cottage in the Heathcote Valley. The family needed furniture and Wilson adapted old kauri (Agathis australis) tubs, found on the property, into serviceable items. The involvement with wood was transformative: Wilson tried to find an education programme that would complement his self-teaching but, at the time, Christchurch Polytechnic offered only carpentry courses. This absence in the availability of design/make training would have a subsequent influence on Wilson's agenda as president of the Crafts Council of New Zealand (CCNZ); in the meantime he honed his skills by doing. His first major exhibition was in 1974 at the Canterbury Building Centre: a buyer from McKenzie & Willis, the furniture retailer, purchased the entire inventory of occasional tables, shelf units and cupboards. As a consequence, Wilson established Adzmarc, rented a studio in the Artists Quarter in central Christchurch, hired employees, and made furniture in a rustic, textured style that was wholesaled to McKenzie & Willis for the next five years.  Community connections  Seeing the need for woodworkers to come together for camaraderie and sharing techniques, Wilson instigated the Canterbury Guild of Woodworkers in 1978. This was the first of New Zealand's woodworking guilds. His networking put him in touch with members of the CCNZ and he became involved in the organization at the national level as its southern regional representative. As the first furniture practitioner to sit on the executive of the CCNZ, he was able to bring woodworking to the attention of the membership; subsequently, furniture workshops, exhibitions and invitations to prominent international makers featured on the CCNZ's calendar and in its publications. Wilson's awareness of the paucity of educational opportunities for designer/craftspeople prompted him to promote education as a significant mandate during his tenure as president of the CCNZ (1981‚Äì1983). In his first message as president he stated: \\"I am also keen to see greater participation by young people in the craft movement, and would hope that we can encourage school leavers to consider the crafts as providing a viable alternative to other employment, so that a proper master-student relationship can be encouraged with some of our experienced artists\\". In 1982 he was successful in applying to the Arts Council of New Zealand for a travel grant to enable him to visit art schools in the United States and Europe, to learn about curriculum and look at studio facilities so that New Zealand might inaugurate similar programmes. Wilson's report, as a consequence of this trip, for the Minister of the Arts, Allan Highet, was passed on to the Director-General of Education, William Renwick, thereby launching the process to establish the certificate and diploma programmes in craft design in polytechnics throughout the country in 1986 and 1987. Wilson served on a number of boards: the executive board of the World Crafts Council (1984‚Äì87), Crafts Education Advisory Committee (1985‚Äì1988), the Designers Institute of New Zealand (council member 1991-93; president 1994), the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council's arts marketing working party (1991‚Äì92), the New Zealand Qualifications Authority‚Äôs craft advisory panel (1992), and the New Zealand Craft Resource Trust (1997). Bodies like the Arts Marketing Board of Aotearoa (AMBA) and the Craft Resource Trust were established to address the vacuum that was left by the dissolution of the Crafts Council of New Zealand in 1992. Following the demise of the CCNZ, Wilson concentrated on involvement in projects that tapped into his MƒÅori heritage. Wilson was responsible, along with interior designer Chris van Ryn, for the interiors for the MƒÅori Television Service's studios in 2004. Four years later, ongoing dedication to design education provoked Wilson's involvement with NgƒÅ Aho. This association of design professionals aims to dispel \\"Euro-centrically biased\\" academic curricula. According to Wilson, \\"There was simply no call to examine whether there were relevant parallel practices within the indigenous culture that were just called something different.\\" Wilson also collaborates with Rau Hoskins in teaching at Unitec Institute of Technology with assignments, like building shelters, that reflect the wisdom of indigenous materials and techniques.  Furniture portfolio  In 1982, Wilson moved his family to Auckland to be closer to his MƒÅori roots in Whakatane The relocation also brought him closer association with Auckland's design and art community. John Parker (ceramics) and Terry Stringer (sculpture) provided segues to exhibition opportunities, and once his studio was established in Mount Eden, he continued to be a prolific and accomplished furniture maker. One of Wilson's major commissions was for the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council headquarters in Wellington. In 1985 nine furniture makers were invited to submit designs for three projects: a boardroom table and sixteen chairs, furniture for the director's office, and furniture for the reception area and offices. After a two-stage selection process, Wilson was awarded the boardroom project. The brief for the table stated that it must be multi-purpose, accommodating both small and large meetings. The chairs were an adaptation of a design that the Department of Foreign Affairs commissioned from Wilson as New Zealand's gift to the new Republic of Vanuatu. In addition to these precisely-crafted functional pieces, Wilson created alternative forms of furniture that explored narrative. These were exhibited at the annual 'Artiture' furniture exhibitions (1987-1993) in Auckland, where the participants aimed \\"to design furniture that was art, not constricted by the necessity of the pieces having to be a commercial proposition\\". The primary example in Wilson's Artiture oeuvre was Royal Pain in the Arse, a chair whose literal pointed humour made reference to the Crown. Also in the narrative vein, Lair for a Lounge Lizard, created for the Contemporary Furniture Show at the Auckland Museum in 1988, explored the new notion of the home office. Lair was not selected for display in the Contemporary Furniture Show, prompting Wilson and other rejected designers to stage a salon de refus√©s at the Gow Langsford Gallery. The publicity generated by the furore surrounding the Australian judge's selection contributed to the Auckland Museum exhibition and its alternative being noteworthy events in the history of New Zealand studio furniture. The works of a number of the exhibitors in the 1992 Artiture display at the Museum were purchased and selected to tour through five cities in Japan in 1993. The last major exhibition of furniture in New Zealand took place at the Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt in 1997. Entitled Framed it was co-curated by Wilson and Humphrey Ikin. The display, consisting of the work of 23 studio furniture makers, was described by Ikin as \\"a slice through to highlight this cross-section: the work of younger designers who had not exhibited previously, alongside the not so young; experienced practitioners beside recent design graduates\\". Although there have been regional exhibitions and gallery shows dedicated to individual makers, Framed spelled the end of national visibility for studio furniture.  Sculpture  During 1993-95 Wilson assisted with the compilation and presentation of evidence for NgƒÅti Awa's claim against the Crown through the Waitangi Tribunal, a commission of enquiry relating to actions or omissions of the Crown that breached the promises made in New Zealand's 1840 founding Treaty of Waitangi between MƒÅori and the Crown. At the conclusion of the hearings Wilson began work on his first solo exhibition of sculpture, He Rahi to Whakamau kotahi i te Pirita, which translates as ‚Äòto be entangled in the supplejack [a twisted vine Ripogonum scandens] once is sufficient.‚Äô This statement is attributed to the prophetic figure Te Kooti as he reflected on his experience of dealing with the Crown during this period in New Zealand history. Sculpture exhibitions in 2003, 2005, and 2011 have continued to be inspired by Wilson's MƒÅori heritage and personal philosophical and political views.\\"The Fourth Perspective\\" at the Judith Anderson Gallery in Auckland in 2001 was a group show in which Wilson's table, made of puriri and metal, retained the tunnels eaten by puriri moths as symbolic of the beauty yet reality of nature. \\"I O E A U\\" at Artis Gallery in Auckland in 2003 transferred the marks made by MƒÅori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi, into three-dimensional forms in steel, wood glass and stone. \\"Re-patterning\\" (2011), that explored the relationships between the universe and the changes wrought by its human inhabitants, was described by Wilson: \\"If we re-pattern our behaviour and really look carefully at how we've got to re-engage with the systems that are a part of us, then we'd have some different outcomes.\\" Wilson is represented by Artis Gallery; his sculpture uses a variety of materials, making reference to landscape, environment and culture. His work is held in public and private collections nationally and internationally. His Pukeruru studio continues to pursue the principle, initiated in the 1980s, of the establishment of learning opportunities in the creative industries. The studio provides opportunities for short-term residencies and internships while encouraging a pragmatic approach to the importance of a sound business practice.

Catholic parish The civil parishes of Kilferagh and Killard were combined into one Catholic parish by the late 17th century. In 1841 the population of the civil parish of Killard was 6,941 in 1,094 houses. Of these, 316 lived in 52 houses in the village. In 1854 the Catholic parish was again separated into roughly the same two areas as the medieval parishes, forming the modern Kilkee (Kilfearagh) and Doonbeg (Killard) parishes. There are two churches in the parish: \\"Our Lady Assumed into Heaven\\" (Doonbeg) and \\"St Senan's\\" (Bealaha). \\"Our Lady Assumed into Heaven\\" is a modern building, noteworthy for the stained-glass windows that are uniquely designed so that the various colours illuminate the altar throughout the day. The church was built in 1976 and has an uncommon octagonal shape. It replaced the older crucifix-shaped church that was built in 1813. The bell from the old church was transferred to the new building. It bears the inscription Me Vocante, Deum Laudate (\\"At my call, praise God\\").

It was reported of this performance (by Sophia Morrison) that \\"There was a crowded house. The Liverpool newspapers gave unstinted praise to both plays and players.\\"'Notes' by Sophia Morrison in Mannin, No. 2, November 1913 In the winter of that same year, the Players did a production of Shimmin's next plays, Luss ny Graih and The Dooinney Moyllee.'Creating a Manx Drama' by Sophia Morrison in Mannin, No. 2, November 1913 The Players were keen to use the profits from their performances for charitable purposes in line with their Manx ideals.

The central connection between Morrison and the Players was demonstrated by some of their members forming her pallbearers: John J. Joughin, Christopher R. Shimmin, C. Cashin and C. H. Cowley.'Obituary: Miss Sophia Morrison', The Manx Quarterly, No. 18, Vol. IV The Peel Players did not last long beyond this time. People who acted with the Peel Players include: Christopher R.

Palmer, Tom Dodd, Sam Harrison and Annie V. Cain. Although the Peel Players were only a small amateur group, they are perhaps the most significant theatre group in modern Manx history. Through their central place in the Manx Cultural Revival and their premiering works by perhaps the island's most important playwright, in Christopher R. Shimmin, the Peel Players have been compared to the Abbey Theatre in Dublin for their significance to Manx culture. Plays produced * Illiam Kodhere's Will by Christopher R.

He and Lenape Chief Killbuck represented the Delaware Nation at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.  Early life and family  Little is known about the exact date of his birth or death. Apparently, Turtleheart was possibly the brother of Wolf Clan Chief Custaloga (Packanke) and perhaps the father or uncle of Captain Pipe called Konieschquanoheel and also known as Hopocan.

Indian Captive, John McCullough, after witnessing the shooting, tomahawking and stabbing of trader, Tom Green, wrote, \\"All the Indians in the Town immediately collected together, and started off to the Salt Licks, where the rest of the Traders were, and murdered the whole of them, and divided their goods amongst them, and likewise their horses. My adopted brother took two horse loads of beaver-skin and set off with them to Tus-ca-law-ways [Tuscarawas], where a number of Traders resided, and sold the fur to them.\\" Of those traders, upon receiving payment, McCullough continues \\"However, as I heard, they went on safe until they got to Ksack-hoong [Sauconk], an old Indian Town at the confluence of the Beaver and Ohio, where they came to an Indian camp unawares.

Siege of Fort Pitt  Indians attacked Fort Pitt on June 22, 1763. Too strong to be taken by force, the fort was kept under siege throughout July.

British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted the use of smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by one historian, \\"there is no doubt that British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy\\", and \\"it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox\\".Dixon, David; Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America; (pg. 152-155); University of Oklahoma Press; 2005; In this instance, as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, William Trent, on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of \\"great numbers of Indians\\" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time.

Likutei Torah The second volume of the work, Likutei Torah, was published by Rabbi Schneur Zalman's grandson, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the third Rebbe of Chabad. It was printed in Zhitomir, after informers had the government close the print shop in Kopust where Torah Or was printed. Despite initial reluctance, Rabbi Menachem Mendel published his grandfather's teachings together with his own brief notes on various treatises, after the Alter Rebbe, his grandfather, reportedly appeared to him and his three sons in a dream, asking them to publish the glosses and comments.Hayom Yom, 3rd Shvat; 15 Shvat chabaad Library.

The Mamarim are not a direct translation of the Hebrew original, but rather a content summary of the Mamar. Each Parsha features a single selected Mamar from amongst the many Mamarim that are printed in the Hebrew original, giving the reader a taste and glimpse of the full content of this monumental work. The main goal is for the reader to receive the content knowledge of the most fundamental Mamarim written by the Alter Rebbe, and for him to be given the tools for how to implement this knowledge within his daily life. Each Mamar concludes with a lessons box that summarizes the practical life lessons that we can derive from the Mamar. Also included are interesting parables that we find easy to relate to and help us to digest the content being studied, and internalize it.

The three-part programme was adapted by Sarah Phelps and directed by Craig Viveiros and is based on Agatha Christie's 1939 novel of the same name. The series features an ensemble cast, including Douglas Booth, Charles Dance, Maeve Dermody, Burn Gorman, Anna Maxwell Martin, Sam Neill, Miranda Richardson, Toby Stephens, Noah Taylor and Aidan Turner. The programme follows a group of strangers who are invited to a secluded island where they are murdered one by one for their past crimes. The serial, debuting to 6 million viewers, received critical acclaim with many praising the writing, performances, and cinematography. It also scored high ratings. Synopsis On a hot day in late August 1939, eight people, all strangers to each other, are invited to a small, isolated island off the coast of Devon, England, called Soldier's Island, by a \\"Mr. and Mrs. Owen\\". The guests settle in at the manor home on the island tended by two newly hired servants, a husband and wife, Mr. Thomas Rogers and Mrs. Ethel Rogers, but their hosts are absent. When the guests sit down to dinner, they notice the centrepiece, ten abstract art deco figurines of jade, supposedly representing ten soldiers arranged in a circle. Afterward, Mr. Rogers puts on a gramophone record, from which a voice accuses everyone present of a murder. Shortly after this, one of the party dies from poisoning, and then more and more people are murdered, all in methods synonymous with a poem affixed to the back of each bedroom door.

The adaptation was produced by Mammoth Screen in partnership with Agatha Christie Productions. Writer Sarah Phelps told the BBC that she was shocked by the starkness and brutality of the novel. Comparing the novel to Christie's other work, she stated, \\"Within the Marple and Poirot stories somebody is there to unravel the mystery, and that gives you a sense of safety and security, of predicting what is going to happen next... In this book that doesn't happen ‚Äì no one is going to come to save you, absolutely nobody is coming to help or rescue or interpret.\\" =Casting= Maeve Dermody was cast two days before the read through of the script and was in Myanmar at the time. She flew to the UK to begin work with a dialect coach and read the book in the first two weeks of filming. =Filming= Filming began in July 2015. Cornwall was used for many of the harbour and beach scenes, including Holywell Bay, Kynance Cove, and Mullion Cove. Harefield House in Hillingdon, outside London, served as the location for the island mansion. Production designer Sophie Beccher decorated the house in the style of 1930s designers like Syrie Maugham and Elsie de Wolfe. The below stairs and kitchen scenes were shot at Wrotham Park in Hertfordshire. Railway scenes were filmed at the South Devon Railway between Totnes and Buckfastleigh. Episodes Reception And Then There Were None received critical acclaim and was a ratings success for the BBC, with the first episode netting over 6 million viewers and becoming the second most watched programme on Boxing Day. Each of the two subsequent episodes netted over 5 million viewers. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, And Then There Were None has an approval rating of 86% based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"Dark yet dashingly executed, And Then There Were None offers a brazenly misanthropic look at human nature.\\" Ben Dowell of the Radio Times gave a positive review. Jasper Reese for The Daily Telegraph gave the first episode 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a \\"pitch-black psychological thriller as teasing murder mystery\\" and \\"spiffingly watchable\\". Reviewing the first episode, UK daily newspaper The Guardians Sam Wollaston noted, \\"[...] it also manages to be loyal, not just in plot but in spirit as well. I think the queen of crime would approve. I certainly do. Mass murder rarely gets as fun as this.\\" Reviewing the final episode for The Daily Telegraph, Tim Martin gave it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a \\"class act\\", and praising the adaptation for highlighting the darkness of Christie's novel, which he claimed no previous adaptation had attempted. The Russian adaption, ‚Äò‚ÄôDesyat Negrityat‚Äô‚Äô from 1987, however, was the first visual adaption to include the novel‚Äôs original ending.

This group marked an era of popular music in Puerto Rico. When trios were very popular in the Americas, Trio Vegabaje√±o was considered the ambassadors from Puerto Rico. Vegabaje√±o is the demonym for people of the town of Vega Baja. Eventually they were recognized as the National Trio of Puerto RicoVintage Music - Trio Vegabaje√±o and on October 26, 1996 a monument was inaugurated in Vega Baja. History Trio Vegabaje√±o was informally formed in 1943 at the Tortuguero Military Camp of Vega Baja by Fernandito √Ålvarez who gathered a few co-workers (Octavio Gonz√°lez and Benito de Jes√∫s) to put together a few musical numbers. A friend, Rafael Qui√±ones Vidal, came up with the name for the trio. Shortly after they recorded their first song \\"Llanto de mar\\". At the time only Fernandito Alvarez and Benito de Jesus did both vocals and guitar while Octavio Gonz√°lez only played guitar. In 1945 Octavio Gonz√°lez was recruited by the US Army and the trio brought Pepito Maduro, also a singer, as the replacement. The group now had an all singers line-up and became pioneers of this new style. During this line-up Guillermo Venegas Lloveras composed their theme song Tema - Tr√≠o Vegabaje√±o in which aside from describing the town of Vega Baja they also state what town is each one from: [Fernandito] \\"Yo soy de Vega Baja (I am from Vega Baja) [Benito] Barceloneta es mi pueblo (Barceloneta is my town) [Pepito] Humacao fue mi cuna (Humacao was my cradle)...\\" Although being a trio, the group became a quartet in 1952 when Jorge Hernandez (requinto player) joined the group. They didn't change the name of the group. This was one of their most successful line-up and even though was not the original, it was sometimes referred to as the \\"original\\" or \\"authentic\\" line-up.triomania - Trio Vegabaje√±o After the departure of Jorge and Benito, the trio had different line-ups. The only living member of the quartet line-up (1952‚Äì65) is Jorge Hernandez. In 2002, the group was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. En Mi Viejo San Juan \\"En mi Viejo San Juan\\" (In my Old San Juan) was first recorded by El Trio Vagabaje√±o in 1943 under the label RCA Victor. The song had an immediate impact and many other versions followed. The composition was written by Puerto Rican composer and singer Noel Estrada and has been translated into various languages. The song is \\"widely known around the world\\".Noel Estrada. Clarissa Santiago Toro.

Alfred the Gorilla ( - 9 March 1948) arrived at Bristol Zoo, England, in 1930 and became a popular attraction and animal celebrity. BBC His fame grew to international proportions during World War II and after his death he remained an important mascot for the city of Bristol. Alfred's distinct personality led to his popularity amongst younger visitors and he quickly became one of the zoo's main attractions. His profile was further increased during World War II when visiting soldiers took images and stories of Alfred back to their home countries with articles about him appearing in the US and Australian press. After Alfred died in 1948, his taxidermic form was put on display in Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery where he continued to act as a mascot for the city. Alfred's form was stolen from the museum in 1956 and was missing for a weekend before he was discovered and returned, a mystery that remained unsolved until the death of one of the perpetrators in 2010.Alfred the Gorilla mystery solved 4 March 2010 The Guardian He remains on display in Bristol today and served as part of the inspiration for the popular Wow! Gorillas trail in 2012.  Gorillas and Bristol  Bristol's connection with gorillas dates back to the first gorilla bones ever brought to Britain. After being sent to Liberia as a missionary in 1836, the American naturalist Dr. Thomas Savage wrote to Professor Richard Owen in London, declaring, 'I have found the existence of an animal of extraordinary character in this locality, and which I have reason to believe is unknown to the naturalist. As yet I have been unable to obtain more than a part of a skeleton.' Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p38 The letter included a sketch of a skull which Savage speculated might be related to a chimpanzee. Savage also wrote to Samuel Stutchbury of the Bristol Institution, a forerunner of the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Stutchbury had more remains sought out and in 1847 Captain George Wagstaff obtained three skulls from the Gabon River in West Africa. When these arrived in Bristol, Stutchbury sent them to Owen who published a paper, on the specimens proposing to call the species Troglodytes Savagei after Thomas Savage.Transactions of the Zoological Society of London, Volume 3, 1849, p391. https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh0hAQAAMAAJ&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false By the time the full paper was published in 1849, however, Dr. Jeffries Wyman of Harvard had already published a description of the bones with Savage's own preferred name of Troglodytes gorilla. The skulls were returned to Stutchbury and can be found in Bristol Museum's collection today. The first living gorilla reached Europe in the 1880s, although a ‚Äòvery unusual chimpanzee‚Äô exhibited by a travelling showman in England in 1860 was later thought to be gorilla. Most of the early gorillas sent to Europe died within a couple of years, often from lung disease. One of the longest lived resided at Breslau Zoo and reached the age of seven. The first living gorilla to reach Bristol Zoo, purchased for ¬£75, arrived in 1900 but died after a short period.A. C. Van Bruggen, ‚ÄòInternational Zoo News‚Äô, 1 July 2007.  Early life  Alfred was initially found by an Expedition from the American Museum of Natural History, New York and Columbia University in 1928 in what was then Belgian Congo. The expedition members were told that a pair of gorillas had been shot for ‚Äòraiding‚Äô a farmer's field for food, afterwards a baby was discovered and suckled by a local woman.H. Paddon, ‚ÄòBiological Objects and \\"Mascotism\\": The Life and Times of Alfred the Gorilla‚Äô in S.J.M.M. Alberti, The Afterlives of Animals - A Museum Menagerie (2011) The baby gorilla was later sold to a Greek merchant and taken to the town of Mbalmayo in modern-day Cameroon, where the expedition encountered him playing in the streets. He was described by the Expedition as ‚Äòthe liveliest specimen of his kind we had ever seen‚Äô.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p38. In 1930 Alfred was sold to an Italian who, after bringing him to Europe, sold him on to an animal dealer. Bristol Zoo, already successful in rearing chimpanzees, acquired Alfred for ¬£350.H. Paddon, ‚ÄòBiological Objects and \\"Mascotism\\": The Life and Times of Alfred the Gorilla‚Äô in S.J.M.M.

Van Bruggen, ‚ÄòInternational Zoo News‚Äô, 1 July 2007. Alfred was named after Alfred Mosely, Companion of Honour,a benefactor of the zoo, it was his gift to the NationHarry Edwards, ‚ÄòThe Old Cliftonian‚Äô, 13 July 1993. Although during his life he was thought to be a mountain gorilla, it is more likely that he was a western lowland gorilla.  Life at Bristol Zoo  Alfred arrived at Bristol Zoo on 5 September 1930, which was thereafter celebrated as his birthday. His cage was positioned just inside one of the entrances and this prominent position, alongside his vibrant personality, meant that he quickly became one of the Zoo's main attractions. During his first two years at the zoo, Alfred regularly took walks around the grounds with his keeper Frank Guise. He did this on the end of a long collar and chain and was well known for wearing woollen jumpers.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39. During his third year at the zoo Alfred had grown to weigh eight stones. His increasing strength had become a concern to his keepers and when he broke a photographer's tripod during his birthday celebrations, his walks around the zoo were curtailed. Alfred also caught whooping cough during these early years but received medical help. This remained the only significant illness that he contracted until the end of his life.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40. Despite being confined to his enclosure Alfred continued to be a popular attraction and he was featured beating his breast on a radio broadcast from the zoo in 1937.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39. Alfred became the oldest gorilla to survive in captivity in 1938 and later that year visitors were invited to guess his weight on a specially constructed machine. The closest guess the public managed was 20 stones, with Alfred actually coming in at 26 stones, four pounds.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39. His diet was completely vegetarian which was an innovation in the practice of keeping captive gorillas and cost the zoo just ¬£3 a week.  Popularity, habits and personality  Alfred's status at the zoo led to him becoming something of a local celebrity with visitors, especially with children. Their recollections often refer to Alfred as having a number of distinct character traits and quirks that made up his personality. On occasion he would approach the children who stood around his cage and make what they perceived as friendly gestures and conversations with them.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L4, 19 April 1993. = Popularity = Although Alfred's habits could occasionally be perceived as offensive by some of the zoo's visitors, many of the children who saw him regularly formed a deep bond with him. One visitor even going as far as to say that because of Alfred's ruder habits, he both ‚Äòloved and hated him‚Äô at the same time.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L19, 9 November 1996. Others recall simply enjoying the gorilla's company and would sit beside the cage for hours just to be close to him.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L8, 24 June 1993. His status as one of the zoo's main attractions is reflected by the fact that many of them recall that rather than ‚Äògoing to the zoo‚Äô, they would often think of their visits as ‚Äògoing to see Alfie‚Äô.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L5, 4 June 1993. Other visitors made regular trips to the zoo on their way through Bristol to other destinations. One woman from the West Midlands recalls that they would drop in on the gorilla every year on their way to a campsite in Somerset. She also notes Alfred's habit of wearing a large hessian sack like a holiday maker wearing a handkerchief on their head which always amused her.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L12, 20 July 1993. = Temperament and nickname = Alfred was allegedly offended by Rosie the Elephant being allowed to walk past his enclosure which would cause him to sulk.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39. He also allegedly harboured a dislike of bearded men, double decker buses and aeroplanes.BBC Article, AHOTW: Bristol Museum's Alfred the gorilla, http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8940000/8940723.stm This stood in contrast for the affection he reciprocated towards his early keepers Frank Guise and Bert Jones, as well as to the sparrows who visited his enclosure to pick at breadcrumbs. He would sometimes be tickled by his keeper and a crowd would gather to watch.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L6, 10 June 1993 As fascism rose in Europe Alfred acquired the nickname, the ‚ÄòDictator of Bristol Zoo‚Äô.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39. = Habits = Alfred was also fond of making and throwing snowballs. At the age of three years he can be seen doing just that in the company of two young children in a photo from January 1931.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39. His expertise at throwing however, was not limited to snowballs. Alfred, one visitor recalled, 'used to express his opinion of the human race by picking up large lumps of his droppings and hurling them accurately at the spectators in front of his cage. It was a delight for small schoolboys to be able to act as cheerleaders to this somewhat one-sided contest‚Äô.Harry Edwards, ‚ÄòThe Old Cliftonian‚Äô, 13 July 1993. Alfred also had a habit of urinating on visitors after climbing the bars of his cage. One child was beckoned over by the gorilla and when she approached he urinated on her head, the story is still remembered by her grandchildren today who often ask to see the gorilla who ‚Äòdid a wee on great grandma‚Äô when they visit the museum.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L9, 1 July 1993. Another writer described how Alfred was her favourite animal at the zoo and she has many memories but her favourite is of her aunt eating plums in front of Alfred. He kept asking her for some and when she simply laughed at him he went to the back of his cage and threw his dung at her. She continued to laugh and not feed him so he climbed the bars of his cage and urinated on her. The writer got in trouble for telling her aunt that the incident was her fault and she should have given Alfred the plums.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L17, 4 August 1993. Alfred was also fond of playing hide and seek with visitors.James Belsey, ‚ÄòBristol Evening Post‚Äô, 30 July 1992. One visitor recalled how she once got her head stuck in the bars of Alfred's cage when she was ten. She was later rescued by a St. Johns ambulance worker. ‚ÄòHow did Alfred react to my dilemma‚Äô, she recounted, ‚Äòhe just sat in the corner of his cage clapping his hands loudly and laughing‚Äô.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L14, 24 July 1993. She now tells the story to her grandchildren when they visit the zoo.  Wartime  Although some animals were moved from the zoo during the war years, Alfred remained in Bristol. His diet of fruit and vegetables became stretched however, and the zoo took to seeking sponsors in order to feed its animals. Alfred was sponsored by Albert Glisten, Fellow of the Zoological Society and Chairman of Southend United Football Club.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40. The presence of US Army troops in Bristol allowed Alfred's popularity to spread further as soldiers sent images and stories featuring the gorilla across the Atlantic. Articles concerning Alfred were reproduced in American newspapers and he retained his celebrity status throughout the war. One visitor to the museum recalled that her late great- great-uncle Bill was Alfred's keeper in the 1940s. Alfred was fond of Bill and would comb his keeper's hair and eat chocolate from his teeth. Bill would occasionally be picked up and taken to the zoo on his days off as Alfred would sometimes not go into his night cage without him. She also noted the gorilla's dislike of bombs and anti aircraft guns.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L15, 26 July 1993. The Home Guard of the 11th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment was based in the zoo's cafeteria during World War Two. One member based at the zoo recalled how they were not allowed to march and parade in front of Alfred's cage lest he become aggressive. At the time the troops discussed the causes of this, musing that it might be that their uniforms reminded Alfred of other primates. On reflection, as the keepers also wore uniforms, the writer concluded that it was more likely the marching itself which upset the gorilla. He also recalled how night watch at the zoo was his scariest experience during his time in the Home Guard. On the one hand, he was worried about Germans appearing out of the dark but he was equally concerned that if a bomb dropped near the zoo the animals might escape from their cages. ‚ÄòOften, 17 year olds like myself exchanged our fears about what one would do if, spare the thought, in such an event the monstrous form of Alfred were to lumber forward out of the darkness‚Äô, he recalled, ‚Äòprobably run towards the enemy!‚Äô he concluded.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L13, 23 July 1993.  Death  In 1946 Alfred became sluggish and overweight before being diagnosed with thyroid deficiency. He recovered from the illness after treatment however, and later returned to his former strength.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40. Alfred died on 10 March 1948. The press at the time speculated that ‚Äòhis pet hate got him in the end‚Äô, linking Alfred's dislike of aeroplanes with the passage of one over the zoo shortly before his death. The actual cause of his demise was tuberculosis which he contracted a year before and despite his keepers best efforts, he had been unable to recover.Ray Barnett, ‚ÄòThe Dictator of Bristol‚Äô in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40. His death was mourned by many of the regular visitors to the zoo, some of whom were even inspired to compose poems in his honour.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L1, 13 March 1948. After Alfred's death gorillas were kept almost continuously at the zoo until the mid-1990s. An article in the Western Daily Press noted the departure of two gorillas in 1995 breaking this pattern of keeping gorillas at the zoo. The departing gorillas were named Diana and Jeremy, aged 23 and 12 respectively. They were sent to London Zoo to live with another female named Zaire. The author noted that the conditions in Bristol's ape house had been criticised, prompting a ¬£5 million redevelopment of the building in order for it to house small animals. A new ape house, the article declared, was not likely to appear for at least four years and the gorillas were unlikely to return, much to the disappointment of the keeper Mike Colbourne.Jonathan Shorney, ‚ÄòWestern Daily Press‚Äô, 18 September 1995.  Taxidermy  Following his death Alfred was mounted by the taxidermists Rowland Ward of London in a pose representing him on all fours. He was returned to Bristol City Museum and was put on display near the heavily frequented museum cafe. His bones and organs were sent to the Anatomy Department at Bristol University.  Display  At first, Alfred's interpretation in the museum was very minimal, detailing only a few key pieces of information about the gorilla. Despite this, his position near the cafe, combined with the fame he had been accorded during his life, made him one of the most visited and celebrated exhibits. Many of those who saw Alfred in the zoo as children continued to visit him once he became an exhibit in the museum. The feelings that they had for him when he was alive often carried over into his second ‚Äòlife‚Äô as an exhibit, maintaining and sustaining his fame. Later encounters with his taxidermic form were particularly memorable for those who could remember Alfred from his time at the zoo. One visitor, for example, encountered the gorilla unexpectedly when visiting her granddaughter at Bristol University more than forty years after Alfred's demise.Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L7, 15 June 1993. Alfred was moved in 1988 to the World Wildlife gallery on the museum's first floor where his exhibit was now positioned alongside a number of different specimens and displays. His interpretation was expanded during this move and he began to appear more and more on publicity material for the museum in photographs as well as in cartoon form. These moves allowed Alfred's form to become a part of a larger narrative on biology and conservation whilst retaining his status as a celebrated local mascot and historical object.  Theft  In 1956 Alfred went missing from the museum after being stolen by a group of students as a prank. After three days he was found and returned to his case although the full story surrounding the theft took more than fifty years to come to light.  Celebrations and competitions  In 1993 people were asked to send in their memories about Alfred as part of a competition to win four free tickets to Bristol Zoo. This was part of the celebrations held to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Alfred's death which also included a series of talks and tours at the museum. The letters that were received added a great deal of anecdotal information about Alfred to the museum's archive Alfred's eightieth birthday was celebrated at the museum in 2010 with a series of activities and events. Children drew him birthday cards showing the gorilla's continuing public appeal as part of the history of Bristol and as a curiosity for younger visitors to the museum. A bust of Alfred's head is also on display at Bristol's M Shed museum after formerly being displayed at the entrance to the gorilla enclosure at Bristol Zoo.  Legacy  Alfred remains a prominent figure in the museum's collection appearing regularly in guides, trails and children's events. Alfred has also featured in several films and plays. Tom Kelpie's award-winning short film spoof Who Stuffed Alfred the Gorilla as well as the original footage filmed by the American exhibition who first discover him playing the streets of Mbalmayo. Nick Jones and Toby Lucas also made a short documentary on Alfred in 2008. Alfred featured in Peter Nichols‚Äô 1979 light comedy Born in the Gardens. One of Alfred's kidnappers, Ron Morgan, also allegedly wrote a play about the incident. Alfred's life and status are also often still used to promote discussion regarding the history and evolution of conservation techniques and the practice of keeping primates in captivity.One article in Nonesuch magazine by Ray Barnett featured an accompanying piece by Sanjida O‚ÄôConnell consisting of an interview with Charlotte Uhlenbroek exploring the way Primate conservation has moved on since Alfred‚Äôs day. Sanjida O‚ÄôConnell, ‚ÄòNonesuch‚Äô, Spring 1999. Alfred's status as a mascot for Bristol was further cemented in 2011 when the Wow! Gorillas project was launched across the city to raise awareness about the extinction crisis facing primates. The project was also held to mark the 175th anniversary of Bristol Zoo and raised over ¬£420,000 for charity.

The wooden tower was erected in 1889 and replaced with a skeleton tower by 1919. The skeleton tower was further altered to an automatic gas light a few years prior to 1931. Two of the keepers, Gilbert B. Hayden and Bernie Hayden, relation unknown, were keepers of the light, but their service years are unknown. As of 2014, a skeleton tower serves as an active daymark and it has a green flash every 4 seconds.  Construction  The Essex Reef Light was constructed in 1889 as part of a $15,000 appropriation by Congress that included several other beacons. The exact cost of the structure is unknown. The light was a tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower with a black lantern that used a 6th order Fresnel lens. The 1900 Light List gave its position as 41.2036 North and 72.2254 West. The hexagonal tower was accessible from a ladder directly by boat with no other landing. The foundation rests upon the river bottom and was a square crib that was made of yellow pine timbers and sheathed with planks that was filled with stones and protected by riprap. The crib extends up to the high water mark to a frustum of a square pyramid that is reduced to at its top and filled with stone. The sides and top are planked and the corners were covered with boiler plate and angle irons. The original light was a hexagonal beacon lantern made of brass and copper with a sixth order Fresnel lens. The oil for the light was stored in boxes in the lower portion of the lantern.  Service  The Essex Reef Light was first lit on July 1, 1889, it featured a fixed red light until December 15, 1892, when it was changed to a fixed white light. In 1914, the light was deactivated for the winter in between January 12‚Äì15 and relit between March 14‚Äì16. A skeleton tower was already in place by 1919 and the date of replacement or removal of the original light is unknown. On December 17, 1919, the light characteristic was changed from fixed white to flashing white every 3 seconds and it was reported that the light's strength was 70 candlepower. In 1931, The Day noted that the skeleton tower was \\"in recent years\\" converted to automatic gas beacons. In 1963, buoys were established near the Essex Reef light. Currently the skeleton tower is active with a height of and has a green flash every 4 seconds. It has a square green daymark with the number 25.  Keepers  Gilbert B. Hayden was noted as a keeper of the light with sparse details found in The Day. In 1914, it noted his return to duties after a \\"few weeks vacation\\" that followed the light's deactivation for the winter. In 1931, The Day contained information about Bernie Hayden, relationship unknown to Gilbert B. Hayden, and stated that he \\"gave the best part of his life to tending [the] Essex light\\". Bernie Hayden tended the light for years, making two trips by boat every day to light and extinguish the Essex Reef Light. He later became nearly blind and his friends petitioned the government for a pension, but was denied on the grounds that only those in exposed water positions could receive a pension. According to local tradition, it was commonplace for townspeople to tell Bernie Hayden that the light floated down the river and Bernie Hayden would join in the joke and claim to recover the light and return it to its rightful place.

History  The sculpture was commissioned by Tony Bogaert, one of the first antique dealers of Kloosterstraat. The sculpture was designed and made by the visual artist Bruno de Smedt in 1997. The disorderly sculpture is a sprawling 5.6 metres wide and 7 metres tall (18 by 23 ft), and took de Smedt fully five months to carve. The Guirlande is seen by many as a symbol of the district and Antwerp which is well known for antiques, art, trinkets and alternative designs. The artwork refers to typical elements for ornamentation and are harmoniously incorporated into an asymmetrical whole; include a cabinet, the cornucopia, an eagle and a Caryatid. The artist with his characteristic organic style shaped something that not only represents Antwerp, but also paid homage to the patron Tony Bogaert, an extravagant figure and mischievous and cunning businessman. A fool's cap and fox refer to this and are processed at the top of the fa√ßade sculpture.  Material  It was created entirely from cedar wood due to its durability against wind and the elements.

A project of Honeywell International Inc. and Pratt & Whitney, ATEC was formed to compete for a government contract to create a 3,000 shaft horsepower engine to replace the existing 2,000 shaft horsepower T700 engine powering the U.S. Army's Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters. ATEC participated in the Army's Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine science and technology program and completed multiple tests of its T900 engine. It is furthering the engine's development through the Army's competitive Improved Turbine Engine Program, which calls for a new helicopter engine with 50 percent more power and 25 percent better fuel efficiency. The company opened its Huntsville, Alabama, office in November 2014. Background Honeywell International Inc. and United Technologies Corporation subsidiary Pratt & Whitney created the Advanced Turbine Engine Company in 2006. The company is led by Craig Madden, president, and Jerry Wheeler, vice president, programs. At the 2007 Paris Air Show, the fifty-fifty joint venture said it would participate in the U.S. Army's Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) program. In May 2008, the Army awarded a $108 million contract to ATEC for the science and technology initiative to replace the current T700 engine. Through the project, the Army seeks to increase the power and efficiency of engines for Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters, to keep the helicopters in the fleet for an additional 30 years or more. ATEC is competing against GE Aviation to develop the new engine. Parent company facilities in Connecticut and Arizona hosted the early development of ATEC's HPW3000 engine. ATEC conducted tests of the HPW3000 in 2013 and 2014, including a sand ingestion demonstration. As of May 2015, ATEC is preparing to move into the Army's next phase of helicopter engine development, the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP), following the AATE program. Maj. Gen. Michael Lundy, who commanded the Army Aviation Center of Excellence, and Heidi Shyu, the Army's assistant secretary for acquisition, called ITEP the Army's top aviation modernization priority. The National Defense Authorization Act funded ITEP at $126 million for Fiscal Year 2017. In November 2014, ATEC moved to the Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama. The Huntsville Times reported that city officials lobbied for three years to get ATEC to locate there. Originally, Wheeler said four or five management and business development workers would work out of the new office, in addition to visiting engineers and logistics professionals. T900 thumb The T900 is ATEC's dual-spool engine intended to replace the U.S. Army's existing engines for its Black Hawk and Apache helicopter fleet. Originally called the HPW3000, the Army designated it as the T900 engine in February 2017. In August 2016, the Army awarded ATEC a $154 million, two-year preliminary design review contract to further support development of the replacement engine. The assignment of a customer naming designation (‚ÄúT‚Äù) is typical as an engine development program matures. The engine is designed so the Army can install it without having to adjust the engine compartment. ATEC is designing a 3,000 shaft horsepower engine to replace the 2,000 shaft horsepower T700. A dual-spool engine has potential to increase an engine's pressure-to-power ratio. ITEP calls for the engine to be 50 percent more powerful and 25 percent more fuel efficient while lowering maintenance costs. The engine's increased power is designed to allow Black Hawk and Apache helicopters to fly higher and longer with more soldiers in hotter climates.

The company is based in Menlo Park, CA. History InVisage Technologies was founded by the company's current CTO Ted Sargent, a professor from the University of Toronto. While developing transmitters and receivers in his lab at U of T, he discovered an especially sensitive receiver, which formed the basis of InVisage's QuantumFilm technology. Sargent then secured the rights to the technology and founded InVisage in October 2006. The company applied this technology toward mobile phone cameras. In 2007, Jess Lee, a former vice president from OmniVision Technologies, joined InVisage as the company's CEO. Syrus Madavi serves as the company's chairman of the board of directors, having joined InVisage in 2012. In February 2013, it was announced that the company had received $20 million in a Series D funding round led by GGV Capital that included Nokia Growth Partners as a new investor, with the company expecting to begin shipping devices with their sensors in the second quarter of 2014. To date, InVisage's investor list includes GGV Capital, Nokia Growth Partners, RockPort Capital, InterWest Partners, Intel Capital, OnPoint Technologies and Charles River Ventures. On November 9, 2017, it was reported that Apple, Inc. acquired InVisage Technologies. QuantumFilm Technology QuantumFilm Technology involves the creation of a film to coat the image sensors used in a cellphone camera, allowing it to capture more light, improving the quality of the images taken. A typical camera phone pixel sensor is made up of several layers, with a layer of colored plastic or glass acting as a color filter sitting on top of several layers of metal connecting silicon electronic transistors together, which is itself on top of a base layer of silicon used by the sensor's electronic transistors and photodetectors. The light coming to the sensor has to pass through the layers of metal before reaching the silicon, a weak light absorber, so the sensor detects only about 25 percent of the light that makes up the image. QuantumFilm Technology places a layer of semiconducting crystals - called quantum dots - on top of the chip, which allows the chip to absorb more light, place more pixels in a smaller space, and create sharper images. Using quantum dots is more efficient at capturing light than traditional silicon-based image sensor chips (capturing 90-95% of the light that hits it), giving the sensors higher sensitivity in low light as well as higher resolution. And while traditional image sensors read an image from top to bottom (which can create a blurred image when the subject is moving), quantum dots detect the entire image at the same moment, reducing the chance for distortion. Invisage holds patents related to the development of QuantumFilm technology, as well as its applications toward optoelectronic devices. Awards In 2010, InVisage's QuantumFilm technology was awarded The Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Award. In 2011, the company received a gold award from the International Imaging Industry Association's (I3A) VISION 2020 Imaging Innovation for its QuantumFilm technology.

It was built in 1860 for Samuel Dinsmoor, Jr., a lawyer and former Governor of New Hampshire, and was later owned by Governor Samuel W. Hale, who made lavish alterations to its interior. It was acquired by what is now Keene State College in 1909. It now houses the office of the college president. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Dinsmoor‚ÄìHale House is located south of downtown Keene, at the southwest corner of Main and Winchester Streets on the campus of Keene State College. It is a three-story brick building, roughly square in plan, with a stuccoed exterior and a low-pitch hip roof. There is a slight projection on the south facade, where there is a stairwell, and on the main facade, where a semicircular bay rises the full three stories and is capped by a low rounded roof. The center entry is recessed from the main facade, with a recessed porch above, which is capped by a small gable. The house was built in 1860 for Samuel Dinsmoor Jr., a prominent local lawyer and bank president who served three terms as Governor of New Hampshire in the 1850s. The house was reported at the time of its construction to be one of the finest in Cheshire County. Samuel W. Hale, a subsequent owner, gave the house grounds and interior a lavish upgrade, and also served as Governor in the 1880s. The house was given to the city in 1909, which in turn gave it to the state for use as part of a normal school, now Keene State College.

On April 29, 1849, she died in childbirth, survived by a son, Joseph Henry Diss Debar Jr. Her parents, the Levassors, took charge of the baby, raising him in Cincinnati. (This son lived to be a very old man, but left no heirs.) Anonymous, ‚ÄúStory About One of the State's Most Interesting Characters‚Äù, West Union Record, 28 January 1941. Now a widower, Diss Debar moved to Doddridge County himself, where he bought a tract where he settled a German-Swiss colony near the village of Leopold. He called his settlement Saint Clara for his late wife. In 1859, Diss Debar married a second time, to a local woman, Amelia Cain (1825-1909), who bore him five children. He did surveying and continued acting as agent for the land company. =The State Seal= In 1863, West Virginia became a state (separate from Virginia) and the brand new state legislature appointed Diss Debar to make preliminary drawings for a state seal and coat-of-arms. His design was adopted in September of that year. At this time Diss Debar began to be quite prominent in state politics. Great Seal of the State of West Virginia The seal devised by Diss Debar is 2.5 inches in diameter and bears the motto Montani Semper Liberi (Latin, \\"Mountaineers Always Free\\").Diss Debarr was also the one who suggested the Latin motto. It was adopted as the official motto of West Virginia in Article II, Section 2-7, of the state constitution signed in 1872. The images are symbolic representations of the state, its people and industries. The two figures standing on either side of the rock marking the state's date of foundation (\\"June 20, 1863\\") indicate the people and their occupations. The plow-handles and the axe indicate the cultivation (wheat and cornstalks are also depicted) after clearing of the original forests. Mineral wealth is indicated by the miner, his pick, and the lumps of coal at his feet. The crossed rifles with liberty cap in the foreground represent liberty maintained by force of arms. (The reverse side, rarely displayed, depicts emblematic objects typical of West Virginia's landscape, productions, resources, and natives grouped inside an encircling wreath of laurel and oak.) =Later years= Governor Boreman appointed Diss Debar commissioner of immigration in 1864 in which capacity he recruited labor and landowners from abroad until the end of his term in 1871.Allen, Bernard L., \\"Joseph H. Diss Debar.\\" e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia. 16 October 2012. Accessed 3 April 2014. He was a member of the House of Delegates representing Doddridge in 1864 and he prepared, compiled and published the first The West Virginia Hand-Book and Immigrant's Guide (1870). Politically, he supported the Liberal Republicans in their efforts to come to terms with ex-Confederates in ending Radical Reconstruction within the state by 1872. During his 29 years living in what is now West Virginia, he produced numerous sketches of the people and places of the era. The elderly Diss Debar left West Virginia and moved to Pennsylvania. He died in Pittsburgh in 1905 and is buried in Philadelphia. Personal Diss Debar is said to have been fluent in French, German and English, semi-fluent in Spanish and Italian, and able to translate Latin and Greek. His characteristic Van Dyke beard, cloak and high silk hat, and the habitual twirling of his cane are said to have made him instantly recognizable. A notorious medium and fraudster ‚Äî Swami Laura Horos (ca. 1849‚Äìca. 1909) ‚Äî falsely claimed for a time to have been married to Diss Debar. Madam \\"O'Della Diss Debar\\" was known to have visited the Diss Debar home in Parkersburg many times and outwardly appeared to be a relative or family friend, but the relationship remains obscure.

He is also known for his poetry, as founder of the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA), and as creator of Tantsu and Tantsuyoga. Watsu is a form of aquatic bodywork in which a practitioner or therapist gently cradles, moves, stretches, and massages a receiver in chest- deep warm water for deep relaxation and aquatic therapy.  Life  Harold Dull was born in 1935 in Seattle, Washington.Dull H. 2010. Watsu: basic and explorer paths. Watsu Publishing. IBN 978-0984451500. = Education = Harold Dull received his BA and MA degrees at the University of Washington. Dull also gained proficiency in several languages. Dull began writing poetry in 1955, while a student of Stanley Kunitz and Theodore Roethke at the University of Washington. After graduation in 1957 he participated in regular meetings of poets with Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan in San Francisco, and published several small books of poetry with the San Francisco Renaissance presses Open Space and White Rabbit Press. Starting in 1976, Dull studied in Zen Shiatsu in America and in Japan, where he studied with Shizuto Masunaga, the original creator of Shiatsu. He also studied with Reuho Yamada and Wataru Ohashi, the teachers who first introduced Shiatsu to the United States.Schoedinger, P. 2011.

Watsu Publishing. . = Development of Watsu = In the early 1980s, while teaching at the School of Shiatsu and Massage at Harbin Hot Springs, California, Harold Dull began adapting Zen Shiatsu for water. He experimented with floating people in the warm water natural springs, incorporating breathing patterns, meditative presence, and meridian stretches in sessions. He called this new form of aquatic bodywork Watsu, a contraction of Water Shiatsu. Dull discovered that Watsu induced deep relaxation, with profound physical and emotional effects. Dull, with his background in creative arts, poetry, and English teaching, originally focused on Watsu as a meditative and nurturing practice, and emphasized \\"heart connection\\". In the 1980s Dull practiced and developed the techniques with various volunteers from the Harbin community, primarily massage therapists and yoga practitioners. Originally Watsu was developed for everybody ‚Äì adolescents, young and old adults, pregnant women, athletes, and those suffering from stress. A wide variety of providers now offer Watsu, including psychologists, psychiatrists, physical therapists, massage therapists, and lay people. By the late 1980s and early 1990s physical therapists and other healthcare providers began to use Watsu with their patients for diverse orthopedic and neurologic conditions. In those early years, there was some resistance to Watsu among those trained in conventional healthcare, primarily because of the roots in Shiatsu and the close physical contact. As increasing numbers of therapists have incorporated Watsu into their treatment programs, Watsu gained increasing acceptance as a form of aquatic therapy, and Watsu is now practiced a spas, clinics, health centers, and hospitals worldwide.  Contributions  = Watsu = Dull is most notable for his work creating and developing Watsu. Watsu is a form of aquatic bodywork used for relaxation and passive aquatic therapy, characterized by one-on-one sessions in which a practitioner or therapist gently cradles, moves, stretches, and massages a receiver in chest-deep warm water. = Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA) = Dull founded the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA), and served as president for various years.

He lived there beginning in 1980 as a teacher and resident, owned and ran the massage school from 1985-2008, and helped design and build the extensive Watsu aquatic facilities. In 1979, the Niyama School of Healing Arts was established at Harbin Hot Springs. In 1985, the school was purchased by Harold Dull and renamed the School of Shiatsu and Massage, which was later bought and operated by the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA).

A prolific writer, Yeng's works have been translated into English, Malay , Dutch and Italian. Yeng has been a recipient of the Singapore Book Award, the Singapore Literature Prize (four times), and the Southeast Asian Writers Award (also known as the S.E.A. Write Award). For his contributions to the literary scene, Yeng was awarded the Cultural Medallion for Literature in 2003. Early life Yeng was born in the Bugis area of Singapore in 1947. His father was a Chinese physician who came from China and his mother worked in a coffee shop in the area. Yeng's parents married during the Japanese Occupation (1942‚Äì1945). Yeng graduated from Ngee Ann College with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Literature in 1969. As a student, Yeng excelled in Chinese and art classes at Catholic High School, Singapore, but scraped through or failed everything else. He decided to embark on writing after submitting a sonnet in lieu of an essay on any subject in Chinese class. His teacher gave him a good grade, and the poem was published in a newspaper. Career From 1978 to 1983, Yeng worked as a newspaper columnist for Nanyang Siang Pau writing for the column \\"Chang Hua Duan Shuo\\". In 1983, Nanyang Siang Pau merged with Sin Chew Jit Poh to become Lianhe Zaobao. Yeng continued contributing as a columnist for the newspaper's \\"Ren Zai Jiang Hu\\" column. Yeng became a full-time writer in the 1980s. He also wrote radio plays for Rediffusion and published many of his works. In 1987, he published a novel, Yi Ge Xiang Wo Zhe Yang De Nan Ren (A Man Like Me), which won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Award the following year. In 1994, Yeng spent a year in Hong Kong as a freelance columnist for United Daily News, Ming Pao, Sing Tao Daily and Sing Tao Evening News. He returned to Singapore later that year and reopened Grassroots Book Room until 2014. In 1995, he set up one of Singapore's most prominent Chinese bookstores, the Grassroots Bookroom, at Textile Centre. This was his second bookstore, after Vanguard Bookshop at Golden Mile Tower. In July 2014, Yeng sold Grassroots to his former customers‚Äîformer Lianhe Zaobao journalist and dramatist Lim Jen Erh, Lim Yeong Shin and medical doctor Lim Wooi Tee‚Äîwho reopened the bookstore at Bukit Pasoh Road in January 2015. In 2013, Yeng was the first writer-in-residence of the Nanyang Technological University Chinese department. He taught classes on Chinese literature and novel-writing and also started to devote more time to a novel about the lives of Cantonese opera actors. In 2014, two English translations of his novels were published in Singapore. Math Paper Press brought out Art Studio, translated by Goh Beng Choo and Loh Guan Liang, while Epigram Books released Trivialities About Me and Myself, translated by Howard Goldblatt. In 2015, The Straits Times' Akshita Nanda selected Art Studio as one of 10 classic Singapore novels. Reading it in its English translation, she called it \\"beautifully broad-minded in its attitude towards women's rights and inter- racial relations, nicely detailing some characters' slow awakening to the lessons one can learn in art and life outside a narrow circle.\\" Controversy In 1977, one of Yeng's friends falsely implicated him of being a communist. Yeng was detained under the Internal Security Act for alleged leftist sympathies. He spent most of those four months alone in prison, with his wife visiting him when she could. In 2012, Yeng was ordered to pay $10,000 in damages and $20,000 in costs to artist Tan Swie Hian. Tan had accused Yeng of libelling him in a 2005 letter which the latter had sent to The Straits Times and the National Arts Council. Personal life Yeng is married to Madam Goh Beng Choo, a translator and former journalist. They met in a bookstore, when Madam Goh was just a 16-year- old secondary school student and Yeng a poet and writer at Ngee Ann College (now Ngee Ann Polytechnic). The couple have one daughter, who is a freelance piano teacher. Yeng is a prostate cancer survivor. He was diagnosed in 2007, and his cancer is currently in remission.

NBC News Archaeological studies Sturdy Colls led a team of archeologists in the most recent excavations on the grounds of the Treblinka extermination camp Museum, resulting in the discovery of several floor tiles believed to have been used in the lining of the gas chambers. The tiles were made by Dziewulski & Lange ceramic factory in Opoczno. Her discovery became a subject of the Smithsonian film made for television. Approval for a limited archaeological study was issued for the first time in 2010 to a British team from Staffordshire using non-invasive technology and Lidar remote sensing notably, because neither the authorities nor the Jewish religious leaders in Poland allowed excavations at the camp out of respect for the dead. Sturdy Colls analyzed soil resistance at the site with ground- penetrating radar. Features that appeared to be structural were found, two of which were thought to be the remains of the gas chambers, and therefore the study was allowed to continue. The archaeological team discovered three new mass graves. At the site of the previously unknown foundations several yellow tiles were unearthed, pressed with a symbol D‚ú°L resembling a ‚ÄúStar of David‚Äù. The logo was soon identified as the pierced mullet star belonging to the Polish ceramics factory from Opoczno founded by Jan Dziewulski and brothers J√≥zef and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Lange. It was therefore not the Star of David as reported by the Israeli Ynet News service which made the announcement. The tiles located by the ground-penetrating radar were claimed to provide the first physical evidence of the existence of the gas chambers in Camp Two. Selected publications ;Books *Sturdy Colls, C.

Geraghty based on a story by Louis Sarecky. The film starred Ann Pennington, Arthur Lake, June Clyde, Dorothy Revier, Sally Blane and Albert Gran. In its first year of operations, RKO attempted to take advantage of musicals as much as possible, and so the music of Oscar Levant and Sidney Clare was awkwardly inserted into this simple comedy script. Plot Peggy is the daughter of Mr. Reynolds and his wife Sophie. Although married, both of the elder Reynolds are having romantic interludes with younger people, Mrs. Lyons-King and Roger Fleming, respectively. In addition, Peggy's sister, Janet, is infatuated with Clinton Darrow, a ne'er-do-well, who is only interested in the Reynolds' money, not in Janet. Peggy is in the only normal relationship, with her boyfriend, Bill. While at a seaside resort, Peggy attempts to get all of her family members back in line. However, things become convoluted as Mr. Reynolds is about to buy some useless shares of stock, having been convinced by Lyons-King, as Darrow begins to blackmail Janet due to some rather juicy letters she had sent to him. When Janet sneaks into Darrow's room, attempting to retrieve her letters, she is seen by her sister and Bill, who think she is sneaking in for other reasons. Janet is unsuccessful in her attempt to procure the incriminating letters. As Darrow steps up his blackmail threats, Janet can see no way out, so decides to kill him instead. However, during the attempted assassination, she mistakenly wounds Peggy, rather than her intended target. Bill, meanwhile has become fed up with all of the antics going on and is sundered from Peggy. Through a twisted process during a fake robbery, a friend of Peggy's, Roger Fleming, and his girlfriend, Tootie, obtain the letters from Darrow, thus ending the blackmail attempt. Peggy manages to straighten out both of her parents, and by the end of the film is reconciled with Bill.

He was a diplomat serving as a Consul in Belgrade. Her mother was a Drummond, of the family of Drummonds Bank. She grew up at Glamis Castle along with her younger cousin Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the future Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and learnt to drive a coach and four down Glamis drive. During her early years she met and learned from poets, writers, philosophers, and other intelligentsia. Writer P. G. Wodehouse, in particular, remained a friend and correspondent until his death; one of his last letters written was to her. Wodehouse dedicated his book The Pothunters to Ernestine Bowes-Lyon. In 1910, she married Francis Winstone Scott, and had two sons. They were divorced in 1918.Dod's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, eighty-first year, Dod's Peerage Ltd, 1921, p. 827Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, ed.

Their elopement was the cause of some scandal. She accompanied him to the Western Front, where she worked as a nursing assistant. They were reunited after the declaration of the Armistice. He, war-weary and uncertain of his future, asked her to return to her family. In protest at this, she shot herself in the chest with a revolver, but survived with the bullet lodged by her heart. In hospital she informed him that she was pregnant. Ronald and Ernestine moved to the chateau of Sus, near Navarrenx in the south west of France. Raoul Charles was born in 1919, and Raymond de Longueuil in 1921. Raoul became a naval aviator, and was killed over the North Sea in 1942 in pursuit of the Nazi Tirpitz Battleship. Raymond, the second born, inherited the title Baron de Longueuil.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, Burke's Peerage, Ltd, 2003, p. 3783 She enjoyed outdoor life as well as high society, knew her flowers and the stars, and sketched and painted in watercolour; in 1970 she had her own exhibition in France and was reviewed in a number of local papers. She told stories to her grandson Michael Grant about Glamis castle being haunted and her experiences there. She led quite a social life between Navarrenx and Pau, and with her husband travelled widely in Europe, especially Switzerland. She drove up until she was 85; usually a big Citroen DS classic. She had her hip replaced in 1976 and was swimming in the river six months later. In fact, she had been swimming in the local river up to six months before she died. The bullet lodged in her heart remained there for over 60 years until her death at age 89/90 at Navarrenx.

Participants in the LEND Network currently include approximately 60 civil society representatives, political activists, and civil servants from Tunisia and Moldova (approximately 30 from each country) and more than 50 international advisers, such as former senior-level government officials or experts in civil society. Overview The LEND Network is a global forum for exchanging information and expertise on democratization to support leaders as they work to build strong and accountable democratic institutions. It provides peer advice and support for leaders and policy makers in key emerging democracies around the world. The Network brings together devoted key leaders from the world‚Äôs newest democracies with former heads of states, leaders and scholars experienced with democratic transition, overcoming financial and logistical barriers that have limited such efforts in the past and enabling true professional dialogue over the virtual platform. This platform consists of a secure and invitation-only online portal which facilitates participants' real-time voice, video, and text communication with integrated text translation. This online platform is supplemented with in-person meetings based on relevant and timely subjects. The initiative is led by a Community of Democracies Working Group co-chaired by Estonia and the United States, and implemented by the Permanent Secretariat of the Community of Democracies. Communities within the platform are based on different key aspects of democratic transitions, including: constitutional reform, civil society, accountability, education, human rights, justice sector reform, diplomacy, local governance, and more. Announcement of the launch of the initiative in Ulaanbaatar (2012) To complement the online platform's facilitation of individual conversation and substantive participation from leaders and advisers, the Community of Democracies and Club de Madrid have also convened a number of face-to-face meetings between the participants. Face-to-face meetings have been held in Moldova, Sweden, Slovakia, and Tunisia. This includes a special workshop in Tunisia on constitution building, held at the peak of the constitutional crisis in Tunisia and largely contributing to the democratic discourse and the continuation of the peaceful consolidation process in the country. The LEND Network was formally launched on July 9, 2012 during a meeting of the Governing Council of the Community of Democracies in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet. Partners In addition to the Community of Democracies, Estonia, and the United States, the Club de Madrid has organized several events LEND Network participants, and the Network also collaborates with the Club de Tunis, USAID, and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

Life A native of Herefordshire, Hill was called to the bar as a member of the Middle Temple. In 1718 Hill became a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and a Fellow of the Royal Society 30 April 1719. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries on 3 January 1722 it was decided to attempt a complete history of British coins. Hill undertook to describe the Saxon coins in the Earl of Oxford's possession, while his own collection was to be catalogued by George Holmes. The plan was not carried through. A few years before his death Hill moved permanently to Herefordshire. He still corresponded with other antiquaries, especially Roger Gale and William Stukeley. A collection of thirty-five ancient Herefordshire deeds, most of them marked with Hill's name, was given by Joshua Blew, librarian of the Inner Temple and from Herefordshire, to Andrew Colt√©e Ducarel. Legacy At his dying request, Hill's father showed his Herefordshire collections to Samuel Gale in March 1728, who thought they couldn't be published. In 1752 Isaac Taylor of Ross bought the papers of Hill's brother, a schoolmaster in Herefordshire, for John Roberts, M.B., also of Ross, who indexed them and made additions. After Roberts's death in 1776 the collection, now about twenty volumes, passed back to Taylor, who sold them in 1778 to Thomas Clarke, F.S.A., principal registrar of the diocese of Hereford. On Clarke's death in March 1780 they came to the Rev. James Clarke. Clarke offered to sell them to John Allen the younger of Hereford, but they could not agree on a price. Via other hands and Belmont Priory, the papers came to Hereford City Library. Hill also wrote verse. Isaac Taylor had soliloquy of Hill's \\"on hearing a parent correct his child with curses\\". A more ambitious poem was mentioned by Maurice Johnson, junior, in a letter to Stukeley, dated 14 October 1719. Verses on Hill's death are in John Husband's Miscellany of Poems (pp. 134‚Äì40), Oxford, 1731, implying that Hill wrote some lines on \\"Eternity\\" about ten hours before his death. Works Between 1715 and 1717 Hill issued proposals for publishing by subscription a history of the city of Hereford. He proposed to follow this by another volume, a county history. The plan was printed in Richard Rawlinson's English Topographer,‚Äô 1720, pp. 71‚Äì3. Nothing came of the project. Hill showed the Society of Antiquaries in 1718 many drawings and plans from travels in the west of England that summer. One of his drawings, a west view and ichnography of Tintern Abbey, Monmouthshire, was engraved by J. Harris for John Stevens's History of Antient Abbeys, 1723. In 1722 he exhibited to the Society surveys of Ariconium and Hereford.

Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) argued that the bill should be passed in order to help the tourism industry in the area, but protecting the lookout point in question. The building had been scheduled to be removed as a result of a lawsuit by a group called the Wilderness Watch against the federal government for using various machinery and a helicopter to repair the lookout. The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 16, 2014. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act would amend the Washington State Wilderness Act of 1984, with respect to certain lands in the Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie and Wenatchee National Forests in the state of Washington that are designated as part of the Glacier Peak Wilderness, to specifically allow the operation and maintenance of Green Mountain Lookout. The lookout was built in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The bill would prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), through the United States Forest Service, from moving the lookout from its current location on Green Mountain in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest unless the secretary determines that its move is necessary to preserve the lookout or to ensure the safety of individuals on or around Green Mountain. The bill would require the secretary, if such a determination is made, to move the lookout to a location outside of the lands described in the act. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on December 19, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 404 would prevent the Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in Washington State unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors. Based on information provided by the Forest Service, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant net impact on the federal budget. Enacting S. 404 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. In 2012, a federal court ordered the Forest Service to remove a lookout structure from Green Mountain, located in the wilderness area. Under the bill, the agency would be authorized to remove the structure only if it poses a risk to public safety. Because the lookout was recently reconstructed, CBO expects that, under the bill, the agency would allow the structure to remain on the mountain for several years. As a result, CBO estimates, the Forest Service would not need to spend about $200,000 in appropriated funds to remove the structure; the amounts required to maintain the structure over the next five years would be minimal. The bill also would require the Secretary of the Interior to restore a land grant issued to an individual under the Alaska Native Veterans Allotment Act. The Department of the Interior (DOI) voided the original land grant when the agency determined that the affected lands were located within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. Because the affected lands are located within the refuge, the CBO expects that any activities that could generate offsetting receipts from those lands over the next 10 years would be prohibited, and we estimate that issuing the land grant would not affect the federal budget. S. 404 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. On September 3, 2013, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 908, the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 31, 2013. S. 404 contains provisions similar to those in H.R. 908 and additional provisions that would require the DOI to issue a land grant in Alaska. The estimated costs of implementing the bills are the same. Procedural history The Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act was introduced in the United States Senate on February 28, 2013, by Sen. Patty Murray (D, WA). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining. The bill was reported with an amendment on March 31, 2014 alongside Senate Report 113-140. The bill was passed by unanimous consent on April 3, 2014. On April 7, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 15, 2014. Debate and discussion During the debate, the Oso mudslide was declared a major disaster, and Senator Murray argued that the bill would be \\"a very small step in what will be a very long recovery\\" and that it would \\"provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term recovery of this area.\\" In Darrington, Washington, the mayor received a standing ovation when he announced that the bill had passed the Senate. Scott Morris, of the Darrington Historical Society, said that the passage of the bill in the House was a \\"relief\\" and that he had \\"lost track of how long we have been dealing with this.\\" The National Trust for Historic Preservation supported the bill; the president, Stephanie Meeks, stated that they were \\"pleased that Congress has acted to protect this historically significant and locally cherished landmark. With this vote, the House joins the Senate in affirming that the preservation of this historic resource is compatible with wilderness protection.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Acts of the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress ‚Äì Thomas S. 404 *beta.congress.gov S. 404 *GovTrack.us S. 404 *OpenCongress.org S. 404 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 404 *Senate Report 113-140 on S. 404 Category:United States federal public land legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States federal environmental legislation ","title":"Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act"},{"id":"42391752","text":"Vanessa Andr√©a Mesquita (born April 1, 1986 in Sao Paulo) is a Brazilian model, bodybuilder, activist and reality television personality best known for being the winner of the fourteenth season of the Brazilian version of the Big Brother, broadcast by Rede Globo in 2014.

In August 1862, the area through which the line was located came under Confederate States Army control for almost a year before it was reoccupied by Union forces. Because of its strategic location in southeastern Tennessee, about north of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and its connection with the important Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, the McMinnville and Manchester line and equipment was fought over, used and damaged by both Union and Confederate armies. In late August 1862, Confederate General Braxton Bragg began the Confederate Heartland Offensive, which culminated in the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, on October 8, 1862. Bragg intended to recruit troops and support in Kentucky and to divert the Union Army's attention from Chattanooga and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Union Major General Don Carlos Buell's army was in control of most of southeastern Tennessee. Buell decided to deploy his force to stop Bragg from marching on Nashville, Tennessee. Union Major General George H. Thomas held McMinnville with two divisions. Three other divisions were to the south at Altamont, Tennessee, where they could maneuver to concentrate at various points to block Bragg's routes to Nashville, although the terrain was rugged. Thomas thought that the army should concentrate at McMinnville, in part because the railroad provided a line of supply and in part because it would be easy for Bragg to bypass Altamont, which he did after a successful diversionary attack there by Confederate Colonel Joseph Wheeler's cavalry. After Buell decided to withdraw all of his forces to Murfreesboro, Tennessee and then to Nashville to protect against Bragg's offensive, he had to race north with his army when he realized Bragg's actual objective was Kentucky.

The Southwestern Railroad Company also had defaulted on the state bonds issued in aid of its construction and the chancery court at Nashville, Tennessee entered a decree against it on June 8, 1871, and on July 6, 1871, the railroad was ordered sold.Debow, 1900, p. 192. As with the McMinnville and Manchester, the railroad, franchises and property of the Southwestern Railroad were sold to the company itself, which subsequently sold them to the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway Company.Debow, 1900, p. 193. The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway Company built the extension of the McMinnville Branch line from McMinnville, Tennessee, to Sparta, Tennessee. After the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway Company completed the extension of the McMinnville line, the McMinnville Branch extended from Tullahoma, Tennessee, to Doyle, Tennessee. The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway later further extended the line to the Kentucky state line after it acquired the property and franchises of the Bon Air Railway Company on December 3, 1887.Debow, 1900, p. 199.

He is often referred to as Athollman. Personal life David Stewart was born at Garth Castle on 1 June 1772, the second son of Robert Stewart of Garth, Perthshire, and was descended from James Stewart (grandson of Robert II) who built Garth Castle, north-west of Aberfeldy, as a home for the chieftain of Clan Stewart of Atholl at the end of the fourteenth century. His mother was Janet Stewart, a cousin of his father. He was an officer in the Black Watch regiment. He was married to Christian Stewart, a cousin. They had a son, Neil Stewart and daughter, Jean Stewart. In 1819 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Lord Gray, Sir George Steuart Mackenzie and Sir David Brewster. In July 1822, after publishing his book, he succeeded to the estate of Garth by the death of his elder brother. When George IV visited Edinburgh in August 1822, Stewart helped Sir Walter Scott in the reception arrangements, headed the Celtic club in the procession, adjusted the royal plaid for the lev√©e, and pronounced the king ‚Äòa vera pretty man‚Äô (Lockhart). He was promoted to major- general on 27 May 1825, and in 1829 he went moved to Saint Lucia as governor. On 18 December 1829 he succumbed to the numerous wounds received during his military life, and died of fever on St Lucia.https://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/stewart_david.htm Military life He was given a commission as ensign in the 77th, (Atholl Highlanders) on 21 April 1783, but that regiment was disbanded soon afterwards. He joined the 42nd highlanders (later Black Watch) on 10 Aug. 1787, and became lieutenant on 8 Aug. 1792, and captain-lieutenant on 24 June 1796. He served with the 42nd in Flanders in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars under the Duke of York, and went with it to the West Indies in October 1795. As part of the Napoleonic wars, he took part in the capture of the French colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent. He was also in the unsuccessful expedition against Porto Rico (Battle of San Juan) in 1797. Stewart returned to Europe with his regiment, and garrison at Gibraltar. Stewart embarked there with the expedition which resulted in the capture of Minorca in November 1798 (Capture of Minorca (1798)). But he was taken prisoner at sea, and was detained for a total of five months in Spain before he was exchanged. He went to Egypt with Abercromby's expedition ((Egyption expedition)), and was severely wounded at the battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801. Three months before this, on 15 Dec. 1800, he had obtained a company in the 90th (Perthshire volunteers), but he returned to the 42nd on 23 July 1802. He obtained a majority in the 78th highlanders, on 17 April 1804, by raising recruits for the second battalion which was then being formed, a thing which his popularity in the highlands made easy to him. His men were so much attached to him that when he was at Shorncliffe army barracks, in the following year, Sir John Moore interposed to prevent his being sent to India to join the 1st battalion. He went with the 2nd battalion to the Mediterranean in September 1805, and shared in the descent on Calabria. At Maida, on 4 July 1806, under General John Stuart, he commanded a battalion of light companies and ensuring the defeat of the French under Jean Reynier outside the town. He was again severely wounded. He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the West India rangers on 21 April 1808, and took part in the capture of Guadaloupe in 1810. He received a medal with one clasp for this and the operation at Maida, and in 1815 he was made C.B. He was promoted colonel in the army on 4 June 1814, and in the following year he was placed on half-pay. Book In 1817, the officer commanding the 42nd, applied to Stewart for information regarding the history of the regiment, as its records had been lost. The inquiries which were undertaken by the request gradually developed into the Sketches of the Character... book, which was published in two volumes at Edinburgh in 1822. John Stuart Blackie stated of the book: : whose excellence shines forth on every page, has been the foundation of all subsequent works on the clans. The first two parts of it, dealing with the country and the people, occupy about half of the first volume; the remainder is devoted the annals of Scottish regiments. : Remarks on Colonel Stewart's Sketches of the Highlanders were published at Edinburgh in 1823, admitting its merits, but objecting to its Jacobite sympathies. Stewart had thoughts of writing a history of the rebellion of 1745, but gave it up.

The book was a special edition commemorative folio dedicated to Cuadra. The group, composed of major Filipino poets in English from the 1960s, selected a long poem written by Cuadra, a poem of not less than 1,000 lines. Joining his poem in the anthology were poems by Cesar Ruiz Aquino, Recah A. Trinidad, Erwin E. Castillo and Wilfredo Pascua Sanchez.

The game was delayed by an argument between the teams over the eligibility of a player. A verbal agreement had been made to allow only students who had attended classes at the respective university at least ten days prior, but Schultz, a fullback for A&M;, had not attended until two to three days prior, allegedly due to ill parents. Not believing the excuse, Baylor eventually prevailed in both the argument and the game, which ended in another squabble about the timekeepers' timekeeping. =Nov. 5 vs. Texas A&M;= Meeting for a second time in the season, Baylor and A&M; celebrated the first annual Central Texas Fair, located in Bryan, Texas, on its College Day with a football game in which A&M; handily defeated the Baylor team. =Nov. 23 vs. Add-Ran= Competing for the local championship, Baylor clearly outclassed their opponents and led in the first half by a comfortable 23‚Äì0 margin. =Nov. 28 vs. Texas A&M;= In what appeared to be the state's last collegiate football game day of the season, the game was called \\"the most interesting ever played on a Waco gridiron, because of the sensational clean and fast plays.\\" Having split the first two meetings of the season, both Baylor and the A.&M.;'s were seeking the tiebreaking victory; A&M; mistakenly contracted to play both the University of Texas and Baylor on the same day, and so split the team.

Career Phoenix was a collection of earlier poems by Cordevilla which were mostly published in the Philippines Graphic weekly magazine in the 1990s, especially the long poem, '\\"The Last Rose,\\" which was serialized in the magazine. Philippines Graphic's literary section was edited then by National Artist For Literature Nick Joaquin.

Filming began in Cornwall and Bristol in April 2014. The production company is Mammoth Screen. The production base for each series was The Bottle Yard Studios in Bristol, England, where purpose-built sets for Poldark's home 'Nampara' and The Red Lion pub have been located since series 1. For series 4, 18 sets were built across 3 studios at The Bottle Yard Studios, including five composite houses (Poldark in Cornwall and London, the Warleggans in Cornwall and London and the Whitworth Vicarage) and a period-correct scale replica of the House of Commons. Production offices, construction, prop workshops and extensive costume department were also based at the Studios. Filming locations include the north Cornwall coast at St Agnes Head, which represents the 'Nampara Valley', and the Botallack Mine near St Just in Penwith, which is featured as 'Wheal Leisure', the mine that Ross Poldark attempts to resurrect. The beach of Church Cove, Gunwalloe on the Lizard Peninsula was used as a location for a shipwreck scene.Cornish Coast stars in Poldark remake at National Trust. Retrieved 22 March 2015.

The service was created in 2010 by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The US government covertly developed the service as a long-term strategy to encourage Cuban youths to revolt against the nation's government, fomenting a \\"Cuban Spring.\\" The initiative also appears to have had a surveillance dimension, allowing \\"a vast database about Cuban ZunZuneo subscribers, including gender, age, 'receptiveness' and 'political tendencies'\\" to be built. The word \\"zunzuneo\\" is Cuban slang for a hummingbird's call. Contractors funded by USAID \\"set up a byzantine system of front companies using a Cayman Islands bank account, and recruit[ed] unsuspecting executives who would not be told of the company's ties to the US government,\\" according to an Associated Press (AP) report which traced the origin of the service. ZunZuneo, dubbed the \\"Cuban Twitter\\", reached at least 40,000 Cuban subscribers but was retired in 2012 without notice. According to AP the service was ended because of the expiration of the grant that funded the program. While initially the service attracted subscribers by having discussions on topics such as sports, the plans were to introduce political messages to encourage dissent. The AP released an expos√© on ZunZuneo in April 2014. Following the report, the US government acknowledged that it funded the service but denied that it was a covert program. According to a USAID spokesperson, the program was reviewed by the Government Accountability Office in 2013, and found to have been executed in accordance with US law. The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations requested documents about the program from USAID. In 2014, the US Office of Cuba Broadcasting announced that it was creating a successor, Piramideo. The platform is designed to spread anti-communist and pro-United States propaganda.

She wrote with her husband Allan Taylor as Allan Dwight. Their most successful novel was Drums in the Forest, first printed in 1936 and up to a 22nd printing in 1970. Most of her own novels were written as Anne Elliot. She also wrote as Anne Lattin, Nancy Dudley, Lynn Avery and Caroline Arnett. When working at Macmillan Publishers, she met Margaret Mitchell. Lois Cole was the first person outside the Mitchell family to read Gone with the Wind. Biography Lois Dwight Cole was born in 1903 in New York City. She received her BA at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1924. She worked at Macmillan Publishers, who sent her from New York to Atlanta in 1927. There she met Peggy Mitchell Marsh (who became better known by her pen-name Margaret Mitchell), and they became lifelong friends. Peggy introduced her to Turney Allan Taylor, a bachelor journalist, who later became Cole's husband. Cole and Taylor had two children. When Cole learned that Mitchell was writing a novel, she asked to see it, but Mitchell refused to let her or anyone else read it. Macmillan sent Lois back to New York in 1930, and promoted her to associate editor. Cole continued inquiring after Mitchell's novel, and in 1933 Mitchell replied that Lois would be the first to read it if it ever got finished. Cole introduced her boss, editor Harold Latham, to Mitchell in 1935. In April 1935, Mitchell gave him the manuscript to read, and Latham sent it on to Cole after having read the first few chapters. Mitchell later said that \\"John and Lois are the only persons I ever discussed it with in any detail\\" before she gave the manuscript to Latham. She continued to assist Mitchell and her husband John on one hand, and Latham on the other hand, in getting the book to a finished state. She edited the blurb, written by John, to its final state. Cole also promoted the book before its release, making sure that it was included in the Book of the Month Club selection. Finally, in April 1936, Macmillan produced the first printing of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. She then worked as editor at Whittlesey House and G. P. Putnam's Sons, before becoming the senior editor at first William Morrow and Company and finally Walker and Company. Cole died in 1979.

It is a delicacy of the Bugis and Makassar people of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and often consumed as a staple to replace steamed rice or ketupat. It is similar to lontong, but with richer flavour acquired from coconut milk. Buras is made by steaming the rice until half-cooked, then cooking further in coconut milk mixed with daun salam (Indonesian bay leaf) and salt until all of the coconut milk is absorbed into the rice. Then the half-cooked coconut milk rice is wrapped inside banana leaves in cylindrical or pillow shapes, secured with strings made from banana leaf fibers (or any kind of string). Usually, two cylinders of burasa are tied together as one. The rice packages are then steamed further until completely cooked. Buras can be consumed as a snack with serundeng (spiced and grated coconut granules), hard-boiled egg, or sambal kacang (spicy peanut sauce). Bugis and Makassar people often consumed burasa as a staple to replace steamed rice or ketupat, usually accompanied with Coto Makassar, konro, pallubasa or nasu lekku (chicken in galangal spice).

The fully automated trains would increase capacity on the Piccadilly, Central, Waterloo & City and Bakerloo lines. Deep Tube Upgrade Programme Mockup of Siemens \\"evo\\" concept proposal The Deep Tube Upgrade Programme (DTUP) originally covered the replacement of the trains and signalling on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines; it had been expanded to cover the eventual replacement of 1992 Stock that serves the Central and Waterloo & City lines. The EVO tube concept design, a lighter articulated train with walk-through cars, was introduced early in 2011. Siemens presented a response in 2011, a design with the weight reduced by and energy consumption reduced by 17 per cent, thus generating less heat to be dispersed in the tunnels. The trains would have a lower floor and 11 per cent higher passenger capacity than the current tube trains. Siemens presented a mock-up of its Inspiro design at The Crystal between October 2013 and January 2014. New Tube for London In early 2014 the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Central and Waterloo & City line rolling stock replacement project was renamed New Tube for London (NTfL) and moved from its feasibility stage to the design and specification stage. The study had shown that for new generation trains and re-signalling: * Piccadilly line capacity could be increased by 60% with 33 trains per hour at peak times by 2025. * Central line capacity increased by 25% with 33 trains per hour at peak times by 2030. * Waterloo & City line capacity increased by 50% by 2032, after the track at Waterloo station was remodelled. * Bakerloo line capacity could be increased by 25% with 27 trains per hour at peak times by 2033. The project is estimated to cost ¬£16.42 billion (¬£9.86 bn at 2013 prices). A notice was published on 28 February 2014 in the Official Journal of the European Union asking for expressions of interest in building the trains. On 9 October 2014 Transport for London (TfL) published a shortlist of those (Alstom, Siemens, Hitachi, CAF and Bombardier) who had expressed an interest in supplying 250 trains for between ¬£1.0 billion and ¬£2.5 billion; on the same day opened an exhibition with a design by PriestmanGoode. The fully automated trains may be able to run without drivers, but the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying it would affect safety. The invitation to tender for the trains was issued in January 2016 with the first train to run on the Piccadilly line in 2023.

Hormizd's revolt was finally suppressed in 283, and he was shortly executed under the orders of Bahram II, who appointed his own son Bahram III as the governor of Sakastan.

During his childhood Barlow lived in various locations in the West Midlands, his father having to move fairly frequently for his job with a bank. The family eventually settled in Wales due to his father‚Äôs ill health, a problem dating back to his military service in WW1. After his father died, in 1936, the Barlow family returned to Birmingham. Upon leaving school, James attended a commercial college before joining the Birmingham Corporation Water Department. At the outbreak of WW2 he enlisted with the RAF, serving as a gunner, then gunnery instructor before being invalided out with tuberculosis. He began writing during his long convalescence, initially contributing articles to aeronautical magazines. He later began to write articles and stories for other magazines, including Punch. After he had recovered his health, James returned to the Birmingham Corporation as a water rates inspector and began to write in earnest. His first novel, The Protagonists, drawing on his experiences in Wales and his time recovering from TB in a sanatorium, was published in 1956. Although receiving some critical acclaim with this and his next two books, he did not achieve real success until 1960, with the publication of The Patriots, a story of war veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life and drifting into a life of crime. In 1969 Barlow moved with his family to Tasmania in Australia but returned a few years later and settled in Ireland. He died suddenly on 30 January 1973 in Cork.

Mozzi‚ÄìChasles' theorem says that every Euclidean motion is a screw displacement along some screw axis.In kinematics, Chasles' theorem, or Mozzi‚ÄìChasles' theorem, says that the most general rigid body displacement can be produced by a translation along a line (called its screw axis or Mozzi axis) followed (or preceded) by a rotation about an axis parallel to that line. History The proof that a spatial displacement can be decomposed into a rotation and slide around and along a line is attributed to the astronomer and mathematician Giulio Mozzi (1763), in fact the screw axis is traditionally called asse di Mozzi in Italy. However, most textbooks refer to a subsequent similar work by Michel Chasles dating from 1830. Several other contemporaries of M. Chasles obtained the same or similar results around that time, including G. Giorgini, Cauchy, Poinsot, Poisson and Rodrigues. An account of the 1763 proof by Giulio Mozzi and some of its history can be found here. Proof Mozzi considers a rigid body undergoing first a rotation about an axis passing through the center of mass and then a translation of displacement D in an arbitrary direction. Any rigid motion can be accomplished in this way due to a theorem by Euler on the existence of an axis of rotation. The displacement D of the center of mass can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the axis. The perpendicular (and parallel) component acts on all points of the rigid body but Mozzi shows that for some points the previous rotation acted exactly with an opposite displacement, so those points are translated parallel to the axis of rotation. These points lie on the Mozzi axis through which the rigid motion can be accomplished through a screw motion. Another elementary proof of Mozzi‚ÄìChasles' theorem was given by E. T. Whittaker in 1904.E. T. Whittaker (1904) Suppose A is to be transformed into B. Whittaker suggests that line AK be selected parallel to the axis of the given rotation, with K the foot of a perpendicular from B. The appropriate screw displacement is about an axis parallel to AK such that K is moved to B. The method corresponds to Euclidean plane isometry where a composition of rotation and translation can be replaced by rotation about an appropriate center. In Whittaker's terms, \\"A rotation about any axis is equivalent to a rotation through the same angle about any axis parallel to it, together with a simple translation in a direction perpendicular to the axis.\\"  References  Further reading * Benjamin Peirce (1872) A System of Analytical Mechanics, III.

Early life Benetti was born 10 weeks prematurely and hospitalized for three months. During the three months in the hospital, Benetti had a respiratory illness while in intensive care that deprived his blood of oxygen. It is believed that caused his cerebral palsy, which was diagnosed when Benetti was a toddler. He underwent years of physical therapy and two surgeries to improve his ability to walk. In junior high, Benetti ran his school's NCAA tournament pool, and in high school he joined the radio broadcasters. Benetti's cerebral palsy prevented him from playing tuba during marching band season. Not wanting to exclude him, the band director asked him to serve as the halftime broadcaster for their marching events. Career In the mid-2000s, Benetti became a student at Syracuse University where he called lacrosse and women's basketball. After graduating, Benetti enrolled at Wake Forest University where he earned a law degree. While at Wake Forest, Benetti acted as the voice of High Point Panthers basketball games, Syracuse Chiefs baseball games, and high school football for Time Warner Cable Sports Channel. Benetti served as an intern for Chicago's sports radio station WSCR. In 2011 Benetti joined ESPN, where his broadcasting career would move him on to television, a medium he wanted to avoid when he was a kid. Benetti would call select college basketball games for ESPN3 and then move on to ESPN2 and ESPNU. In 2013 Benetti called his first football game for AAC Network. Beginning with the 2016 baseball season, Benetti replaced Ken Harrelson as the television play-by-play announcer for select Chicago White Sox home and road games. In May 2017, the White Sox announced Benetti would take over full-time play-by-play duties in 2019 upon the retirement of Harrelson.

The theorem is attributed to Michel Chasles (1793‚Äì1880). Benjamin Peirce followed Chasles work on that developed an analogy between conduction of heat and gravitational attraction: :A single current in a direction perpendicular to the level surfaces, and having a velocity proportionate to the decrease in density ‚Ä¶ is the law of propagation of heat, when there is no radiation, and hence arise the analogies between the levels and isothermal surfaces, and the identity of the mathematical investigations of the attraction of bodies and the propagation of heat which have been developed by Chasles.Peirce section 142 (end) Chaslesian shell is the figure that Peirce exploits:Section 143 :If an infinitely thin homogeneous shell is formed upon each level surface, of a system of bodies, having at each point a thickness proportional to the attraction at that point, the portion of either of these shells, which is included in a canal formed by trajectories, bears the same ratio to the whole shell, which the portion of another shell included in the same canal bears to that shell, provided there is no mass included between the shells. :The conception of these shells, and the investigation of their acting and reacting properties was original with Chasles, and it will be convenient, as it is appropriate, to designated them as Chaslesian shells. The Chasles theorem as expressed by Peirce:Section 145 (end) :The external level surfaces of a shell are the same with those of the original masses, and the attraction of the shell upon an external point has the same direction with the attraction of the original masses, and is normal to the level surface passing through the point. This theorem is due to Chasles. The ellipsoid is recruited to bound the Chaslesian shells:Section 143 :An infinitely thin homogeneous shell, of which the inner and outer surfaces are those of similar, and similarly placed, concentric ellipsoids, is a Chaslesian shell.

It was within the barony of Tulla Upper, but as of 1845 had recently been transferred to the barony of Bunratty Lower. It is and covers . The village of Kilmurry-Negaul is north of Sixmilebridge on the road to Quin. There is a large tract of fine arable country of a light limestone where the parishes of Quinn, Clonlea and Kilmurry-Negral meet. Antiquity The name Kilmurry means \\"Church of the Virgin Mary\\", but originally the parish may have been dedicated to an Irish saint. A holy well near the old church is dedicated to Saint Tobar Faoile. The castle of Rossroe, well-preserved in 1897, belonged to Fineen, son of Loghlen MacNamara, in 1580. The castle of Drumullan was in 1580 the property of Covea, son of Mahone MacNamara. The parish lay in MacNamara territory, and the families of this powerful sect would not abandon the Catholic faith. During the reign of King William III of England (1689‚Äì1702) John Lawson, an Englishman, was given the rectories of Quin, Tulloo, Cluony, Dowry, Templemaley, Kilraghtis and Kilmurry-Negaul. Opposite the record of this appointment was the note, \\"No cure served at present; noe church in repaire; the country all wast.\\" These had been seven of the best parishes in the county. On 18 March 1790 the vicarages of Kilseily, Bunratty, Clonlea, Clonloghan, Finogh, Kilconry, Killuran, Kilfinaghty, Kilmurrynegaul, Kilnoe and Tomfinlough were episcopally united in the Church of Ireland. In 1810 the Church of Ireland rectory of Kilmurraynegaul was valued in the King's books at ‚Ç§0.6.8 sterling. It was one of the parishes that made up the Union of Kilseily. As of 1837 the civil parish was part of the Catholic union of Sixmilebridge. The population was 980 in 1821 and had fallen to 628 in 1831. In 1841 the population had risen to 699 in 101 houses. The old burial ground in the village had the ruins of an old church in 1837. By 1897 all traces of the church had gone, but the graveyard surrounding it remained in use.

The museum produces the quarterly journal V√§sterbotten for the V√§sterbotten County district association.  The open-air museum with Sami camps  Midsummer celebrations at the open-air museum. Gammlia is an open-air museum that is an integrated part of the V√§sterbottens museum. The open-air museum has a collection of historical buildings and organizes activities to showcase what V√§sterbotten looked like in historical times. The buildings that can be viewed at Gammlia have been brought together from different parts of the county; including Helena Elisabeth Church, a manor house, a windmill, an 18th-century farmhouse, a school, a blacksmith shop and a number of Sami camps. During summertime Swedish native breeds of horses, cows, sheep, pigs and chickens are on display in the open-air museum. Among the daily activities are butter churning, baking bread tunnbr√∂d, crafts and handicrafts. The farms are open for viewing from mid-June to late August, and during the annual Christmas market. The outdoor area is always open to visitors. The name Gammlia is based on Gamli, which was the winning entry in a naming contest that the historical society organized in conjunction with Gammlia's completion. Gamli is a paraphrase of the words \\"den gamla liden\\" (\\"the old hillside\\")..  History  The V√§sterbotten County Antiquarian Society reached a decision at a meeting in January 1886 that \\"as a storage room for antiquities a museum shall be established in Ume√•.\\" It was initially located in the Ullbergska property in what nowadays is the block Thor on Storgatan. The Southern department's collection of objects were completely destroyed by the great city fire in Ume√• on 25 June 1888, when most of the city was destroyed. In 1901, the establishment relocated to the newly built grammar school. Due to the increasing size of the collection, the museum moved to the large warehouse by the city port in 1911. From the very start the local historical society, which was formed in 1919, was working for the establishment of a museum building in the Gammlia area. The building was completed in 1939. Between 1921 and 1990, various older buildings from V√§sterbotten County were moved to the area. The original plan was to have a farm from the northern part of the county and one from the south, but because of high costs it was instead decided to compile some buildings from the north and some from the south of V√§sterbotten into a single farm. In 1928, a ski museum was inaugurated in a ski jump tower in the recreational area Fiskartorpet at Norra Djurg√•rden in Stockholm. In 1963, the collections were moved to the Swedish Ski Museum in Ume√•. One of the museum's artefacts is the world's oldest ski.2014 Capital of Culture: highlights of Ume√•, Sweden, The Telegraph, retrieved 6 May 2014 The main building of V√§sterbottens museum was designed by the architect Bengt Romare and was constructed in 1943. The museum has since expanded several times and one of the largest expansions in 1981 made it possible for Bildmuseet ‚Äì a contemporary art museum of Ume√• University ‚Äì to move in. In 2012, Bildmuseet relocated to a new building on the Ume√• Arts Campus and V√§sterbottens museum was thus able to expand in its previous premises.

It took its name from a German legend which stated that the fall of the Hohenzollern dynasty would be announced by the appearance of a woman wearing white. Network Walth√®re Dew√© The Dame Blanche network was founded in 1916 by Walth√®re Dew√©, an engineer working in a telegraph and telephone company in Brussels. The decision resulted from the arrest and execution of Dew√©'s cousin, Dieudonn√© Lambrecht, who had himself founded an intelligence network codenamed \\"Lambrecht\\". In order to save the group, Dew√© took control and developed it under the name Dame Blanche. The network was at first affiliated to the British military intelligence service Cameron Folkstone. After constant infiltration by German counter-espionage it reverted to MI6 at Rotterdam where they were handled by Captain Henry Landau. After the end of the war, Mansfield Smith-Cumming, head of MI6, estimated that Dame Blanche had supplied as much as 70 percent of all military intelligence collected by Allied intelligence services world-wide, not merely that from German-occupied Belgium and northern France.Ruis, Edwin. Spynest. British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914-1918. Briscombe: The History Press, 2016. By the end of the war, its 1,300 agents covered all of occupied Belgium, northern France and, through a collaboration with Louise de Bettignies' network, occupied Luxembourg. The network was known for its high proportion of female members; women may have made up as much as 30 percent of its total personnel. During the second German occupation of Belgium in World War II, Dew√© used the experience of the Dame Blanche network to start a new network, codenamed Clarence. He was shot and killed while trying to avoid capture by the Germans in 1944.

Lithograph by Friedrich Kriehuber (1870) Defenestration of Prague of 1618 (1848) Karel Svoboda (14 June 1824, Pl√°nice - 13 September 1870, Vienna) was a Czech/Austrian painter, primarily of historical scenes, which are notable for their accurate detail. He worked in Prague and Vienna.  Life  He was orphaned at an early age and went to live with his uncle V√°clav, who was a professor at the Gymnasium in Prague. Karel learned both philosophy and drawing under his tutelage. His talent attracted the attention of Count Franz von Thun, who helped him to enter the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied under Christian Ruben.Bohemia and the ƒåechs, by Will Seymour Monroe. L. C. Page & Co. (1910) His painting of the second Defenestration of Prague was widely admired and prompted Ljudevit Gaj to invite him to Zagreb, where he lived for several months, painting local characters and scenes from Illyrian history. Later that year, he married the daughter of composer and, in 1851, moved to Vienna. Despite relocating, he took an assignment to create historical murals at Queen Anne's Summer Palace (Le Belv√©d√®re) back in Prague. Over the next few years, he executed several major commissions, including posters for the Five-hundredth Anniversary of Vienna in 1865. He also served as a drawing instructor at the Gymnasium in Schottenfeld (Neubau) and provided illustrations for several books of poetry, including the \\"Rukopis Kr√°lov√©dvorsk√Ω\\" (K√∂niginhofer Handschrift), a Medieval song collection which became the source of much controversy, as it was believed to be a forgery by the Czech philologist V√°clav Hanka (an assertion which later proved to be true, although the arguments continue even now). He exhibited widely and painted eleven frescoes at the Bishop's Palace in Czernowitz as well as ten panels on the story of \\"Iphigenia\\" for the Vienna State Opera. Many of works were reproduced as woodcuts or on copperplate. His wife died in 1869 and he died a year later, of a heart attack, at the \\"Florence Spa\\".

Symptoms can be any combination of myopathic, hepatopathic, or encephalomyopathic. These syndromes affect tissue in the muscle, liver, or both the muscle and brain, respectively. The condition is typically fatal in infancy and early childhood, though some have survived to their teenage years with the myopathic variant and some have survived into adulthood with the SUCLA2 encephalomyopathic variant. There is currently no curative treatment for any form of MDDS, though some preliminary treatments have shown a reduction in symptoms. Signs and symptoms All forms of MDDS are very rare. MDDS causes a wide range of symptoms, which can appear in newborns, infants, children, or adults, depending on the class of MDDS; within each class symptoms are also diverse. In MDDS associated with mutations in TK2, infants generally develop normally, but by around two years of age, symptoms of general muscle weakness (called \\"hypotonia\\"), tiredness, lack of stamina, and difficulty feeding begin to appear. Some toddlers start to lose control of the muscles in their face, mouth, and throat, and may have difficulty swallowing. Motor skills that had been learned may be lost, but generally the functioning of the brain and ability to think are not affected. In MDDS associated with mutations in SUCLA2 or SUCLG1 that primarily affect the brain and muscle, hypotonia generally arises in infants before they are 6 months old, their muscles begin wasting away, and there is delay in psychomotor learning (learning basic skills like walking, talking, and intentional, coordinated movement). The spine often begins to curve (scoliosis or kyphosis), and the child often has abnormal movements (dystonia, athetosis or chorea), difficulty feeding, acid reflux, hearing loss, stunted growth, and difficulty breathing that can lead to frequent lung infections. Sometime epilepsy develops. In MDDS associated with mutations in RRM2B that primarily affect the brain and muscle, there is again hypotonia in the first months, symptoms of lactic acidosis like nausea, vomiting, and rapid deep breathing, failure to thrive including the head remaining small, delay or regression in moving, and hearing loss. Many body systems are affected. The Charlie Gard case was associated with this sub form of the disease. In MDDS associated with mutations in DGUOK that primarily affect the brain and the liver, there are two forms. There is an early-onset form in which symptoms arise from problems in many organs in the first week of life, especially symptoms of lactic acidosis as well as low blood sugar. Within weeks of birth they can develop liver failure and the associated jaundice and abdominal swelling, and many neurological problems including developmental delays and regression, and uncontrolled eye movement. Rarely within this class of already rare diseases, symptoms only relating to liver disease emerge later in infancy or in childhood. In MDDS associated with mutations in MPV17 that primarily affect the brain and the liver, the symptoms are similar to those caused by DGUOK and also emerge shortly after birth, generally with fewer and less severe neurological problems. There is a subset of people of Navajo descent who develop Navajo neurohepatopathy, who in addition to these symptoms also have easily broken bones that do not cause pain, deformed hands or feet, and problems with their corneas. In MDDS associated with mutations in POLG that primarily affect the brain and the liver,This form of MDDS is also called \\"Alpers' disease\\", also called \\"Alpers' syndrome\\", \\"Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome\\", \\"progressive sclerosing poliodystrophy\\", and \\"progressive infantile poliodystrophy\\". It is named after Bernard Jacob Alpers () and Peter Huttenlocher (see ) the symptoms are very diverse and can emerge anytime from shortly after birth to old age. The first signs of the disease, which include intractable seizures and failure to meet meaningful developmental milestones, usually occur in infancy, after the first year of life, but sometimes as late as the fifth year. Primary symptoms of the disease are developmental delay, progressive intellectual disability, hypotonia (low muscle tone), spasticity (stiffness of the limbs) possibly leading to quadriplegia, and progressive dementia. Seizures may include epilepsia partialis continua, a type of seizure that consists of repeated myoclonic (muscle) jerks. Optic atrophy may also occur, often leading to blindness. Hearing loss may also occur. Additionally, although physical signs of chronic liver dysfunction may not be present, many people suffer liver impairment leading to liver failure. In MDDS associated with mutations in PEO1/C10orf2 that primarily affect the brain and the liver, symptoms emerge shortly after birth or in early infancy, with hypotonia, symptoms of lactic acidosis, enlarged liver, feeding problems, lack of growth, and delay of psychomotor skills. Neurologically, development is slowed or stopped, and epilepsy emerges, as do sensory problems like loss of eye control and deafness, and neuromuscular problems like a lack of reflexes, muscular atrophy, and twitching, and epilepsy. In MDDS associated with mutations in the genes associated with mutations in ECGF1/TYMP that primarily affects the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms can emerge any time in the first fifty years of life; most often they emerge before the person turns 20. Weight loss is common as is a lack of the ability of the stomach and intestines to automatically expand and contract and thus move through it (called gastrointestinal motility) ‚Äì this leads to feeling full after eating only small amounts of food, nausea, acid reflux, All affected individuals develop weight loss and progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility manifesting as early satiety, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain and swelling. People also develop neuropathy, with weakness and tingling. There are often eye problems, and intellectual disability. Causes MDDS is caused by mutations that may be inherited from the parents or may form spontaneously during development of the fetus. MDDS is associated with mutations in the genes TK2, SUCLA2, RRM2B, DGUOK, POLG, TYMP, SUCLG1, and TWNK. Myopathic MDS is strongly correlated to a variety of mutations in the gene TK2, seeing a reduction of TK2 activity to less than 32% in people with MDS found with the mutation. Because TK2 plays a key role in the mitochondrial salvage pathways of several deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), a lowered activity would lead to less cycling of nucleotides. This lack of nucleotide recycling is detrimental since the mitochondria cannot synthesize entirely new deoxynucleotides, and the inner membrane of the mitochondria prevents the negatively charged nucleotides of the cytosol from entering. The SUCLA2 gene codes for the beta- subunit of SCS-A. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of succinate and coenzyme A into succinyl-CoA, but is also associated with the complex formed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) in the last step of the dNTP salvage pathway. The RRM2B gene, which is expressed in the cell nucleus, codes for one of two versions of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, which generates nucleotide precursors required for DNA replication by reducing ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates. The version of R2 encoded by RRM2B is induced by TP53, and is required for normal DNA repair and mtDNA synthesis in non-proliferating cells. The other form of R2 is expressed only in dividing cells. The DGUOK gene encodes for mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides into nucleotides. POLG encodes for the catalytic subunit pol Œ≥A, which is part of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. Other causes are mutations of thymidine phosphorylase (TyMP), succinate-CoA ligase, alpha sub unit (SUCLG1) and TWNK (also known as PEO1 and C10orf2). Diagnosis MDDS is diagnosed based on systemic symptoms presenting in infants, followed by a clinical examination and laboratory tests (for example, high lactate levels are common) medical imaging, and usually is finally confirmed and formally identified by genetic testing. =Classification= MDDS are a group of genetic disorders that share a common pathology ‚Äî a lack of functioning DNA in mitochondria. There are generally four classes of MDDS: * a form that primarily affects muscle associated with mutations in the TK2 gene; * a form that primarily affects the brain and muscle associated with mutations in the genes SUCLA2, SUCLG1, or RRM2B; * a form that primarily affects the brain and the liver associated with mutations in DGUOK, MPV17, POLG, or TWNK (also called PEO1); and * a form that primarily affects the brain and the gastrointestinal tract associated with mutations in ECGF1 (also called TYMP). Treatment There are no treatments for MDDS, but some of the symptoms can be managed. For survivors living with MDDS, there are drugs to control epilepsy, and physical therapy can help with muscle control. Liver transplants may benefit people with liver involvement. Prognosis =Myopathic form = The TK2 related myopathic form results in muscle weakness, rapidly progresses, leading to respiratory failure and death within a few years of onset. The most common cause of death is pulmonary infection. Only a few people have survived to late childhood and adolescence. = Encephalomyopathic form = SUCLA2 and RRM2B related forms result in deformities to the brain. A 2007 study based on 12 cases from the Faroe Islands (where there is a relatively high incidence due to a founder effect) suggested that the outcome is often poor with early lethality. More recent studies (2015) with 50 people with SUCLA2 mutations, with range of 16 different mutations, show a high variability in outcomes with a number of people surviving into adulthood (median survival was 20 years. There is significant evidence (p = 0.020) that people with missense mutations have longer survival rates, which might mean that some of the resulting protein has some residual enzyme activity. RRM2B mutations have been reported in 16 infants with severe encephalomyopathic MDS that is associated with early-onset (neonatal or infantile), multi-organ presentation, and mortality during infancy. =Hepatopathic form = DGUOK, POLG, and MPV17 related forms result in defects to the liver. Liver dysfunction is progressive in the majority of individuals with both forms of DGUOK-related MDS and is the most common cause of death. For children with the multi-organ form, liver transplantation provides no survival benefit. Liver disease typically progresses to liver failure in affected children with MPV17-related MDS and liver transplantation remains the only treatment option for liver failure. Approximately half of affected children reported did not undergo liver transplantation and died because of progressive liver failure ‚Äì the majority during infancy or early childhood. A few children were reported to survive without liver transplantation. Research Nucleoside bypass therapy is an experimental treatment aimed to restore the normal levels of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) in mitochondria.

He was one of the founder of the community of Ny- √Ölesund on the island of Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway. Biography Brandal was born at the village of Brandal on the island of Hareidlandet in M√∏re og Romsdal, Norway. He was the son of Sevrin Olavius Martinus Larsen (1847‚Äì1934) and Davida Petersdatter (1842‚Äì1903). He started working as a fisher after confirmation and bought his first vessel in 1891. Eight years later it participated in its first Arctic Ocean sealing expedition. Brandal participated in a fur hunting expedition to Greenland in 1901. His fleet gradually increased, with focus on Arctic Ocean sealing. He stopped active seamanship in 1911 and became a manager for the fleet. Besides the hunting of seals, it now also hunted walrus. Brandal was also engaged in the processing of products from fishing activities through the establishment of a herring factory.Hanoa, p. 11. During World War I, Norwegian access to a coal supply was limited. Brandal bought the coal mining claims at Kongsfjorden on Svalbard in 1916 for 250,000 Norwegian krone.Hanoa, p. 10. He established Kings Bay Kull Comp. A/S (KBKC) that year and started mining that summer. The following year his company established the town of Ny-√Ölesund. During the first years, several names were in use for the settlement, including Kings Bay, Kingsbay and Brandal City. Ny-√Ölesund came into use in the early 1920s. Later Trygve Klausen, Michael Knutsen and Trygve Jervell joined Brandal as co-owners of the company.Hanoa, p. 12. Production started quickly, but the company eventually met difficulties throughout the 1920s. Low coal prices due to the international financial crisis led to the total loss of 1929. After all mining operations in Ny-√Ölesund were stopped, the Norwegian state acquired all the shares in KBKC in 1933.

He was previously the voice of Georgia Tech football and men's basketball, as well as Butler men's basketball. He has also called various NCAA championships for Turner Sports and select ACC baseball and basketball games on ESPN3. Early life Gaudin was born and raised in Evansville, Indiana. He was a huge Atlanta Braves fan and wrote a letter to Skip Caray asking how to get into sports broadcasting. Caray responded and encouraged him to practice, critique, and practice some more. Gaudin kept those words in his heart, and in high school convinced a local radio station to allow him to broadcast some of his school's baseball games. After graduation from Harrison High School,http://www.courierpress.com/news/local/evansville-native-brandon- gaudin-will-be-voice-of-madden-nfl-17-video- game-34c589af-7599-0371-e053-0-382235071.html Gaudin enrolled at Butler University where he would graduate with a communications degree with an emphasis in broadcasting. He also majored in Political Science and received a minor in Business. He was named a \\"Top 10 Male Student\\" at Butler and given the distinction of the \\"Most Outstanding Communications Student\\" in his class. Career Gaudin's first post-college job was broadcasting Minor League baseball for the Orem Owlz, an affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. After one season with Orem, Gaudin took an on-air hiatus to assist in the formation of a New York City start-up with two former bosses at ESPN, where he interned during college. Gaudin, along with Erik Sorenson, the former President of MSNBC, and former Larry King Live Producer Robert Grossman founded MediaOne Management in 2007. The boutique firm specializes in the representation of cable news talking heads. Gaudin left New York in the fall of 2008 for the opportunity to get back on air in his hometown of Evansville, Indiana as the Voice of the Evansville Purple Aces. He also served as a freelance on-air talent for the local ABC affiliate. From there, Gaudin returned to Butler, serving three years as the Voice of the Butler Bulldogs. He was hired on the heels of Butler's 2010 run to the National Championship game where they fell to Duke; however, he was on the mic the following season when Butler returned to the Final Four in 2011. During his time at Butler, the Indianapolis Star called Gaudin \\"a rising star in the industry\\". While in Indianapolis, he also began freelance play-by-play work for Turner Sports via their partnership with the NCAA, broadcasting various collegiate championships. In 2013. Gaudin was hired to be the voice of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. His predecessor, Wes Durham, had moved on to call SEC and ACC games for FSN. Gaudin won the job from a long list of over 150 nationwide candidates. Gaudin's hiring was featured in The New York Times where a Vice President for rights-holder IMG noted \\"Gaudin's vocal stylings jumped off the page.\\" Gaudin would call his first game for the Yellow Jackets on August 31, 2013. During his time at Tech, Gaudin was hired by Westwood One as a play-by-play broadcaster for their men's basketball NCAA Tournament and college football coverage. In June 2016, it was announced that Gaudin would replace Jim Nantz as the Play-by-Play Voice of the Madden NFL video game for EA Sports. In releasing the news, EA Producer Christian McLeod said \\"What really attracted us to Brandon was he just sounds like sports.\\" Previous announcers for the game besides Nantz have included Pat Summerall, Al Michaels, John Madden, Cris Collinsworth, Tom Hammond, Gus Johnson and Phil Simms. Also in June 2016, Gaudin was signed by the Big Ten Network to broadcast football, basketball and baseball in addition to expanding his role in college and the NFL as a play-by-play voice for Westwood One. Several of Gaudin's calls have been featured on ESPN's SportsCenter Play of the Day as well as the Dan Patrick Show. One of the springboards to Gaudin's career came during his junior year in college when he won a nationwide Play-by-Play competition sponsored by CBS during the 2005 NCAA Tournament. For winning the award, Gaudin was flown to the Final Four and interviewed at halftime on CBS by Greg Gumbel.

A heated argument followed with Godard punching Quarrier.Stephen Glynn: Film Reviews ‚Äì Sympathy for the Devil. In: Scope. No. 7, February 2007. Requested on June 16, 2013. Quarrier was a close friend of Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate. On 8 August 1969, the night of the murder of Tate and four other people by the Manson Family, he had been invited by Tate to her house. However, he was delayed during filming of Vanishing Point in the California desert (Quarrier was a creative associate on the film). Arriving late in Los Angeles he decided not to bother the pregnant Tate at such a late hour and traveled onto the Vanishing Point wrap party instead.Mim Scala: Diary of a Teddy Boy. A Memoir of the Long Sixties. The Goblin Press, 2009. . S. 117‚Äì118. His last film role was in 1968's Wonderwall. After Tate's death, Quarrier retired from the film business. Later life After suffering a mental breakdown in 1972, Quarrier spent time at Bethlem Royal Hospital. In 1996, Quarrier received a police caution for indecently assaulting two girls. On 7 October 2008, Quarrier pleaded guilty at Blackfriars Crown Court to the attempted abduction of a five-year-old girl in a busy supermarket in Ladbroke Grove, West London. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Two weeks prior to the incident, Quarrier had attempted to 'purchase' a nine-year-old girl in the same supermarket. Quarrier also received a Prohibitive Activity Order, banning him from unsupervised contact with children under the age of 16 years. He was also ordered to comply with an alcohol treatment directed by his probation officer.http://squaremilenews.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/sixties-movie-star-tried- to-abduct.html Sixties Movie Star Tried To Abduct Screaming 5 Year-Old Girl Quotes > [Iain Quarrier] reflects the gilded youth of swinging sixties London, the > glittering Bohemian inner circle of beautiful people.

It is native to New Guinea, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia, where it attacks and kills living trees and damages structural timbers. Description Termites are social insects with a caste system, and individuals are either workers, soldiers, or reproductives. A C. elisae worker measures between in length and has a rounded head with large eyes. The pronotum is broad and both it and the head are densely hairy. The antennae have 20 to 22 flagellomeres (segments). A soldier is rather larger than a worker and has a rounded head and large incurved mandibles. Its antennae usually have 16 flagellomeres. The fontanelle, a pore gland on the forehead which secretes a milky fluid, can easily be seen from above. The pronotum is long with about 70 setae (bristles), mostly near the margins, and the mesothorax, metathorax, and abdomen are also densely bristly. These features help distinguish this species from other termites found in the same region. Distribution and habitat C. elisae is native to the forests of New Guinea, where it is widely distributed, and is also found in New Ireland. Since it has been determined that C. curvignathus is a synonym of C. elisae, its range has been extended northwards through Indonesia and the Philippines to the Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Ecology C. elisae primarily attacks both young and old evergreen trees in the genus Araucaria, the klinkii (A. klinkii) and the hoop pine (A. cunninghamii), but is also known to attack other hosts such as the taun tree (Pometia pinnata), Hopea trees, the papaya (Carica papaya), and the mango (Mangifera indica) A parasitic fungus, Antennopsis gayi, is sometimes found growing on the body of C. elisiae and the rove beetle Coptophysa obesa is sometimes found living inside the termite colony. Damage C. elisae is considered to be an extremely severe pest. The termites enter a tree through an injury to the bark and tunnel into the interior, where they eat the wood and often cause the death of the host. In plantations of hoop pine, groups of up to 20 trees may be infected and die, attacked by termites foraging from one central nest via tunnels to neighbouring trees. Trees older than 21 years seem less prone to attack. In Malaysia, C. elisae has made the establishment of plantations of certain exotic tree species very difficult, attacking every tree in some new plantations of Pinus and Araucaria. Control may be attempted by excavating the nest and removing the queen reproductive, or in new plantations, by the use of explosives.

Additionally, Ocean Networks Canada operates smaller community-based observatories offshore from Cambridge Bay, Nunavut.,Juniper and McLean, 2014 Campbell River, Kitamaat Village and Digby Island. These observatories collect data on physical, chemical, biological, and geological aspects of the ocean over long time periods. As with other ocean observatories such as ESONET, Ocean Observatories Initiative, MACHO and DONET, scientific instruments connected to Ocean Networks Canada are operated remotely and provide continuous streams of freely available data to researchers and the public. Over 200 gigabytes of data are collected every day.Dewey et al, 2013 The VENUS Observatory is situated at three main sites in the Salish Sea, including Saanich Inlet (depth 100 m), the eastern and central Strait of Georgia (depths 170‚Äì300 m), and the Fraser River delta. The NEPTUNE observatory is situated off the west coast of Vancouver Island in Barkley Sound, along the Cascadia subduction zone, on the Cascadia Basin abyssal plain, and on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.Barnes et al, 2011 Altogether, the system includes 3 observatories, 5 shore stations, 850+ km of seafloor backbone cables, 11 instrumented sites, 32 instrument platforms, 6 mobile instrument platforms, 400+ instruments and over 2000 scientific sensors deployed.Heesemann et al, 2013 Scientific topics of study that are enabled by data from these observatories include Arctic oceanography,Juniper and McLean, 2014 deep-sea biodiversity,Matabos et al, 2013 marine ecosystem function,Wang and Pawlowicz, 22014 marine forensics,Anderson 2010 gas hydrates,Riedel and Willoughby, 2010 hydrothermal vents,Bemis et al, 2012 marine mammals,Andr√© et al, 2011 sedimentKatz et al, 2012 and benthicRobert et al, 2012 dynamics and tsunamiFine et al, 2013 studies.  Study sites  Ocean Networks Canada instrumentations are installed in the following seafloor locations: = Salish Sea = Ocean Networks Canada installations and data sources in the Salish Sea.  Saanich Inlet  2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations in Saanich Inlet between Sidney and Mill Bay, BC, on the east coast of Vancouver Island. This is one of the sites on the VENUS observatory. The University of Victoria's Ocean Technology Test Bed is located here as well. Saanich Inlet, at the southern end of Vancouver Island, Canada, is a naturally hypoxic basin. A shallow sill (70 m) at the mouth isolates the deep basin (215 m) that experiences seasonal deep-water anoxia as a result of high primary productivity and subsequent degradation of sedimented organic matter.Matabos, Tunnicliffe et al, 2012 The Saanich Inlet network consists of cabled arrays of instruments in Mill Bay, Patricia Bay and an autonomous mooring at the entrance (sill) to the inlet. Two cabled surface buoys are connected to the Patricia Bay installation, supporting a technology testbed facility (Patricia Bay) and a full water column observation station (Coles Bay). Patricia Bay installations include: * Seafloor network at 100 m depth connected to a shore station at the Institute of Ocean Sciences * Surface buoy based Ocean Technology Testbed designed and built to support engineering and technology development. * Surface based Buoy Profiling System (BPS) designed and built for water column measurements off Coles Bay in central Saanich Inlet. * Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (\\"Bluefin\\") In Mill Bay, a mini-observatory is installed at Brentwood College with basic sensors that measure water properties at 8 m depth.

Located at the leading edge of the Cascadia subduction zone, this site supports the study of the accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the continental slope as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are just right for exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. Gas hydrates have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within ‚Äúcages‚Äù of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor. The region is influenced by a major ocean current system. Off the coast, the west wind drift current splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the California current system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large submarine canyon acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the continental slope to the deep- sea. Organisms living in the depths of Barkley Canyon have evolved to be able to persist in areas with high pressure, no light, and low nutrients/food availability. The Barkley Canyon instruments span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized biological community. Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including sablefish, thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and eelpouts have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, sea pens, and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.Juniper et al, 2013 Where gas hydrates are observed on the seafloor, there are mats of chemosynthetic bacteria which derive their energy from hydrogen sulphide produced by the oxidate of methane by a second group of microbes living deep within the sediments. Other chemosynthetic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria live in symbiosis with clams who live at these hydrate mounts. Many of the species observed elsewhere in Barkley Canyon are not dependent on this system but are frequently observed in the area.  Cascadia Basin  2013 layout of installations at Ocean Networks Canada's Cascadia Basin site on the NEPTUNE observatory. The Cascadia Basin is the heavily sediment part of the Juan de Fuca Plate that extends from the base the continental margin to the west where the sediments lap on to the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank. The Juan de Fuca Plate is one of the last remnants of the Farallon Plate, the original eastern Pacific oceanic plate, which has been almost entirely subducted beneath North America. The flat sediment surface constitutes an abyssal plain, an exceedingly vast environment that covers over 50% of the planet‚Äôs surface. Seemingly inhospitable, with temperatures below 2 ¬∞C, high-pressures, and a total absence of light, the Cascadia Basin is nevertheless home to an assortment of well-adapted organisms. Depending mostly on marine snow‚Äîthe continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from surface waters‚Äîlittle is known about the complicated food web connecting the organisms of the deep. Because of the harsh environment, there is a low density of organisms observed. Despite the low density, there is a fairly diverse community living on the abyssal plain. Installation and maintenance work has enabled a number of these organisms to be observed. The main groups of organisms observed include fish (skates and rattails), echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, and crinoids), molluscs (octopus and squid), sea pens, crabs, and squat lobsters. A number of pelagic (living in the water column) organisms were observed such as squid, jellyfish, ostracods, ctenophores, and salps. A few isolated outcropping seamounts that pierce through more than 200 m of impermeable sediments, are conduits that allow hydrologic exchange between the open ocean and the upper oceanic crust‚Äîthe largest aquifer of the planet. The Cascadia Basin site is placed in the vicinity of several circulation obviation retrofit kit (CORK) borehole observatories, which are designed to study the hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology of the upper oceanic crust. CORKs are also being used to investigate changes in regional plate strain that are caused by earthquakes on the plate boundaries. The seafloor pressure measurements of the CORK borehole observatories constitute the center of a ‚Äútsunami-meter‚Äù, a network of several high precision, rapid sampling bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), that allows precise determination of deep water tsunami amplitude, direction of propagation, and speed.  Clayoquot Slope  The name Clayoquot (pronounced ‚ÄúClah-quot‚Äù) is an anglicized version of Tla-o-qui-aht, the largest nation in the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) First Nations, whose people have resided in the Clayoquot Sound region near Tofino and Ucluelet for at least the last 2000 years. The Clayoquot Slope site lies about 1250 m below sea level and approximately 20 km landward of the toe of the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the area at which the Juan de Fuca plate is subducting (descending) beneath the North American plate. This is a zone where much of the thick layer of sediments deposited on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are scraped off and accreted as the tectonic plates converge (move together). As sediments thicken and compact from accretion, pore waters are expelled from the sediment, and gases ‚Äî primarily biogenic methane ‚Äî contribute to the formation of gas hydrates in the upper few hundred metres of the sediment. At this site, a cold vent, known as Bullseye Vent, has formed along with significant concentrations of gas hydrates.Scherwath et al, 2012 Clayoquot Slope is home to a variety of deep-sea organisms. Many demersal fish (fish which live very near the bottom) were observed (rockfish, flatfish, thorny heads, and rattails) along with echinoderms (sea cucumbers, brittle stars, sea stars), octopus, crabs, cnidarians (sea pens, corals, anemones), and bacterial mats. In the water column, organisms such as squid, krill, jellyfish, siphonophores, and larvaceans have been observed during installation and maintenance work.  Endeavour  2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations along the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge in the northeast Pacific. This site is part of the NEPTUNE observatory. Endeavour (depth 2200‚Äì2400 m) is a northern segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge which, in turn, is part of the complex, 80,000 km long mid-ocean ridge system spanning the World Ocean. Juan de Fuca Ridge is a medium rate spreading centre (~6 cm/yr) forming the divergent boundary between the Pacific (to the west) and the Juan de Fuca (to the east) tectonic plates . At these divergent boundaries, convection currents in the mantle rise up as magma, emerge through the rifts as lava, and crystallise as new rock (basalts and gabbro). These processes continually create new ocean crust. Hydrothermal vents, which typically form along these mid-ocean ridges, are fissures from which geothermally heated water flows. The water flowing out of vents is dominantly seawater drawn into the system through the faults, porous sediments, and volcanic rocks. As the cool seawater moves through the sediment and rock towards the hot magma, the water becomes super heated (300-400 ¬∞C) and rich in dissolved mineral elements (such as sulphur, iron, zinc and copper) from the young ocean crust. When the hot effluent is expelled, it encounters the cold, ambient seawater (about 2 ¬∞C) minerals precipitate from the element-rich vent water. At the Endeavour segment, a notably vigorous venting area, black smokers form at the high temperature vents, where the effluent is precipitating iron sulphides. This gives the plumevits dark colour and deposits sulphide-minerals, creating chimneys up to 30 m in height. There are 6 known vent fields with distinct morphologies spaced about 2 km apart along the axial rift valley of the segment.Kelley et al, 2014 These tall sulphide chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of the deep sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its fundamental energy source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source (chemosynthesis). These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are the base of the food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal symbiotic bacteria to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.  Folger Passage  2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations at Folger Passage in Barkley Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. This site is part of the NEPTUNE observatory in the northeast Pacific. Folger Passage is located at the mouth of Barkley Sound, offshore Vancouver Island near Bamfield, British Columbia. The seafloor composition includes cobble, gravel, soft sandy sediment, and carbonate-rich detritus. Two instrument platforms, Folger Deep (100 m) and Folger Pinnacle (23 m), are installed at Folger Passage. Folger Deep is situated on soft sediment at the mouth of an inlet channel while the Folger Pinnacle platform is secured to the top of a rocky reef within a rockfish conservation area. This coastal zone is ideal for studies of land-ocean interactions and coastal physical oceanography. Estuarine circulation from Barkley Sound is influenced by the shelf dynamics of an eastern boundary current, creating a complex physical environment. Surface outflow drives a deep water inflow which is strongly influenced by upwelling and downwelling conditions on the nearby continental shelf. The nutrient-rich, terrestrial freshwater discharge and the nutrient-rich, cool, salty upwelled water support a diverse and abundant ecosystemPawlowicz and McClure, 2010 Folger Pinnacle, located atop a shallow reef, has dense mats of sponges, ascidians and encrusting algae. There are numerous types of sessile (bottom attached) organisms including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, tunicates, and barnacles. Since this is a rockfish conservation area, there is a wide variety of rockfish (yellowtail, China, quillback, Puget Sound, black, and blue) in addition to many other fish (kelp greenling, lingcod, flatfish, wolfeels), molluscs (giant Pacific octopus, mussels, swimming scallops, and snails), and echinoderms (seastars, sea cucumbers, and urchins). An echosounder installed at Folger Deep shows evidence of a dense zooplankton community and schools of fish in the water column, while hydrophones regularly record the songs of whales and dolphins in the area.

The field was the first to be developed offshore Bulgaria, and at peak production provided more than 16% of Bulgaria's domestic gas needs, the platform and associated infrastructure is still the only production facility located in the Bulgarian Black Sea.  Discovery  Gas was discovered in the Late Cretaceous / Late Paleocene calcarenite reservoir in 1993 by Texaco and its JV partners (Texaco 20% - Operator, Enterprise 20%, OMV 10% and the remaining 50% was held by the State (Bulgarian Committee of Geology and Mineral Resources)). The discovery well Galata 1 was drilled using the Ocean Liberator semi submersible drilling rig. The well flowed at per day through a choke. This was the first offshore commercial gas discovery in Bulgaria. Later the same JV further appraised the field with the Galata 2 well and Bogdanov East 1 well. The field was later developed by the UK company Melrose Resources plc.  Development  Melrose Resources plc acquired its initial interests in Bulgaria through the acquisition in 1998 of Petreco S.A.R.L. whose interests included the undeveloped Galata discovery. The development of the field required considerable capital investment by Melrose Resources plc (supported by the IFC) to construct the necessary onshore and offshore infrastructure of which there was none in Bulgaria. The majority of the development project work was undertaken in 2003 and 2004. This included: * The construction of the Galata production platform in Varna, Bulgaria. The platform was then transported to the field location by barge and installed at the location 25km offshore (a tripod platform with 3 pile driven legs and 3 open grated floors) holding the GP-1 and GP-2 wellheads; * The drilling of 2 production wells (GP-1 and GP-2) into the gas reservoir using the Ukrainian jack up rig Tavrida cantilevered above the Galata production platform; * A 20km offshore pipeline to transport the gas from the Galata platform to the beach landing south of Varna; * An onshore processing plant (OPP) located South of Varna near the beach landing to receive the produced gas and remove both water and heavier hydrocarbons to bring the gas to sales quality. Later onshore compressors were added at the OPP to maximise the potential gas recovery from the reservoir; * A 70km onshore pipeline crossing a number of roads and mainly agricultural land of varying gradient; * A metering station near Provadia to measure the quantity and quality of the gas at the sales point into the National Transmission System (NTS) operated by Bulgartransgaz. Production from the Galata gas field commenced in June 2004 once all the infrastructure was in place and fully commissioned.  Production and Reserves  The total proven reserves of the Galata gas field prior to production was around . At peak production the field provided more than 16% of Bulgaria's domestic gas needs with production rates up to per day. In order to maximise gas recovery from the field onshore compression was required as the reservoir pressure declined through production. A first compressor was installed in January 2006 with a second one installed in the autumn of 2007, both were located at the onshore process plant (OPP). The Melrose Resources plc Annual Report 2007 stated \\"the compressor, which has been synchronized with the existing production facilities, will facilitate the recovery of the field‚Äôs booked proved plus probable reserves and take the ultimate recovery to an estimated 74 Bcf\\". In January 2009 the field was shut-in with Melrose exploring the option of converting the field to gas storage making some \\"low cost modifications\\" and seeking approvals. In 2012, Petroceltic (Melrose was acquired in 2012 by Petroceltic) reported in its Annual Report that pressure surveys had indicated gas was \\"migrating from remote areas of the structure\\" and production was recommenced. In March 2017 (following the acquisition of Petroceltic by Worldview Capital Management) a water knockout system was installed on the Galata platform to \\"allow for further production enhancements\\".  Satellite Fields  Three additional satellite fields located to the East of the Galata gas field were discovered by Melrose between 2007 and 2010. These were the Kaliakra gas field discovered in 2007, the Kavarna gas field discovered in 2008 and the Kavarna East gas field discovered in 2010. The Kaliakra and Kavarna fields were developed and brought on production on 4 November 2010 utilising subsea wells and tie back gathering pipelines that connect to the Galata production platform and infrastructure. The utilisation of subsea well technology on these two field developments was a first in the Western Black Sea. The Kavarna East field has not yet been developed.  Operator  The current operator of the field is Petroceltic who merged with Melrose Resources Plc in 2012. Petroceltic was acquired by Worldview Capital Management, a Cayman Island based financial fund in June 2016.

The castle is situated on a rocky outcrop jutting out into the sea. Its precise date of construction is uncertain, but it was important to the development of its region during the Middle Ages. During the War of the Sicilian Vespers, it was subject to Roger of Lauria. It was besieged more than once, and was briefly controlled by the Spanish. It is currently a museum. History The town of Aci Castello developed around the castle, which was built in 1076 by the Normans upon the foundations of a 7th- century Byzantine fortification. In 1169, Aci Castello started to expand after an eruption of Mount Etna made the towns in its vicinity uninhabitable. The castle later became the property of the Bishops of Catania. In 1296, Roger of Lauria, admiral of the Aragonese fleet during the War of the Sicilian Vespers, was granted the fief of Aci and its castle as a reward for his faithful service to King Frederick III of Sicily. When relations between the two men soured and di Lauria transferred his loyalties to the Angevins, the castle was besieged and captured by King Frederick and di Lauria stripped of his fiefs. In 1320, the castle and Aci were taken from Roger's descendant, Margaret of Lauria and given to Blasco II de Alagona. Whilst the latter was away defending Palermo from the attacking Angevins, Bertrando di Balzo sacked Aci in his absence.

A medium-sized academy that serves the inner city area of Birmingham, it is a popular choice with parents, with many coming from the immediate area with almost all students in walking distance to the academy. The academy is rated as 'Good' by Ofsted in 2016 and the academy was highly commended for its rapid success with high praise coming from the National Schools Commissioner Sir David Carter and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw. The academy is sponsored by CORE Education Trust which also runs Nansen Primary School which is opposite to Rockwood. In 2016, the School was in the top 20% nationally for progress made by its pupils between their key stage 2 SATs results at primary school and their key stage 4 GCSE results as measured by Specialist Schools Trust (SSAT). In 2017, the School was in the top 2% highest performing schools in the country. History The school was built in the 1960s and was known as Naseby School. In 1983 it became Park View School and was based over two sites. The Lower School was located on Naseby Road and Upper school was based in Park Hall School. The school became Park View Business and Enterprise School in 2005 and later was refurbished in the early 2010s under the Building Schools for the Future programme. The school was previously a specialist Business and Enterprise College; however, in 2013 it became an academy sponsored by Park View Educational Trust. In 2014 the school was subject to an inquiry: see Operation Trojan Horse. The school was put under investigation by Ofsted. In 2015, it was announced that the Education Funding Agency had found financial irregularities to the tune of ¬£70,000 including a payment of ¬£27,000 to a public relations firm without authorisation from the EFA. The EFA report alleged that money which had been allocated to the school under the government's pupil premium scheme‚Äîwhich is intended to help the most disadvantaged of children‚Äîwas misused on public relations. The school was renamed Rockwood Academy in September 2015, at the request of the children and their families. Rockwood is now sponsored by CORE Education Trust which has lifted the academy from special measures to 'Good' by Ofsted in 2016. The academy has seen rapid progress since then by offering a curriculum that caters to the students needs and also becoming a leader in sports education becoming the first school of tennis with the academy building close links with Ukactive. The academy has also started the first Army cadets scheme that was launched by the Secretary of State for Defence Sir Michael Fallon.

A leaky transform fault is a transform fault with volcanic activity along a significant portion of its length producing new crust. In addition to the regular strike-slip motion observed at transform boundaries, an oblique extensional component is present, resulting in motion of the plates that is not parallel to the plate boundary. This opens the fault, allowing melt to break through and cool on the ocean floor, producing new crust. This extensional component can come from a slight shift in the position of a plate's Euler Pole. In order to accommodate oblique motion along the plate boundary, these leaky transform faults can break up into a series of small transforms linked by short segments of spreading ridges. These new transforms will follow small circles centred on the new Euler Pole.  Case studies  The Western Limassol Forest Complex, an ophiolite assemblage on the island of Cyprus dated to the Late Cretaceous, is believed to have come from a leaky, left-lateral transform fault about wide. Structural deformation of dykes in the ophiolite complex indicate injection into a shearing environment; they trend N-S but are cut by E-W trending shear zones. These intrusions are likely syn-tectonic, as they both pass through and are cut by the shear zones. The Emerald Fracture Zone (EMZ), located on the boundary of the Antarctic and Pacific plates to the south of New Zealand, is an ideal location to study extensional transform faults. The EMZ is proximal to the Euler Pole for Antarctic plate rotation about the Pacific, producing large effects on the boundary between the two plates as the pole migrated and relative plate velocities changed. Two main plate boundary reorganizations are evident in the EMZ, linked by large tectonic events. One at 30 My, potentially linked to the collision of India and Asia at 35 My, and a second at 6 My, potentially linked to the collision of the Ontong Java Plateau with the Melanesian arc at 10 My.  Petrology  While the petrology of leaky transform faults has not been studied extensively, some detailed petrologic work has been done on the Siqueiros transform fault in the Eastern Pacific between the Pacific and Cocos plates. This region is host to young volcanic sites producing picritic basalt. These basalts have slight chemical variations from the typical mid-ocean ridge basalts found in the area; they are more primitive (higher MgO values) and are more depleted in incompatible elements.

It has a large stone rampart with entrances on the west and north sides; there is a guard chamber within the north-east entrance, and it has a deep defensive ditch.A short guide to Caer Drewyn Hillfort; accessed 3 March 2014 The site Caer Drewyn is the most southerly hillfort in the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is situated on the spur of a hill between Llangollen and Corwen, just above the confluence of the River Dee and the River Alwen. The earliest structure was a small enclosure built against a natural rock outcrop. Today this structure is only visible as the remains of a grass-covered bank. A later, larger fortress was surrounded by a dry-stone wall, and does not have the earthen ramparts of other local hillforts. The area of the site is about three hectares. There are two in-turned entrances, one at the highest point, with the possible remains of a guardhouse beside it, and the other on the west side adjoining the remains of a rectangular building. There is a further enclosure outside that contains stone foundations of what may have been a hut platform. History Caer Drewyn is an Iron Age fort dating back to about 500 BC, however it was in use as a defensive position long after this. Legend states that Owain Gwynedd occupied it while Henry II of England was invading Gwynedd in 1165 via a southerly route, and Owain Glynd≈µr is believed to have gathered his troops here in 1400 after he had proclaimed himself King of Wales.

The tree is a species of sycamore-fig., citing J.R.I. Wood (1997), A Handbook of the Yemen Flora, Aylesbury, UK Description Ficus vasta is a large tree, with a massive trunk, and spreading branches whose tips form an inverted bowl up to 50m in diameter. It reaches a height of 25m. The trunk is smooth and grey, and is commonly buttressed. The bark is smooth and grey, except on young branches where it is yellow-white-brown, and flaking when dry. The leaves are elliptical, reaching 25 x 20 cm, hairy, and rough to the touch. They are often distinguished from other species of fig by its large heart-shaped leaves and massive trunk. The figs grow in clusters, are 2 cm in diameter, and spherical. When ripe they are green with pale green spots. They are hairy and their opening is clear. Ficus vasta grows as an epiphyte or as a chasmophyte. As the young tree grows, it sends down roots which thicken and become trunk-like, often fusing together and completely engulfing the trunk of the tree or rock it grew on. This process often kills the host tree and completely engulfs or covers the rock face. Uses The figs are edible, being collected by children. They are also eaten by sheep, goats, monkeys (including baboons) and birds. The figs can be eaten right off the tree, or when half-dry, or when dry. Dry figs are usually stored and eaten as needed. Ecology Ficus vasta grows in or near the Horn of Africa. It is primarily endemic to Ethiopia and Yemen, but can also be found in the Sudan, Somalia and Saudi Arabia, and into Uganda and Tanzania in the African Great Lakes region. The tree grows along rivers forming stands or thickets. Additionally, it is found in dry savannah, and grows at elevations between 1,400m and 2,500m. It is not cultivated under domestication, and is disappearing due to human pressure, mainly in its use as firewood.  See also  * Strangler fig References =Sources= * Berg, C.C. 1988.

Auction internet company Chartitybuzz auctioned the experience of watching Simon Doonan create the Barney's Christmas windows to benefit Christie's Green Auction in 2010 with a final bid received for $60,000. Kaufmann's offered Christmas windows and Santa Land. Fees were charged to see Lonnie Hanzon's Christmas window display 12/25: A Holiday Store in Omaha in 1987. Until it closed in 1989, Altman's was known for its Christmas window displays that rivaled Lord & Taylor's, a few blocks up on Fifth Avenue. In Pittsburgh, Horne's was one of the retailers known for its Christmas window displays. In Boston, Filene's would hold a Christmas tree lighting and Jordan Marsh would present a series festive Christmas window displays known as the \\"Enchanted Village\\". The window display has since relocated to Boston's Hynes Convention Center, and then to City Hall Plaza. In Montreal, James Aird Nesbitt was in charge of the traditional Christmas window displays at Ogilvy (department store). In 1947, he commissioned German toymaker Steiff to create two animated holiday scenes known as \\"The Mill in the Forest\\" and \\"The Enchanted Village\\". The displays included dozens of handcrafted mechanical toy animals and more than a hundred moveable parts. In 2008, the displays were completely refurbished. Woodward's Department Store in Vancouver's retail shopping district was famous for its Christmas window displays. Europe Tom Keogh designed the annual Christmas windows for Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Fenwick (department store) in Newcastle is famous locally for its Christmas window display. Since 1971 there has been a Christmas display in the shop's windows, and people come from near and far to look at them. There are records however going back to the 1930s to indicate that displays have been done. This 2009 theme was a traditional nativity scene, very different from the 2002 aliens theme (Christmas in Another World) which showed aliens celebrating Christmas and sparked lively discussion in the letters page of the local papers. The Arab dress provoked some debate. The commentators may not have been familiar with the location of Bethlehem. In 2011, the store held the 40th anniversary of the store's Christmas window display tradition. The store is most famous for its extravagant windows, filled with detailed sets and sophisticated moving figures, which appears every Christmas and almost rivals the windows in Liberty's. The themes are taken mainly from fairy tales and children's stories. The figures move and are accompanied by music. In 2011, Anthony Ausgang designed the Christmas windows for the La Rinascente Department Store in Milan with larger-than-life three- dimensional models of his trademark psychedelic cartoon cats.Italian Vogue: Ausgang at La Rinascente Bertrand Planes designed Christmas window displays for Le Bon March√© in Paris. Australia In Australia, the Sydney department store David Jones presents an annual animated Christmas Window display. Traditionally these have often featured snowy northern hemisphere Christmas scenarios, but in 2014 the windows are set in a distinctly Australian summer, featuring beach and rainforest scenes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLHi5FVXe6g based on the book \\"Reindeer's Christmas Surprise\\" by Australian author Ursula Dubosarsky and illustrator Sue De Gennaro. In Melbourne, the Myer department store began presenting an annual Christmas window display in 1956,http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01038b.htm and later added the annual Myer Christmas Parade. Displays have typically included scenes from Christmas related stories such as The 12 Days of Christmas, A Christmas Carol and How The Grinch Stole Christmas as well as nativity scenes and scenes from children's stories and fairy tales. For the past few decades, displays have featured animated characters. Uno's Garden was chosen as the theme of the 2007 Myer Christmas Windows in Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia.

Jeff\\" is the eleventh episode of the fifth season of Community, and the 95th episode overall in the series. It originally aired on April 3, 2014 on NBC. The episode was written by Dino Stamatopoulos, and directed by Rob Schrab. The episode was completed in the animation style of the popular 1980s children's television animated series, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. The episode received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the affectionate homage to the childhood cartoon series. Despite positive reviews, however, the episode saw season lows of 0.9/3 in the 18-49 rating/share demo and 2.50 million American viewers. Plot The episode begins with Cobra forces led by Destro (Isaac Singleton Jr.) attacking the Taj Mahal. They are intercepted by G.I. Joe troops led by Flint (Bill Ratner). Among the force is the (rather dysfunctional) study group; Annie (Alison Brie), codenamed ‚ÄúTight Ship,‚Äù who questions their orders, Britta (Gillian Jacobs), codenamed ‚ÄúBuzzkill,‚Äù who comments on her suggestive outfit with inappropriate language. Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), codenamed ‚ÄúThree Kids,‚Äù who's too busy talking to her kids on the phone to focus on the battle, and Jeff (Joel McHale), codenamed ‚ÄúWingman‚Äù. Jeff shoots down Destro's plane, but takes things too far when he shoots out Destro's parachute. A surprised Destro falls to his death, causing Flint and the rest of the Joes to stare in horror. Wingman, Three Kids, Buzzkill, and Tight Ship are charged with violence, suggestive language, and mature situations unbecoming of G.I. Joe at a court-martial presided over by Duke (Michael Bell), Flint, and Scarlett (Mary McDonald-Lewis). Wingman defends the first killing in G.I. Joe history by countering it should be their duty to eliminate Cobra because it is a ruthless terrorist organization, but the four are sent to jail. In the jail, the Group meets \\"Fourth Wall,\\" played by Abed (Danny Pudi), in the adjacent cell. Fourth Wall explains that they are in a cartoon and that he has infiltrated a Cobra dig site called \\"Greendale.\\" Wingman loses consciousness, sending him to a live-action, mock G.I. Joe commercial featuring three young boys playing with G.I. Joes and their accessories. Wingman regains consciousness in the G.I. Joe cartoon where he hears beeps resembling hospital equipment and Annie's and Britta's voice calling him Jeff. Wingman dismisses this, saying he belongs in G.I. Joe. Meanwhile, at Cobra Headquarters, Cobra Commander (Rob Schrab) delivers a eulogy at Destro's funeral. He is interrupted by \\"Vice Cobra Assistant Commander,\\" played by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), who delivers news of an energy surge at the Greendale site. Cobra then initiates an attack of the G.I. Joe base to avenge Destro's death. Cobra bombs a hole in Wingman's jail cell, allowing the Group to escape. Wingman tries to help out in the battle, but he just ends up killing more Cobra soldiers and accidentally setting Lifeline on fire, causing him to burn to death. The Squad leaves in a ‚ÄúSubmachopter‚Äù tiltrotor and Fourth Wall suggests going to the site at Greendale. The mention of the word causes Wingman to lose consciousness again, sending him into another live-action G.I. Joe action figure commercial where the Squad is now called ‚ÄúThe Mutineers‚Äù because of Wingman's fatal sharpshooting skills. Wingman regains consciousness and the Mutineers arrive at the Greendale site. The Mutineers easily defeat opposition and enter Study Room F, where Wingman realizes that he works at Greendale as a teacher named Jeff Winger, and that this cartoon reality is in his imagination. Jeff leaves to go to his office and realizes why he is unconscious ‚Äì because he drank the bottle of Scotch whiskey and took anti-aging pills from Koreatown. He returns to the group and explains that he took them because he has been lying about his age. Fourth Wall informs him of the different layers of existence, where he is currently in the 1980s cartoon layer. He explains that Jeff sees visions of the next layer, the toy commercial plane, which separates him from the real world where Jeff must go to confront the reason for the hallucination. Jeff says he doesn't want to go back because he doesn't want to be a middle-aged community college teacher; he wants to be in G.I. Joe because he is immortal in this cartoon world. Just then, Cobra and G.I. Joe forces intervene to reveal they have joined forces to become \\"Jo-Bra\\" and capture Wingman, as his ability to kill means that he is the biggest threat to both of them. Cobra Commander and Duke ask Jeff questions about real life that make Jeff realize he cannot live in this cartoon universe forever. Jeff tricks them and uses his jet pack to escape the cartoon reality. Jeff leaves the toy commercial layer and enters reality where he is on a hospital bed, surrounded by the members of the Save Greendale committee. Jeff reveals that he's 40 years old, to no surprise of the group; as they were aware that he wasn't around his early 30s. They nevertheless support him and say he should not have been embarrassed to reveal his age. The group gives him a present of a coffee mug they bought at the hospital gift shop that says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an Old Boy,‚Äù with the ‚ÄúOld‚Äù written in. He tells them to bring it in for a hug and they all laugh while the camera fades to black. The animated end scene shows Buzzkill catching two kids spray- painting their names onto a park structure. She botches a Public Service Announcement and gives a cynically complex message before Fourth Wall intervenes to give a short message: ‚ÄúGraffiti is bad. Go play sports.‚Äù Cultural references The episode was animated in the style of the popular 1980s television cartoon, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. Jeff, as \\"Wingman,\\" adopted the look of G.I. Joe's Duke, though with inverted colors for his costume; Annie, as \\"Tight Ship,\\" was an analogue to Shipwreck; Abed's \\"Fourth Wall\\" was an homage to the Native American G.I. Joe, Spirit; Shirley, as \\"Three Kids,\\" wore Stalker's costume; Professor Duncan, as \\"Xim-Xam\\" (and his twin \\"Mix-Max\\"), was an homage to the Crimson Guard Twins; Professor Hickey as \\"Major Dick,\\" with an eye-patch and costume to that of Major Bludd; Chang, as \\"Overkill\\" wore Quick Kick's costume; and Dean Pelton, as \\"Vice Cobra Assistant Commander\\", served as a foil to Cobra Commander. During the courtroom scene in Wingman's trial, Scud from Scud: The Disposable Assassin is seen in the background. Fourth Wall's illustration of the layers of reality is a reference to the 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Deities & Demigods/Legends & Lore book. The hospital scene where the group laughs and the camera fades to black pays tribute to the light-hearted endings of G.I. Joe cartoons. The end-credits Public Service Announcement by Buzzkill and Fourth Wall is a reference to a PSA from the original G.I. Joe cartoon, as well as the 35 overall PSAs done in the series. Production Chris McKenna, executive producer of Community. Series creator and co-showrunner Dan Harmon initially announced that there would be an animated episode during the cast and crew's visit to the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013. Series writer and co-showrunner Chris McKenna said the idea for the concept of the episode came about in a simple way: \\"I think Harmon said, 'Let's do a G.I. Joe episode!'\\" McKenna said that the show wanted to pay tribute to the 1980s animated series: \\"[G.I. Joe] was something from our childhood that was very important to us and we had fond memories of it, and we thought it would be a cool way to do another animated episode. Like all Community episodes, it takes on a certain style. This one has a very specific story reason for it. I don‚Äôt want to give too much away, but our characters find themselves on a Wizard of Oz-type journey through the world of G.I. Joe. ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a mystery that Jeff in particular has to get to the bottom of.\\" McKenna added that the Community team had been working overtime to craft \\"a loving homage to the G.I. Joe series.\\" Though production for the live-action episodes had been completed in December 2013, the cast recorded their voices in late March 2014. McKenna said the delay was due to the fact that they broke and re-broke the story several times in order to utilize all the regulars and guest stars in the Community universe, as well as to find a proper justification for using the animated medium to tell their story. McKenna said that Rob Schrab (Scud: The Disposable Assassin) was the \\"perfect person\\" to direct the episode and \\"he's absolutely a maniac trying to get it together.\\" McKenna explained that this episode is not simply a sketch, but that the characters take on this style to carry out a story that takes place in the real world, which Harmon stated was a story was about \\"age and dying.\\" The episode was animated by Harmon's animation studio, Starburns Industries, which had previously animated the claymation episode, \\"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\\". The episode was animated with the permission of the G.I. Joe's toy manufacturer, Hasbro. Harmon had this to say about Hasbro's willingness to lend its iconic style: > \\"The weird thing was how cooperative they were.

Joe logo and we have G.I. Joe characters talking to our > characters‚Ä¶\\" Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 2.50 million American viewers, receiving a 0.9/3 in the 18-49 rating/share. The show placed fourth out of fifth in its time slot, behind The Big Bang Theory, Hell's Kitchen, and Once Upon a Time in Wonderland; and fifteenth out of seventeen for the night. =Critical reception= Critics gave the episode generally positive reviews, with many remarking on the authentic feel of the 1980s cartoon G.I. Joe. The episode drew criticism, however, due to unfamiliarity of many in the audience with the cartoon to which the episode paid homage. Brian Collins of Badass Digest praised the episode's use of the animated medium to tell an essential story in the Community mythology. He said this episode proved \\"once again that in Community, there's (almost) no such thing as a throwaway episode.\\" Collins enjoyed how the episode immediately distinguished itself from the 1980s cartoon by questioning the lack of deaths when firing multiple weapons while fighting a terrorist organization like Cobra. He commended the episode for being frank with the viewer from the beginning with the idea that the episode took place in Jeff's mind, unlike the fourth season's finale. Collins noted how this episode compared to the second season's stop-motion episode where Abed had a mental breakdown. The ultimate reveal, however, in this episode that Jeff is in a coma (due to alcohol poisoning mixed with suspect anti-aging pills) made this much the episode much darker, Collins said. Collins also praised the episode for delivering a grounded piece of canon about Jeff turning 40 years old despite making him a ‚Äúbit too old‚Äù for the 23/24-year-old Annie: ‚ÄúIt's a daring move, and the fact that he's been ‚Äòlying‚Äô about his age doesn't quite land since he's never revealed it in an episode, but it's one of the many things that helps keep the show grounded in more of a reality than we're used to on a sitcom.‚Äù The reveal is especially poignant, Collins wrote, because Jeff was now the one with the crisis, where previous episodes saw dramatic stories such as Troy leaving (Abed's crisis), Pierce dying (the Group's crisis), and Britta seeing her activist friends move on. Collins ended by saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a goddamn hilarious episode. Rob Schrab (the director of the episode) plays Cobra Commander, and had me laughing out loud nearly every time he spoke - particularly during Destro's eulogy, which he botches because he's never had to give one before now.‚Äù Joe Matar from Den of Geek rated the episode ‚Äú2 out of 5 stars,‚Äù though qualifying his rating by confessing he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt even remember watching a single G.I. Joe [episode] and I certainly didn‚Äôt own any of the action figures.‚Äù This mirrored the rating given by Dave Bunting (Vulture), who also qualified his rating by saying he ‚Äúnever watched that mid-‚Äô80s animated series, and the line of action figures that inspired the cartoon also didn't mean much to me.‚Äù Similar to Bunting's reason for the lack of connection with the episode, Matar explained that though this episode is a loving homage to the old G.I. Joe action figures, he couldn't ‚Äúimagine this episode holding that much appeal for you. It certainly didn‚Äôt for me.‚Äù Matar criticized the episode's heavy dependence upon ‚Äúnostalgia and recognition of a bygone era of budget animation and cheesy toy commercials,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúeither your familiarity with this old junk will be triggered from frame one and you‚Äôll be grinning the whole episode or you‚Äôll sit there, stony-faced, at times bewildered, like yours truly.‚Äù Despite his harsh criticism, Matar explained that he understood the irony that the characters were ‚Äúupset when someone actually dies.‚Äù Matar resented this ‚Äúin-joke‚Äù as much of the story hinged upon this concept. Unlike Collins, Matar did not appreciate Jeff imagining the entire episode like in the fourth-season finale: > ‚ÄúSomething continually upsetting to me is the way Season 5 at its worst > reminds me of Season 4, a period in Community‚Äôs life that I don‚Äôt even > consider to be the same show. But remember the abysmal Season 4 finale where > Jeff kind of had a psychotic break and imagined the Darkest Timeline was > real and then it turned out it was all a dream? Well, this one makes a lot > more sense and it doesn‚Äôt cheaply hide the ‚Äòdream‚Äô aspect so as to use it as > a twist at the end, but still, it feels lazier than I expect Community to > be.‚Äù Emily VanDerWerff's (The A.V. Club) unfamiliarity with the 1980s cartoon did not negatively affect her rating, however, as she gave the episode an ‚ÄúA-.‚Äù VanDerWerff said that though she was too young to have knowledge of the cartoon, she enjoyed this spiritual sequel to season two's stop-motion episode, \\"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\\". She said that she enjoyed the episode turning into a ‚Äúweird, Inception-inspired attempt to break out of Jeff‚Äôs subconscious.‚Äù She also enjoyed the episode ‚Äúkept getting more and more ridiculous as Jeff struggled to wrangle everything together into a coherent narrative funny.‚Äù Like Collins, VanDerWerff enjoyed that the stakes were established early on and that it was revealed that the episode took place in Jeff's head ‚Äì similar to Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas taking place in Abed's head. She praised the episode for being able to handle darker topics, explaining that Jeff wasn't actively trying to commit suicide, but taking pills thinking it will bring him youth: > ‚ÄúThe episode also doesn‚Äôt shy away from how that act of self-destruction > might as well be subconscious suicide anyway. Jeff‚Äôs horribly depressed > about being 40 and having only made it as far as a community college > instructor. Even if he‚Äôs surrounded with friends, he‚Äôs not in the place he > thought he would be when he was a little boy and imagined greater things for > himself. Adulthood might carry with it pleasures that childhood doesn‚Äôt‚Äîfrom > naked breasts and Scotch all the way up to deeper emotional connections with > other human beings‚Äîbut childhood carries with it the pleasure of not really > knowing how much sorrow and despair the world can hold. That‚Äôs why nostalgia > for the things we loved as children is such a powerful opiate: It takes us > back to a place where we knew we were loved, as Don Draper would have it. > I‚Äôm not saying this episode doubles as a subtle critique of all of those > Buzzfeed articles about how great it was to be a kid in the ‚Äò90s, but I‚Äôm > not saying that either. We all get older and have to put away childish > things. Getting lost in them can be a danger in and of itself.‚Äù VanDerWerff also praised director Rob Schrab's ability to ‚Äúbeautifully [capture] the animation limitations of ‚Äò80s afternoon cartoons‚Ä¶[and] the flat lighting of ‚Äò80s toy commercials.‚Äù VanDerWerff requested to give Shirley more material in future episodes, while appreciating her name ‚ÄúThree Kids‚Äù as a joke to how rarely the show gives her more than a catchphrase. Though she found the episode to be ‚Äúvery enjoyable‚Äù and ‚Äúvery funny,‚Äù VanDerWerff lodged a minor complaint at the final scene in the hospital: > ‚ÄúI think works a little too hard to put a cap on everything that doesn‚Äôt > leave the audience contemplating their own mortality‚Ä¶But I still thought the > episode built nicely to a place of genuine existential despair and then sort > of‚Ä¶ shoved it right back down so we could have the standard group hug‚Ä¶It‚Äôs > not a huge flaw‚ÄîCommunity has been walking right up to the edge of the > howling void and then walking right back with a hug since 2009‚Äîbut it‚Äôs one > that nonetheless kept me from completely embracing everything that was going > on in the end.‚Äù References External links * \\"G.I.

He is listed as a ‚Äúdry goods merchant‚Äù in 1884 with a store at 13 East Main, a few blocks west of his home. In 1899-1900, the firm of Specht-Finney-Skinner opened a department store at 11 East Main. McCallum appeared to have joined that firm as he was no longer listed as self-employed. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. At age 84, according to the 1930 Census, McCallum was still working as a dry goods salesman. In that year, the house was valued at $12,000. History In 1884, William McCallum and his wife Susan purchased the property on the northwest corner of Main and College Avenue, which was part of the Woodhull Addition. The following year, construction began on his house, designed and built by Henry Lemster. It cost about $10,500. Between 1893 and 1902, the city revised its street number system, such that the home was variously numbered: ‚Äò‚Äô81 East Main‚Äô‚Äô. ‚Äò‚Äô99 East Main‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äô507 East Main.‚Äô‚Äô When the Lincoln Highway was dedicated in 1928 by the Boy Scouts, the city decided to rename Main Street as Lincolnway. Today, the McCallum‚Äôs address is ‚Äú507 Lincolnway.‚Äù The McCallums took in boarders for several years between the 1920 census and the 1930. Glen and Clara Dean purchased the house after 1930, but before 1938. Dean was the son of the founder of Valparaiso Plumbing Company, Lyman Dean. They were located at 210 East Lincolnway in the mid-twentieth century. The Lyman Deans lived at 502 College Avenue, a few block south. Dean's plumbing and heating firm installed the indoor plumbing. Between 1938 and the 1950s, numerous renovations were made. The first was to create an apartment on the second floor, then a second apartment on that floor. Finally, a third apartment was created on the first floor. The Deans claimed also to have taken out all the poplar flooring in the house and replaced it with oak. During these years, they found the original interior shutters. After repairs and staining, they were reinstalled. In 1947, the house to William and Ray Von Doehren. In the 1950s, Mrs. Von Doehren added a family room with a fireplace and a garage on the southside of the house, along with a white clapboard ‚Äúbump-out‚Äù on the west side of the kitchen. The house remained divided into three apartments. Upon the death of Mrs. Von Doehren the house was given to Harriet Troxel. She and her husband, Bob Troxel, moved in around 1980. She willed the house to her daughter, Sharon Swihart. She and her husband moved to the house in 2001. As the tenants have moved out, the Swiharts began to convert it back to a single-family residence. Architecture Floor Plan of the Wm McCallum Hse in Valparaiso, INThe house was constructed circa 1885 as a two-story, double brick, asymmetrical Italianate residence with a low hip-and-gable roof system. The exterior walls are English bond brick. The neighborhood contains similar houses on tree- covered lots. The interior is approximately 5,000 sq ft. The front fa√ßade, on the south, include a Colonial Revival porch and a two-story bay. Two wooden Tuscan columns support porch roof. Above the front door is a rectangular glass transom of beveled and leaded white glass with the house number backed in red. West of the porch is the two-story bay with floor to ceiling windows. The crowns are finished with a two-brick drop or pendant with sandstone sills. The cornice is most apparent on the south facade, but is complete all around the house. Eave brackets are in pairs, and applied to a tall paneled trim band. The house has been placed on the National Register of Historic Structures for the Italianate architecture.

He was the 4th, 7th, and 25th Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly. He represented Ozaukee County for a total of 14 years in the Assembly and served as a senator in the first three sessions of the Wisconsin State Senate. Early life and career Horn was born in Linum, in the Province of Brandenburg, in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia (now Germany). He was educated in Berlin, at the Gymnasium of the Gray Friar, but did not graduate, and entered the military service of Prussia. He emigrated to the United States in 1836, first residing in New York state, then making his way west in 1837. He made his residence in Michigan but traveled extensively through Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and finally Wisconsin. He arrived in Milwaukee, in the Wisconsin Territory, in 1840 and, in 1841, settled in Mequon, in what was then Washington County. He resided here until his final move, to the neighboring community of Cedarburg, in 1847. He practiced law in Cedarburg and served as Mayor. He also served on the Ozaukee County Board of Supervisors and was editor of the Cedarburg Weekly News. In 1842 Horn entered his first public office when James Duane Doty, Governor of the Wisconsin Territory, appointed him Justice of the Peace for Washington County. He also served as postmaster for Mequon, while he was residing there, and was Register of Deeds for the county in 1846 and 1847. Political career In 1848, he ran for and was elected to the first session of the Wisconsin State Senate, running as an independent Democrat. He was re-elected in November 1848 to a full two-year term in the Senate. In 1850, he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1851 session, and was chosen as the Speaker of the Assembly for that session. In 1853, Ozaukee County was created out of the eastern part of Washington County. That same year, Horn was elected as one of the first two representatives of Ozaukee County in the Wisconsin Assembly for the 1854 session, he was again chosen as Speaker for that session. Later in 1854 and 1855, he served as Wisconsin's Commissioner for Immigration in New York City, directing new immigrants and settlers to Wisconsin. He served again in the 1859 and 1860 sessions of the Wisconsin Assembly. Also during this time, he represented Wisconsin on the Democratic National Committee, and was Vice President of the 1860 Democratic National Conventions in Charleston and Baltimore. He was also a delegate for Wisconsin at the 1868 Democratic National Convention. He served as Ozaukee County Commissioner of Schools from 1862 to 1865, but returned to the Assembly again in 1867, 1868, and 1872. He was elected in 1874 with both Democratic and Republican support, and was then chosen as Speaker again for the 1875 session of the Assembly. He went on to serve another five years in the Assembly, in 1882, 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890. In 1890, he was elected to a four-year term in the Wisconsin State Senate, but he would die in January 1893 before the end of that term.'Wisconsin Blue Book 1893,' Biographical Sketch of Frederick W.Horn, pg. 634Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the State Bar Association of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Bar Association: 1901, Biographical Sketch Of Frederick W.

The syndrome arises from a mutation in the TP63 gene.Chan, I., Harper, J. I., Mellerio, J. E., & McGrath, J. A. (2004). ADULT ectodermal dysplasia syndrome resulting from the missense mutation R298Q in the p63 gene Wiley-Blackwell. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2230.2004.01643.x This disease was previously thought to be a form of ectrodactyly‚Äìectodermal dysplasia‚Äìcleft syndrome (EEC), but was classified as a different disease in 1993 by Propping and Zerres.  Signs and symptoms  ADULT syndrome features include ectrodactyly, syndactyly, excessive freckling, lacrimal duct anomalies, dysplastic nails, hypodontia, hypoplastic breasts and nipples, hypotrichosis, hypohidrosis, broad nasal bridge, midfacial hypoplasia, exfoliative dermatitis, and xerosis.Avitan- Hersh, E., Indelman, M., Bergman, R., & Sprecher, E.

Cause  ADULT syndrome is due to autosomal dominant mutations of the TP63 gene, which encodes the p63 protein. TP63 mutations cause deformities because the p63 protein is critical in embryonic development of limbs and other ectodermal tissues. 7 mutations have been found, the commonest forms being R298Q and R243W, in which encoding for arginine is changed to glutamine at position 298 and tryptophan at position 243 respectively. Other p63 genes mutation syndromes include ectrodactyly‚Äìectodermal dysplasia‚Äìcleft syndrome (EEC) and Hay-Wells syndromes.

DCFC‚Äôs men‚Äôs side formerly played in the National Premier Soccer League's (NPSL) Midwestern Conference before joining NISA in 2019. The Northern Guard have received national and international attention in the soccer community for their passionate and creative support in the stands at DCFC's home Keyworth Stadium that exceeds support traditionally associated with the fourth tier of soccer in the United States. The former commissioner of the NPSL, Michael Hitchcock, called the atmosphere created by the Northern Guard \\"one of my U.S. soccer highlights\\" and an \\"incredible experience.\\" and Sean Spence, the editor of SB Nation's Chicago Fire blog, wrote that \\"When association football takes over the USA...It will be because of ultras like the Northern Guard, Detroit City FC's rabid, profane, hilarious supporters group.\\"  History  Founded in 2012 by brothers Gene and Ken Butcher, the Northern Guard brought drums, smoke bombs, flares and flags to the first-ever DCFC match to create an atmosphere similar to European supporter stands. Over the course of two seasons, attendance in the supporters' stands at DCFC matches grew to fill the 800 person-capacity section and many more supporters began to bring their own drums, flags, smoke, and costumes to add to the atmosphere. In June 2013, a pair of Northern Guard Supporters were married at midfield at halftime of a DCFC match.  Traditions and Controversies  The Northern Guard celebrate a goal during a home game at Cass TechMany Northern Guard members wear skull facemasks and skulls are common symbols in the group's flags and apparel. Founder Ken Butcher explained, \\"We wore face masks that looked like skulls because we kept hearing that the city of Detroit was dead. Well, if we are dead, then we were gonna be the walking dead.\\" Before home matches, the Northern Guard gather at Fowling Warehouse in Hamtramck and march to the stadium, where they gather outside the stadium's gates and chant \\"Can you hear (opponent) sing? We don't hear a fucking thing.\\" As the opposing team enters the field, the Northern Guard chant \\"Come and get it,\\" which has become the group's unofficial motto. The Northern Guard are known for their use of smoke bombs, lighting dozens of large bombs a match in their stands, as well as for vulgarity and profanity. SB Nation soccer editor Sean Spence wrote that \\"...despite the presence of several families in their midst, they are loudly, hilariously vulgar, and use profanity with a ferociousness and familiarity that is almost admirable.\\" (Spence also cautioned that \\"the Northern Guard is where family-friendly entertainment went slumming and got stomped biker-style into an intensive care ward.\\") Once in each half, the Northern Guard will \\"Tetris\\" in the stands, linking arms and dancing side-to-side while singing the melody to \\"Korobeiniki,\\" the theme song to the video game Tetris. The Northern Guard have developed an obscene parody of the traditional French song \\"Alouette\\" and sing \\"Detroit Alouette\\" in the 60th minute of DCFC matches. An earlier version ascribed various physical deformities to the wives of opposing players, but the lyrics sung since 2017 mock the opposing team's supporters (\\"Have you seen their fucking fans?\\"). Supporters of Detroit City FC during a matchThey have also adopted songs and chants that celebrate the group's unusually confrontational style for American lower-tier soccer supporters, including \\"No one likes us, we don't care\\" originally popularized by Millwall FC supporters and \\"We're ruining football and we don't care\\" from Manchester City FC's supporters. The Northern Guard sing the first and last verses of The Pogues' arrangement of Ewan MacColl's song \\"Dirty Old Town.\\" If the team is winning, the Northern Guard will sing in the 80th minute. If the team is losing or the score is even, the song is sung after the match. The Northern Guard is notorious for chanting \\"Fuck Ohio\\", especially, but not exclusively, when playing against teams from that state. In the 2013-14 offseason, the Northern Guard offered a scarf for sale with the words \\"FUCK OHIO\\" on one side, which received attention in the US soccer community when one was shown on the ESPN broadcast of the 2014 MLS All-Star Game. Before the 2014 season, DCFC ownership banned chants, signs, tifo and apparel (including the scarf) with \\"the F-word\\" from the stadium.  Hooligans for Heroes  In 2012, members of the Northern Guard founded Hooligans for Heroes (H4H), a nonprofit that engages soccer supporters on behalf of wounded veterans of the United States Armed Forces. Detroit City FC ownership is supportive of H4H, and played a benefit match on Memorial Day of 2013 where DCFC players wore camouflage jerseys that were auctioned off after the match with proceeds going to the Wounded Warrior Project through H4H. John Bieniewicz Fundraising On June 29, 2014, soccer referee John Bieniewicz was assaulted by Baseel Abdul Amir Saad, a player in an amateur match he was officiating in the suburbs of Detroit. Bieniewicz died two days later of his injuries, and Saad was charged with second-degree murder. A memorial fund was set up to support Bieniewicz's family, and at Detroit City FC's next home match, the Northern Guard passed around a \\"swear jar\\" to raise donations for the fund, playing on their reputation for profane language during matches. The Northern Guard also organized a minute of silence in Bieniewicz's memory in the match's 44th minute, during which they held up red cards in symbolic rejection of violence against officials. Through these efforts, the Northern Guard raised more than $3,000 that was then matched by Detroit City FC ownership for a total donation of $6,560 to the memorial fund.

This film premiered 11 October 2006 at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The film is entirely spoken in Dutch, but English subtitles are shown. On Saturday, 14 October 2006 the film premiered on national television, when it was broadcast by MTV Netherlands. The film continues to receive screenings at film festivals around the World, such as at the Tate Modern in London, U.K. at the Street Art Exposition in 2008.  Synopsis  In the 2006 documentary \\"Kroonjuwelen\\" is a production of Stunned Film. A collective of designers, multimedia developers and filmmakers headed by Ivo Boerdam. The idea for the film was brought into existence at the Mokum Master graffiti reunion in 2004 in Amsterdam. An event where the graffiti writers of Amsterdam gather to redefine the art form. The film sheds light on the Dutch graffiti scene, specifically the scene in and around Amsterdam, with rare video footage dating from 1978 to 2005. Stunned Film follows various known graffiti writers and features interviews with well- known artists. The film covers the birth of Graffiti in the Dutch Capital from out of the punk and squatting scene of the city in the late seventies, and into the emergence of hip-hop culture in the Netherlands in the early eighties when graffiti in the Netherlands took to the trains, following the evolution of the art form up to modern artists.

As MC at Gerde's Folk City in Greenwich Village, he was influential in Bob Dylan's early career, and also recorded one of the earliest albums produced as a tribute to Woody Guthrie. Life He was born in Henderson, Kentucky, later moving to a farm in Bourbon County. Liner notes for Gambling Songs. Wirz.de, Retrieved 3 April 2014 His mother, Corilla (n√©e Eberhardt), was a former opera singer. Both his father, Logan B. English, and his maternal grandfather, Fredrick W. Eberhardt, were Baptist ministers; Eberhardt was a published author, and Logan B. English was a farmer and prominent civic leader. English family papers, 1884-1986, University of Kentucky. Retrieved 3 April 2014 Logan E. English later said that his grandfather's preachings, and the songs of the field hands on his father's farm, were vital in shaping his love of folk music and the theater. He attended the Millersburg Military Academy before studying acting and speech at Georgetown College. After serving in the US Army in Korea, he returned to complete a Master's degree in Fine Arts at Yale School of Drama. He started to pursue an acting career in New York, and also began singing traditional folk songs in clubs in Greenwich Village and elsewhere. English had what was described as a \\"startlingly melodious voice, and a winning personality\\"; he was a talented guitarist, but did not write his own songs. Biography by Bruce Eder, AllMusic. Retrieved 3 April 2014 He began singing professionally in 1956. The following year, he recorded two albums for the Folkways label - Kentucky Folk Songs and Ballads, and The Days of '49: Songs of the Gold Rush, the latter with banjoist Billy Faier - and a third album, Gambling Songs, for the Riverside label. Stefan Wirz, \\"Logan English: Discography\\". Retrieved 3 April 2014 His recordings and regular performances of traditional songs, in New York and Boston, helped put many of the traditional songs into wider circulation; his version of \\"Geordie\\", for example, was heard by Joan Baez who performed and recorded the song in 1962. English performed at the opening night of Gerde's Folk City club in Greenwich Village in 1960, together with Carolyn Hester. Smithsonian Folkways: American Folk Ballads. Retrieved 3 April 2014 He knew Woody Guthrie through mutual friends Bob and Sid Gleason, and was instrumental in securing Bob Dylan his first appearance at Gerde's in 1961. His widow Barbara Shutner said: > My husband Logan English and I met Bob Dylan at Bob and Sid Gleason's > house... One night we were all sitting around and Woody said something like, > \\"Play something\\" to this kid sitting on the couch. The kid was Bob Dylan, > and he sang and it was just beautiful.

Retrieved 3 April 2014 had a radio show on station WBAI, and appeared in several plays, both on and off-Broadway. He also wrote poetry. Two of his verses, The Wind That Shakes The Barley and Beware You Sons of Sorrow, appear in The Kentucky Anthology: Two Hundred Years of Writing in the Bluegrass State, in which English is described as \\"Bourbon County's poet- errant, a man who loved Kentucky but who could never live for very long in the land that formed and nourished him and provided him with material for his poetry, plays and songs.\\" He appeared on several compilations and live recordings of folk music in the early 1960s, including The Life Treasury of American Folk Music. In 1962 he recorded the album American Folk Ballads for Monitor Records. The songs included sea shanties and children's songs, with English writing a short description or story about each song in the liner notes. He wrote: > From the wild-flower dusks of mountain twilights, out of steamy southern > mud-flats and dusty midland prairies, off the sun-silver steel of cinder- > blown railroad tracks and out of the chill damps of prison cells - from > churches and saloons, cradles and gravesides come the songs of America that > must be sung. He recorded the album Logan English Sings the Woody Guthrie Songbag for 20th Century Fox Records in 1964. Released three years before Guthrie's death, and described as \\"an unselfish effort to boost the awareness of the iconic folk legend\\", it contained versions of thirteen of his songs, and led to English's identification as one of Guthrie's major interpreters. However, English's unwillingness to write his own songs, coupled with a chronic drinking problem, also made it increasingly difficult for him to maintain a successful performing or recording career. He later moved to Saratoga Springs, New York, where he taught and gave occasional public performances. In 1974, he released his final album, Woody Guthrie's Children's Songs, for the Folkways label. In 1979, he published a long autobiographical poem, No Land Where I Have Traveled: A Kentucky Poem, which was reprinted in 2001. He also wrote two full-length plays, and was commissioned by the Actors Theatre of Louisville to write a play based on the life of Kentucky politician Cassius Marcellus Clay, which was unfinished at the time of his death. He died in Saratoga Springs in 1983, at the age of 54, when he was hit by an automobile while walking.

A habitual criminal, Jones spent over half his life in prison from which he made repeated attempts (some successful) to escape. His first successful escape was in 1879 when he escaped from Ruthin Gaol while on remand for stealing some watches. By some method he opened the door of his cell and walked out of the front door of the gaol while the staff were having their evening meal. he was recaptured three month later near Colwyn Bay. The grave of Coch Bach y Bala at St Elidan's Church, Llanelidan In 1900 he attempted to escape from Caernarfon Gaol while awaiting transfer to Dartmoor prison. Barricading himself in his cell he began to tunnel out but was unsuccessful. Following two lengthy sentences in Dartmoor for burglary, Jones returned to North Wales and within months on his release was convicted of yet another burglary. Held in Ruthin Gaol while awaiting transfer, this time to Stafford Gaol, he tunnelled through the cell wall and climbed over the prison walls using a rope made from bedclothes. Six days later while being tracked on land near Llanelidan he was shot in the leg by Reginald Jones- Bateman and bled to death from the wound. He was buried in the graveyard of St Elidan's Church in Llanelidan, Denbighshire.
