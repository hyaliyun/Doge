Callie M. Leach French (\\"Aunt Callie\\" 1861-1935) was an American steamboat captain and pilot. For much of her career as a captain, she worked with her husband, towing showboats along the Ohio, Monogahela and Mississippi Rivers. She played the calliope, cooked, sewed, and wrote jokes for the showboat theater. She never had an accident in her career and was the first woman to hold a masters and pilot's license for a steamboat.  Biography  French was born in Jackson County, Ohio and lived in Cincinnati. French married Captain Augustus Byron French in 1878. Augustus Byron French owned a steamboat, named C.O., which traveled along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, towing a theater. He taught Callie to pilot and suggested that she should pursue her pilot's license in New Orleans, where she earned a first class license in 1888. This made her the second woman to hold this license in the United States. It also helped save the couple money. In April 1890 she earned pilot's license for the Ohio and Monogahela Rivers. In 1892, she earned her master's license, making her the only woman to hold both. In addition in April 1893, she was admitted as the first woman member of the American Association of Masters and Pilots of Steam Vessels. When she brought her boat to land at the docks, she \\"attracted considerable attention among the river men,\\" and she was acknowledged to be an excellent captain, according to the Louisville Post. French's New Sensation showboat, owned by A.B. French and Callie French. French's steamboat was called the Mary Stuart and it towed a houseboat named the Sensation which had a theater which could seat 600 people. The couple partnered with John McNair, who was an engineer, tuba player and actor. Shows such as melodramas typical of the day were performed in the theater and French wrote jokes for shows as well. The boat also had a calliope which could be heard from the river with French playing it to attract customers. She was known as \\"Aunt Callie\\" to her patrons. She cooked, sewed and acted as a nurse when necessary. She was also an expert swimmer. Around 1902, she and her husband purchased land in Columbia, Alabama where they intended to retire. Augustus French never made it to retirement, dying in a hotel in Cincinnati and leaving French as the sole owner of the steamboats. John McNair and his wife Ida helped French with management of the crew and programming respectively. French continued to travel on the river until 1907, then sold out her share and retired to Alabama. She never had an accident or lost a boat. French later married Chas H. Tomlinson in Alabama. She died in 1935 and was buried in the Columbia Cemetery. In 1991 French was inducted into the National Maritime Hall of Fame. French was inducted into the National Rivers Hall of Fame in 2001.

Although ranked ballots were expected to increase the civility of the election, it failed to prevent the creation of two negative websites targeting former city councillor, Virginia Ridley (ward 10), and city councillor, Maureen Cassidy (ward 5).

Keen was born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. In 1980 he won the schoolboy 10-mile time-trial championships. That led selection by the British Cycling Federation for the national track squad, despite having no track experience. Keen was educated at John Hampden Grammar School, before completing a sports studies degree at University College Chichester, where he began studying human performance from an academic perspective. He went on to complete a Master of Philosophy degree in Exercise Physiology at Loughborough University, and devised a research programme on the physical limitations to pursuit racing. He wrote to British Cycling asking if they wanted to get involved in the trials. They agreed to send some junior riders. Simultaneously, Keen was working as a senior lecturer in exercise physiology at University College Chichester and the University of Brighton. He was UK national track cycling coach from 1989 to 1992 and was Chris Boardman’s coach when he became Olympic champion in the individual pursuit at the 1992 Summer Olympics, Britain's first Olympic gold medal in cycling for 72 years. Keen continued to work with Boardman as he started his professional career on to the continent where Boardman would win the prologue at the Tour de France three times and broke the world hour record three times. Other riders he coached include Yvonne McGregor, who he guided to Olympic and World Championship medals as well as the world hour record, Caroline Alexander, who won a European Mountain Bike title, and Marie Purvis, who he coached to the British hour record. From 1997 to 2004 Keen was the elite performance director of British Cycling. In 1999 he was awarded the Mussabini Medal. He was performance director for UK Sport prior to the 2012 London Olympics. At UK Sport as Performance Director Keen was responsible for developing and implementing ‘Mission 2012’ a strategic performance management system and reporting process for Olympic and Paralympic sports in the run-up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London. ‘Mission 2012’ was adopted in preparation for Sochi 2014 and the Rio Olympics in 2016. In June 2012, Keen became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

In his Letter of Marque, Ward names Benjamin Norton as captain, commanding him to commandeer any Spanish ship he may come across. Throughout the sloop's five month cruise, Norton kept a detailed journal of the ship's daily encounters. The ship was set to sail down the East Coast of the colonies to the Caribbean, and stop any Spanish ships from delivering supplies, or taking supplies. The story of Revenge, and the surviving documents, are a huge insight into colonial privateering. These men operated under the laws of the crown, while being able to legally capture cargo, slaves, and boats.  The journey  = June = Captain Benjamin Norton writes in his journal that during the month of June, HMS Revenge remained in Huntington Bay, searching for men to join his crew. The crew started with forty-one hands (people) and three slaves. During their time in Huntington Bay, six men became mutinous, and were sent away. Ideally, Norton wanted a doctor on board the ship in case his men were injured or taken ill. The process of vetting a doctor would hold Revenge in the bay until 13 July 1741.John Franklin Jameson, ed., Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period (2008), 392–393, digital file There is some speculation that the ship was in the bay at the time of the New York Conspiracy of 1741, due to an entry in Norton's journal, which mentions hands going to see a burning.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 384. = July = When the ship was finally able to set sail, Captain Norton recorded a total of sixty-one hands on board. The first order of business was to appoint a quartermaster, and the crew elected Duncan McKenley. Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 392. Revenge would quickly make their first encounter with a Spanish ship, Humming Bird. Aboard the ship was the leader of the almost mutiny that took place in Huntington Bay, and some of the men that went with him. Norton was able to persuade the captain of Humming Bird to return the hands that had pledge themselves to Revenge. The opposing captain obliged and returned two hands. On 28 July 1741, Revenge made a successful capture of a Spanish controlled ship, which was originally British. At 5 am lookouts aboard Revenge spotted another sloop on the horizon. They fought against one another until the opposing sloop surrendered. The ship was a British ship that had been taken over by a Spanish privateer, led by Captain Don Pedro Estrado.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 399. The captain of the sloop brought Norton the three documents that they had on board: the commission, instructions on what signal to make upon arrival at St. Augustine, and lastly what route to steer down the coast of Florida for the best results.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 399. Norton ordered a man, by the name of John Webb, to serve on board the new sloop. If they were to become separated, Webb was to take the sloop to Providence where he was to leave all of the cargo on board until Norton's arrival. Captain Norton took the slaves on board Revenge to be sold into slavery for profit. These slaves were considered to be free under Spanish law, and despite the pleas of freedom to Norton, they were still sold into slavery. One of these black prisoners was Francisco Menéndez.Jane Landers, Black Society in Spanish Florida (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999), 42. Upon interrogation by Norton, Menéndez admitted to being a captain of the Spanish army at Fort Moze. Menéndez confessed to being in charge of a small company at St. Augustine. He commanded the troops under the name \\"Signior Capitano Francisco\\". After the battle, Menéndez admitted to becoming a privateer in order to return to Spain. Francisco Menéndez would eventually be sold into slavery under the name Don Blass.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 384, 395, 410–411, 414, 416. Norton would be summoned to Admiralty court in the Bahamas, where he would argue that the slaves captured (including Menéndez) were not free blacks, but were slaves in the eyes of the crown. The scholar Jane Landers found that Menéndez was only sold for \\"thirty-four pesos\\", despite his worth being closer to one hundred and fifty pesos.Landers, Black Society, 301. = August = During the month of August, Captain Norton writes in his journal a number of ship repairs. At one point, the mast was destroyed by a lightning bolt in a storm. One man was hurt, and the ship had a hole. The hole would start to fill with water and would go unnoticed for hours. Once a hand noticed the damage, the men scrambled to work to patch the hole. The boatswain would be punished for not noticing the hole sooner. August also saw a trial in Admiralty court over the recently captured sloop. Captain Norton argued that the sloop, and the cargo onboard, was rightfully his property under a ruling from the king. This ruling stated that any ship taken by a British privateer for more than 96 hours (four days) was the property of the capturer.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 408. In this case, this meant the sloop captured was property of Revenge. The judge ruled in favor of Norton, and decided the cargo sold from the captured sloop would be split among the capturers. The judge also would rule that Menéndez could remain a slave, and would therefore be eligible for sale into slavery. = September = In the beginning of September, Norton mentions a hurricane, twice, that caused damage to the ship. At this point in the journey, the ship had successfully sailed to the Caribbean. Most notable, Revenge captured a sloop and a brigantine, named Sarah. Sarah was taken by Revenge on 27 September, but the captain of Sarah confessed that the ship had initially been taken 23 days earlier by the Spanish. Initially, the ship was British, until their capturing. Overnight, the brigantine would sail off, successfully escaping from Revenge. Captain Norton wrote to John Freebody telling him of the situation, and that the owners of Sarah resided in Boston.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 425–430. Norton asked Freebody to find Masters Lee and Tyler of Boston for a trial in Admiralty court. The captain also mentions that some of the hands discovered the captain of Sarah was named Thomas Smith. Norton felt that Sarah, or a portion of the cargo, truly belonged to him, since he rescued the ship from Spanish hands. Freebody would formally file a complaint with the Admiralty courts of Boston on 5 November 1741.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 431–434. = October = Captain Norton writes that he lost sight of the recently captured sloop in a storm, but would find the ship two days later. John Webb would be appointed master of the sloop, now called Invisible. He was not to talk to anyone, and must remain in sight of Revenge at all times. Webb also had orders to sail back to Rhode Island, but not to sell the cargo until Revenge arrived. The two ships would start their travel back together. = November = John Freebody formally files the complaint in court for the capture of Sarah. The two ships, Revenge and Invisible, arrive back in Rhode Island, but Captain Norton would soon be called to Admiralty court in Boston.  The trial for Sarah  Judge Robert Auchmuty complied with the complaint from John Freebody, and subpoenaed the two owners of Sarah from Boston, as well as the captain, Thomas Smith. Through the depositions of Jeremiah Harriman and Thomas Smith, the captain of Sarah, the Vice-Admiralty Judge would decree Norton and Freebody were not entitled to any salvage prizes.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 434–442. The judge cited two previous cases in which an English merchant ship was captured by the Spanish, then the English recaptured the ship. Both judges in the cases ruled that there would be no salvage prizes awarded because it was considered freeing the British people. The owners of Revenge, Benjamin Norton and John Freebody, would appeal the decision, but the new judge in the case would still rule there would be no salvage prize awarded.Jameson, Privateering and Piracy, 442–462 Freebody would work with people in Boston and in London to try to get a new appeal. The case would continue on until 1743, two years after the capture of Sarah. In all of the trials, the judge would rule that there would be no prize awarded.

However, in this case, the patronymic was used informally by later biographers to distinguish him from namesakes like Willem Gerrit Dedel (1726 - 1768), and in such a case the patronymic was usually added after the surname. Ambachtsheer of Sloten and Sloterdijk (20 April 1734 in Amsterdam – 2 January 1801 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch politician during the Patriottentijd in the Dutch Republic. Personal life Dedel was the son of Salomon Dedel, an Amsterdam merchant who traded on France and the Dutch West Indies, and Agneta Maria Boreel. Together with his father, he founded the firm Salomon & Willem Gerrit Dedel & Co. in 1758, which appears to have been dissolved in 1776. He married Jacoba Elisabeth Crommelin (the daughter of a Haarlem burgemeester) on 3 June 1764 in Haarlem. They had two sons and two daughters. Career Dedel held many public offices in Amsterdam: commissioner in 1757, schepen 1761, councilor in the vroedschap 1768, hoofdofficier (public prosecutor)See for one of the cases Dedel prosecuted, the murder trial of Johannes Bartholomeus Ferdinandus van Gogh, 1769-1781, burgemeester in 1784, 1787, 1790, 1793. He was appointed a councilor in the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier in 1782-1783, and the Admiralty of Amsterdam in 1785-1786, 1791-1792. Commissioner of the States of Holland and West Friesland for the mail in Amsterdam in 1780. He was also Canon of the Church of St. Marie in UtrechtAt the time this was not a Roman Catholic church, but a congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church. However the Cathedral chapter had been held over from medieval times to administer the goods of the church. from 1757-1775. During the Patriottentijd he was a member of the Dutch States Party Regenten in Amsterdam, just as his colleague Joachim Rendorp. That is to say that he opposed the stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange, but was not a sympathizer of the \\"democratic\\" wing of the Patriots, like his colleague Hendrik Daniëlsz Hooft. This would lead to his temporary downfall in the Spring of 1787. He and Hooft had been elected burgemeester of Amsterdam (together with two others) in February 1787. One of their first tasks was to decide about Amsterdam's standpoint in the matter of sending the so-called \\"Legion of Salm\\", a brigade of mercenary soldiers that was paid by the States of Holland, and was not part of the Dutch States Army, under the command of the Rhinegrave of Salm, to The Hague, as a \\"supplementary\\" garrison to the Dutch Blue Guards that already garrisoned the city, but were considered \\"unreliable\\". The mission was opposed by the Orangists in the vroedschap of Amsterdam because it would weaken the position of their political friends in the States of Holland. The Amsterdam schutterij (at least a large group of officers under leadership of Colonel Isaac van Goudoever) tried to convince the vroedschap with a threatening demonstration at the Amsterdam City Hall on 26 February 1787 to vote in favor of the mission. Dedel did his best to withstand this pressure, but the vroedschap caved in under the threats. With the support of the Amsterdam delegation in the States of Holland, the motion to prohibit the mission would have carried, and the Legion would not be sent to The Hague, but now the opposite resolution passed.Colenbrander, pp. 153-154 After this first defeat, Dedel was ready to switch to the Orangist side. The Amsterdam population was sharply divided between the Patriots and the Orangists. An important Orangist group were the so-called Bijltjes (Little Axes), the laborers in the Amsterdam shipbuilding industry, who were fiercely Orangist, but no friends of the States-Party regenten (now commonly called \\"aristocratic Patriots\\") around Dedel and Rendorp. They would, however, be ready to join the anti-Patriot regenten, if they could get the political concession that those regenten would support a return to the constitution of 1766, under which the stadtholder held extensive patronage rights. The Bijltjes had not forgotten that Dedel himself in 1785 had promoted the withdrawal of the stadtholder's right to appoint members of the Admiralty boards. They wanted to repeal that measure, but Dedel and his friends did no want to make that concession. The group around Dedel sent Abraham Calkoen, one of their members, to the stadtholder in Nijmegen on 12 April to ask him to command the Bijltjes to drop their demand, and order them to start violent demonstrations to support the policies of Dedel against the Patriot schutters and Free Corps. Calkoen offered the stadtholder reinstatement as Captain- General of the States Army, the command of the Hague garrison (that had also been taken away from him), and the dismissal of the Patriot Amsterdam pensionary Engelbert François van Berckel and Grand Pensionary Pieter van Bleiswijk (the first to be replaced by Rendorp) if the stadtholder would help mobilize the Bijltjes. But the rights of appointment and military justice were issues on which the Amsterdam regenten would not budge. An agreement with the stadtholder was reached on 14 April. However, the representatives of the Bijltjes had not given their consent and they balked. Then, on 20 April the news about the secret negotiations broke and the Amsterdam schutters under van Goudoever revolted. A petition to purge the vroedschap of Orangist members was presented under the force of arms, and on 21 April these members slinked away. Dedel and his colleague Beels were formally dismissed as burgemeester in July 1787.Colenbrander, pp. 175-183 However, when the Prussian invasion of Holland and the subsequent fall of the city of Amsterdam on 10 October 1787 occurred, Dedel quietly took back his seat as burgemeester. He managed to negotiate the limitation of the occupation of the city by the Prussians to the symbolic occupation of the Leiden Gate in the Walls of Amsterdam, and this earned him the gratitude of the citizenry. After the Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam in January 1795 Dedel retired as a private citizen. He and his wife died in January 1801 within weeks of each other.

It has no obvious leaves and the mostly white flower is usually buried in leaf litter. The plant is usually only detected by its fruiting capsule which is borne on a stem which elongates up to high.  Description  Corybas cryptanthus is a terrestrial, perennial, saprophytic, herb with its leaves reduced to tiny triangular scales on horizontal rhizoids buried in leaf litter. There is a single more or transparent whitish to pinkish flower with red or purple streaks. Its dorsal sepal is long and lance-shaped. The lateral sepals and petals are thread-like, the lateral sepals longer than the petals and often appear above the leaf litter. The labellum is up to long with its end covered with many branched lobes covered with tiny cilia. Flowering occurs from June to October following which the flowering stem elongates greatly, with the fruiting capsule on the end up to above the litter layer.  Taxonomy  Edwin Hatch was the first to formally describe this species in 1951 but he gave it the name Corybas saprophyticus, unaware that the name had already been used for a different orchid. The name was therefore a nom. illeg. and in 1956 Hatch changed the name to Corybas cryptanthus. The original and the corrected descriptions were published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand. The specific epithet (cryptanthus) is derived from Ancient Greek words kryptos meaning \\"hidden\\" or \\"secret\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat The hidden spider orchid grows in dense shrubland and tall forest in partly decomposed leaf litter. It occurs on the North, South and Three Kings Islands. Ecology It has been suggested that C. cryptanthus is partly a parasite on the roots of southern beech trees, obtaining nutrients via a fungus.

He competed in college for the St. Mary's Gaels. Early life Waldow began playing competitive basketball in eighth grade. In his sophomore season at Ponderosa High School, he slimmed down and had a growth spurt that saw him increase his height from 6'2 to 6'7. Waldow averaged 26 points and 11 rebounds per game as a senior. Despite this, he was lightly recruited and one of the few collegiate offers came from St. Mary's. College career Waldow redshirted his freshman year at St. Mary's, which he used to add muscle to his frame. In an overtime win against San Diego on March 10, 2013, Waldow contributed 23 points, 16 rebounds, and four blocked shots and had a tooth knocked out while fighting for a rebound. He then tried to hand the tooth to coach Randy Bennett. After the incident, Waldow used a vampire mouthguard and had reconstructive dental surgery. Due to better conditioning, Waldow put up 15 points and 7.5 rebounds per game as a junior and improved his post game. Waldow was a First-Team All- West Coast Conference and NABC All-District selection as a junior and senior. He set a career high with 29 points in a game against Boise State on December 6, 2014. As a senior, Waldow posted 19.0 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. He was one of two players in the country to average in excess of 19 points and nine rebounds per game alongside Iona's David Laury. He finished his St. Mary's career ranked second in games played with 134 and fourth in points (1,743), rebounds (900) and blocks (133). Waldow participated in the Reese's Division I College All-Star Game on April 3, 2015 and had 12 points and six rebounds. Professional career Prior to the 2015 NBA draft, Waldow worked out with a number of NBA teams including the Milwaukee Bucks. In August 2015, Waldow signed with the Antwerp Giants of the Belgian league. He was inside the Brussels airport at the time of the terror attacks of March 22, 2016. Waldow was scheduled to board a flight to Italy to play in the FIBA Europe Cup, but did not get on the plane due to the attacks. According to Waldow, he was inside the food court with a teammate when he heard screams and ran downstairs to meet with the rest of the team. He later played with Fos Provence Basket of the French Liga B and averaged 11.1 points and 6 rebounds per game. In September 2017, Waldow inked with the Turów Zgorzelec of the Polish Basketball League. He posted 13.3 points and 7.6 rebounds per game in Poland. On August 1, 2018, Waldow signed with Caen Basket Calvados of the French second division. On November 16, Waldow parted way with the team and announced to head to Japan and signed with Nishinomiya Storks of Japan second division on December 6, 2018.

She is the host of Radio 3Fourteen.Staff (ndg) \\"From Alt-right to Alt-lite: Naming the Hate\\" Anti- Defamation League. Retrieved: May 7, 2018  Early life and education  Lokteff was born in Oregon and is of Russian descent. She identifies as a pagan. She attended Portland State University and later worked in music production. Career  In 2011, she married Henrik Palmgren, the Swedish host of web media company Red Ice. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Red Ice started in 2003 covering the paranormal and conspiracy theories before shifting to white nationalism and antisemitism. Lokteff and Palmgren have been jointly cited as an influential introduction to white nationalism by members of the far right. Red Ice shifted around 2012 in response to what the couple perceived as \\"anti-white sentiment\\" coinciding with the Black Lives Matter movement. Lokteff has denied the Holocaust and the Native American genocide. She has publicized the work of denialist historians such as David Cole and Mark Weber. Following the election of Donald Trump in 2016, Lokteff has attempted to increase the number of white women involved in the predominately male-dominated alt-right movement, advocating for them to play a supporting role to men. Lokteff opposes feminism, claiming that it has made life more difficult for men and that feminism's goals of equality have already been achieved. She has also criticized some of the women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. New York magazine describes her as a \\"looks- obsessed eugenicist\\", quoting her as saying \\"The alt-right is a very attractive, very sexy bunch ... Matches are being made left and right of beautiful, intelligent couples. It's a eugenic process.\\" She has been frequently trolled and threatened by members of the alt-right. In 2018, Lokteff was a guest on the podcast of a Florida schoolteacher who used the pseudonym Tiana Dalichov. She used the podcast to encourage white nationalists to become schoolteachers to influence children. In October 2019, Red Ice TV's YouTube channel was banned by YouTube for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban. A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.

The larva is semiaquatic and lives in the gelatinous ooze associated with leaks of sewage effluent, drains, and in trickling filter systems. Description The adult female fly is about long, the male being slightly smaller. The wings are broad and held at an angle away from the body. They are clad with dense tufts of hairlike scales along the veins, and are grey, with a mottled appearance. The wing muscles are relatively weak and the insects mostly run or hop, occasionally making short flights. The males hatch first and only survive for a few days, while unmated females may live for a week. Distribution and habitat Originating in North America, this insect has spread around the world. Its range includes Europe, western Asia and South America. It had become established in Britain by 2000, in Brazil by 2006, in Norway by 2011, in Iraq and Croatia by 2013 and in Spain by 2016. The larvae develop in moist areas rich in organic matter such as drains and trickling filter systems, but also in ditches and sludges of decaying organic matter. The adult insects seldom move far from where they were hatched. Life cycle The eggs are laid in the moist places in which the larvae will feed. Up to 100 are laid by the female, sometimes singly, but usually in gelatinous batches of 15 to 40. The eggs are translucent and under a millimetre in diameter. They hatch in about two days at . The larvae are slender, whitish, cream or pale brown, with a head with strong jaws, 11 body segments, and siphons on the hindermost two segments. The larval stage lasts for about 15 days at 70 °F, and it is in the larval stage that the insect will usually overwinter, in diapause. The pupae are yellowish brown to brown and have a pair of ear-like respiratory processes on the head end. The pupal stage lasts for one or two days. Both larvae and pupae are usually to be found in the top of the substrate, sometimes deeper than this when the material is fairly dry. Ecology A trickling filter system is a form of biological treatment widely used to process sewage. The sewage or other wastewater flows downwards over a medium such as gravel which is supported on a permeable membrane. In the medium live over 200 species of bacteria, algae, worms, protozoa, and insects including larvae of the drain fly; together these organisms form a biofilm which processes the fluid passing through the filter system and removes pollutants.

Burnstein (1900-1980), a rabbinic ordinand of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, was a writer, editor and interfaith leader. Burnstein was born in Kiev, Ukraine and, after making his way to the United States, graduated from Northwestern University. At a ceremony where Hayim Nahman Bialik received an honorary Doctorate of Hebrew Letters by the Seminary, Burnstein was ordained in June 1926—in the same class as Rabbis Joel S. Geffen, Israel M. Goldman, Elhanan H. Golomb, Jacob Granowitz, Louis Greenberg, Lewis B. Grossman, Moses Hadas, Michael Higger, Jonas Kaminkowski, Herbert Parzen and Benjamin Unger. In addition to his rabbinic ordination, Burnstein also held a Masters Degree from Columbia University and earned a Doctorate of Divinity from the Seminary in 1965. In 1928, Burnstein began what was, according to The New York Times, a ten-year term serving Temple Beth El of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A young rabbi, only three years after ordination, at the Rabbinical Assembly conference of 1929, Burnstein lectured on \\"The Abiding Values of the Resurrection Belief.\\" Only two years into his tenure at Temple Beth El, Burnstein witnessed and offered some words upon the congregation's dedication of its new building in 1930 at a ceremony attended both by Harrisburg's mayor George A. Hoverter and Philadelphia's Rabbi Max D. Klein. Pamela Susan Nadell and Marc Lee Raphael write, however, that Rabbi Max \\"Gelb succeeded ... Burnstein as rabbi of Temple Beth El, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (1933–39)\\" and \\"found the congregation beset by serious financial problems, brought on by the Depression ... [a] declining membership and the failure of most of the congregation's auxiliaries.\\" The exact dating of Burnstein's tenure in Harrisburg is complicated by the official records of Tifereth Israel Congregation in New Bedford, MA, which note that \\"Rabbi Alexander Burnstein was elected to replace Rabbi [Nochman S.] Arnoff on January 30, 1927, but only stayed with this congregation for 2 years before returning to New York.\\" During this time it is recorded that \\"Cantor Boris Alper came to the congregation in 1928, and formed the first mixed choir\\" before Alper \\"passed away in 1947.\\" Ultimately \\"Rabbi Bernard H. Ziskind was elected to replace Rabbi Burnstein.\\" (One separate record recalls Ziskind as having begun his career in New Bedford in 1930.) Notably, the Report of the Forty-Second Year of the Jewish Publication Society of America 1929-1930 indicates that there was in this time period a Rabbi A. Burnstein at Beth El in Harrisburg, PA. On December 1, 1938, upon the successful arrangement of this position by Cyrus Adler (who had presided over Burnstein's ordination less than a decade before), became the executive secretary of the Advisory Committee on Refugee Jewish Ministers from 1938 to 1942. Burnstein, who, in this capacity worked with representatives of the three major denominations of American Judaism at the time, regarded Adler as having \\"done more toward the consummation of this project than any other man.\\" In this capacity, Burnstein was tasked with handling all of the requests that Adler had forwarded from cantors and rabbis asking the Seminary to bring them to the United States from Europe. On May 1, 1939, Burnstein informed Adler that he had successfully relocated 33 rabbis to the United States, including Rabbi Emil Schorsch of Hanover, the father of JTS' former Chancellor Rabbi Dr. Ismar Schorsch. As Adler's health waned, Louis Finkelstein took Adler's stead, and Burnstein became a regular correspondent with Finkestein, asking the latter to urge congregations to hire refugee rabbis he recommended. Burnstein's employment in this position ceased in 1942. It is known that, during the Holocaust, Burnstein corresponded with Joseph H. Hertz, the Chief Rabbi of England. Prior to 1942, when Burnstein began to serve the Orthodox congregation Millinery Center Synagogue in Manhattan (the city in which he died ten years after his retirement in 1970), Burnstein had previously led congregations in—aside from HarrisburgNew Bedford, Massachusetts; Newark, New Jersey and Long Beach, New York. In 1945—while serving Millinery Center Synagogue—Burnstein joined the editorial board of the quarterly Conservative Judaism, a journal to which he would later contribute his own writings and remained on the editorial board through 1951. Between 1949 and 1950, Burnstein served as a member of the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law (since renamed the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards). An activist, Burnstein was a signatory to \\"A proclamation on the moral rights of the stateless and Palestinian Jews,\\" published in 1941 calling for support for the Jewish plight in Palestine. In that same year, Burnstein spoke at the East Midwood Jewish Center, where Rev. Dr. Harry Halpern served as the rabbi; the former, in the capacity of \\"guest preacher\\" was scheduled to deliver on December 12, 1941 \\"A Message to the Defeated.\\" Although the content of the speech appears not to be recorded, it is notable that this talk was delivered the first Friday night (Shabbat evening) after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Burnstein is also the author of a widely disseminated piece (having appeared in Milwaukee's The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle and The Jewish Floridian) on finding meaning in the idea of freedom when celebrating Passover in an age dominated by technological advance and globalization. Burnstein evidently believed that the Decalogue was an important ecumenical guideline for people of all faiths and non-faiths to follow. The New York Times reported the day after an April 30 multifaith gathering at which Burnstein spoke: Burnstein was one of two Jews, both rabbis (the other being Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel), who contributed to a volume celebrating the lifework of Reinhold Niebuhr. Burnstein, a Jewish \\"admirer\\" of Niebuhr, wrote of his disagreement with Niebuhr in focusing on teshuvah rather than original sin in understanding human behavior.

He is the featured designer mentor in the 2002 award-winning documentary, The World's Most Fashionable Prison. Early life and education Quiñones was born on February 28, 1980, in Bobon, Northern Samar. He is a son of a policeman and a biology teacher. As a young child, he never imagined he would be a fashion designer. After three years of studying Political Science at the University of Eastern Philippines, he left the island of Samar to go to Manila. Personal Logo of Puey Quiñones Quiñones' interest in fashion started when he was in high school in Bobon. He was inspired by his neighbor Dennis Lustico, who became a successful fashion designer in Manila. Quiñones wanted to become a designer but thought would be impossible for him to achieve. “I thought that in order to become a designer, you must come from a rich family and study fashion design abroad,” he said. Manila In 1999, Quiñones decided to move to Manila to work as an all-around assistant in Lustico's atelier. In the early hours, he would sew buttons and do the hems, but once everyone departed, he made sketches and left them on Lustico's desk. The established designer took notice, and under his mentorship, Quiñones learned the technical skills necessary for the job. Eventually, Lustico recommended him to Bergamo. At Bergamo, Quiñones designed embroideries for the Barong Tagalog and new cuts for suits in Piña material, innovating the traditional Filipino suit. His big break came in 2002 when he became a finalist at The Philippines Young Designers Competition for Paris. It was through this competition that he would meet his first client, Filipino politician, philanthropist, and socialite, TingTing Cojuangco. In 2005, Quiñones opened an atelier at The Bel Air in Makati City, Philippines. His clientele grew and he organized his first solo show, Swell, where he presented a 30-piece collection made of Koryo silk (a local weave in the Philippines). Los Angeles After a decade of leading a successful design house in Manila, Quiñones decided to relocate to Los Angeles, California. He was one of the featured designers for the historic J Summer Fashion Show, produced by Jessica Minh Ahn, held at One World Trade Center in New York City in June 2014. In 2015, Quiñones became Creative Director for global bridal brand, Cocomelody. Partnership In 2018, Quiñones and partner, Paul Martineau, established Puey Quiñones, Los Angeles in the designer’s downtown atelier. They opened two showrooms in Bel- Air Village, Makati City: the first for Quiñones’ eponymous high fashion brand and the second for Cocomelody bridal wear. In 2020, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art purchased a Quiñones mini-dress with pouf sleeves for the permanent collection. Works Quiñones's designs have graced publications, television shows, movies, music videos, and red carpet events. *In June 2014, he presented a 15-piece collection for J Summer Fashion Show in New York City's One World Trade Center, entitled Fly, which reflects the spirit and design of the venue — ethereal, hopeful, powerful and stunning. Not one to miss out on the irony of the experience, Puey clearly identified with the symbolism of the World Trade Center: to rise after a fall, to fly and soar with a vision, renewed confidence, and newfound strength. *Quiñones was a guest designer for America's Next Top Model Cycle 21. He designed clothes using fabrics native to the Philippines for a runway challenge where the contestants had to walk on stilts. *Designed one of Katy Perry's costumes for her Dark Horse (Katy Perry song) music video. *In October 2017, after eight (8) years, he did a solo fashion show for MEGA Fashion Week SS18 held in Manila, Philippines. The collections were revealed in two different acts: first is an all-white bridal ensemble with a romantic silhouette, and the second is Quiñones's signature aesthetic of bold, vibrant colors, patterns (some beaded so intricately), mischievous accents, and confounding textures. *He dressed HFPA member Janet Nepales and Filipino-American television host and journalist Janelle So-Perkins at the 75th Golden Globe Awards. *ENews! correspondent and TV host, Zuri Hall wore a pink silk taffeta dress by Quiñones to the Met Gala in 2019.

Radio Jet NGC 3309 has a radio jet emerging out of its center. The jet is two- sided and the northeastern part of the jet appears to end in a spur. The southwestern part of the jet lies along a straight line. At a projected distance of about ~ from the nucleus, the jet appears to narrow into a nozzle- like structure before it expands into a lobe extending away from the galaxy. The predominant part of the radio emission in the Hydra Cluster comes from NGC 3309. The radio emission in NGC 3309 may have been triggered by a resent perturbation with the giant spiral galaxy NGC 3312. Globular clusters NGC 3309 has an estimated population of about globular clusters.

Holland began selling prints in a shop at 66 Drury Lane in 1782 and published a number of prints during the 1784 election. He move to new premises at 50 Oxford Street in 1788 , where he charged 1s for admittance to his 'Museum of Graphic Genius'. Holland's successful business grew and his list included works by Frederick George Byron, George Murgatroyd Woodward, and John Nixon, as well as James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson . A radical, he was prosecuted in 1793 on charges of seditious libel for selling a copy of Thomas Paine's Letter Addressed to the Addressers and imprisoned in Newgate Prison where he encountered Lord George Gordon and other radicals and communicated with John Horne Tooke.

In 1905, Juggilal and his family shifted to their Kanpur house after a division in the family business which then owned two flour mills — the Ganges Flour Mill and Cawnpore Flour Mill — apart from being the sole selling agents for Elgin Mills, Cawnpore Cotton Mills and Victoria Mills. The division created two new business units - Baldeodas-Kedarnath and Baijnath-Juggilal. After Kamlapat the business was passed on to his three sons - Padampat, Kailashpat and Lakshmipat. Padampat established Straw Products Ltd in 1940 with support from Nawab of Bhopal - Hamidullah Khan. The brothers set up a gas plant - JK Rampur Gas Plant - with support from princely state of Rampur. They also acquired a plant of the Aluminium Corporation of India in Asansol. Lakshmipat took the lead in order to make the plant operational. He also established a small steel plant - JK Steels - near Rishra in West Bengal, and a paper mill in Odisha. The brothers also acquired National Insurance Company during the period of World War II. The family supported the British Government during the war years and stepped up the production to meet the needs of British Army. Due to the support given to British Government during the war years, Padampat Singhania was conferred with knighthood at The Viceroy's House, New Delhi, on 23 February 1943. In 1944, the family bought a woolen textile mill - Raymond Woollen Mills - in Thane from E.D. Sassoon & Co.. Kailashpat took charge of the company and was instrumental in its growth. Today Raymond Group is a leading producer of fabrics in India. The business subsequently got divided between the brothers. Padampat took over the north Zone with Kanpur as headquarters. Lakshmipat resettled in Kolkata and took control of eastern zone while Kailashpat moved to Mumbai to head the western zone. Later on Lakshmipat moved to Delhi and established it as headquarters for businesses under his control. Family branches =Kanpur branch= Padampat Singhania continued to manage the businesses from Kanpur while his younger brothers moved to Mumbai and Kolkata. Being eldest in the family he was the President of the group but the companies operated independently with some cross holdings among them. After Padampat, his eldest son Gaur Hari Singhania became head of the businesses which were under Kanpur branch of the family. Padampat's younger son Govind Hari Singhania was also involved in the business. After Gaur Hari Singhania's death the business is now headed by his son Yadupat Singhania.

He also established a small steel plant - JK Steels in West Bengal - and a paper mill in Odisha. In 1960s, due to labor union problems in West Bengal and nationalisation of several companies under family's control, the family moved from Kolkata to Delhi. After Lakshmipat, his eldest son Hari Shankar Singhania took over the control of the companies and managed it along with his brothers and other family members.

Slauerhoff before his death. Background and content Slauerhoff's health had always been frail, and in October 1935 he was sick again, with malaria He was taken off his ship and brought to a hospital in Genoa. He spent time rehabilitating in Merano, Annecy, and Lausanne and by February 1936 fell ill again. He returned to the Netherlands, tenaciously hanging on to life in a nursing home in Hilversum but too weak to travel to a spa. He worked on Een eerlijk zeemansgraf in Hilversum, and wrote a note to fellow poet P. C. Boutens saying the volume's title was ominous. The collection indeed contains a poem called \\"Uitvaart\\" (\\"Funeral\\"), whose first draft he jotted down in his journal 12 years before, when he fell ill on his first sea journey. Publishing history The collection was published (by Nijgh & Van Ditmar, Rotterdam) as Slauerhoff was in the nursing home in Hilversum, where he would die of malaria and tuberculosis on 5 October 1936. The book was reprinted in 1937 and 1954 (edited by Kees Lekkerkerker), and then again in 1985 for Nijgh & Van Ditmar's edition of Slauerhoff's poetry in individual volumes. Critical responses Critic Kees Fens, in 1996, remembered that Een eerlijk zeemansgraf was, for him, the most engrossing of Slauerhoff's poems in part because it sketched a sailor's life so well. Fens loved the exotic names, and remarked that for Slauerhoff every port was his homeport as long as it wasn't a Dutch port.

Career As of 2018, Donald has worked in the insurance industry \\"for more than 20 years\\". Donald and business partner Neil Fox have \\"acquired a string of companies\\". On 3 September 2019, Donald sold Bridle Insurance to Finch Group. Football In February 2010, he bought Eastleigh F.C. in the Conference South. In May 2017, with the club now one division higher in the National League, he told the Southern Daily Echo that he would repeat his total investment of £10 million in the club in the aim of getting them into the English Football League. He developed a reputation for being careful with money, saying that he \\"hit the roof\\" because the club were giving free bottles of water to players who would only drink half; he saved the team £500 by stopping this. In July 2015, Donald paid £500,000 to buy a 10% stake in Oxford United, the club he had supported his whole life and previously donated to. He did not become a member of the board due to conflict of interest relating to his role at Eastleigh. In April 2018, Donald was chosen to be the leader of a consortium offering to purchase Sunderland, who were put up for sale by billionaire owner Ellis Short after a second successive relegation to League One. He agreed to sell Eastleigh so that he could own Sunderland. On 21 May, he officially became owner of Sunderland, doing so without the consortium to speed the transition. On 31 December 2019, news broke that Donald was reportedly trying to sell the club after 19 months of ownership, due to backlash from fans. A week later, the board stated that it would look to sell the club because \\"long-term success cannot be achieved by a disunited club\\". In an interview with TalkSport in April 2020, Donald stated that he was aware that he had made mistakes during his tenure as owner and that he understood the fans dissatisfaction. He also stated his intention to still remain a minority shareholder once the club had been sold.https://talksport.com/football/efl/694073/sunderland-owner-stewart- donald-sell/ In an interview with BBC Radio Newcastle on 17 July 2020, Donald publicly named his asking price to purchase the club to any interested parties.

The initial deployment consisted of UAE military aircraft carrying more than fifty UAE soldiers and two armored vehicles, followed by two more aircraft carrying more soldiers, tanks and other armored vehicles. Al Jazeera reported that shortly after landing, UAE forces dismissed Yemeni soldiers stationed at administrative installations such as Socotra Airport and seaports until further notice, and the flag of the United Arab Emirates was raised above official government buildings in Hadibu. Background Since 2000, UAE humanitarian organizations such as Emirates Red Crescent have played an active role in Socotra. The organization provided relief and aid in March 2000 after major floods damaged buildings and agriculture. In a 2003 US diplomatic cable, Iranian companies were also noted to have completed several projects in Yemen, including building the Socotra airport strip. In 2015, cyclone Chapala and cyclone Megh struck the island, causing severe damages to the Island's infrastructure, homes, roads, and power. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, the United Arab Emirates sent an aid ship and plane, carrying tons of food, blankets and tents, and barrels of food. In 2016, the UAE increased supplies delivered to Socotra which had been largely abandoned and forgotten during the ongoing conflict. In October 2016, the 31st cargo aircraft landed in Socotra Airport containing two tons of aid. At that time, the UAE also established a military base on the island as part of the Saudi led intervention. In 2017, Emirati troops had already been deployed on the island as part of the Saudi-led intervention, some Yemeni political factions accused the UAE of attempting to occupy Socotra and looting and ravaging the flora of the island. History Yemen's internationally recognised government condemned the takeover as \\"an act of aggression\\"; however no military resistance to Emirati troops was reported. The Independent newspaper reported that the UAE has annexed the island and built a communications network, as well as conducted census and provided Socotra residents with free healthcare and work permits in Abu Dhabi. Two weeks later on 14 May, Saudi troops were also deployed to the archipelago and a deal was brokered between the United Arab Emirates and Yemen for a joint military training exercise and the return of administrative control of Socotra's airport and seaport to Yemen. Reactions A statement from Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr’s office said the UAE military’s seizure of the seaport and airport on Socotra was an “unjustified” assault on Yemen's sovereigny. The UAE Foreign Ministry responded by saying it was \\"surprised\\" by the statement and blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for \\"distorting\\" its role – \\"The UAE military presence in all liberated Yemeni provinces, including Socotra, comes within the efforts of the Arab Coalition to support legitimate government at this critical stage in the history of Yemen.\\" UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash tweeted, \\"Some have recently remembered Socotra Island to challenge the Arab coalition and the UAE. We have historical relations with the families and people of Socotra.\\" On 3 May 2018, protests rallied against the UAE takeover, demanding an immediate withdrawal. However, on 6 May 2018, pro-Emirati supporters gathered in the island's capital Hadibu to support the UAE presence on the island. On 10 May 2018, the United States said it was \\"closely following the situation on the island of Socotra\\" and called for \\"de-escalation and dialogue\\" between the UAE and Yemen. On 11 May 2018, Turkey showed concern about the event. The Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs said \\"we are closely following the recent developments in Yemen's Socotra Island. We are concerned about these developments that pose a new threat to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Yemen\\", and called on all relevant actors to respect the legitimate Yemeni government and to refrain from taking measures that could further complicate the situation. The Yemeni political party claimed, as of 8 September 2020, that the government of United Arab Emirates (UAE) had been trying to build a military base on Yemen's Socotra island. The Yemeni government has accused the UAE of supporting Southern Transitional Council (STC) to take control of the Socotra province with its own interests in Yemen.

The airport has no IATA or ICAO designation.  Facilities  Ennis Municipal Airport covers at an elevation of 500 ft (152 m) above mean sea level and has one runway: * Runway 15/33: 3,999 x 50 ft. (1,219 x 15 m), Surface: Asphalt For the 12-month period ending 4 April 2016, the airport had 3,720 aircraft operations, averaging 10 per day: 97% general aviation and 3% military. 12 aircraft were then based at this airport: 83% single-engine and 17% multi- engine.  Replacement plan  Initial consideration for a replacement airport began in 2005 to address maintenance problems and a lack of space; the existing runway cannot be extended economically due to proximity to FM Road 1722 and Lake Clark, and it has chronic paving problems due to poor soil and drainage. An economic feasibility assessment was done for a new 490 ac (198 ha) airport—with a 5,000 ft (1,524 m) runway capable of handling business jets—adjacent to a new 300 ac (121 ha) business park. Moving the airport would allow the redevelopment of of land for residential purposes, and proceeds from the sale of the existing airport site will be applied to the new airport project. By September 2008, a provisional site was selected near the Texas Motorplex, with grants from the State Airport Fuel Fund (TxDOT) and the FAA to cover 90% of the cost, and the city the other 10%, with only the environmental assessment awaiting completion. However, the plans were shelved by early 2010 due to economic pressure and FAA funding cuts. The proposal has been revived as of late 2017.  Accidents and incidents  * 10 January 1998: An Aero Commander 500B, registration number N556BW, struck power lines and terrain during an attempted single-engine go-around; the pilot and copilot were killed, the aircraft was destroyed, and the single passenger (who was also a commercially rated pilot) was seriously injured. After departing from nearby Lancaster Municipal Airport, the right-hand engine lost power, and the pilots shut it down and initiated a precautionary landing on Runway 15 at Ennis Municipal. The rated passenger remarked that the approach \\"seemed textbook perfect,\\" but the pilots initiated a go-around for unknown reasons. As the flying pilot raised the flaps and began raising the landing gear, the nose pitched up, and the \\"left wing started up in what [the passenger believed] to be a VMC roll.\\" The craft clipped power lines and impacted the ground in a right-wing-low attitude, coming to rest inverted. The accident was attributed to the failure of the pilots to maintain minimum control speed (VMC) during go-around, various maintenance problems with the right-hand engine, excessive gross weight, an excessively forward center of gravity, and both pilots' lack of experience in the aircraft make and model.

Life in England Samuel Thomas Pettigrew was born in 1827 in London, as the son of an eminent physician. He completed his graduation as a Bachelow of the Arts, from the Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1848, and proceeded to get is Master of Arts in 1851. In 1848, he was ordained as a deacon by the Bishop of London, and as a priest in 1849. In 1853 he became a tutor and Fellow of St Augustine's College, Canterbury, and remained there till 1855. After serving a curacy for a short period at Westminster, he travelled to the East, where he served as chaplain of the Honourable East India Company, and was able to combine his priestly work and with his interest for natural history. Life in India In 1855 he was appointed in the services of the East India Company, at Madras. In India he served at Rangoon (now Burma) (1855–57); Kamptee (1857–64); Bangalore (1864–67); Ootacamund (1869–72); Trevandrum (1874–77). Pettigrew was deeply interested in natural science, and was a keen botanist- entomologist, interested in the study of insects, birds, flowers, trees, architecture, church and school buildings, and Eurasian education. Bangalore, India =Bishop Cottons Schools, Bangalore= In Bangalore, Pettigrew lived in a bungalow, called Sidney Park (present Kasturba Road) costing about £12 per month. Here, he made his plans on establishing schools and building churches in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. His priority was schools, as those days most of the European and Eurasian children were being educated at Roman Catholic schools. The Government School at that time, was meant for the natives and did not encourage Eurasians to join, and other schools were far away in the Niligriris and at Madras. Hence, the Bishop Cotton's scheme of education for the hills was selected and a plan was made and forwarded to the Madras Government. Pettigrew was able to push for the inclusion of female students for the school, which had so far been resisted. His efforts were commentated with a mention in an Indian newspaper with the title The March of Female Education. The first 12 months of the school faced many difficulties and in this period, support came from General Hill and Captain Lavie, and the services of Rev Dr George Uglow Pope, renowned Canadian Tamil scholar, were obtained. =St. Paul's Church, Bangalore= Pettigrew describes the Church of England mission chapel as being nothing more than a plain and ugly building. An oblong structure having plastered walls, holes with wooden shutters for the windows. The interior was brick and mortar construction, 9 ft height serving as pulpit. A common table covered with an old red baize cloth was used as the altar. There were no seats, as the native population were used to sitting on the floor. A verandah which ran on the north and south sides of the chapel gave protection against the sun. A low mud wall served as the compound. At the entrance, existed a triangle which was used for punishing recalcitrant drummer, and in this triangle was the bell used for summoning the worshippers. A native deacon lived in a portion of the native schools, opposite to the church. The deacon received his stipend from the Venerable Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and the school was being run by voluntary donations. Pettigrew went through the records of the church and describes its history as being first planted by some German missionaries related to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, in the 18th century. It was then transferred to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and managed by a committee based in Madras. A spark of life was given to this church in 1817, when a chaplain brought together the scattered congregation. For the next 19 years, the worship was done in the small schoolroom with the sacraments being administered by the chaplain of the St. Mark's Church in English, which was not understood by the Tamil natives. Under Canon Trevor of York, the mission was re-constituted with the church being rebuilt covered by subscription and funds provided by SPCK. Additional schools were also opened. On 31 March 1940, he church was consecrated as 'St. Paul's Mission Church' for the purpose of native Christians. Later a missionary was appointed by SPG and a mission house constructed. In 1852, Bishop Dealtry gave licence for a native priest, but was shorty withdrawn. In 1864, there was one native deacon, one catechist, a school master and a school mistress, the native congregation by that reaching 300. The Boys school attached to the church had 40 students, and the girls school 30 students, who were provided a daily meal and given clothes once a year with funds provided by a benevolent lady resident of the Cantonment. =All Saint’s Church, Bangalore= S T Pettigrew was the driving force behind building the All Saint's Church, which stands on Hosur Road, Richmond Town, Bangalore. According to his records, the site of the church was initially allocated for a small colony of European pensioners, as the St. Mark's Cathedral was getting full. A modest sum of INR 100 had been collected and a small plot had been allotted at the corner of the parade grounds. This initial plan was however rejected by the Church Building Society in Madras, as being too small, and a design drawn up Robert Chisholm, Consulting Architect, Madras Government was suggested as the alternate. After this Pettigrew left for the Nilgiris and returned after 2 years and found there was no progress in building the church. A decision was made to build the church with private contributions, with the estimated cost being INR 10,000. On 27 November 1869, the foundation stone was laid. The building project however faced much difficulties, financially and also otherwise. However, after the scaffolding, the community stepped up. Donations were made towards the altar, altar cross, vestments, font, pulpit, and communion plate. The Principal of Cooper's Hill College donated the rose window in memory of his child. The exterior of the building was completed for INR 2,000 lower than the original estimate. As, Bishop Waller was on sick leave in England, Bishop Milman who was visiting, consecrated the church on 17 October 1870. The services commenced under the chaplaincy of Rev Dr George Uglow Pope, who was then the warden of the Bishop Cotton's School. Retirement On his return from India, he served as Curate-in-charge of Pudleston, 1878–80, and then as the Vicar of Hatfield, 1880–87. He died at Leominster in 1889. Books authored S T Pettigrew, anonymously authored the book Episodes in the Life of an Indian Chaplain, where he describes his life as chaplain of the Honourable East India Company serving in India, at Rangoon, Kamptee, Bangalore, Ootacamund and Trevandrum.

The vessels will also be equipped to provide emergency humanitarian relief in areas affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes. The first ship was expected to be delivered in 2022. In April 2020, TOTE Services signed a contract with Philly Shipyard (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for the construction of up to five NSMVs, with the first two delivered in Spring and Winter 2023 for a cost of US$630M.  Background  The US maritime academies train future officers and engineers for the US merchant fleet. An integral part of this training is annual voyage at sea aboard a training vessel. Much of the year the vessels are laid up, and as US government owned ships they can be activated and deployed to provide housing for disaster relief workers. As of 2018 the current vessels were aging. The newest was almost 30 years old and oldest, Empire State, was 56 years old and had an antiquated steam power plant. The ships also fail international emission standards and this has impacted their training itineraries. MARAD provides the training ships and in 2015 initiated a program to develop a purpose-built ship design that would combine the training and disaster relief missions. This dual purpose led to the class name of the design as National Security Multi-Mission Vessel.  Design Considerations  In 2015 the Herbert Engineering Corp. of Alameda, CA began work on a preliminary design for what became the NSMV. The ship dimensions would have to fit the existing mooring berths at the service academies. The design team visited three of the academies to learn of their training requirements. While primarily a training ship, the vessels would also be equipped for disaster relief. These included a Roll-on/Roll-off side ramp, container space and crane, and a helipad.  Project Status  In February 2018 the design stage was in Phase 3 of development and in sufficient detail to present to shipyards for construction bidding. In March 2018 the US federal budget included funding for the NSMV project and the first ship was expected to enter service in 2022. A construction contract was to have been awarded to a shipyard in the second quarter of 2019 but proposed 2019 federal budget reductions cut the allocated amount per ship from $300M to only $205M. This reduced amount would require abandonment of the NSMV design and a complete redesign for a smaller ship. The 2020 budget requested by President Trump would restore the allocation to $300M. In April 2020, TOTE Services signed a contract with Philly Shipyard (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for the construction of up to five NSMVs, with the first two delivered in Spring and Winter 2023 for a cost of US$630M. In prospect are the three remaining NSMVs, with series production estimated to be worth $1.5B.Philly Shipyard books $630 million NSMV training ship order, Nick Blenkey, MarineLog.com, 2020-04-08 In July 2020, Wabtec Corp received an order to supply 16V250 Tier 4 Diesel Engines for this project.

The SwissCham fosters business ties and friendship between Swiss and Singaporean companies, which are dating back for soon 200 years. Formerly known as the Swiss Business Association (“SBA”), it acts as the spokesperson of Swiss business interests in Singapore towards Singaporean and Swiss authorities as well as other chambers and business groups, cultivating the Swiss networking culture in Singapore and the region. History Being already present in Singapore for soon 200 years, Swiss companies intensified their activities and strengthened their presence in Singapore soon after it became a sovereign nation in 1965 and Switzerland decided to establish diplomatic relationships with the city- state in 1967. Swiss investments have been among the top five foreign direct investments (FDI) ever since, demonstrated by already more than 100 Swiss companies having had a presence in Singapore by the end of the 1980s. The need for an official forum to help these companies exchanging ideas and accessing information became increasingly important. In 1988, with the help of the Swiss Ambassador Kurt O. Wyss, the SBA was founded by a group of visionary Swiss- Singaporean businessmen and entrepreneurs. After representing and serving its members for over 25 years, the SBA committee conducted in 2015 a strategic review of its activities, vision and mission. With a transformation roadmap and revised statutes approved by the annual general meeting in 2016, the SBA got rebranded to the Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Singapore in 2017, underlining its continuous efforts to raise awareness on its work as a chamber of commerce and industry and staying relevant in a fast and constantly changing world. This sharpened focus of its activities included a variety of new initiatives such as a professionalized online presence and digital communication concept throughout 2016 as well as in 2017 the launch of the inaugural Swiss Business Award honoring “Excellence in People & Skills Development”. Core activities The mandate of the SwissCham is to represent and advocate its members’ interests and offer a platform for practicing and living the Swiss networking culture, following the overarching goal of promoting and fostering the Swiss trade, services, manufacturing and investments in Singapore. Its core activities are grouped in four main pillars: Firstly, a 360 degree networking platform for interacting among members as well as with other Singaporean companies and professionals, other chambers of commerce as well as other Swiss organizations in Singapore. Secondly, a broad range of attractive events including member presentations, knowledge sharing or cultural and social events to get a better understanding of Singapore, its history and the resulting business and networking culture. Thirdly, advocating work for its members interests towards the Swiss authorities in Switzerland and in Singapore, towards the local authorities in Singapore (primarily through its standing seat in the board of governors of the European Chamber of Commerce in Singapore), and towards other business organizations through regular interactions in industry group meetings. And fourthly, a selective range of services and benefits offered to its members, including an online FAQ with key knowledge for setting up and running a business in Singapore from a Swiss perspective, or on-demand support for members with regards to business relevant topics such as access to relevant industry or market data, or regulatory or labour market aspects. Swiss Business Award honoring 'Excellence in People & Skills Development' From left to right: Dr. Tom Ludescher, Rajan Arul (General Manager Firmenich Singapore), Guy Parmelin (Federal Councillor of Switzerland), and Thomas Kupfer (former Ambassador of Switzerland to Singapore) The Swiss Business Award introduced in 2017 rewards and recognizes Singapore-based companies for their efforts and initiatives in developing their workforce through ‘Excellence in People & Skills Development’. Education and talent development are particularly relevant for Singapore and Switzerland, both of which having repeatedly topped worldwide educational rankings such as the Programme for International Student Assessment published each year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the Global Innovation Index published each year by INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organization. The nominations for the Swiss Business Award are evaluated by an independent jury consisting of high ranking representatives from business and academia in Singapore. Singapore-based Firmenich Asia Pte. Ltd. won the inaugural Swiss Business Award in 2017 for its dedication to local workforce. In 2018, Marché Mövenpick won the Swiss Business Award dedication to the skills development of its employees. Marché cooperates with local schools, such as polytechnics and Institute of Higher Education (ITE), to offer internship opportunities to students. Members While its founding members had mostly a link to the financial industry, the member base of the SwissCham grew to over 200 corporate members by 2018, from start-up companies and well established SMEs to large multinationals, representing all major industries of Swiss business in Singapore.

The original St. Nicholas Hotel in St. Louis was located on 4th Street, but this building was destroyed by a fire in 1884. The fire was not a hotel fire as the building was only occupied by stores at the time. This January 4, 1884, fire is remembered as one of the most difficult for the St. Louis Fire Department as the temperature had fallen to 26 degrees below zero with ice reaching two-feet thick to the outside walls after water had been sprayed on the exterior. The second St. Nicholas Hotel in St. Louis was designed by the famous architect Louis Sullivan and was built in 1893. The eight-story hotel was opened a year later in 1894. Its exterior had distinctive terra-cotta snowflake embellishments. The building was in the Historic American Buildings Survey, but it was demolished in 1973. A supposed fire had led to the hotel's conversion to an office building when the gabled roof and arched entrance were removed and four floors were added with a restaurant added and Turkish bath installed in the basement.

Sexual assault of LGBT people is a form of violence that occurs within the LGBT community. While sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence can occur in all forms of relationships, it is found that sexual minorities experience it at rates that are equal to or higher than their heterosexual counterparts. There is a lack of research on this specific problem for the LGBT population as a whole, but there does exist a substantial amount of research on college LGBT students who have experienced sexual assault.  Definition  There are varying definitions as to what sexual assault is defined as. According to the United States Department of Justice: > \\"The term 'sexual assault' means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by > Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to > consent.\\" Definitions and laws of sexual assault vary from state to state. The website FindLaw allows users to click on their corresponding to state to read about how their state defines what sexual assault is, as well as what laws and limitations exist. Sexual assault of LGBT individuals refers to the act of sexual violence against persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender amongst other sexualities and sexual minorities.  Statistics  The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, also known as RAINN, puts out general statistics of sexual assault, including: * Every 98 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. * 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, nonconforming) college students have been sexually assaulted. According to a 2010 findings on The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it concluded that: * For Lesbian women:  44% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  Approximately 1 in 8 (13%) have been raped in their lifetime. * For Gay men:  26% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  4 in 10 (40%) have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime. * Bisexual Women:  61% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime.  1 in 5 (22%) have been raped by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  46% have been raped in their lifetime. * Bisexual Men:  37% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  47% have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime. In a paper by Emily Rothman, Deinera Exner, and Allyson Baughman, it was found that, in regard to lifetime sexual assault victimization, the estimated prevalence for lesbian and bisexual women was approximately 12.6 - 85%. For gay and bisexual men, it was 11.8-54.0%.  Underlying issues, myths, and misconceptions  The underlying issues of sexual assault against LGBT persons includes homophobia and transphobia among other forms of prejudice against sexual minorities. These forms of prejudice end up creating unsafe spaces for LGBT persons where they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves or do not feel safe living as their authentic self. According to the Pride Resource Center at Colorado State University, homophobia is defined as: > \\"Homophobia is a pervasive, irrational fear of homosexuality. Homophobia > includes the fear heterosexuals have of any homosexual feelings within > themselves, any overt mannerisms or actions that would suggest > homosexuality, and the resulting desire to suppress or stamp out > homosexuality. And it also includes the self-hatred and self-denial of > homosexuals who know what they are but have been taught all their lives by a > heterosexual society that people like themselves are sick, sinful and > criminal.” According to Planned Parenthood, transphobia is defined as: > \\"Transphobia is the fear, hatred, disbelief, or mistrust of people who are > transgender, thought to be transgender, or whose gender expression doesn’t > conform to traditional gender roles. Transphobia can prevent transgender and > gender nonconforming people from living full lives free from harm.\\" These phobias, as well as myths centered around LGBT individuals, influence a culture that holds back persons from identifying how they choose and places them into a binary that doesn't encompass all possible ways of identifying. One of the main myths that can harm LGBT individuals is the idea that they have not met the right guy/girl yet. This perpetuates heterosexism and denies the possibility of one having attraction to the same gender. One of the biggest misconceptions that comes out of transphobia centers around the use of bathrooms. Made popular by North Carolina's \\"Bathroom Bill\\", it brought up the concern that by allowing individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender they identify as, predators could easily enter bathrooms and take advantage of individuals claiming that they identify as the gender the bathroom is. Legislation, such as House Bill 2, only perpetuate the discrimination of transgender individuals, rather than give them support to live their lives as the gender by which they identify. Laws have always existed that prohibit individuals from entering bathrooms with the purpose of harming others.

It has a more or less round leaf and a single purplish and green flower. It is only known from two locations and is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.  Description  Corybas dentatus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a broad egg-shaped, heart-shaped or almost round leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. A single purplish and green flower long and wide is borne on a short flowering stem. The largest part of the flower is the dorsal sepal which is long and wide. It is pinkish grey with dark purple markings and forms a hood over the labellum. The lateral sepals are whitish, linear to lance-shaped, about long, and wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are lance-shaped, about long, wide and curved. The labellum is dark purple, tube-shaped near its base, about long, before curving and flattening into a broad egg-shaped flat long and wide with teeth on the edges. Flowering occurs in July and August.  Taxonomy  Corybas dentatus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Sandy Crrek Conservation Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (dentatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"toothed\\" or \\"pointed\\", referring to the prominent teeth on the edges of the labellum. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Corysanthes but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The Lofty Ranges helmet orchid grows in open forest and woodland with low shrubs and ferns. It is known from two populations, the larger of which is in the Sandy Creek Conservation Park. Conservation Corybas dentatus is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species are road and track maintenance, weed invasion, herbicide spraying and population fragmentation.

Currently, is hosted by Christina Rocha, who had replaced Regina Volpato in 2009, when the show's format has been reformulated.  Format  Casos de Família presents daily themes that will highlight the emotions of the participants on the stage, the invited audience and the viewers who are at home. In addition to the guests, the audience also actively participates in the show with opinions and questions about the stories told. The intention is to guide and even solve the cases presented with the participation of a psychologist. After 4 years in charge of the Family Cases, Regina Volpato stated that she would not renew the contract for personal reasons, and would take over the program until the end of her contract with the station, which won on February 28, 2009. It was speculated that the reason for the departure of Regina Volpato would be the implantation of the Venezuelan format \\"Who is Reason?\\" in the program, where people literally discuss the topics that have to be addressed, and in this one would have the famous \\"would lower\\", besides \\"shacks\\" and exploration of embarrassing situations  History  In 2004, SBT acquired the format from Venevisión, and hired journalist Regina Volpato (formerly Fundação Roberto Marinho and BandNews) to lead it.

The taxonomic position of Thursophyton has been uncertain; most authors have considered it too imperfectly known to place, or have assigned it to the Lycopodiophyta. Unpublished research suggests similarities with spiny genera of the Zosterophyllopsida.  Description  Thursophyton is a genus of terrestrial vascular plants which flourished in the Middle Devonian period. These plants consisted of aerial stems branching dichotomously, trichotomously or pseudomonopodially, at least the main axes clothed in spirally arranged spines up to 7 mm long, which are not leaves as they are not vascularised and leave no scar when removed. The stems contain an elliptical exarch xylem having both annular and spirally thickened tracheids; very little is known about the sporangia. Species The type species is Thursophyton milleri. Other species have been suggested (e.g. T. reidii, T. eberfeldense, T. hostimense, T. vahlbergianum) which are usually regarded as synonyms of T. milleri. Because of the poor preservation of much of this plant material from the Devonian period, it is likely that other synonyms exist e.g. Euthursophyton hamperbachense Mustafa from Germany.

Its only species, Theoxena scissaria, was first described by Achille Guenée in 1868. It is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been classified as nationally vulnerable by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  It was described by Guenée in 1868 from a specimen obtained in Canterbury by Richard William Fereday and named Panagra scissaria. In 1883 Edward Meyrick placed the species into the newly created genus Theoxena. In 1898 and in 1928 George Vernon Hudson also described and illustrated Theoxena scissaria. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Meyrick described the species as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. Its range is in North Canterbury, Mid Canterbury, South Canterbury, Mackenzie, Central Otago and Otago Lakes. Other than the type locality, specimens have been collected near the foot of Mount Hutt, the Winchmore Irrigation Research Station near Ashburton, at the lower slopes of Mount Ida in Otago, Horseshoe Slip on Mount Grey, and Ashley Gorge. It is now possibly extinct on the Canterbury Plains.  Life cycle and behaviour  The life history of T. scissaria is still uncertain. Adults have been collected in late winter at the foot of Mount Ida, though none were collected there after August. This species has also been recorded as being on the wing in June, December and January. It is most commonly seen between the months of May and July. A second generation emerges during the summer months. Although T. scissaria has been collected during the day, it is attracted to light.  Habitat  This species frequents plains. Host species The host species of T. scissaria is as yet unknown. However, this species has been associated with the tussock grass Poa cita. It has been hypothesised that the host species for T. scissaria larvae may be in the genus Carmichaelia.  Conservation status  This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being nationally vulnerable.

He won the competitions to design both the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou. Lü died the year that the memorial hall began construction in 1929; it was eventually completed in 1931. Background Lü spent part of his childhood in Paris. He earned a degree in architecture from Cornell University, in the United States, in 1918 and then worked for Murphy & Dana until 1921,Rowe and Kuan, p. 69. when he went into independent practice in Shanghai. Among projects he worked on with the firm are Ginling College in Nanjing and Yenching University in Beijing.  Career  Lü's firm, whose name translates as \\"C. Lü Architect\\", was the first Chinese-owned architectural firm. In 1924, with Fan Wenzhou, he co-founded the first Chinese architectural association. Considered one of the most gifted Chinese architects of his generation, Lü won two prestigious national design competitions, for the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in September 1925, and for the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall the following year. He died of cancer in 1929 and the Memorial Hall commission was completed by Li Jinpei.Rowe and Kuan, pp. 69, 72. In keeping with the competition guidelines but also with the historicising impulse exemplified by Murphy & Dana's collegiate buildings, Lü's designs for both major commissions adapt traditional Chinese design features to modern uses.Zhu, pp. 68–70. His writings describe this as a means of asserting Chinese nationhood against foreign imperialism.Zhu, p. 53. Liang Sicheng later criticised him for using only superficial aspects of Chinese architecture, which he wrote led to \\"a series of mistakes in proportions\\" in the hall in the mausoleum.Rowe and Kuan, pp. 84–85. Other early historians of 20th-century Chinese architecture have also represented him as merely a draftsman, due in part to Henry Murphy describing him as such after he won the contest to design the mausoleum.LU Yanzhi and Huang Tanpu the Mystery of Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (吕彦直与黄檀甫广州中山纪念堂秘闻), , 2007-10, HUACHENG PRESS (the member of GUANDONG PROVENCE PRESS GROUP), LU JIEFENG  Lü Yanzhi and Huang Tanpu  Graduated from Leeds University (HUANG,the first line left) Huang Tanpu (also known as T.P.WONG, March 27, 1898 - January 20, 1969, born in Taishan, Guangdong Province of China) has followed his uncle to England by the age of 13 and been adopted later by Miss Claic.B. Milchell, a teacher at Leeds Secondary School. After graduating from Leeds University, he met LU Yanzhi in Paris's Louvre museum at the beginning of 1921 during the trip back to China and since then they've become close friends and partners. In March 1922, they co-founded the \\" Gen Yue & Co \\"( pinyin: ZHENYU Company ), in which LU was engaged as architect and Huang undertook the business. LU Yanzhi(left) and HUANG Tanpu(right) In September 1925, Lu won the first price of Dr. Sun Yat- sen's Mausoleum Design Awards. The company then announced the establishment of \\"YanKee Architects\\". In March 1926, HUANG delivered the speech at the groundbreaking ceremony of Nanjing's Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on the behalf of LU Yanzhi. Since then he represented Lu for the communication with the media and the government, the organization and the public speeches etc. In November 1926, they signed another architecture's contract on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Memorial Hall. In 1927, LU felt serious illness (cancer), HUANG was asked by LU to be his total representative, to continue on the 2 great constructions in Nanjing and Guangzhou. From 1929 to 1932, Huang hired Shanghai famous Wang Kai Photography, to photograph the third period of the construction process of Nanjing Sun's Mausoleum and Guangzhou Memorial Hall to record the truth about the construction process of these two great national memorial buildings. July 1929,HUANG(right) and Architect P.G.LEE, in Nanjing Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum Huang in the construction site of Guangzhou Memorial Hall After Lu's death, the “YanKee Architects Office” under Gen Yue & Co was renamed as “YanPoy Kee Architects Office” ( another famous Architect POY G. LEE was invited to join the Architects Office) In December 1934, Huang married Huang Zhengqiu, the golden key winner of Yenching University (燕京大學; pinyin: Yanjing Daxue). Her grandfather is Wong Kai Kah (1860—1906)(pinyin: Huang Kaijia, one of the earliest official students sent to United States in Qing Dynasty) . In 1935, Huang bought the land and constructed a family residence in Shanghai Hongqiao Rd. to serve as a permanent secure collection place for those invaluable architect drawings and documents. In 1944-1945, during the anti-Janpanese war, Huang employed some workers to dig the air raid shelters in the garden to place the collections, for ensuring their safety. In May 1949, the PLA army of Chinese Communist Party occupied Shanghai. In 1950, one day Huang's family suddenly received the expropriation notice from Shanghai Municipal Military Association, asked for the requisition of the house in order to accommodate the officers of Soviet Air Forced Military, and the family must be moved out within 72 hours... At that time, Huang was in Hong Kong, and Mrs HUANG guided the family relations to move away all the architectural drawings, pictures, and Lu's books and materials etc... After the Hongqiao house was expropriated, some large wooden cases containing these historical treasures were relocated many times and finally been moved to a small apartment where the family settled down. In February 1951, HUANG was put into prison . His Hongqiao house was confiscated and his company also stopped business. At the end of 1953,released from prison. In 1956, he donated a great part of collections to the government. In 1959, one more time, he was sentenced to imprisonment. In order to survive, Mrs.HUANG began to sell parts of the collections, which were discovered later by an old librarian worked in the Shanghai Archives. Some of the collections were finally transferred later to Guangzhou. On 20 January 1969, Huang passed away. His grave was settled in the neighbor city Suzhou countryside in Jiangsu Province. After 2000, this history was gradually recognized. In 2012, some donation materials, contributed by Huang and his future generations, were exhibited in Nanjing Sun Yat-sen Memorial House.

Upon arrival to the Honduran coast, in order to lighten the load of his ships so that he can arrive to land, he ordered several horses to be thrown overboard into the ocean and by that action, the newly established port was called Puerto de Caballos (Port of Horses). Gil González Dávila went on to found the first Spanish settlement in Honduras called San Gil de Buena Vista.Estado, sociedad y lenguaje: la política lingüística en Honduras (in Spanish) Initial conquest of Honduras proved to be difficult as the native tribes in the territory overwhelmingly resisted the Spanish invasion. Impatient of the prolonged conquest of the territory, Spanish conquistador of the Aztecs in present-day Mexico, Hernán Cortés came to Honduras with an army to take control of the territory. It wasn't until 1539 that Spanish forces were able to take full control of the territory. The territory of Honduras soon officially became part of the Spanish Empire under the Viceroy of New Spain based in Mexico City and administered by the Captaincy General of Guatemala based in Santiago de Guatemala.History of Honduras =Independence= In 1808, Joseph Bonaparte was installed as King of Spain and several Spanish American colonies began to declare their independence from Spain. As Honduras and most Central American nations were governed by Mexico City; New Spain declared its independence from Spain in 1810. In 1821, the Plan of Iguala declared Mexico as a constitutional monarchy. Honduras declared its own independence from Spain in 15 September 1821 and chose to join the Mexican Empire under Emperor Agustín de Iturbide. In March 1823, Iturbide resigned as Emperor and Mexico became a republic. Honduras decided to separate from Mexico on 1 July 1823. Honduras, along with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua formed the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1839 the Central American Federation dissolved and Honduras became an independent nation.Britannica: History of Honduras =Post- Independence= On 17 November 1894, Honduras and Spain established diplomatic relations with the signing of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Bilateral relations between Spain and Honduras (in Spanish) After independence a small community of Catalans immigrated to Honduras.La Emigración Española a América Latina: El Ejemplo Catalán (in Spanish) In September 1977, King Juan Carlos I of Spain made his first and only official visit to Honduras.Visita de los Reyes a Centroamérica (in Spanish) In June 2009, Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was removed by military forces and forced into exile. As a result of the coup d'état, Spain expelled the Honduran ambassador in Madrid who supported the removal of President Zelaya from power.España expulsa al embajador de Honduras, destituido por Zelaya (in Spanish) Over the years, several thousands Hondurans have immigrated to Spain seeking better opportunities. The largest Honduran community in Spain (and in all of Europe) is located in the town of Girona, Catalonia province.Gerona: la ciudad española preferida de los hondureños (in Spanish) Bilateral relations Spanish Cultural Center in Tegucigalpa Both nations have signed several bilateral agreements such as an Agreement on Dual-Nationality (1966); Agreement on Economic Cooperation (1972); Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation (1981); Agreement on Air Transportation (1992); Agreement on the reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (1994); Agreement on Cultural, Educational and Scientific Cooperation (1994); Agreement on mutual Diplomatic Assistance (1995) and an Extradition Treaty (1999). Transportation There are direct flight between Madrid and San Pedro Sula with Air Europa. Trade In 2017, trade between Honduras and Spain totaled €158 million Euros. Honduras main exports to Spain include: fish, mussels, crustacean and coffee. Spain's main exports to Honduras include: raw materials, industrial products and material used for the mechanical and construction industry (mainly steel products) and the pharma- chemical industry. In 2016, Spanish investments in Honduras totaled €4.8 million Euros. Spanish multinational companies such as Mapfre and Zara operate in Honduras.

He was born to Luther and Lowell Shaw on October 27, 1936 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Shaw, a retired U.S. Army officer, holds a Ph.D. in journalism from the University of Wisconsin and an M.A. and B.A. in journalism from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Shaw worked for nearly three years as a daily newspaper reporter. As an Army officer, he is the graduate of five major military schools including the U.S. Army War College and the U.S. Naval War college. He also has been a visiting professor at seven universities and has lectured at more than 20 universities in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Shaw is best known for his work, with Maxwell McCombs of the University of Texas, on the agenda setting theory and for his studies of 19th and 20th century American and Southern press history. Shaw began work on the agenda-setting theory in 1966 and was joined by McCombs in 1967, when McCombs came to UNC as a junior professor. During the 1968 presidential election, Shaw and McCombs collected survey data from a random group of Chapel Hill residents. McCombs and Shaw demonstrated that audiences often judge the importance of a news item based on how frequently and prominently it is covered by the media, thus indicating the degree to which the media shapes public opinion. McCombs and Shaw's seminal article, The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media, is arguably the most-cited article in the field of mass communication research. In 1977, Shaw and McCombs published The Emergence of American Political Issues: The Agenda-Setting Function of the Press, which the Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly listed as one of the top 35 \\"significant journalism and communication books\\" of the 20th century. In 1999, Shaw and his colleagues published the first study of audience agendamelding, the process by which individuals mix messages to create personal images of community. Since then, Shaw and his colleagues have published several agendamelding articles. He is the author, or co-author, of 18 books as well as nearly 70 scholarly articles and approximately 50 scholarly book reviews. In 2012, Shaw was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism Hall of Fame.

These screwworms are referred to as \\"secondary\\" because they typically infest wounds after invasion by primary myiasis-causing flies. While blow flies may be found in every terrestrial habitat, C. macellaria is primarily found in the United States, American tropics, and sometimes southern Canada. They are most common in the southeastern United States in states like Florida. C. macellaria have a metallic greenish-blue thorax and a red-orange head and eyes. These adult blowflies range from 5–8 mm in size. Since the fly larvae infect the wounds and dead tissue of animals, these flies pose a grave medical and economic risk to humans and livestock. C. macellaria are attracted to carrion and garbage and are often found in slaughterhouses and outdoor markets in the tropics. While these flies carry many various types of Salmonella and viruses like the swine influenza, C. macellaria can also serve as important decomposers in our ecosystem. Description C. macellaria are classified as intermediate sized flies with a dull or bright metallic, blue-green coloration. On their thorax, there are three black longitudinal stripes that interrupt the blue-green color. The eye and head of these flies are orange-red in color. C. macellaria also has pale setae on the fronto-orbital plate outside of the frontal bristles. On C. macellaria the frontal row of bristles extend anteriorly to the base of the first antennal segment and consist of 12-14 bristles. The legs of the fly are orange brown to dark brown, and the coxae are orange brown to black with a green metallic luster. C. macellaria possess a dark reddish brown anterior femur and an orange-red anterior tibia. The anterior tibia also has four short bristles that are placed on the dorsal side. The color of the wings of the fly is orange brown tint towards the base. On these wings, the veins in the fly are orange brown to dark brown. The costal sessions 2 to 6 are in the proportions 78:56:96:30:6:6. The first genital section is black with a metallic green luster. On the fly, the scattered setae and a defined marginal row of bristles; the second segment is smaller with a dark brown to black tint with scattered setae. = Distinguishing features = C. macellaria is closely related to C. hominivorax but can be distinguished from C. hominivorax in three primarily ways: two of which are seen in adults and one which is seen in the larvae. In adults, the hairs on the fronto-orbital plate are black in C. hominivorax, but are pale in C. macellaria. Additionally, the central black stripe on the thorax extends only slightly in front of the mesonotal suture in C. hominivorax and well in front of the suture in C. macellaria. C. macellaria larvae, unlike like C. hominivorax larvae, do not have pigmented tracheal trunks but instead have V-shaped spines on the anal protuberance. C. macellaria also does not have an oral sclerite. Distribution and territory C. macellaria is most often found in the southeastern part of the United States, in states like Florida, Louisiana, and Georgia. Despite the high concentration in these states, these flies have been found as far north as Southern Canada and as south as the Neotropics, with the exclusion of countries like Chile and Argentina. While they have been found in this large expanse of areas, they have been shown to thrive most in warm and humid areas like the Southern United States, Caribbean Islands, Central America, and northern South America. In these areas, the population size typically increases during periods of extended rainfall. The territories of these blowflies are relatively small, especially during the time of mating. In this period, these flies will stay within a couple meters of one another. Life cycle and history Secondary screwworm.The average life span of an adult C. macellaria is 2–6 weeks. In this time period, the females try to increase the chances of producing as many surviving offspring as possible. In a lifetime, C. macellaria may lay up to 1000 or more eggs. These eggs are typically laid in groups of 40 to 250. Females may also lay their eggs with other females, leading to an accumulation of thousands of eggs. = Eggs = The eggs of C. macellaria are laid in large groups (40–250 eggs at one time) and typically hatch in about 24 hours. The time taken for eggs to hatch often depends on moisture, temperature, and precipitation. In favorable conditions, the eggs may hatch in just four hours. These eggs are about 1 mm long and appear white to pearl white in color. = Larvae = The larval stage of C. macellaria is referred to by the common name of secondary screwworms; this is due to the presence of small spines on each body segment that resemble parts of a screw. The larval stage of C. macellaria immediately follows the egg stage and is typically broken down into three substages or instars. Upon hatching, the larve appear a cream color, have cylindrical bodies with 10 or more spines around the spiracular area, possess incomplete peritremes (an indistinct or absent button), and have bands of small spines on each segment. C. macellaria, unlike like C. hominivorax, do not have pigmented tracheal trunks; instead, they have V-shaped spines on the anal protuberance. C. macellaria also does not have an oral sclerite. C. macellaria larvae will feed on the decaying flesh of the animal that they have been laid on until they reach maturity. This stage of maturity is during the third instar and by this time point, the larvae may be as long as 17 mm. The entire larval stage is about four to seven days long, and afterwards, the larvae fall off the food source to pupate in the top layer of the soil. = Pupae = The C. macellaria larvae will typically burrow underneath the top layer of soil, leaves, garbage and begin to pupate there. During this stage, the outer layer begins to turn brown from the cream white that it used to be. The outer skin will begin to shrink and harden while the pupa develops entirely in the hardened shell. Based on the temperature, the length of this stage will vary greatly. In warmer temperatures, the stage may last as short as seven days, but in colder temperatures, it may last as long as two months. = Adults = Adult C. macellaria are considered to be medium-sized flies because they are about 6 to 9 mm in size and appear bright metallic blue-green to blueish purple in color. These adults typically spend one to two days maturing after leaving the pupae stage. Within four days of emerging from the pupa stage, the adult C. macellaria become sexually mature and start looking for mates. The males will typically mate rapidly and will spend most of their time eating nearby vegetation and nectar from flowers. The females, on the other hand, will feed on the fluids of live wounds from animals. Contrary to the males, the females will travel long distances to find mates. Food resources C. macellaria male adult on a flower. Depending on the gender and stage in their development, C. macellaria will utilize different resources for energy and nutrients. During the larval stage, the C. macellaria will dig deeper into the necrotic wounds of their host animal and feed on the dead tissue. Both males and females will feast through this method. This time period is extremely crucial to the flies, as they must gather enough nutrients in order to last through the pupal stage without any food sources. This is one reason why the larvae are much larger than the size of the adult C. macellaria. As adults, the food specifications of the flies change. Female flies will continue to feed on tissues of animals; however, now they preferentially feed off of live tissue and tissue plasma. Males, at this point, will no longer consume tissue, but instead will eat nearby vegetation and intake nutrients from the nectar of flowers. Mating Although there are few studies on the mating patterns of C. macellaria, there is some information on the interactions between the males and females. Adult female C. macellaria have been observed to will release pheromones that will stimulate the males copulatory attempts on contact. Even though depriving the C. macellaria adults of dietary proteins did not impact the potency of the female extracts, there was a reduced response in males for the pheromones. Parental care Male C. macellaria do not provide parental care. The males will typically mate quickly and have the females bear the young. Since the females lay so many eggs, there is little care provided by the actual mothers after laying the eggs. The females do strategically lay the eggs in dead skin flesh so that once the eggs hatch into larvae, nutrition will be readily available. Social behavior Traditional social behavior like lekking has not been observed in C. macellaria; however, other social behaviors have been observed. =Egg laying= It is common for female C. macellaria to lay eggs with other females. Since females may lay up to 250 eggs, it is common for aggregations of thousands of eggs to infest entire animal carcasses.  Pheromone selectivity  While C. hominivorax is closely related to C. macellaria, there are evolutionary developed methods that lead to reproductive isolation. One of these mechanisms is the interspecies response to the C. macellaria female pheromone. Studies on newly colonized C. hoinivorax males have demonstrated that the males do not response to the C. macellaria pheromone. Enemies = Larval predation = When studying the larval dispersal and predation for C. macellaria, studies have shown that there is interspecies competition and predation. It has been demonstrated that C. albiceps larvae attack C. macellaria larvae during their dispersal process. Additionally, C. macellaria showed higher aggregation level in single than in double species. This may be explained by an evolutionary mechanism used to conserve and protect C. macellaria from predation. = Human predation = Due to the medical and economic impact of the C. macellaria and other blowflies, an array of pesticides have been developed to reduce the C. macellaria population, including pyrethrin aerosol. Mimicry and protective coloration C. macellaria sitting on a flower. While there are theories for protective coloration, there is no clear mimicry done by C. macellaria or by other insects specifically mimicking C. macellaria. The metallic green coloration may be a form of warding off predators, but this still in the process of being analyzed. Impact = Medical = C. macellaria has extensive medical and economic implications. When C. macellaria larvae infest the dead and decaying tissues of animals or humans, myiasis may often occur. Once infestation occurs, a dark brown discharge will start to leaking from the wound. As the infestation increases, there is more agitation and inflamed tissue, which is accompanied by unpleasant smells. After the process of clinical diagnosis begins and the myiasis is recognized, then the larvae are easier to identify. Treatment of these infestations can be time intensive and leads to increased chances of reoccurrences. The first step is manual removal of the larvae followed by an antibiotic smear. = Economic = The livestock industry considers the secondary screwworm an important pest because of the enormous economic losses caused by cases of myiasis and disease transmission. The medical and pesticide treatment costs the United States millions of dollars annually. Forensic importance C. macellaria is the most common species of blow flies found on carrion in the southern United States. C. macellaria has recently gained recognition in forensic entomology because of its occurrence on decomposing remains. Since the analysis of the succession and occurrence has been well defined, it is possible to create postmortem interval estimations, which are crucial for forensic entomology. Adult C. macellaria in the southeastern United States are only attracted to the dead tissue on animals minutes after the death. In other regions of the United States, the adult flies are attracted to the dead flesh after a 24-hour delay.

Currently, he is the curator at the 98 CKGM Montreal Super 70s Tribute Pages and of the 1470 CFOX Montreal Radio Archive. Career Marc Denis started his career as a radio host with college friends by founding the college radio station, CBRV, at Collège Bourget in Rigaud, Québec. His first commercial radio job was at CJRC Ottawa in 1970 where he was a Parliament Hill news reporter and later, on CKCH Hull, where he hosted radio programs while completing his graduation at the University of Ottawa. His first broadcast on CKGM Montreal was in early 1974 where he initiated a bilingual English-French switch-hitting show in Top 40 format. A year later, bilingual colleagues Rob Christie and Scott Carpentier joined the station lineup and, together and back-to-back with Marc Denis, branded themselves as La Connection Française. The trio broke up in 1977 with the departures of Christie and Carpentier. Denis continued to host the evening show bilingually on CKGM until 1980. From 1980 to 2010, Marc Denis hosted programs on several other radio stations in Montreal, English (CJFM) or French (CKOI), and was also the producer-host of the bilingual in-flight audio pop music and interview program, Coffee, Tea or…Pop ! / Aéropop !, on Air Canada from 1989 to 1997. He also hosted on-air in Toronto from 1997 to 2000, in English on CJEZ 97.3 and, in French, on CJBC 860 in 2001, before returning to resume his broadcast career in Montreal in 2002 with 105.7 Rythme-FM. Marc Denis joined Q92 on September 10, 2005 to host \\"Winning Weekends\\" and later, hosting the \\"New Saturday Night Oldies\\" as of July 21, 2007 on the station. On June 6, 2008, Q92's sister station CINW dropped its Talk programming for a \\"Greatest Hits of the 60s-70s80s\\" music format, with Marc Denis as the morning host, launching on July 1. Marc Denis has also appeared on television as a host including, on Télé-Métropole CFTM 10 Montréal (TVA) and Télé-Québec in French, and, on CFCF12 (CTV Montreal) and CBC 6 Montreal in English during the 1980s.

different parts of its range, is a species of leaf-footed bug in the family Coreidae. It is found in Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, North America, South America, Southern Asia, the Pacific Ocean and Oceania. Description This leaf-footed plant bug is elongated and about long and wide. The long antennae are banded in black and orange, and there is a pale orangish transverse band at the front of the broad plate covering the prothorax. The remaining surface is dark brown or a dull purplish-black, with small orange spots on the underside of the thorax and abdomen, and a pair of orange spots on the two rear, enlarged, flattened tibiae. Distribution and host range Leptoglossus gonagra is found in much of sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia, the Pacific area, northern Australia, North, Central and South America and the Caribbean area. Its host range includes mung beans, navy beans, cowpeas, legumes, passion fruit, cacao, coffee, avocado, macadamia, mango, cashew, citrus, pomegranate and cucurbits. Life cycle The female attaches chains of about 16 eggs in lines to twigs or stems of the host plant. These hatch after about a week and the nymphs moult five times as they grow. They are similar in appearance to the adults but are reddish when young with dark spines on head and thorax. They cluster together at first but later disperse more widely around the plant. Both adults and nymphs suck sap from the cells of the host plant, injecting toxic saliva, and this may cause the shoot to shrivel. Nymphal development takes about seven weeks and the whole life cycle takes nine or ten weeks. Females may lay a total of around sixty eggs and live for several weeks.

Background New Zealand Cricket established the Shell Conference in 1997 in response to two problems. First, the Shell Trophy (also known as the Plunket Shield), the first-class competition contested by the six major association teams, was becoming expensive to run in its double round robin format. Second, it was felt that the standard of New Zealand cricket would be improved by holding a competition in which the six teams combined to make three teams, and adding a team from overseas to make a four-team single round robin format. The three domestic teams were: * Northern Conference, which selected its players from Northern Districts and Auckland * Central Conference, which selected its players from Central Districts and Wellington * Southern Conference, which selected its players from Canterbury and Otago The overseas teams were Bangladesh in 1997-98 and Pakistan A in 1998-99. The format was abandoned after the 1998-99 season. In 2000-01 the Plunket Shield resumed its place as New Zealand’s only first-class competition, returning to its double round robin format. Playing record Central Conference played seven first-class matches, winning two, drawing two and losing three. They played four List A matches, winning the first three and losing the last. 1997-98: Captained by Mark Greatbatch, Central Conference finished third in the first-class competition in 1997-98 with a win (against Bangladesh) a draw and a loss.Wisden 1999, pp. 1316–17. Mathew Sinclair made the most runs, 203 at an average of 50.75, and made the team’s highest score, 95. Their most successful bowler was Campbell Furlong, with 12 wickets at an average of 18.91, and the best figures were 5 for 42 by Mark Jefferson. 1998-99: Captained by Craig McMillan in 1998-99, Central Conference again had a win, a draw and a loss, which this time was sufficient to take them into the final, where they lost by 46 runs to Southern Conference.Wisden 2000, pp. 1342–43. Sinclair was again their highest scorer, with 285 runs at 40.71, and Craig Spearman made their highest score of 137. McMillan took the most wickets in the competition, 14 at 16.78, and also had the best figures, 6 for 71.
