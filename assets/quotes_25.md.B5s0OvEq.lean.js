She is known mostly for her paintings, though she also made prints and created assemblages of collected objects. She was awarded the Jerwood Prize for painting, and received a retrospective exhibition at Tate Britain. Background Born on 14 November 1919 in Chelsea, London to an affluent upper-middle-class family, she was initially educated privately by her father, the poet Eric Taylor,Who's Who, 1971, p. 611, before enrolling as a part-time student at the Chelsea School of Art (now Chelsea College of Art and Design) in 1937. In 1938, she took classes at Chelsea with the sculptor Henry Moore. Her aunt was Irish designer Eileen Gray.Adams, Peter. Eileen Gray: A Biography. London: Thames and Hudson, 1987, p. 9. Clough lived in London throughout her career. Career Apart from wartime service,Debrett's People of Today, 1992, p. 390, during which she worked as a cartographer for the Office of War Information, Clough painted full-time until her death in 1999, supplementing her income with teaching posts at Chelsea (1956‚Äì69) and Wimbledon School of Art (1966-97).Prunella Clough, Tufnell, B. (Ed) (2007, London, Tate Publishing), p.11 The Clough-Taylor family often holidayed in Southwold, and in 1945 Clough's mother Thora Clough purchased Woldside house in Southwold, which became an important base for the artist until it was sold after Thora's death in 1966. Clough retained strong links with the area throughout her career; the coastal landscape, a local quarry, and fishermen at nearby Lowestoft and Yarmouth harbours provided significant early subjects. Clough also produced a number of still lifes. Clough had her first solo show at the Leger Gallery in London in 1947. In 1951, Clough participated in the exhibition 60 Paintings for '51, organised by the Arts Council to coincide with the 1951 Festival of Britain, for which they commissioned 60 artists to produce paintings of 4 by 5 feet or more. Clough's submission was entitled Lowestoft Harbour (1951), a painting of two fishermen weighing a catch of fish. The painting was subsequently purchased by the Arts Council Collection. Clough's early subject matter led to her being linked with Neo-Romantic artists such as John Minton and Michael Ayrton. From the 1950s onwards, she increasingly painted the industrial landscapes of post-WWII Britain. Although based in London, she made frequent trips to East Anglia and the Midlands. During the 1950s, Clough became close friends with the painter and critic John Berger; they went drawing together in the marshalling yards at Willesden Junction. Clough also visited a number of factories and industrial sites with the sculptor Ghisha Koenig, and became close friends with the painter David Carr, who also shared her interest in the industrial landscape as a subject. These trips resulted in a number of paintings of men and women at work in factories and on building sites, together with images of power stations, electrical plants and chemical works. The novelist Margaret Drabble has noted that while many of her early paintings included the human figure, it gradually disappeared from her works, and Clough's canvases became more abstract during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1960, Clough had her first retrospective at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, under the directorship of the curator Bryan Robertson. During a 1982 interview with Robertson, which was published in the catalogue for an exhibition of Clough's work held that year at the Warwick Arts Trust, the artist described how: \\"I prefer to look at the urban or industrial scene or any unconsidered piece of ground.\\" In the latter decades of her career, Clough made a number of abstract works that reference fragments of urban detritus and rubbish that she found on the streets of London, such as plastic bags, discarded gloves, and oil stains. The first time she exhibited these paintings was in 1989 in a show entitled Prunella Clough: Recent Paintings, 1980-1989 at Annely Juda Fine Art Gallery in London. The exhibition was a ‚Äúcritical and financial success‚Äù and helped Clough gain recognition and popularity. The early 1980s saw Clough embark on a series of paintings that focussed on an abstracted 'gate' motif, and she also became fascinated by the shadows cast by passing people on subway walls, creating a number of works on this theme. In 1979, Clough played a key role in helping to organise the major retrospective of Eileen Gray's work at the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Although Clough worked predominantly as a painter, she was also an accomplished printmaker. Clough created lithographs early in her career, and from the early 1960s often worked at the Curwen Studio in Plaistow. Throughout her career, Clough also made a number of assemblages from found objects that she gathered on her trips to industrial sites, the extent of which only became clear when these were discovered in her studio after her death. Clough's work enjoyed increasing recognition from the 1970s onwards, with exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery in 1976, followed by shows at the Warwick Arts Trust, the Camden Arts Centre and Kettle's Yard. From 1988 Clough was represented by Annely Juda Fine Art. In 1999, the year of her death, she was awarded the Jerwood Prize for Painting, and in 2007 she received a retrospective exhibition at Tate Britain. Prunella Clough is recognized as an accomplished artist, yet did not become as famous as some of her peers. A contributing factor to this was her love of privacy. She also was very generous in regards to money and her art. She would let people reproduce her work, but did not want money for it. When she sold or gave away a painting, she did not try to exercise authority or ownership over it anymore.  Artistic Style  Prunella Clough's paintings often share a mild or neutral color palette, sometimes with punctuating strong or harsh colors. Clough cites the weather in England as the probable cause for this trend. Clough often made changes to her paintings after she had begun working on them. In doing this she left traces of the old lines and shapes, creating a many-layered surface. Her actual painting techniques furthered this by adding more texture. ‚ÄúClough employed thick impasto, she daubed, she scraped, she gauged and scratched, she obliterated, experimenting with a variety of mixed media‚Äù. Gerard Hastings has described how Clough used a variety of tools and materials to apply paint to her canvas and create a variety of visual effects, including sandpaper, wire wool, rollers, wallpaper scrapers, and pieces of wire mesh. She would sometimes mix textured materials like sand into her paint. Clough's paintings gave unique views of everyday features of the urban landscape. Prunella Clough sometimes took photographs of her subject matter, but more important to her was the memory of the experience of seeing something. \\"Her subjects are closely observed details and scenes from the landscape. The images are combined and filtered through memory, and evolve through a slow process of layering and re-working.\\"Sunday Telegraph, Issue #2396, 13 May 2007, Arts Section, Graham-Dixon, A., Heart of Industry In an interview with Bryan Robertson she said, ‚ÄúI work from the subject matter, things perceived, and the things that I see tend to be somewhat murky‚Äù.

Life and work  He was born in Kongana, B. Shettigeri, a village in Coorg, Karnataka state, South India. From an early age he practised regular meditation. After finishing his studies, he renounced the world in 1929 and joined the Ramakrishna Mission. After a few years he left for the Himalayas and practised intense meditation. In 1933 he attained the supreme state called nirvikalpa samadhi (superconscious state or nirvana). After that he remained in seclusion for many years, studying the mind- functions and writing books. Especially after the partition of India in 1947, and seeing the atrocities there, his \\"heart melted, as it were\\", and he wrote some more books. The books were published slowly, and spread also to the Western countries. He began to accept disciples. In Denmark in particular, he had many disciples. In 1971 he went for the first time to Denmark, and continued to visit this country every year for 5‚Äì7 months until 1987. An ashrama (monastery) was established in Gylling, Denmark (Jutland, near Aarhus) which is the main centre today. Ashramas were also established in India, Sweden, Germany, Norway and the USA. The books were printed and published first in Rishikesh, India, and later printed and published at Narayana Press, Gylling, Denmark. Swami Narayanananda's works (or part of them) have been translated into many languages, particularly Danish and German. Some of them were translated into Tamil through his disciples Swami Nityananda and the late Swami Sadananda. Swami Narayanananda died in Mysore, India, at the age of 85.  Teachings  Swami Narayanananda called his teachings \\"The Universal Religion,\\" implying that they are dealing with Truth, irrespective of caste, creed, sex, nationality, race, etc. He gives guidance to spiritual seekers. He emphasizes the moral code of conduct as a basis for spiritual development, and puts particular stress on sexual sublimation implying brahmacharya ‚Äì celibacy or (for married people and couples) moderation in sexual life, as a means to maintain and improve physical, mental and spiritual health. His works include among others the following subjects: philosophy, psychology, religion, spirituality, yoga, meditation and kundalini shakti (the primal power in man).

Medical career in Franconia and in the Palatinate Joseph Heine was born in W√ºrzburg on 28 November 1803. He was the son of Johann Georg Heine, who was an orthopedist and manufacturer of orthopedic instruments for the W√ºrzburg university. Joseph attended the W√ºrzburg Gymnasium until 1824 and studied medicine in W√ºrzburg and Munich. In 1827 he passed his state examination in Bamberg and did his doctorate as an MD in W√ºrzburg. Heine widened his medical knowledge by a number of journeys abroad. In the winter of 1828/29 he studied dermatology and surgery in Paris. His tutor in the latter discipline was Guillaume Dupuytren. The departure of his father Johann Georg Heine to the Netherlands in 1828 forced the son to return to W√ºrzburg, where‚Äîtogether with his cousin Bernhard‚Äîhe took over the management of the Karolinen-Institut for one year. In 1830 a \\"desire for further education\\" compelled him to travel to Vienna and Warsaw, where in 1831 he treated persons wounded in the anti- Russian rebellion as well as persons suffering from cholera. As he came down with typhoid fever himself he had to return to Bavaria and worked as a physician in Homburg on the Main and in W√ºrzburg, before he applied for the post of district doctor in Waldmohr in the Palatinate. When he was appointed in 1836 he gained the rank of a royal civil servant in the Kingdom of Bavaria, which he held for lifetime. In 1840 he applied for the higher post of a \\"first-class district doctor\\" in Germersheim, which he held until 1851. \\"Political\\" Interlude (1848‚Äì1851) In 1848 Heine stood for a seat in the Frankfurt National Assembly, but lost by a very narrow margin. Although he characterized himself as \\"unpolitical\\" his political leaning could be described as \\"pan-German and anti-revolutionary\\". His second effort to gain a political mandate was successful: He was elected a member of the second chamber of the Bavarian Landtag. Yet in 1851 he gave up the seat, returned to Franconia and became a forensic pathologist and hospital manager in the city of Bamberg. Government official in the Palatinate (1856‚Äì1875) Heine's next upward step in his career was the appointment as \\"Kreis- und Medizinalrat der Pfalz\\", a position which put him in charge of overseeing the health system of this administrative region. His office was in Speyer from where he did an excellent job supervising physicians, hospitals and pharmacies all over the region until his retirement in 1875. Although he did not have a surgery of his own, he treated friends and relatives, and also poor people in his neighbourhood. He had good contacts to German physicians, e. g. Rudolf Virchow in W√ºrzburg, which may have been the reason for the facht that the 36th congress of German physicians and scientists in the summer of 1861 was held in Speyer. Joseph Heine and his father When Johann Georg Heine left W√ºrzburg and his family in 1829 to settle in the Netherlands it must have been shocking for his son Joseph. When Johann Georg wanted him to take over a hospital in Brussels he rejected the offer and rather completed his medical education in other European cities. He was greatly concerned when he learned about his father's efforts in branches of medicine he was not qualified for. There was only one meeting of father and son in 1838, shortly before the father's death. Johann Georg was already very sick and Joseph wanted to help him. However, he had to realize that his father stubbornly insisted on curing himself with dubious methods. In a publication four years later, Joseph Heine harshly criticized his father for leaving his family and for trying unscholarly methods of medical treatment, but also praised his merits as an outstanding orthopedist.Heine, Joseph: Physio-pathologische Studien aus dem √§rztlichen Leben von Vater und Sohn, Stuttgart/T√ºbingen 1842 Joseph Heine and Anselm Feuerbach Besides numerous friendships with prominent contemporaries, such as the Bavarian minister Theodor von Zwehl (1800‚Äì1875), publisher Johann Friedrich Cotta and philosopher and historian Peter Ernst von Lasaulx Heine had a particularly close connection with the Feuerbach family. Heine had known and admired Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, the mathematician, since his student years. After Karl's death Heine was good friends with the elder brother Joseph Anselm Feuerbach, who taught archeology in Freiburg. Joseph Heine soon recognized the artistic talent of his friend's son Anselm Feuerbach and tried to encourage and support him. His and von Zwehl's attempt to send the young painter to Wilhelm von Kaulbach in Munich was a failure: in 1850 Feuerbach went to Antwerp instead. On his way through, Anselm visited Heine in Germersheim, to \\"get money for the journey out of him\\", but, in a letter to his mother, had to admit later: \\"Heine was sullen, and I had to say farewell, politely, at once, I am very sick and tired of him.\\"Kern, G.J. und Uhde- Bernays, Hermann (eds.): Anselm Feuerbachs Briefe an seine Mutter, 1. Band Berlin 1911 This meant the end of the relationship‚Äîat least according to available sources. Anselm Feuerbach went to Paris and Rome to become a famous painter. Joseph Heine lost sight of him. On his retirement in 1875, Joseph Heine received a personal peerage of the Bavarian Kingdom, which made him Joseph von Heine. He lived for two more years in Munich and died there on 4 November 1877.Regrettably, a portrait of Joseph Heine has not been found yet.

With a population of around 1.2 million, Buenos Aires was then the largest urban complex in Latin America, the eighth city in the world, and one of the richest. As the capital city and main port of the young Argentine Republic at the height of its economic expansion, the city was growing rapidly with the successive waves of European immigration. Summary A total of 20 pavilions were built specially for the exhibition.El √∫nico pabell√≥n que qued√≥ del festejo del Centenario, olvidado y en mal estado, Clar√≠n, 28 Jan 2010 A number of young Italian architects, including Virginio Colombo, Francisco Gianotti and Mario Palanti who designed the Italian pavilion, went on to establish successful careers in Buenos Aires working in a number of styles, including Art Nouveau. Their buildings were some of the most important of the 20th century in Buenos Aires and those that remain continue to play a significant role in defining the city's architectural landscape. Each pavilion feature a different theme, such as: * Agriculture and Cattle Raising ‚Äì Organised by the Sociedad Rural Argentina, this was housed in a pavilion within the organisation's house in Palermo. It and contained an exhibition of agricultural activities and products from various parts of the country. * Industry ‚Äì This was located on what today is Del Libertador Avenue near El Rosedal, and featured industrial machinery much of which had never been seen before in Argentina. The only major pavilion still standing from any of the expositions is the Postal Service Pavilion from the Industrial Exhibition. * Railways and Overland Transport ‚Äì An exhibition of the latest automobiles from Europe, yachts, aeroplanes, railway locomotives, carriages and wagons. The pavilion, designed by Italian architect Virginio Colombo, was located near the Hip√≥dromo de Palermo. It was the most attended exhibition. * Hygiene - this was located on the Unzu√© Residence gardens, now occupied by the Argentine National Library. * Fine Arts - this was located in the \\"Argentine Pavilion\\", a steel structure covered in ceramics and multi-coloured glass designed by French architect Albert Ballu for the 1889 Exposition Universelle of Paris, where it stood next to the newly built Eiffel Tower. By 1910 the pavilion had been relocated in Plaza San Mart√≠n, opposite the Plaza Hotel. The pavilion would be dismantled in 1933.Exposiciones hist√≥ricas en la Argentina III.

It has smooth bark, egg-shaped, heart- shaped or round, sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and cup-shaped to cylindrical fruit. Description Eucalyptus pulverulenta is a straggly tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of or a tree to , and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, greenish to grey or brown bark, sometimes hanging in short ribbons. The crown of the tree has almost exclusively juvenile leaves that are egg- shaped to round or heart-shaped, glaucous, sessile, long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are glaucous, oval to diamond-shaped, long, wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from May to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to cylindrical capsule long, wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy Eucalyptus pulverulenta was first formally described in 1819 by John Sims in the Botanical Magazine. The specific epithet (pulverulenta) is from the Latin word pulveratus meaning \\"powdered\\", referring to the white covering on the leaves, buds and fruit. Distribution and habitat Silver-leaved mountain gum is only known from a few scattered populations on the Central and Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, between Bathurst and Bombala. It grows in grassy woodland on hillsides and mountains. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It was only known from about 5,400 plant in ten populations in 1990. The main threats to the species are habitat damage due to grazing, clearing of vegetation for fire trail, and its small population size.

The line, which opened on Saturday, 1 June 1901 with no formal ceremony, ran between and . It was the first railway authorised by the Light Railway Commission to be built under the Light Railways Act 1896. In January 1917 much of the track was removed. But the line was relaid and re-opened in August 1924 largely because of pressure from local landowners, farmers and agricultural workers. Passenger services ended in 1932 but a goods service from Basingstoke as far as Bentworth and Lasham continued until 1936. Most of the line was then lifted for a second time. However, two short stretches of track at either end of the railway were left in place. These were used for shunting goods traffic until 1967. The northern section was from Basingstoke to the Thornycroft factory, and from Butts Junction to Alton Park at the southern end. Construction The line was authorised under the Light Railways Act in December 1897. Construction began in July 1898. As the first light railway in the country the construction attracted some interest in the railway industry and the first cut in the ground was ceremonially made by Charles Ritchie, the then President of the Board of Trade at a spot next to the Thornycroft works near Basingstoke. Route The railway operated from Basingstoke railway station, through Cliddesden, Herriard and Bentworth and Lasham to Butts Junction (just west of Alton). In 1909 a private platform was opened called Alton Park, also Treloar's Hospital Platform railway station, which served the Lord Mayor Treloar's hospital. Operation Excluding the approach to Butts Junction, the line was entirely single track. Only Herriard station was provided with two platforms. As a light railway, the line had an overall speed limit of 25 miles per hour, and the journey from Basingstoke to Butts Junction took typically 45 minutes. When it opened, there were three return trips to Alton daily, which rose to six by the summer of 1909, with an extra couple of goods trains. Filming The railway was used for the filming of the 1929 film The Wrecker and the 1937 film Oh, Mr Porter! which features Cliddesden station as the fictional Buggleskelly. BBC - Hampshire - Alton line's silent movie stunt, 26 November 2009 Unused footage from The Wrecker was used in the 1936 film The Seven Sinners. Commemoration A short length of railway track was installed in the centre of the Viables roundabout in Basingstoke in 1976 to commemorate the line at a point close to its original route. There is also a plaque at the main station in Basingstoke. The only part of the railway which survives today is a 100m stub of track 1 mile west of the railway station in Basingstoke.

History In 1660, the daimy≈ç (feudal lord) of the Sendai Domain, and clan head, Date Tsunamune was arrested in Edo, for drunkenness and debauchery. The charges are generally believed to have been true, but the arrest was probably encouraged heavily by certain vassals and kinsmen in the north. These vassals and kinsmen appealed to the Council of Elders in Edo that Tsunamune was not fit to rule, and that his son Date Tsunamura, great-grandson of Masamune, should become the daimy≈ç. Thus, Tsunamura became daimy≈ç, under the guardianship of his uncles, Date Munekatsu and Muneyoshi. Ten years of violence and conflict followed in the domain, reaching a climax in 1671 when Aki Muneshige, a powerful relative of the Date, complained to the shogunate of the mismanagement of the fief under Tsunamura and his uncles. The Metsuke (Inspector) for the region attempted to deal with the situation, and to act as a mediator, but was unsuccessful against Aki's determination. The Metsuke reported back to Edo, and Aki was soon summoned there to argue his case before various councils and officials, including the Tair≈ç Sakai Tadakiyo and members of the R≈çj≈´ council. Following his arrival on the 13th day of the second lunar month, he met with and was interrogated and examined, as were several other retainers of the Date on both sides of the dispute. One retainer in particular, a supporter of Tsunamura and his uncles, by the name of Harada Kai Munesuke made a particularly poor impression in his meetings, and is said to have left the interrogation in a sour mood. Towards the end of the month, all the Date retainers involved were summoned to the Tair≈ç's mansion for a further round of questioning. It is said that over the course of the day, Harada grew increasingly distressed as he realized the extent to which his answers clashed with those of Aki Muneshige. According to one version of events, Harada, following a series of questions, was waiting in another room when Aki came in and began to shout insults at him. Swords were then drawn, and Aki was killed. Harada was killed moments after, by the officials or their guards. A trial was soon held, the murder being made a more severe crime for having been committed in the home of a high government official. The official verdict was that Harada drew first, and the punishment was severe. The Harada family was destroyed, Harada's sons and grandsons executed, and though Tsunamura was affirmed as the proper daimy≈ç, his uncles were punished. Aki was judged to be a paragon of loyalty, and no action was taken against his family. This story inspired a number of cultural productions, most notably the j≈çruri (puppet theater) play, later adopted into kabuki, Meiboku Sendai Hagi, by Chikamatsu. In this production, as in many other retellings of the tale, Harada is undoubtedly the villain, Aki the hero. Historians, however, are skeptical about the accuracy of this black-and-white approach, and claim that there were likely other elements to the narrative which are not clear from the formal records. One side or the other in the dispute may have bribed government officials in order to affect the government's handling of the situation, and it is known that Sakai Tadakiyo was a friend of Tsunamune, thus perhaps altering the shogunate's behavior in this matter further.

It is from Melbourne, and 65 m (212 ft) above sea level. The station lies next to Lake Lorne and was first opened on 21 May 1879. It operated until 6 November 1976 when it was closed. Subsequently, usage of the line was granted to the Bellarine Peninsula Railway which commenced tourist operations from Queenscliff in May 1979 to Laker's Siding, extending to Drysdale soon afterwards. History View from across Lake Lorne Goods Wagons at Drysdale in 2007 =Early years= The station opened on 21 May 1879 at a cost of ‚Ç§514. Facilities provided included a 60 m (200 ft) passenger platform, a 45 m (150 ft) loading platform, a 'barrel roof' goods shed, a van goods shed, a 2-ton hand crane, an 18-ton cart weighbridge, a telegraph office and tea stall. The station hosted passenger services as well as goods until 1931 when the regular passenger service ceased. Only summer Sunday excursion trains were available for passengers after this date, although riding in the guards van of goods trains was permitted. =Second World War= The Second World War saw a huge increase in traffic on the line with troop specials (returning troops for R&R;), and ordnance trains carrying mines manufactured at RAN Swan Island (Queenscliff). Typical inwards goods at Drysdale were coal and briquettes, farm equipment and beer, while outwards goods were bricks, flax and market produce. =Postwar decline= After the war weekly goods services and summer excursion trains continued through Drysdale, though rail services declined until the line closed briefly in 1959, reopening late the same year largely to benefit one customer - a shell grit (glass making) mining company at Laker's Siding near Queenscliff. Station facilities were gradually removed; the Station Master was withdrawn in 1953, and the nadir was reached in 1972 with the sale and removal of the station building. Upon closure of the line in 1976, the only facilities remaining were the van goods shed and about 12 m (40 ft) of platform. =Revival= Since reopening by the Bellarine Peninsula Railway in 1979, all objects and structures on the site have been constructed, or reconstructed, by volunteers. As of late 2009, the traffic pattern is of two services, three days each week, year-round, with additional charter and summer trips. The line carries more traffic than it has done previously. Drysdale Station has won several awards for the Bellarine Railway in the areas of heritage preservation, presentation and the recycling of materials. Drysdale Station also sees heavy use by patrons of the Bellarine Rail Trail of which Drysdale is the mid (and highest) point.

Victorian majolica is a generic name given to the brightly coloured lead- glazed earthenware that was originally developed by Mintons for the Great Exhibition of 1851. Railway Pottery The Railway Pottery was set up for the manufacture of high quality \\"General Ware and Art Ware\\" by Frederick Hackney and J. Kirkham, who had previously worked for Wedgwood. In 1878 Simon Fielding bought the company, which was subsequently known as S.Fielding and Co., and managed it with Abraham Fielding. Simon Fielding owned the Blyth Colour Works in Cresswell, Staffordshire, which gave the Railway Company direct control over important ceramic raw materials. In 1879 the press praised the company for making \\"wonderful strides\\" and said, \\"majolica is equal to anything we have seen\\", but the company ran into debt. Abraham Fielding paid off the debts and took charge of the company. Hackney moved to Baltimore, United States to work for D.F.Haynes & Co. at the Chesapeake Pottery. In 1880, the Blyth Colour Works was sold to Piggot & Scarrott. The next ten years were the peak period for the manufacture of Fielding's pottery. In 1893, a trade journal wrote of the Railway Pottery, > At the present time upwards of four hundred hands are employed by the firm, > and there is every prospect of these being largely increased in the future. > The reason of this success is not far to seek. The firm have aimed at the > production of goods of artistic designs and excellent quality at the lowest > possible prices, while by continually introducing novelties they have kept > pace with the popular demand for something new. The consequence is that > during the past five years the volume of the firm's business has been > doubled. The firm's works, known as the Railway Pottery, is fitted up with > all the latest machinery, driven by three powerful engines.A Descriptive > Account of the Potteries Abraham Fielding invented a patent down-draft kiln, in which the heat of the fire, instead of simply rising from the bottom of the oven up through the chimney at the top, rose and was then driven down through the centre of the kiln before rising through the chimney. This design distributed the heat more evenly in the kiln and reduced wear-and-tear. The Railway Pottery was renamed the Devon Pottery in 1912 and developed the Crown Devon line. Designs By 1878 the Railway Pottery was making a range of majolica jugs, bread trays, oyster plates, etc. Ten majolica designs were registered between 1881 and 1884 and were used on a huge range of goods: tea and coffee sets, dessert, fruit, ice cream and fish services, vases, jardinieres, cuspidors, jugs, tea pots and umbrella stands. Umbrella stands were made in standard designs and designs incorporating goats, hares, ducks, cranes and a tree trunk with a girl skater. A Kate Greenaway stand was made, which contained figures on panels representing spring and autumn. Perhaps the most bizarre stand produced in 1879 showed: \\"The Ameer of Afghanistan running up a tree, in the shape of a monkey, to escape from John Bull, who is supposed to be shooting at him\\" (Pottery Gazette) A fox fruit dish was described as follows: \\"The surface of this dish has a fine grouping of ferns and foliage and the handle or knob is formed by a well moulded fox that is intently watching a rabbit peeping from beneath a burrow.\\" The most popular designs were: fan, fan and insect, fan and scroll, fan and daisy, and other fan designs; ribbon and leaf, ribbon and daisy, shell and net, hummingbird and bamboo, pansy and fuchsia; shell shapes, panels with birds, squirrels and other animals. The background colours are argenta white, turquoise, yellow, and cobalt blue. The oyster plates are highly prized, particularly in the USA. Other designs: *Butterfly and bamboo *Cobalt blue moustache cup *Figural and panelled jugs *Garden seats *Ribbon and leaf *Shaving mugs *Shell and net *Wheat and daisy *Wheat ribbon and daisy Back stamps Early majolica was stamped with a fleur de lys in a shield. Other marks are a diamond and the word Fielding. On 19th century majolica, all marks are impressed, not printed, but there are some black or, occasionally, purple painters' marks.

Investigative journalism  Sweeney worked for twelve years at The Observer newspaper, where he covered wars and revolutions in more than sixty countries including Romania, Algeria, Iraq, Chechnya, Burundi and Bosnia. =Barclay brothers suit= In 1996, Sweeney was sued for criminal defamation in France by the Barclay brothers, owners of The Daily Telegraph, but the claimants lost their case. At the time, Sweeney worked for the rival newspaper The Observer, and had given an interview on BBC Radio Guernsey alleging that they had been involved in corruption. The claimants justified their legal claim in the French courts on the basis that the broadcast could also be heard in a small coastal part of northern France, although this was widely considered forum shopping. Sweeney was ordered to pay ‚Ç¨3,000 by the appeal court in Rennes, France. Career at the BBC Sweeney appeared on the BBC arts programme, The Late Show when he filmed behind the scenes footage of the campaign of the 1992 United Kingdom general election. Later, Sweeney would work at the BBC from 2001 to 2014 as a staff reporter for flagship news programme Panorama, but subsequently continued to be involved in producing BBC Panorama programmes. Sweeney regularly reported for Newsnight, a BBC current affairs programme. Sweeney ceased working for the BBC in October 2019. Shortly before his departure, the Press Gazette reported that \\"[Sweeney] was secretly filmed speaking with a source over drinks who turned out to be an ally of [Tommy] Robinson\\". Panorama later apologised on Sweeney's behalf for \\"offensive and inappropriate\\" comments made during the encounter. =Zimbabwe= After formally joining the BBC in 2001, Sweeney reported on mass graves in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe for the BBC in 2002. By then Mugabe had banned BBC reporters from the country, forcing Sweeney to hide in a car boot to travel to a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition. =Cot death investigation= Sweeney spent four years investigating the cases of Sally Clark, Angela Cannings and Donna Anthony, three women who had been falsely imprisoned for killing their children. Sweeney's investigation helped to clear their names, and led to Sir Roy Meadow, the expert witness whose testimony had proved decisive in their convictions, being temporarily struck off the General Medical Council's medical register. Sweeney received the Paul Foot Award in 2005 in recognition of his work. =Investigative report on Scientology= John Sweeney talking about his book \\"Church of Fear\\" at Leeds Sceptics \\"Scientology and Me\\", a Panorama investigation into Scientology written and presented by Sweeney, was aired on BBC One on Monday, 14 May 2007. Prior to its airing, video footage filmed by the Church of Scientology was released on YouTube and on DVD that showed Sweeney shouting at Scientology representative Tommy Davis during a visit to Citizens Commission on Human Rights's exhibition \\"Psychiatry: An Industry of Death\\". The clips were sections of a documentary the Church of Scientology's Freedom Magazine TV produced about the BBC Panorama programme.\\"BBC reporter blows his top at Scientologist\\", Daily Telegraph, 15 May 2007 Sweeney remarked that he lost his temper due to days of harassment by Davis and the Church, and a strong personal reaction to the psychiatry exhibition. He had been visited at his hotel by Davis, despite not having shared the address with the Church, and had been followed on several different occasions.Row over Scientology video, John Sweeney, BBC News, 12 May 2007 Sweeney labelled the clips \\"attack videos\\" and others say they were produced to discredit him and the documentary. The BBC in response aired its own full recording of the incident.BBC Report on John Sweeney (BBC Video of events) - BBC News clip 14 May 2007 Panorama's Editor Sandy Smith explained what happened and how the BBC dealt with the incident in a post on the BBC's Editor's Blog. An internal BBC investigation found that Sweeney's conduct at one point in the filming was clearly inappropriate, but also noted that Sweeney had apologised for his outburst and concluded that as a whole, filming of the documentary had been performed in a proper and fair manner. Later on that same year in the BBC Panorama year in review Sweeney said \\"..a new generation is making up its own mind, and for that I make no apology\\". Sweeney went into a similar outburst in January 2009 when being interviewed on Radio 4 about the Tom Cruise film Valkyrie‚Äîclearly referring to the episode two years previously, as a part of a rehearsed joke. In a segment on BBC Radio 4's From Our Own Correspondent broadcast in March 2008, Sweeney paid tribute to the late Scientology critic Shawn Lonsdale, who had died, apparently from suicide, a few weeks before. Sweeney looked back at the life of Lonsdale, and his eventful interview for the Scientology and Me programme that had been filmed the previous spring. A follow-up Panorama programme also hosted by Sweeney, which at an hour is twice the length of the original one, was aired on 28 September 2010. This documentary contained interviews with high-profile ex- scientologists Mike Rinder and Marty Rathbun. Rinder in particular explained the tactics used by the church during the making of the previous documentary, while Rathbun primarily discussed the allegations of David Miscavige assaulting other members of the church. Rinder had been involved in the Scientology organisation's stalking of Sweeney. =North Korea Undercover= In an undercover visit to North Korea, Sweeney posed as an academic from the London School of Economics whilst travelling with a party of students from the university, also including Sweeney's wife and another BBC employee. The BBC was accused of putting students at risk and of compromising the future ability of the university to pursue studies in other countries with strict regimes. The BBC Trust Editorial Standards Committee investigated the complaints against the programme makers, and found that \\"the BBC failed to ensure that all the young adults Panorama travelled with were sufficiently aware of any potential risks to enable them to give informed consent. This was a serious failing, and the BBC is right to apologise to the complainants.\\" They also found that Sweeney's wife, who was the trip organiser and tour leader, had a conflict of interest which was compounded when she became employed by the BBC for the programme. Subsequently, however, a public statement signed by six of the 10 LSE student participants on the trip said that \\"We feel that we have now been put in more risk than was originally the case, as a result of the LSE's decision to go public with their story\\".Students say LSE has placed them at 'more risk' from North Korea, The Guardian, 17 April 2013 They also indicated that they had no objection to the broadcast of the BBC Panorama documentary and that they were satisfied with how the BBC handled the trip. An LSE spokesman denied this. The programme was watched by 5.06 million people making it the number 1 show in its time slot and the second most watched show of the night.A North Korea Panorama special is seen by over 5 million viewers on BBC One., Digital Spy, 16 April 2013 The programme formed the basis of a book, North Korea Undercover, published in November 2013. =Fake Sheikh: Exposed= Sweeney was the presenter of a controversial Panorama about the ex News of the World undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood called \\"Fake Sheikh: Exposed\\". The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, wrote to the BBC asking them not to show it in case it prejudiced any future trial, and Mahmood unsuccessfully tried to get an injunction to stop Panorama broadcasting recent video of him with no disguise. The broadcast was twice delayed and was finally transmitted on 12 November 2014. Following the programme the Crown Prosecution Service announced that they would reinvestigate 25 cases where people were convicted on Mahmood's evidence. =Trump: The Kremlin Candidate?= Sweeney presented the documentary he researched and investigated, Trump: The Kremlin Candidate?, first broadcast for Panorama on BBC One on 16 January 2017, four days before the Inauguration of Donald Trump. Exploring links between Trump associates and Russian officials and Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, the documentary was well received by The Guardian, Radio Times, The National, and the Times Union. The documentary was screened in Perugia, Italy on 6 April 2017 at the International Journalism Festival. Investigative journalists Sweeney and Andrei Soldatov of Russia were in attendance at the screening. =Tommy Robinson= On 23 February 2019, about 4,000 protested outside BBC offices in Manchester against one of Sweeney's planned Panorama episodes on activist Tommy Robinson, who also led the protest. During the rally, undercover filming of Sweeney, obtained from a supporter of Robinson, was shown on a large screen. In the film, Sweeney is heard making a number of remarks which were described by the activist as being racist, homophobic and anti-working class. Sweeney also called former IRA leader Martin McGuinness \\"one of [his] political heroes\\". Sweeney later apologised for the remarks. The BBC stated that \\"any programme we broadcast will adhere to the BBC's strict editorial guidelines\\", and that work on the Panorama programme would continue. The NUJ condemned what they described as the intimidation of BBC staff and journalists. Panorama issued a statement apologising on Sweeney's behalf for his \\"offensive and inappropriate\\" comments. The Panorama episode on Robinson was never shown on the BBC.

Originally part of the lands of the Kaurna aboriginal people, it was farmed from European settlement of South Australia until the declaration of the park in 1989. The park provides an open space barrier between Golden Grove and the suburbs of Salisbury, has dams to mitigate flooding and is a significant site for both public recreation and native flora and fauna conservation. It is bounded by main roads and bisected by a four-lane main connecting road.  Structure and climate  Map showing structures, trails and roads Cobbler Creek Recreation Park is a protected area located about north of the Adelaide city centre within the suburb of Salisbury East.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.3 The park is bounded by Bridge and Smith roads, and Green Valley Drive. The Grove Way, a major divided road, runs through the park with a pedestrian underpass connecting the two park sections. The park is open to the public and includes three formed walking trails and two ruins. The remains of William Pedler's home \\"Trevalsa\\" and another's called \\"Teakles House\\" lie next to one of the trails. There are no public facilities except for benches, signage and picnic tables.Tilbrook K. (2003), pp.22-25 \\"Kelway House\\", originally belonging to the Kelway Park farm that occupied much of the park, remains as office accommodation for park management staff.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.20 The park lies on the border between the dry northern Adelaide Plains and the wetter Mount Lofty Ranges. Based on climate measurements for nearby Parafield Airport, the park has an average rainfall of , an average winter daily temperature range of 6.215.6 degrees Celsius and a summer range of 16.529.7.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.4 Due to the risk of flooding after heavy rain, the park's waterways have been dammed, though they are dry for much of the year.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.35 The park's topography ranges from steadily sloping in the west, to hilly in the east. Its lowest point, on the western edge along Bridge road, is above sea level, rising to at the Para Trigonometric Point in the park's southeastern corner. Flat land on the western side has red-brown soil with the remainder having Terra Rosas, Redzinas and fine-textured mallee soils.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.9 Cobbler Creek itself begins in the hills to the west of Golden Grove and joins with Slate Creek prior to entering the park. It is used to collect stormwater from the Tea Tree Gully area as it passes through both farmland and suburbs. After leaving the park the creek passes through housing developments, into wetlands and eventually to the Barker Inlet. The recreation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. Prior use of the land Ruin of \\"Trevalsa\\", William Pedler's home After European settlement the land was used for farming. William Pedler III (1804-1874), emigrated to the colony from Cornwall in 1838. He was one of the first to farm the area with his wife Elizabeth (Nicholls). William had been a shoe-maker in Cornwall and Adelaide and from his farm at Salisbury made shoes and boots for teamsters passing through carting ore to Burra. William Pedler first purchased land of at Cobbler Creek in 1850, later adding adjoining land to create a farm of 279 acres. He passed the property on, and his oldest son William IV farmed the land for many years with his wife Martha (Day) and their family. William III's profession gave both the creek that passes through the northern part of the park, and the park their names.Lewis (1980), p.24 Pedler's farm occupied the flatter, western area of land near Bridge Road. Part of the park was later a farm known as \\"Kelway Park\\"; a homestead of the same name remains in the park's south-west. In the 19th century, Salisbury residents used this area for Sunday school picnics. Swings were temporarily built, water and food brought to the site and games and bands provided for entertainment.Lewis (1980), p.54 Investigations have found no evidence of land use prior to European settlement, although the park forms part of the traditional lands of the Kaurna aboriginal people. It is likely that the Kaurna used the area during winter for food and shelter, moving to the coast to escape summer heat.  History  In a 1962 government report, the park's area was identified for use as future open space. A golf course was proposed, as were other sporting facilities. The course was re-proposed in 1981 and again in the 1990 management plan. The park was purchased by the Government of South Australia in 1970, as part of a program preserving open space for recreation. The park's location was chosen to provide a development-free buffer between the existing suburbs of Salisbury and the proposed Golden Grove development. It was owned and managed by the State Planning Authority until 1982 when control passed to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Cobbler Creek was declared a recreation park in 1989, at which point some of the land remained leased for agriculture.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.III,13,21 The Golden Grove Indenture Act (1984) committed the government to build certain access roads to the new suburb of Golden Grove. Based on the provisions of section 7A-1 in the act, in June 1987 cabinet approved the building of Grove Way. The road is a 4-lane divided connecting road, begun in September 1988 and completed in 1990.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.14 Cobbler Creek Recreation Park is administered and maintained jointly by the City of Salisbury, and the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources. A volunteer group, Friends of Cobbler Creek, was formed in 1990 and works with rangers to improve and maintain the park.  Flora and fauna  River red gum, native to the area While sections of the park have been cleared (owing to past land uses), other areas feature grassland, river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), and mallee box (Eucalyptus porosa). The park contains some of the last remaining mallee box grassy woodland in Adelaide. Amongst the woodlands, plants like the blue-flowering flax lily are common. Most of the lower, western parts of the park were cleared for pasture and cropping until the early 1970s. While there is remnant vegetation on higher ground, introduced pasture grasses and associated weeds dominate much of the understorey. Perennial native grasses, such as kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), have been used as part of the park's revegetation. Many of the introduced grasses dry in summer and pose a greater fire hazard than the regrowth. To combat this hazard, and protect surrounding residential areas, annual burns are held particularly around the park's margins. These burns also serve to encourage native vegetation to dominate over introduced weeds. Introduced artichoke thistle in flower Due to the park's perceived modest conservation values, the 1990 management plan called only for specific control of proscribed weeds rather than an eradication plan for all introduced species.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), P.30 Cobbler Creek park has a wide range of native plants including quandong, ruby saltbush (Enchylaena tomentosa), desert cassia (Cassia eremophila), weeping pittosporum and umbrella wattle (Acacia ligulata). Native fauna species have been greatly reduced by past agricultural practices and the introduced rabbit is now common.Department of Environment and Planning (1990), p.12 Eastern bearded dragons, White's skink, eastern brown snake, and sleepy lizard reptile species are seen; a total of twenty species have been seen within the park. Black- shouldered kites and nankeen kestrels hunt over the grasslands. red-rumped parrots and crested pigeons are seen feeding on the ground and wattlebirds, musk lorikeets, noisy miners and honeyeaters in the flowering gums and along creeklines. The park is home to a small population of the worm-like and vulnerable Flinders Ranges worm-lizard (Aprasia pseudopulchella).Mitchell D J (1993) Recreation Recreational use of the park is encouraged. There are some picnic facilities provided and dogs are allowed to be walked while on leads. The park includes three named walking trailsMai Tappa, Babbler and Porosa that largely follow formed management tracks. The trails pass by the park's ruins and both these and natural sights are highlighted by interpretive signs. Mountain bike riding was prohibited within the park and illegal trail bike riding was common.Various news reports, particularly News Limited: The Messenger (Salisbury), 15 June 2005 and 2 November 2005 However, as of 2013 shared use trails have been built for walkers and mountain bike riders.

The squadron was formed in England in October 1917 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, and disbanded in April 1919. It was re-formed by the Royal Australian Air Force in September 1939. After seeing action during the Pacific War flying Lockheed Hudson and, later, DAF Beaufort bombers, the squadron was disbanded a second time in January 1946. History No. 8 Squadron was formed during World War I, being raised as a flying training squadron of the Australian Flying Corps at Yatesbury, England, during on 25 October 1917. The squadron received its first aircraft in January 1918 and trained replacement pilots for No. 4 Squadron until being disbanded following the conclusion of the war on 30 April 1919.. The squadron's first commanding officer was Major G.A.C. Cowper; it was initially designated as No. 33 (Australian) (Training) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps. No. 8 Squadron Dakotas, October 1939 During World War II, No. 8 Squadron was re- formed as a bomber-reconnaissance unit at RAAF Station Canberra, which was later retitled as RAAF Station Fairbairn, Canberra, on 11 September 1939.. Due to a shortage of other aircraft the squadron was initially equipped with ex- civilian DC-3 transport aircraft, which were used to conduct patrols off the Australian coast and for transport tasks. The squadron was re-equipped with Lockheed Hudson medium bombers in May 1940 and deployed to Singapore in August. It first saw action within hours of the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December 1941 when its 12 aircraft attacked Japanese shipping off Malaya. The squadron suffered heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire and Japanese fighters in the first days of the Malayan Campaign, during which time it undertook bombing and reconnaissance missions. As there were no aircraft to replace its losses, the squadron was amalgamated with No. 1 Squadron later in December. The amalgamated squadron continued operations throughout the month, before No. 8 Squadron handed its remaining Hudsons to No. 1 Squadron in January 1942 and was evacuated to Palembang in Sumatra, where it received replacement Hudsons. The replacements were six aircraft from No. 59 Squadron RAF, as well as their crews, who had been reassigned and sent from the UK between December 1941 and January 1942. With the new force, they undertook further reconnaissance and bombing missions, during which the squadron continued to suffer heavy losses until No. 8 Squadron was disbanded at Batavia on 16 February and its personnel returned to Australia. No. 8 Squadron was reformed at RAAF Station Canberra on 12 March 1943 equipped with DAP Beaufort as a medium and torpedo bomber squadron. The squadron practiced cross-country navigation, bombing and air-to-air gunnery around Canberra, as well as torpedo training at Jervis Bay, before moving to Bohle River in northern Queensland in July 1943. The squadron then moved to Goodenough Island, Papua New Guinea, in September and began flying combat missions against Japanese airfields and supply dumps and shipping in the New Britain area. In December, one of the squadron's aircraft sank a 6,834 tonne Japanese ship with torpedoes in Simpson Harbour.. Following the isolation of Rabaul, the squadron moved to the New Guinea mainland in April 1944 and flew strikes against Japanese positions near Wewak and anti-shipping patrols until the end of the war from bases around Nadzab and Tadji. No. 8 Squadron was disbanded at Tadji in New Guinea on 19 January 1946. During the war, 79 personnel from the squadron were killed in action or died on active service. Members from the squadron received the following decorations: one Order of the British Empire, 13 Distinguished Flying Crosses and one bar, two Distinguished Flying Medals, two British Empire Medals, and seven Mentions in Despatches. While not noted by AWM, British Empire Medals were awarded to Sergeant E.J. Daly and Sergeant B.V. McLean, following actions after a crash at Canberra on 3 May 1943.

The test organization can be affiliated with the government or universities or can be an independent testing laboratory. They are independent because they are not affiliated with the producer nor the user of the item being tested: no commercial bias is present. These \\"contract testing\\" facilities are sometimes called \\"third party\\" testing or evaluation facilities. Affiliation of testing organizations Many suppliers or vendors offer some chemical testing, physical testing, and software testing as a free service to customers. It is common for businesses to partner with reputable suppliers: Many suppliers have certified quality management systems such as ISO 9000 or allow customers to conduct technical and quality audits. Data from testing is commonly shared. There is sometimes a risk that supplier testing may tend to be self-serving and not completely impartial. Large companies often have their own specialized staff and testing facilities laboratory. Corporate engineers know their products, manufacturing capabilities, logistics system, and their customers best. Cost reduction of existing products and cost avoidance for new products have been documented. Another option is to use paid consultants, Independent contractors, and third-party test laboratories. They are commonly chosen for specialized expertise, for access to certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required. Many have certifications and accreditations: ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 17025, and various governing agencies. Independent third party laboratories should not be affiliated with any supplier as such affiliation creates bias. Purposes Independent testing might have a variety of purposes, such as: * Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a specification, regulation, or contract are met * Decide if a new product development program is on track: Demonstrate proof of concept * Provide standard data for other scientific, engineering, and quality assurance functions * Validate suitability for end-use * Provide a basis for technical communication * Provide a technical means of comparison of several options * Provide evidence in legal proceedings: forensics, product liability, patents, product claims, etc. * Help solve problems with current products or services * Help identify potential cost savings in products or services Industry standards There are various technical standards available which organizations can use to evaluate products and services. Test methods are published by regulators or can be included in specifications or contracts. International standards organizations also publish test methods: * International Organization for Standardization, ISO * ASTM International * European Committee for Standardization. CEN * Military Standards * etc. =Software= For example in software usage, the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process improvement approach that ‚Äúprovides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes.‚Äù There are various levels attainable within CMMI, the highest of which is Level 5. Attaining this level of certification verifies that the practices of the organization are exemplary. The Testing Maturity Model (TMM) has been designed to complement CMMI and is based on best industry practices. The TMM has 2 components; firstly, a set of 5 levels that define testing capability covering maturity goals, subgoals and activities, tasks and responsibilities and secondly, an assessment model consisting of a maturity questionnaire and an assessment procedure. There is also the Test Process Improvement model from Sogeti. This supports the improvement of test processes by looking at 20 key areas and has different levels therein to enable insight into the state of the key areas. In order to satisfy the criteria stipulated in the best practice guidelines, organizations must be committed and must invest time and money to implement and adhere to the processes as defined by such guidelines. Typically, companies have a small test team which coordinates the entire testing activity. During the testing cycle, the test team is supplemented with the readily available developers. Pros to independent testing * No commercial bias is present: test reports have more credibility. *The turnaround time for test activity is often much shorter because the independent laboratory specializes in testing *Independent organizations often have specialized facilities with current calibration * Personnel often have excellent experience, credentials, certifications, and accreditations.ASTM E1301 Standard Guide for Proficiency Testing by Interlaboratory Comparisons Cons to independent testing * Costs of contract testing * Independent testers do not know the product, service, or customer as well as the producer or developer.

A cage cup, also vas diatretum, plural diatreta, or \\"reticulated cup\\" is a type of luxury late Roman glass vessel, found from roughly the 4th century, and \\"the pinnacle of Roman achievements in glass-making\\".New Scientist Diatreta consist of an inner beaker and an outer cage or shell of decoration that stands out from the body of the cup, to which it is attached by short stems or shanks. About fifty cups or, more often, fragments have survived,Bonhams and there are only a few in near-complete condition. Most have a cage with circular geometrical patterns, often with an \\"inscription\\", or phrase in letters above the reticulated area as well. Some have a flange, or zone of projecting open-cut moulding, above the lower patterns and below the lettering (only illustrated here by the Cologne cup in the gallery). Even rarer are examples with scenes with figures, of which the Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is the only complete example to survive, though there are other fragments. In this the rest of the \\"cage\\" is made up of a vine that entraps Lycurgus. None have a foot. All were clearly difficult to make, and no doubt very expensive, like the other spectacular type of luxury Roman glass,Bonhams cameo glass objects like the Portland Vase. Both the technology used to make them and the way they were used are still the subject of some debate among specialists. Technology Cage cups, diatreta, are mentioned in Roman literature,Martin, Susan Dunbar - Imperitia: The Responsibility of Skilled Workers in Classical Roman Law American Journal of Philology - Volume 122, Spring 2001, pp. 107-129, in respect of a calicem diatretum - related law, mentioned by Ulpian and the dates assigned to examples (not necessarily by the same people) range from around the mid-third to the mid-4th century,Specifically it has been suggested that the Lycurgus Cup refers to a political event in 324. at the same time as the late Roman cameo glass vessels. They appear to have been made of similar glasses, and there is also evidence that some late vessels may have been combinations of cameo and cage-cup techniques.Whitehouse, D., Late Roman cameo glass, in Annales du 11e Congres. 1990: Amsterdam. The main division is between cups with figures, whether or not accompanied by reticulated patterns, and those without. Some have inscriptions and flanges with ovolo decoration; others do not. Most have a narrow beaker shape, but others a wider bowl-like one.Bonhams Since the first publication on the subject in 1680 it has mostly been accepted that the cage cups were made by cutting and grinding a blank vessel of solid thick glass, a laborious technique at which the Greeks and Romans were very experienced from their passion for hardstone carvings and engraved gems in semi-precious stones. An alternative theory, once rejected but recently revived, suggests that this is only true of the rim of the vessels and the cutting of the fixed cage, but not for the joining of beaker and its cage; these would have been made separately and fused when hot.The main current proponent is the German glass historian Rosemarie Liercke - see external links for her website, which has English accounts of her theories, controversial on this and other matters. For example, it is claimed that the smooth joins on the Munich cup show the fusion of the cage to the main cup, though the cage itself is carved. These smooth joins also show the Cologne and Pljevlja cups above. However this remains controversial, and a fragmentary cup found in Corinth in the 1960s is said to show no evidence of joints where the cage meets the main cup when examined under a microscope.Whitehouse, 83-84; Corning Cage Cup Apart from carved gems, a small fragment of an openwork pattern in reticulated silver has survived in a large hoard of Roman silver chopped up in the 5th century as bullion, and buried in Scotland at Trapain Law, now in the Royal Museum of Scotland. The fragment shows a pattern based on circles, that is very similar to the glass diatreta, suggesting that the same style may have been used in silver plate, though which came first is unknown.Fleming, 110 The Lycurgus Cup, lit from behind, with a modern foot and rim. Some examples add difficulty to the manufacturing process by using different colours on the cage, like the Milan and Cologne cups, but most are plain glass, like those at Munich and Corning. For the special technology of dichroic glass, which changes colour when light passes through it, see the article on the best example, the Lycurgus Cup. Function The function of cage cups is debated. The inscriptions strongly suggest that they were cups to be used, and perhaps passed around, for ceremonial drinking at feasts, but it has been suggested that the shape of the out-turned rim of the beakers and the missing stand of all known vessels means that all diatreta were like the example in the Corning Museum of Glass, which was almost certainly an oil lamp designed to be suspended. The Corning cup was certainly intended for suspension, as the copper alloy fittings were found with it; there is a round band fitting under the rim, and three pieces that are part chain and part rod, leading to a ring and single rod, and a variety of cups for three attachments,Cornelius Steckner: Pharokantharoi und Kylikeia. Dionysische Lichtgef√§√üe in architektonischem Kontext, AIHV Annales du 11e Congr√®s (Antwerp University Press) 1988, 257 -270 very like a hanging basket in modern gardens, and an arrangement known to have been used for lamps by the Romans.Corning Museum of Glass. For fuller details click the red link on \\"(87.1.1)\\". The convivial dedications found on several examples are paralleled on the bases on many Roman gold glass cups found mostly in Rome. The Lycurgus Cup has no out-turned rim, but may have been altered, or fitted with a metal rim like the modern one it has now. Like the Constable-Maxwell cup, the Corning cup is much wider than the other well-known examples, shaped more as a bowl than a cup, though apart from the lack of lettering, otherwise very similar in form to the narrower cups. The cups therefore probably form two groups: a bowl-shaped lamp group with no lettering, and a beaker-shaped group for drinking from, with lettering.Bonhams Cups for drinking with rounded bottoms, which encourage faster consumption as they must either be held or placed rim down (and empty) on a surface such as a table, are known from various cultures, with for example the modern yard glass, and other types of \\"shot\\" glass. Origin Decorative Roman glass of the highest quality tends to be assigned to Rome or Alexandria, the latter mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century satirist Martial and other sources, but the majority of finds of diatreta are from Roman sites along the Rhine, or near it, suggesting that they were produced in the area, perhaps at Augusta Treverorum, modern Trier, the largest city of Roman Germany, which was the main residence of Constantine I for many years, coinciding with the period when the cups seem to have been made.Randers-Pehrson, 27-30 Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne, is another possibility.Broadman, 328 However several more recent discoveries, including reputedly both the Corning and Constable-Maxwell cups, have been from the Eastern Empire, so there may have been two centres of production.Bonhams Examples The Coppa diatreta Trivulzio in Milan, seen upside down These represent most of the best-preserved examples to survive. :Beaker-shaped: *The Cologne cage cup at the Romano-Germanic Museum in Cologne.

This is somewhat puzzling to archaeologists, as the rest of the grave goods found in the same grave were very mundane. *The Coppa diatreta Trivulzio at the Museo archeologico Milan, the only example with no damage at all. This has the inscription: BIBE VIVAS MVLTIS ANNIS: \\"Drink and you will live for many years\\". It is 4th century, found in the 17th century in a sarcophagus in between the comuni of Mandello Vitta and Castellazzo Novarese (Novara), in the 18th century acquired by Abbot Trivulzio and in 1935 by the city of Milan. *The Munich Cup in the Munich Staatliche Antikensammlungen, found in Cologne, also inscribed \\"Bibe multis annis\\", short for BIBE VIVAS MVLTIS ANNIS *The Lycurgus Cup; no inscription, but the glass is dichroic, changing colour when lit from behind. Its origins are unknown, but it has probably always been above ground. This is significantly larger than the geometrical beakers, with a height of 158.8 mm (6.25 in).British Museum *The Daruvar \\"Netzbecher\\" (\\"net-beaker\\") in Vienna, found in 1785 in Daruvar, Croatia, and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.

Von den sechs Gl√§sern befindet sich heute leider nur noch ein einziges Glas in der Sammlung des Landesmuseums Mainz: die Dionysos-Flasche. Alle anderen Gl√§ser dieses kostbaren Fundes sind seit dem Krieg verschollen. Dies ist umso tragischer, als besonders wertvolle Sammlungsbest√§nde des Hauses - unter ihnen auch das Diatretglas und die Dionysos-Flasche aus Hohen-S√ºlzen - im Oktober 1939 nach Erbach im Odenwald ausgelagert wurden. Bei einer √úberpr√ºfung der ausgelagerten Best√§nde im September 1943 waren beide Gl√§ser noch vorhanden.

In 1950 Victor, Lord Rothschild asked the British Museum to investigate his Lycurgus Cup, which he subsequently sold to the museum in 1958. In 1956 the German scholar Fritz Fremersdorf published an account of their manufacture by cutting and grinding, which remains the conventional theory. In 1959 a detailed account of the Lycurgus Cup was published by Donald Harden and Jocelyn Toynbee, which also discussed diatreta as a group, effectively for the first time. A major exhibition in 1987, \\"Glass of the Caesars\\", organized by the Corning Museum of Glass and shown in the British Museum, Cologne and Milan, united several of the leading examples, and its catalogue, edited by Harden, remains a key work.Bonhams; British Museum Modern replica cups have been made several times, partly to test hypotheses of the method.

It was designed as a replacement for the Airco DH.9A and served with the Royal Air Force between 1924 and 1929. Development First prototype Fawn with short fuselage and single tank The Fairey Fawn was designed by F Duncanson of Fairey Aviation as a replacement for the Airco DH.9A in the light day-bomber role, to meet the requirements of Specification 5/21 for an aircraft for reconnaissance and army cooperation duties. It was a development of the Fairey Pintail floatplane, powered by a Napier Lion engine. The first of three prototypes flew on 8 March 1923.Mason 1994, p. 148. The second and third prototypes were fitted with lengthened fuselages to improve stability, and this was adapted for the production version.Taylor 1988, pp. 108‚Äì109. The Fawn was fitted with fuel tanks above the top wing in order to meet Air Ministry safety requirements. These tanks posed a hazard to the pilots if the aircraft overturned on landing. First prototype Fawn with lengthened fuselage, revised tail and overhead tanks; the basis for the production Fawn Mk II A revised specification 20/23 was issued which added the bomber role. Two prototypes and 48 production Fawn Mk II aircraft were ordered against the new specification in August 1923 to re-equip the home based DH.9A squadrons of the RAF, although the first two production aircraft were completed as short fuselage Fawn Mk Is. The remainder of this order were full production long fuselage Fawn Mk IIs. The Fawn Mk III was fitted with a more powerful 468 hp (350 kW) Lion V engine, while the Fawn Mk IV was fitted with a supercharged Lion VI engine. Operational history The Fawn entered service with 12 Squadron in March 1924, equipping two further regular squadrons, 11 Squadron and 100 Squadron.Thetford 1957, p. 202. Despite the fact that the Fawn was originally intended to replace all the home-based DH.9A squadrons, four more squadrons continued to be equipped with the DH.9A for several more years before being replaced by other types. The Fawn was not a popular aircraft in RAF service, having little better performance than the aircraft it replaced, and having a poor view for the pilot owing to the bulky Lion engine.Mason 1994, pp. 149‚Äì150. The Fawn was replaced in these three regular squadrons in 1926, being replaced by the Hawker Horsley and the Fairey Fox.

Used mainly to ferry personnel to and from the ship, or for other small-scale activities, it was, by the 18th century, one of several types of ship's boat. The design evolved throughout its period in service. Origins The term 'jolly boat' has several potential origins. It may originate in the Dutch or Swedish jolle, a term meaning a small bark or boat. Other possibilities include the English term yawl, or the 'gelle-watte', the latter being a term in use in the 16th century to refer to the boat used by the captain for trips to and from shore.Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 340 The term appears in Chamber's Encyclopedia between 1727 and 1741, and as 'jolly' in the works of Frederick Marryat, though it may have been in use considerably earlier, as the record of the voyages of Francis Drake and John Hawkins has 'That day the Pegasus jolly was going on shore for water, carying no guarde. The Spaniards perceiving it came downe upon them.'More Words Ancient and Modern, pp. 92-3 Design and use In this illustration from Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, crew members flee from a mutinous ship in a jolly boat. Jolly boats were usually the smallest type of boat carried on ships, and were generally between and long. They were clinker- built and propelled by four or six oars.Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 434 When not in use the jolly boat normally hung from davits at the stern of a ship, and could be hoisted into and out of the water. Jolly boats were used for transporting people and goods to and from shore, for carrying out inspections of the ship, or other small tasks and duties that required only a small number of people, and did not need the use of the larger boats, such as the launch or cutter. Jolly boats were carried on practically all types of warships of the Royal Navy during the age of sail, from ships of the line down to sloops and brigs. Ships of the line would carry a barge, launch, pinnace, two cutters, all of various sizes, and a jolly boat, while the brigs might carry only a jolly boat and a cutter. The application of the jolly boat was developed further during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly by the frigate commander Sir George Collier. Collier, who was active in the close blockade of the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, combined the features of a jolly boat with those of a whaleboat and found the result extremely seaworthy and particularly effective in carrying out shore landings. The design was particularly buoyant and was often described as a type of lifeboat. Several captains ordered these boats for their own ships, while the Admiralty considered the possibility of ordering a general replacement of old-style jolly boats with the new 'lifeboat' design on several occasions, but were deterred by the cost. By 1815 however the Stores Committee had authorised the replacement of the old-style jolly boats with the improved versions as and when it proved practical for a ship's commander to carry this out.

While √Ülfric is an Old English name, his nickname Modercope or Modercoppe is Norse. This would exemplify the time when there was a strong Anglo-Danish movement and three successive Danish kings had held the throne until Edward the Confessor succeeded in 1042. √Ülfric had a strong connection at court, but his role and status are unusual: he was described as a ‚Äòcomes famoses‚Äô in a document from Bury St Edmunds. √Ülfric was the son of Wihtgar and his son was also called Wihtgar. √Ülfric was one of the wealthiest of the East Anglian thegns during this period, whose estate can be traced through the lands held by his son, Wihtgar, that were recorded in the Doomsday Book. His wealth and reputation derived from his connections with Emma of Normandy (d. 1052), wife of King Cnut and prior to that, second wife of √Üthelred the Unready (d. 1016). As her dapifer (steward or seneschal), √Ülfric administered the eight-and-a-half hundreds of west Suffolk on her behalf. He also appears to have had family connections in the queen‚Äôs household, as evidenced by a bequest left to him as ‚Äòkinsman‚Äô in a will addressed directly to the queen. √Ülfric's own will still exists in the archives of Bury St Edmunds. In it he leaves certain lands to religious institutions in Ely and Bury St Edmunds, including in Loddon, a small town in South Norfolk. He is therefore credited as the first person to record the name of Loddon or 'Lodne' in any document, and consequently his figure appears on the town's sign.

A prolific playwright, he authored more 300 works. Swinson was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to Hugh Swinson and Lilla Fisher Swinson. He attended St Albans School. He enlisted in the Rifle Brigade in 1939 and in 1940 was commissioned into the Worcestershire Regiment. In the Far East, he fought at the 1944 Battle of Kohima as a Staff Captain with the British 5th Brigade, which commanded the 7th Battalion of his Regiment. The diaries he kept during the battle are now lodged in the Imperial War Museum. He served until 1946, with postings in Malaya, Burma, Assam and India during World War II. In 1949, he subsequently became a writer and producer at the BBC where he produced a number of programmes for Richard Attenborough. In 1966, Swinson wrote and published \\"Kohima,\\" an account of the Battle of Kohima which was fought from April to June 1944 and in which he was a participant. The preface states that Field Marshal William Slim directed Swinson to ensure that Kohima and Imphal are described as twin battles fought under Slim's 14th Army. This Swinson does. Ultimately, however, the book focuses on the experience of the British 2nd Infantry Division. The book is a good adjunct to Slim's \\"Defeat Into Victory\\" and Masters' \\"Road Past Mandalay.\\" Swinson was the author of Scotch on the Rocks (1963 and 2005), which told the true story of the wartime wreck of the SS Politician, on which Compton Mackenzie's novel Whisky Galore (1947) - and the Ealing Comedy of the same title - were based. He died in Spain while on vacation, aged 55. He was survived by his wife, Joyce Budgen, and their three children. References Bibliography * Writing for Television Today.

The paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson is credited with naming it after the French paleontologist, Jesuit and philosopher Teilhard de Chardin. Paleobiology Restoration The carbon isotope excursion suggests that the Asian Teilhardina asiatica is the oldest; the youngest is the North American Teilhardina brandti. There are four hypotheses that have been proposed to try and explain the geographic distribution: 1\\\\. Africa was the origination of the primates and then they dispersed to Europe- Greenland and finally North America. 2\\\\. Primates originated in North America then dispersed to Asia through the Bering route and later passed through Greenland to finally reach Europe. 3\\\\. Primates originated in Asia or Africa and dispersed through North America and finally reaching western Europe. 4\\\\. Asia was the primate‚Äôs origination, they then dispersed eastward towards North America and westward to Europe. At one point a hypothesis arose that the primates may have originated in India prior to Asia plate collision near the Paleocene Eocene boundary and they spread into Asia after it collided. These hypotheses were re-evaluated using new morphological evidence and earliest records of Teilhardina species involved from the continents (e.g. Asia, Europe, Africa etc.). The researchers concluded that none of the hypotheses fit the pattern that had emerged from their studies. A new hypothesis arose from the research; it is now believed that at the beginning of the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum the Teilhardina dispersed from east to west near the Northern Hemisphere. The earliest primates migrated via crossing the Turgai Straits from South Asia to Europe, finally dispersing to North America through Greenland. In simplest terms, it is as follows: westward Asia-to-Europe-to- North America. Taxonomy Although Teilhardina has been usually assigned to Omomyidae, Ni et al. (2004) recovered the genus as polyphyletic, with Teilhardina belgica and T. asiatica nested as the basalmost haplorrhines, and others being recovered as anaptomorphine omomyids (and thus more closely related to the tarsiers than to simians). Teilhardina crassidens was referred to the genus Baataromomys by Ni et al. (2007), but a new paper by Morse et al. (in press) assigned crassidens to the new genus Bownomomys along with T. americana.Ni, X., Wang, Y., Hu, Y. & Li, C., 2004: A euprimate skull from the early Eocene of China.

It was probably donated by the Mede family who lived at Failand Hill and carries their family crest. The Medes were also associated with St Mary Redcliffe, with Thomas Mede holding office as High Sheriff of Bristol and Member of Parliament for Bristol in the 15th century.

During his lifetime he published 44 books of his own poetry, in addition to translations of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway, and Heinrich Heine. He was married to the novelist Gisken Wildenvey.  Biography  Wildenvey was born at Mj√∏ndalen in Nedre Eiker, near the city of Drammen in Buskerud, Norway. He was the son of Lauritz Portaas and Hanna Kristine Grosvold. He was born outside of marriage. His mother remained unmarried while his father married her younger sister. His childhood home, from which he got his surname at birth, was called Port√•sen. He emigrated to the United States in 1904. but returned to Norway during the summer of 1906.

According to Sebak's comprehensive account, the final death toll was 635, among them 225 Norwegian citizens. The 160 survivors spent up to eight days in open lifeboats before rescue. Several more people died in the days that followed rescue as a result of their exposure to the elements and drinking the salt water. Herman Wildenvey was among the survivors.

World War II drama film directed by Rudolph Mat√©, loosely based on a novel of the same name by Martin Dibner. The story depicts the conflicts of a naval officer in combat with his shipmates and conscience over values instilled in him by his Quaker upbringing. The film stars Alan Ladd, who co-produced it, William Bendix, Dianne Foster, Keenan Wynn, James Whitmore, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.. It also marked the film debut of Joey Bishop. Plot summary In September 1942, during World War II, Susan Cahill (Dianne Foster), art director for an ad agency on Madison Avenue run by her fiance, is jealous of his business flirtation with a client's daughter to secure a deal. She accepts an invitation to dinner on Long Island from agency artist Alexander \\"Alec\\" Austen (Alan Ladd). Susan is disturbed by Alec's obvious feelings for her, but accepts a lunch date the next day anyway. After she leaves, Alec receives a telegram to report for active duty in the U.S. Navy but decides not to tell Susan as their relationship grows. Just before reporting for duty, Alec takes Susan home to meet his mother, a Quaker, revealing to them his hope to marry Susan‚Äîand his call up. His mother is hurt that Alec did not disclose his military obligation and saddened that he has disregarded the pacifist tenets of his upbringing. Susan admits she loves Alec, but will not break her engagement. Alec reports aboard his ship, the destroyer USS Poe, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, with no one to see him off as it departs for San Francisco. The ship's captain, Cmdr. Meredith (James Whitmore), quickly takes a shine to Alec and he is befriended by his roommate and the ship's doctor, Lt. Blanchard (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.), who soon realizes Alec is \\"carrying a torch\\" for Susan. However, the ship's executive officer, Lt. Comdr. Edge (Keenan Wynn), has an immediate dislike of Alec's Quaker background and objects to his assignment as assistant gunnery officer. Alec introduces himself to the sailors in the gunnery division, catching them gambling but overlooking the offense. Chief Petty Officer \\"Frenchy\\" Shapiro (William Bendix) congratulates Alec for the way he handled the situation but receives a gentle warning that they best not repeat it. The two become close friends despite their differences in rank when Frenchy reveals that he became estranged from his wife because of his Navy duty. Underway, the ship picks up three survivors from a sunken German submarine, but when Blanchard and Alec attempt to treat them humanely, Edge angrily intervenes. He accuses Alec of being less than a man because he cannot hate, but Alec assures him that he can. In San Francisco, Alec begins drawing a portrait of his Frenchy to give to his daughter. The captain gives Alec a five-day liberty to meet Susan, who has come to California after Blanchard contacted her. They agree to marry immediately and travel to Pebble Beach to stay with Susan's sister, who unfortunately receives notification that her husband has been killed in action. Alec decides to return to the ship and marry Susan only upon his safe return from duty. At sea in the Aleutian Islands, when an aircraft is spotted approaching the ship, the gunners plead for orders to open fire but Alec cannot bring himself to give the command. The plane turns out to be American, apparently justifying the hesitation, but he admits to the captain that he simply froze. Although sympathetic, the captain swaps Alec's assignment with that of the damage control officer. Edge violently condemns Alec and the entire crew save Frenchy shun Alec for being a conscientious objector. During an actual Japanese air attack, a bomb crashes through the deck without exploding. With Frenchy's help, Alec throws the unexploded bomb overboard. At a funeral service for sailors killed in the air attack, the captain reminds the crew that they all might have died without Alec and Frenchy's bravery. The ship docks at Dutch Harbor, where the navy seamen quarrel with those from the Merchant Marine. Alec tries to intervene and is knocked to the ground by a merchant mariner. Mocked for apparently \\"turning the other cheek,\\" Alec defends himself but is accidentally knocked unconscious by Frenchy when a brawl begins. He admits to Blanchard that he felt an angry urge to kill, but Blanchard reassures him that his response was natural. Alec volunteers to lead a dangerous mission ashore to rescue stranded airmen and their reconnaissance photos of the Japanese-held island, joined by Frenchy and several members of the crew. They link up with the airmen, but cut off along the beach by Japanese soldiers, Alec orders his men to open fire and calls the ship for fire support. Frenchy is forced to kill a Japanese shooting at them when Alec cannot bring himself to fire his own weapon. As Frenchy openly pities his friend, four enemy soldiers emerge and Frenchy is wounded. Alec kills them to protect his friend and is also wounded, but Frenchy dies before they make it back to the ship. Soon after, Alec returns to Susan with Frenchy's portrait to deliver to his daughter.

Los Angeles Times 6 Mar 1957: 21. =Screenplay= The screenplay incorporated several subplots (primarily the portraits created by Austen) and characters/back stories from Dibner's 1953 novel, but the plot of the film largely focused on Alec Austen's spiritual crisis of pacifism versus duty, which in the novel did not occur. Likewise the screenplay, except for the issue of abuse of authority by some officers, did not address the major themes of the novel: the clinging by the regular navy chain of command early in the war to archaic customs and traditions that proved detrimental to morale and endangered ships in combat; racial discrimination; sadistic criminal acts, including homosexual rape, by officers and sailors who served in the pre-war Navy; and the assignment in a hurriedly expanded wartime navy of incompetent or marginally qualified regular officers to positions of trust and authority. In the novel the executive officer, an Annapolis-trained senior officer, has a mental breakdown even though higher authority knew from his abusive behavior that he should not be serving on a ship in combat, and commits suicide during battle. The climactic battle scene of the novel, a large scale surface action closely resembling the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, in the film became a minor land skirmish involving Austen's shore party during a rescue attempt. Characters' traits and motivations were altered to match the personalities of the actors cast in the roles, or as in the case of Kennan Wynn's character, were a composite of two major characters. =Shooting= Filming started 15 April 1957.\\"Film Warners Expands Ladd's Pact Of Local Origin\\" by THOMAS M.

At the time, Mathers starred in the television series Leave It to Beaver The film transformed the novel's light cruiser Atlantis (the fictional counterpart of the USS Richmond), a ship with a skipper who loathes the sea and a crew of dispirited castoffs, into the destroyer Poe. During filming in June and July 1957 at Long Beach, California, the Poe was portrayed by the , a World War II destroyer still serving with the Navy but scheduled to be \\"mothballed\\" in early 1958. Its configuration was altered to resemble its wartime appearance, including removal of modern radar appurtenances and installation of 20mm gun mounts from the era on the fantail. Mat√© used most of the ship's complement as shipboard extras, rotating a few at a time on a daily basis and praising their cooperation and abilities.

Thompson of The New York Times wrote in his review: \\"Unfortunately, having stated its case‚Äîthe hero's mental conflict‚Äîthis Warners release then sidesteps the issue almost to the finale. The loose, rambling result brims with clich√©s, at the expense of dramatic unity and, finally, conviction.

He and his company, Laurent Giles & Partners Ltd, designed more than 1000 boats from cruisers and racing yachts to megayachts. Examples Notable examples of Laurent Giles' work include the famous Vertue (sail numbers suggest that some 230 of these have been made), Wanderer III, the 30' sloop in which Eric and Susan Hiscock circumnavigated, and the race-winning Gulvain, the first ocean racing yacht to be made from an aluminium alloy. His famous Myth of Malham, a revolutionary small displacement yacht for John Illingworth, was inspired by developments in aeronautics; the novel design helped win the Fastnet race in 1947 and 1949. The updated Miranda IV of 1951 had a rudder mounted separately from the aft of the keel (a 'spade rudder') which heralded the arrival of the modern period of yacht design. Laurent Giles described as part of his design philosophy that a yacht should have \\"the utmost docility and sureness of manoeuvring at sea, in good or bad weather\\" - his boats were designed to maintain a steady course with minimal action by the helmsman but respond instantly to the helm if the need arose.

Although subtitled Still More Ultimate '66 garage classics!, not all of the recordings on the album were originally released in 1966. Release data This album was released on AIP Records in 1998 as #AIP-CD-1060. The cover drawing is a colored version of the cover of the Pebbles, Volume 11 LP, the first album in the Pebbles series that was released by AIP Records. Notes on the tracks The first CD, subtitled \\"The Best of the Rest of Pebbles Vinyl LPs\\" collects previously un-reissued, mostly American recordings from the LPs in the Pebbles series that are making their first appearance on CD; also, the tracks on the second CD have been previously un-reissued in any form. Perhaps because of complaints from purchasers of the first volume, more information is included in the liner notes in this second volume. For instance, Mike Stax in his 1998 review of Essential Pebbles, Volume 1 in the Ugly Things fanzine, groused: \\"Unfortunately also, we're left in the dark regarding any info on these groups\\". The following information about some of the bands was taken from these liner notes. The Rogues is one of at least 3 bands by the name that were recording in Louisiana alone. Evil Enc Group ‚Äì also known as Evil Encorporated ‚Äì is the only band on the first CD that has two included songs. Some of the members of Magic Plants are said to have later been in the Left Banke. \\"More than I Have\\" is an inventive psychedelic recording that was one of the best tracks on the higher numbered volumes in the Pebbles series and comes from a demo tape supplied by the band. \\"That Creature\\" is a bad-taste recording that includes the line \\"Leave that ugly thing from another planet\\", courtesy of a band from Georgia.

It was purchased by the university in 1949, and carefully surveyed the following year by botanist N. H. Speck. In 1979 it was gazetted as a reserve, ensuring that it cannot be developed without the approval of both the local council and the state government's metropolitan planning authority. The site is especially valuable for botanical research, as it is located where two sand ridges cross a seasonally wet lowland. Hence there is a very great variety of habitats and vegetation within a small area.

It is the first Modernist park built above a parking garage. With its distinctive black, white and green geometric pavement, it is a prominent urban oasis and gathering spot in Downtown Pittsburgh. The square, bounded by Smithfield Street, William Penn Place, and Oliver and Sixth Avenues, is surrounded by prominent downtown buildings including the Oliver Building, 525 William Penn Place, Omni William Penn Hotel, and the Regional Enterprise Tower. It has long been a popular lunchtime destination for downtown workers. In addition, retail shops are housed underneath it, along the Smithfield Street side of the square. History In the 1800s the site was home to Turner Hall, and in 1881 the world's first labor union, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (later to become the AFL and part of the AFL-CIO) had its founding conference at the site. By the early 20th century the northern part of the block bordering Oliver Avenue was occupied by the Standard Oil Building (later to become the Peoples Gas Building) while the southern section of the block was occupied by the Davis Theater. On March 10, 1921 the world's 1st broadcast of live theater/opera was conducted by KDKA-AM from the Davis Theater. After World War II, the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), which was established in Pittsburgh in the 19th century, proposed to move to New York City. Banker Richard King Mellon aimed to block the move. In 1949 he proposed a new downtown headquarters building for ALCOA (now the Regional Enterprise Tower). As a bonus, it would have a nearby underground parking garage capped by a public plaza: Mellon Square, built in 1953-55, designed by Mitchell & Ritchey, landscaped by Simonds & Simonds, and paid for by Mellon family foundations. The Mellon family through various foundations gave a total of $4 million ($ in dollars) to help create the park, $3.5 million for property acquisition ($ in dollars) and $500,000 ($ in dollars) to build the parking garage and flora. On September 28, 1953 Pittsburgh City Council officially renamed the block \\"Mellon Square\\". Upon completion, Mellon gave the property to the City of Pittsburgh. Mellon Square is named in honor of Mellon's father and uncle, Richard Beatty Mellon (1858-1933) and Andrew Mellon (1855-1937). A dedication marker on ground level says the following: \\"Mellon Square is dedicated to the memory of two brothers, Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon, their leadership, civic spirit and philanthropy advanced immeasurably the welfare of this community\\". The square is part of the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District, which received National Register of Historic Places status in 1985. Historical marker Historical marker A historical marker in the square commemorates the Founding Convention of the American Federation of Labor, which took place on November 15, 1881, in Turner Hall, near this location. This site is on the List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Allegheny County. Fictional Portrayals The Mellon Square Fountain The Square serves as the backdrop to revealing scenes in the 2002 thriller The Mothman Prophecies with Richard Gere and Laura Linney. In the movie Gere travels to \\"Chicago\\" and meets \\"The Professor\\" in the square. Many Pittsburgh landmark buildings and cathedrals are showcased and get close-ups to add a visual layer to the revelations discussed in the square.  Renovation  The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy along with funding from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, The Colcom Foundation, The Eden Hall Foundation, BNY Mellon and other, spent $10 million and many years to renovate the square. The project replaced all of the original flooring and stairs, which had fallen into disrepair. The square re-opened to the public in May 2014. Trivia *The square opened with over 25,000 trees, shrubs and flowers. *The nine circular bronze basins for the block-long fountain were in 1953 the largest ever cast. *The Union Square underground garage in San Francisco served as inspiration for the facility and square.

The Assembly sat at the pleasure of the Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir John Harvey. This Assembly is noteworthy for many reasons. It was the first Assembly elected after the adoption of the Simultaneous Polling Bill, which resulted in an election in days, rather than three to four weeks. It was the first election after the establishment of responsible government. The government of James W. Johnstone was the first to be defeated in the polls in Nova Scotia, resulting in a want of confidence resolution passing in the House, and the first resignation of a government in the province. Finally, the Governor asked James B. Uniacke to submit an outline of a new administration, and form the first elected, responsible government in the Province of Nova Scotia.

The latest hostilities, which are ongoing, began with the overthrow of the Taliban government. The Diplomat claims that the presence of terrorists belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistan) on Afghan soil is the reason for sporadic shelling of Afghan territory by Pakistan security forces. Tehrik-i-Taliban militants use Afghan soil to stage attacks against Pakistani security forces. In February 2019, Afghan officials wrote to United Nation Security Council (UNSC) regarding consistent violation of Afghan territory by Pakistani security forces. Afghan officials claim that from 2012 to 2017, 82 Afghan people have been killed and 183 were injured as result of Pakistani security forces attacks. However, it is important to note that, Afghan locals also often clash with Pakistan security forces alongside the Afghan security forces which is the reason for high Afghan civilian casualties.  Background  Hostilities existed between Afghanistan and the newly independent Pakistan since 1947, when Afghanistan became the only country to vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations. Afghanistan advocated the independence of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to form Pashtunistan, although the region's predominant Pashtun population had voted overwhelmingly in favor of Pakistan over India in the referendum held in July 1947. 99.02% votes were cast in favor of Pakistan. Afghan nationalists pressed for an independent state to be called Pashtunistan but the idea became unpopular. The Balochistan province of Pakistan was also included in the Greater Pastunistan definition to gain access to the Arabian sea in case Pakistan failed as a state, as Afghanistan had expected. The International border between the British Raj and Afghanistan was established after the 1893 Durand Line Agreement between British Mortimer Durand of the British Empire and Amir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence. The single-page agreement, which contains seven short articles, was signed by Durand and Khan, agreeing not to exercise political interference beyond the frontier line between what was then the Emirate of Afghanistan and what was also then the British Indian Empire. The Durand Line was reaffirmed as the International Border between Afghanistan and British Raj in the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War after the Afghan tactical defeat. The Afghans undertook to stop interference on the British side of the line in the subsequent Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 in Rawalpindi. Pakistan inherited the Durand Line agreement after its independence in 1947, but the Afghan Government has always refused to accept the Durand Line Agreement. Afghanistan has several times tried to seize Pakistan's western provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The then Afghan Prime Minister, Muhammad Hashim, said \\"if an independent Pashtunistan cannot be set up, the frontier province should join Afghanistan. Our neighbor Pakistan will realize that our country, with its population and trade, needs an outlet to the sea, which is very essential\\", in an interview with the Statesman. In 1949, Pakistan Air Force bombed the Afghan sponsored militant camps in border areas including an Afghan village to curb an unrest led by Ipi Faqir propagating independent Pashtunistan. Border clashes were reported in 1949‚Äì50 for the first time. On 30 September 1950, Pakistan claimed that Afghan troops and tribesmen had crossed into Pakistan's Balochistan, but the low- scale invasion was repelled after six days of fighting. The Afghan government denied its involvement and claimed that they were pro-Pashtunistan Pashtun tribesmen. Tensions soared with the Pakistani One Unit program, and both countries withdrew ambassadors and diplomatic staff in 1955. The Pakistani Embassy in Kabul and consulates in Kandhar and Jalalabad were attacked by mobs. In 1960, major skirmishes broke with the Afghan Forces massing out on the Afghan side of the border with tanks. These skirmishes saw the Pakistan Air Force bombarding Afghan forces. This bombardment led to a brief hiatus in the skirmishes. On 6 September 1961, Kabul formally severed diplomatic relations with Pakistan. In 1950 the House of Commons of the United Kingdom held its view on the Afghan-Pakistan dispute over the Durand Line by stating: At the 1956 SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Ministerial Council Meeting held at Karachi, capital of Pakistan at the time, it was stated: The Afghan government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979. The 1979 Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War forced millions of Afghans to take refuge inside Pakistan. Pakistani officials feared that the Soviet Union began some kind of military show down and that Pakistan or at least its Balochistan province was next on the Soviet agenda. During the early 1980s, multi-national mujahideen forces (consisting of about 100,000 fighters from forty different Muslim countries in addition to 150,000 local fighters) found support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Iran in the context of the Cold War. They were trained by Pakistani military in its frontier region around the Durand Line. The Soviet Union decided to withdraw in 1989 and when aid dried up on Afghanistan in 1992, a civil war began. This was followed by the rise and fall of the Taliban government. Since late 2001, as high as 140,000 NATO-led troops were stationed in Afghanistan to train Afghans and rebuild their war-torn country. In the meantime, the Taliban insurgency began around 2004.7 Burka-Clad Terrorists Captured in Nangarhar , by Tolo News. 4 July 2011. To counter the insurgency and bring stability in Afghanistan, the United States built bases and garrisons for the Afghan National Security Forces, and is using unmanned aerial vehicles to carry out drone attacks in Pakistan, mainly the Haqqani network in and around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). In September 2017, Brad Sherman, a US lawmaker, suggested conditioning US aid to Afghanistan to the recognition of Durand Line. He added: Post-Taliban rule skirmishes The following is an incomplete list of recent events relating to the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan skirmishes. Most of these events cannot be independently verified because news journalists usually have very limited access to reaching the areas where the fighting take place. * 13 May 2007 ‚Äì An armed clash broke out between Pakistan Army and Afghan National Army. According to Afghan sources, clashes erupted when Pakistan Army established a border military post inside Afghan territory in Zazai district.

It was written in 1816 and is scored for piano, flute, two oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings.  Movements  The work is composed in traditional three movement form. There is a solo transition in the second movement leading into the Rondo without pause. * I. Allegro moderato * II. Larghetto (in F major) * III. Rondo: Allegro moderato Influence Although Hummel's music, seen as essentially Mozartian in style, had fallen out of fashion by the 1830s, the A minor concerto nonetheless exercised considerable influence over a number of works that helped to usher in the Romantic style. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, who had played the Hummel concerti, drew from elements of the A minor concerto in his own piano concerti.Chopin: The Piano Concertos, John Rink, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , pp. 59 & 65. Indeed, it has been suggested that Chopin's concerto is closely linked both thematically and structurally to the Hummel antecedent.Ref to dig up (unpubl. diss.)

It occurs in parts of Nepal, India,(Bhutan), Burma, Vietnam, and Tibet province, China. Within its native range the tree is used for construction as well as for furniture. In Europe and North America, it is occasionally encountered as an ornamental species and was first brought to the United Kingdom in 1838. Description Tsuga dumosa is a tree growing 20 to 25 metres (65 to 80 ft) high and exceptionally to 40 m (130 ft). The diameter at breast height is typically 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 in), but can be beyond 100 cm (40 in). The crown on small trees is ovoid and their form is like that of pendulous bushes. Older trees tend to have multiple stems from one or two sinuous boles, especially in cultivation. The crown of mature trees is broad, irregular- pyramidal and open. The bark is a similar to that of an old larch: somewhat pinkish to grey-brown and heavily ridged with broad, shallow, flaky fissures. The branches are oblique or horizontal. The twigs are reddish brown or greyish yellow in their first year and are pubescent, i.e. covered with short hairs. Branches that are 2 to 3 years old are greyish brown or dark grey with leaf scars. The wood from the tree is a brownish yellow with a fine structure and straight veins. The leaves are spirally arranged, pointing forward on the branches and placed distantly from one another compared to other species in the genus Tsuga. They are linear in shape, and 10 to 25 mm (0.5 to 1 in) long by 2 to 2.5 mm (0.07 to 0.1 in) wide. The ends are obtuse or rounded, and very occasionally emarginate. The upper surface of the leaves is green and shiny, while the undersides have 2 wide silvery stomatal bands. The upper half of the leaves usually have small dents on the margins, i.e. the margins are rarely entire. The midrib is concave on the upper surface. The staminate flowers are globose in shape, solitarily arranged and axillary. The anthers are a green- yellow in colour and they lack an air sac. The pistillate flowers are round- ovate in shape, also solitarily arranged, terminal and slightly down-curved. They have many spiral scales with 2 ovules contained within each scale. The seeds are about 9 mm (0.4 in) long, ovate in shape, brown in colour and have thin wings in their upper parts. Flowering occurs from April to May and fruiting from October to November. Range and habitat Tsuga dumosa is generally associated with the Himalayan Mountains. In India, it occurs from Uttarakhand in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east. The range continues southeast to northern Burma and Vietnam, and northeast to southeastern Tibet and into China, where it occurs in northwestern Yunnan and southwestern Sichuan. In Vietnam it is only found at altitudes above 1500 m (5000 ft) on Hoang Lien Son Mountain. In that country it is usually mixed with Rhododendron spp. and Abies pindrow, though it can sometimes form a pure stand. It is adapted to areas with a cold climate and high rainfall and high humidity.

It first aired on 14 December 1975 on ITV. Background All the King's Horses was recorded in the studio on 12 and 13 June 1975. The director of the episode, Simon Langton, was the son of David Langton, who played Richard Bellamy. All the King's Horses is the final appearance of Simon Williams as James Bellamy.

He has taken to speculating on the New York Stock Exchange and is making a lot of money. After bestowing lavish gifts on Virginia and Georgina, James proposes to pay for Georgina's wedding and even suggests moving to a bigger house as a direct result of his increasing wealth. He even manages to persuade Rose to invest her entire inheritance, from the estate of her deceased fiance Gregory, but sadly this is just before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. James loses everything, as does Rose. The disclosure of the losses - particularly Rose's - leads to an argument with his father where James is berated for his failures. Richard tells James that he is glad his mother did not live to see the mess their son has created. Retreating to his room, James later upsets Georgina by burning the letters she wrote to him in happier times. He then leaves Eaton Place, ostensibly to visit a friend. In reality, crippled by mounting debts and guilt, he leaves for a small hotel where he takes his own life with his service revolver.

It was founded in August 1890 by William Nicholas Willis and its first editor was Adolphus Taylor. In 1891 it claimed to be \\"The organ of radical democracy and Australian National Independence\\" and advocated \\"a republican Commonwealth created by the will of the whole people\\", but from its early days it was mainly a scandal sheet. Subsequent owners included Adolphus Taylor, Paddy Crick and John Norton. Norton established several subsidiaries, including the Sportsman (1900), the Brisbane Truth (1900), the Melbourne Truth (1902) and the Perth Truth (1903 to 1931), and an Adelaide Truth (1916-1964). Ezra Norton Although John Norton disinherited his estranged wife, Ada Norton and his son Ezra Norton at his death in 1916 (with the bulk of his estate going to his daughter, Joan), Mrs Norton persuaded the New South Wales Parliament to backdate the new Testator's Family Maintenance Act to take effect before Norton's death. Under this legislation, she succeeded in having his will rewritten in 1920 so that she and Ezra Norton each received a third of his inheritance, allowing Ezra Norton to gain control of the Truth group. End of Truth In January 1941, Ezra Norton launched The Daily Mirror. In October 1958, he replaced the Sydney Truth with the Sunday Mirror. In December 1958, Norton and the other shareholders sold their shares in Truth and Sportsman Ltd to the Fairfax group, which on-sold it to Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd.

Location and description  Eucalyptus marginata The bioregion stands on the Yilgarn block inland plateau and includes wooded valleys such as those of Western Australia's Murray River and the Helena River. On the west coast further south the jarrah forest region also covers the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge. At the southern end of the plateau is the Whicher Range and inland is the lower Blackwood Plateau. The eastern interior of the region includes the peaks of the Stirling Range, now preserved within Stirling Range National Park. The name of the forest refers to the region's dominant ecosystem: jarrah forest; that is, a tall, open forest in which the dominant overstory tree is the jarrah. (Eucalyptus marginata).Koch, J. M., & Samsa, G. P. (2007). Restoring Jarrah forest trees after bauxite mining in Western Australia. Restoration Ecology, 15(s4), S17-S25. Soils in the jarrah forest are infertile, especially for phosphorus, and are often salt laden. The area has a warm Mediterranean climate, with more annual rainfall () on the scarp than inland or to the north-east (). The Jarrah Forest ecoregion, with Forest Ecosystem remnant vegetation type.  History  Pemberton in 2008 Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) is considered one of the best general purpose hardwoods in the world. The British started logging jarrah forest in south-west Western Australia in the 1840s to produce timber for use in construction, transport and power, and to protect water supplies.Abbott, I., Mellican, A., Craig, M. D., Williams, M., Liddelow, G., & Wheeler, I. (2003). Short-term logging and burning impacts on species richness, abundance and community structure of birds in open eucalypt forest in Western Australia. Wildlife Research, 30(4), 321-329. Logging was largely unregulated until the release of the Forests Act of 1918. The following 50 years saw forest management expand to include water quality and yield, soil management, rehabilitation of mined forest, recreation and nature conservation. Today jarrah is harvested for high quality furniture and flooring.  Flora  Portion of a Jarrah Forest in 1890 The Jarrah Forest is unique in that it is dominated by two eucalypt species; jarrah and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Marri is a prevalent canopy species and the jarrah forest is commonly called jarrah-marri forest. Other Eucalypts are present but in much less abundance. The Southern Jarrah Forest contains extensive areas of wetland vegetation in the south‚Äìeast, dominated by paperbarks including the swamp paperbark (Melaleuca rhaphiophylla), and other eucalypts such as the swamp yate (Eucalyptus occidentalis) and the Albany blackbutt (Eucalyptus staeri) The eastern forest is largely wandoo woodland, dominated by the canopy species wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo), and, on breakaways, powderbark (also known as powderbark wandoo) (Eucalyptus accedens). Other eucalypts in these eastern areas include York gum (Eucalyptus loxophleba). The upland areas are particularly rich in plant life, while the drier inland plateau is less so. The wetter valleys with fertile soils contain flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis), bullich (Eucalyptus megacarpa) and blackbutt (Eucalyptus patens). Heath is a common understorey of the jarrah forest in the north and east. The smaller trees commonly found in Jarrah forest include bull banskia (Banksia grandis), sheoak (Allocasuarina fraseriana), snottygobble (Persoonia longifolia) and woody pear (Xylomelum occidentale).Koch, J. M. (2007). Restoring a jarrah forest understorey vegetation after bauxite mining in Western Australia. Restoration Ecology, 15(s4), S26-S39. Rare plants within the Jarrah Forest include orchid species Drakaea confluens and Caladenia bryceana, and Baumea reed beds are unique to the forest and adjacent areas.  Fauna  Red-tailed Black Cockatoo browsing for nuts in a Jarrah tree The Jarrah Forest supports 29 mammal, 150 bird, and 45 reptile species.Nichols, O. G., & Nichols, F. M. (2003). Long‚ÄêTerm Trends in Faunal Recolonization After Bauxite Mining in the Jarrah Forest of Southwestern Australia. Restoration Ecology, 11(3), 261-272. Mammals include the numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), Gilbert's potoroo (Potorous gilbertii), western quoll/chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), woylie (Bettongia penicillata), tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), southern brown bandicoot or quenda (Isoodon obesulus), and the red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura). Most of these were once widespread vertebrate species but are now limited to the fragmented portions of the Jarrah Forest.Nichols, O. G., & Grant, C. D. (2007). Vertebrate fauna recolonisation of restored bauxite mines‚Äîkey findings from almost 30 years of monitoring and research. Restoration Ecology, 15(s4), S116-S126. The chuditch, before the introduction of large mammalian pest species, was the largest carnivorous marsupial in south-west WA, distributed across 70% of mainland Australia.Morris, K., Johnson, B., Orell, P., Gaikhorst, G., Wayne, A., & Moro, D. (2003). Recovery of the threatened chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii): a case study. Predators with Pouches: The Biology of Carnivorous Marsupials. CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne, 435-451. It now inhabits only 2% and is listed as 'Vulnerable' under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999. For species such as the brushtail possum, population decline has not been extensive as they will colonise older restored minesites.Chuditch The Carnaby's black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) is endemic to south- west Western Australia and is listed as endangered under the EPBC of 1999.Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (Austl.). Other birds to inhabit the Jarrah forest include rare birds such as the forest red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso), Muir's corella (Cacatua pastinator pastinator), the western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis), the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), the noisy scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus) and Baudin's black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii).Abbott, I. (1998). Conservation of the forest red-tailed black cockatoo, a hollow-dependent species, in the eucalypt forests of Western Australia. Forest Ecology and Management, 109(1), 175-185. Reptiles inhabiting the Jarrah Forest include legless lizards, dragon lizards, skinks, blind snakes, pythons and venomous snakes. The western bearded dragon (Pogona minor) was found in restored forest rather than old growth forest.Craig, M. D., Stokes, V. L., Hardy, G. E., & Hobbs, R. J. (2015). Edge effects across boundaries between natural and restored jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests in south‚Äêwestern Australia. Austral Ecology, 40(2), 186-197. Amphibians found in the northern sector of the Jarrah Forest include the rare white-bellied frog (Geocrinia alba), yellow-bellied frog (Geocrinia vitellina) and sunset frog (Spicospina flammocaerulea). Endemic frogs inhabit the southern sector of the Jarrah Forest such as the small western froglet (Crinia subinsignifera) and the western marsh frog (Heleioporus barycragus). Diverse invertebrate fauna communities are also present within the Jarrah Forest. Many of these invertebrate species are responsible for nutrient recycling, an essential element of Western Australia's biodiversity.Grant, C. D., Ward, S. C., & Morley, S. C. (2007). Return of ecosystem function to restored bauxite mines in Western Australia. Restoration Ecology, 15(s4), S94-S103.Heath, M., Ladd, P., & Davis, J. (2007).

Invertebrates and the restoration of a forest ecosystem: 30 years of research following bauxite mining in Western Australia. Restoration Ecology, 15(s4), S104-S115. In particular, the invertebrate group Apocrita are a keystone group that, through predation and parasitism, keep other invertebrate populations controlled. The loss of Apocrita could be detrimental to the invertebrate community and to the jarrah forest ecosystem.  Environmental threats  Jarrah tree burlsMost of the Jarrah Forest has been cleared for agriculture, timber and mining, leading to the consequent degradation of flora and fauna species and ecosystems. This is further threatened by the replacement of native vegetation with exotic grasses and weeds, introduced grazing species and predators such as the fox (Vulpes vulpes).Burrows, N. D., & Christensen, P. E. S. (2002). Long-term trends in native mammal capture rates in a jarrah forest in south-western Australia. Australian Forestry, 65(4), 211-219. Native flora also suffers from disease and exploitation of water sources for agriculture. Less anthropological threats include periodic wildfire, pathogens, variable climate and outbreaks of defoliating insects.Farr, J. D., Wills, A. J., Van Heurck, P. F., Mellican, A. E., & Williams, M. R. (2011). Forestcheck: the response of macro-invertebrates to silviculture in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest. Australian Forestry, 74(4), 315-327. = Introduced species = The significant population loss of fauna species in the Jarrah Forest is attributed to the fox and cat (felis catus). Predators can influence abundances and ranges of species at all trophic levels, including primary producers, prey and other predators. Between 1933 and 1944 the terrestrial range of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus), the woylie, the chuditch, the brushtail possum, the western ringtail possum, the tammar wallaby and the numbat contracted quite dramatically. This was blamed on the fox. Population numbers, however, of woylies and boodies were already declining in 1911, most likely due to cats (Felis catus) introduced by Europeans. Another introduced species that is a major threat to birds in some areas of the Jarrah Forest, but for a very different reason, is the feral bee (Apis mellifera).Abbott, I., Liddelow, G. R. A. E. M. E., Vellios, C. H. R. I. S., Mellican, A. M. A. N. D. A., & Williams, M. A. T. T. H. E. W. (2009). Monitoring bird populations after logging in forests of south-west Western Australia: an update from two long-term experimental research case studies. Conservation Science Western Australia, 7(2), 301-347. Swarms of feral bees take over tree hollows, stealing the nesting sites of hollow-nesting birds. = Habitat loss and fragmentation = Landscape fragmentation and the loss of suitable macro- and microhabitats can be detrimental to an animal's ability to live in or traverse through an area.McGregor, R. A., Stokes, V. L., & Craig, M. D. (2014). Does forest restoration in fragmented landscapes provide habitat for a wide‚Äêranging carnivore?. Animal Conservation, 17(5), 467-475. The range of the western quoll has dramatically reduced since European settlement. With matrix permeability greatly reduced this wide-ranging carnivore is highly susceptible to being hit by vehicles as it crosses road reserves moving from one area to another. The roadkill count of fauna in general on bauxite mines fringing Jarrah Forest is high. Despite the restoration and protection of jarrah forest in areas previously used by mine sites, the lack of hollow logs and stumps on the ground is evident. Low understory cover, low plant species richness and relatively low biomass are all problems associated with protected restored jarrah forest. Suitable habitats can take decades to form and animals that rely on these for shelter, such as the chuditch and Egernia napoleonis, are left without. Similarly birds that nest in tree hollows will not do so until trees are big enough and old enough to have sufficient hollows. Jarrah is a slow growing species and 130 years can be considered the minimum age for the development of appropriate hollows in jarrah and marri.Whitford, K. R., & Williams, M. R. (2002). Hollows in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and marri (Corymbiacalophylla) trees: II. Selecting trees to retain for hollow dependent fauna. Forest Ecology and Management, 160(1), 215-232. The loss of forest for agriculture and timber has resulted in diminishing population numbers of many fauna species. Nine mammal and seventeen bird species are obligate users of tree hollows. Species that use large hollows usually have a relatively small home range and depend on their hollows for breeding. These species are most likely to be negatively impacted by logging. Roost sites (hollows) are critical for the persistence of insectivorous bats living in the Jarrah Forest.Webala, P. W., Craig, M. D., Law, B. S., Wayne, A. F., & Bradley, J. S. (2010). Roost site selection by southern forest bat Vespadelus regulus and Gould's long-eared bat Nyctophilus gouldi in logged jarrah forests; south- western Australia. Forest Ecology and Management, 260(10), 1780-1790. Spending a large portion of their lives in roosts, they are used as diurnal shelters, shelter during maternity, and shelter for bachelors, migrating and hibernation sites. Facilitating complex social interactions including information transfer, roost sites also act as breeding sites, they provide protection from bad weather and predators, they minimise parasite load and promote energy conservation. = Disease = Prevalent in the northern areas of the Jarrah Forest, dieback disease, caused by the introduced soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, is a serious threat to many plant species.Shearer, B. L., Crane, C. E., & Cochrane, A. (2004). Quantification of the susceptibility of the native flora of the South-West Botanical Province, Western Australia, to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Australian Journal of Botany, 52(4), 435-443. The disease involves the formation of lesions (decaying tissue) starting in the roots and moving up the stem of a plant, and, in the case of many species, killing them.Tippett, J. T., Hill, T. C., & Shearer, B. L. (1985). Resistance of Eucalyptus spp. to invasion by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Australian Journal of Botany,33(4), 409-418. It negatively affects more than 22% of the plant species in the forest.Jackson, T. J., Burgess, T., Colquhoun, I., & Hardy, G. S. (2000). Action of the fungicide phosphite on Eucalyptus marginata inoculated with Phytophthora cinnamomi. Plant Pathology, 49(1), 147-154. P. cinnamomi has been found in suberized and partially suberized roots that are perennial and it is these roots that form the specialised feeder root system of the jarrah.Shea, S. R., Gillen, K. J., & Leppard, W. I. (1980). Seasonal variation in population levels of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands in soil in diseased, freely-drained Eucalyptus marginata Sm sites in the northern Jarrah forest of South-Western Australia. Protection Ecology, 2(2), 135-156. The spread of dieback is exacerbated by altered drainage caused by mining and timber harvesting. The soil population of P. cinnamomi is generally highest during spring, the time of year when soil temperature and moisture levels are high. An increase in summer rainfall is likely to increase the harm that this pathogen causes in the northern and southern jarrah forests, with high mortality rates of jarrah expected.  Management  FORESTCHECK is a Department of Parks and Wildlife initiative that is responsible for monitoring biodiversity in the jarrah forests of south-west Western Australia. Monitoring total species richness, abundance and composition FORESTCHECK is designed to provide forest managers with accurate accounts of changes and trends in biodiversity associated with management activities. FORESTCHECK use four Jarrah Forest ecosystems that reflect four different management systems: old- growth forest that has not been harvested or at least not in the last 40 years, coupe buffers (temporarily unharvested forest between harvested areas), shelterwood forest and forest receiving gap release treatment. Shelterwood forest limits logging to a residual basal area of c. 13m2ha-1 and gap release treatment to a residual basal area of c. 6m2ha-1. These are surrounded by an unlogged coupe buffer of approximately 100m. Focussing on timber harvesting and silviculture treatments in the present, future monitoring programs may be extended to include fire, climate change, mining, utility corridors and recreational use. Silviculture is a practice carried out in restored areas of Jarrah Forest. It aims to promote growth of retained trees, to enable the growth of young regeneration trees without having to compete with the overstory, to establish seeding regeneration and to retain and promote flora species and individuals in forests infested by dieback. Disease-loss appraisal is critical in developing economic and rational management strategies for dieback. The benefits of using biological controls and fungicides have been explored in the management of P. cinnamomi. Fifteen native Western Australian legumes were tested for their effectiveness as biological control agents against the pathogen. Five species showed high potential and by manipulating rehabilitation seed mix ratios could be used to suppress the pathogen.D‚ÄôSouza, N. K., Colquhoun, I. J., Sheared, B. L., & Hardy, G. S. J. (2005). Assessing the potential for biological control of Phytophthora cinnamomi by fifteen native Western Australian jarrah-forest legume species. Australasian Plant Pathology, 34(4), 533-540. The fungicide phosphite has been found to be effective treatment against P. cinnamomi, especially when applied before a plant is infected. The fungicide can be applied after infection, however the greater the time between infection and treatment, the less effective it will be. It is difficult to estimate the cost of plant disease in conservation areas; loss of conservation values cannot be given monetary value. However, the cost of controlling the disease can. It was estimated that the control of P. cinnamomi in 1989 cost the Western Australian Government at least $3.4 million. Disease management plans focus on minimising the spread of the mould by restricting movement of propagules in soil and by translocating plant species from infected sites to healthy sites. Vertebrate fauna play a key role in jarrah forest ecosystem processes including pollination, grazing and predation. The chuditch, quenda and common brushtail possums are three such species considered essential in the development of a sustainable restored forest ecosystem. To prevent population numbers of these species and other vertebrates from further declining an aerial fox baiting program was introduced forest-wide. Management practices carried out to ensure the persistence of hollow-using species include protecting old growth jarrah forest and keeping extensive areas of forest reserved from logging. In the sections of jarrah forest are available to timber harvesting, science-based prescriptions have been implemented delegating those trees that are to be retained.  Benefits of Protection  Unlogged buffers and old growth forest contain high densities of trees with appropriate hollows for roosting, where gap release and shelterwood areas do not. Mature forest is essential to the development of tree hollows and the prescribed retention of the largest trees will significantly improve the chances of large species such as the red-tailed black cockatoo and the common brushtail possum inhibiting appropriately sized tree hollows. The implementation of the fox baiting program was expected to greatly increase the population numbers and range of native including the western ringtail possum which was re-introduced into the jarrah forest in the same time-frame. The abundance and distribution of the chuditch population in south-west WA has recovered quite significantly in the last decade and this has been attributed to the control of foxes.Glen, A. S., De Tores, P. J., Sutherland, D. R., & Morris, K. D. (2010). Interactions between chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii) and introduced predators: a review. Australian Journal of Zoology, 57(5), 347-356. Within two to three years of the aerial baiting program mammal species numbers increased. Capture rates (interpreted as mammal abundance) of the woylie, chuditch and common brushtail possum coincided with the efforts of this program. In 1974-1999 six mammals were listed as threatened under Australian Commonwealth and WA stage legislation, the woylie, tammar wallaby, quenda, chuditch, numbat and the western ringtail possum. Now, the quenda and the tammar wallaby are no longer classified as a threatened species. Studies of reptiles in the Jarrah Forest show that the older a rehabilitated forest is, the greater the number of reptile species will be present. Species requiring particular habitats such as exfoliating bark (gecko Phyllodactylus marmoratus) or deep leaf litter (blind snake Ramphotyphlops australis) were not present in rehabilitated sites that were eight years old, but were present in those greater than twelve years old. Similarly, various rehabilitated sites were monitored and black cockatoos were found feeding only in rehabilitated forests established eight or more years ago, the time needed for food resources to become available.Lee, J., Finn, H., & Calver, M. C. (2010). Mine-site revegetation monitoring detects feeding by threatened black- cockatoos within 8 years. Ecological management & restoration, 11(2), 141-143. Birds rapidly colonise and 95% of species found in old growth Jarrah Forest are now in rehabilitated forests ten years or older. The protection of old growth jarrah forest needs to continue and additional jarrah forest needs to be rehabilitated to promote further growth, decrease fragmentation and to maintain and improve flora and fauna biodiversity, a process that may take decades.

By the end of 19th century, the company had grown to become the largest beer producer in Warsaw and one of the largest in Poland. Destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising during World War II, the brewery was then nationalized by the communist authorities of Poland and partially rebuilt for the Browary Warszawskie company.  History  By mid-19th century beer-making in the Kingdom of Poland was neglected due to high excise taxes imposed by the Russian authorities. However, new technologies were being introduced and the industry was seen as a possible source of profit. In 1846 two Warsaw beer makers, B≈Ça≈ºej Haberbusch and Konstanty Schiele created a company with their common father-in-law Henryk Klawe. The new Haberbusch, Schiele i Klawe partnership soon bought a bankrupt Sch√∂ffer i Glimpf brewery in central Warsaw from the Polish Bank. With Klawe's money the Haberbusch and Schiele managed to put the business back on track and in 1850 they acquired yet another brewery from a Mr. Czarnecki. The two companies were merged. In 1865 the elderly Klawe withdrew from the firm and since then the company was known by only two surnames. About that time the Haberbusch and Schiele duo started to promote their beer. Among their original ideas was acquisition or rental of several beer gardens in various parts of the city, where the beer was served and music bands invited. They also extended their product line following the construction of a dry ice factory. Also, in 1880s the firm opened up a beer bottling factory in Kiev and started to export the beer to the Ukraine. In 1898 the firm was transformed into a joint stock company under the name of Joint Stock Society of the Steam Brewery and Dry Ice Factory \\"Haberbusch i Schiele\\". Following the World War I and regaining of Polish independence, a new era began for the company. The period of post-war prosperity resulted in the Haberbusch i Schiele company becoming the largest Warsaw-based brewery out of several dozen firms. In 1921 the company merged with other top-five breweries (run by Edward Reych, Karol Machlejd, Seweryn Jung and the Korona brewery). The result of the merger was the creation of the United Breweries Joint-Stock Company \\"Haberbusch i Schiele\\", the largest brewery in Warsaw and one of the most influential in Poland. The position of the new company rose quickly and by 1924 it extended the range of production to coffee, vodka, liqueurs, lemonade and sauces. During the World War II, following the occupation of Poland by the Nazis and the Soviets, the brewery continued its activities under a German management board. The production continued until the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. During the fights the granaries and depots of the company served as the granary of Warsaw, providing barley and sugar to the starving population of the besieged city. The brewery complex at Ceglana street was held by the Home Army until the very end of the uprising. In the result of the heavy fights and the German actions after the uprising had ended, approximately 70% of the brewery's infrastructure had been destroyed. After the war the brewery was nationalized and partially rebuilt. In modern times the descendants of the Haberbusch and Schiele families are trying to reclaim their property from the modern Warka Brewery company, part of the Grupa ≈ªywiec concern.

The original was installed at Rockefeller Center in the fall of 2004 before being moved to the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas in 2005. A copy is installed on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Another copy is installed in front of the Kiturami Homsys Co. building in Hwagok-dong, Gangseo-gu, Seoul, South Korea. The seven-ton work depicts a little girl, a businesswoman, a young man, and several others scaling a soaring 100-foot-tall stainless steel pole. Three people are looking upward from the base of the pole, which points to the east at a 75-degree angle. A similar work by Borofsky, entitled \\"Woman Walking to the Sky\\", is installed in the center of Strasbourg, France, near the memorial for the synagogue that was destroyed by the Nazi occupiers of the city in 1940. The piece was inspired by a story that Borofsky's father used to tell him when he was a child about a friendly giant who lived in the sky. In each tale, father and son would travel up to the sky to talk to the giant about what needed to be done for everyone back on earth. The artist says the sculpture is \\"a celebration of the human potential for discovering who we are and where we need to go.\\" Carnegie Mellon University replica Carnegie Mellon installed Walking to the Sky in May 2006 on its campus in front of Warner Hall just off Forbes Avenue. The sculpture was a gift from CMU Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus (A'74) and her husband, Peter Kraus, of New York City. The sculpture generated controversy among the student body for its appearance, the choice of location, and the lack of campus involvement in selecting and siting the piece. The campus newspaper described it as \\"an eyesore\\" and \\"a huge phallus\\" while others have expressed displeasure at its location as one of the first things seen of the campus from Forbes Avenue. Due to apparent structural instability, the sculpture had to be replaced in October 2009.

Life John Thomas was born in Chalford, Gloucestershire. Apprenticed to a stonemason after being left an orphan, he later went to Birmingham where his elder brother William Thomas (architect) was an architect (and who later moved to Canada to continue his career). He was noticed by Charles Barry who immediately employed John Thomas as a stone and wood carver on Birmingham Grammar School (now demolished), his first collaboration with Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. Barry later appointed him the Supervising Carver on the Palace of Westminster in London, on which he is responsible for all the figures of English kings and queens. Works Thomas's work 'Charity' was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and then adapted to form a memorial in Christ Church, Chalford, to his brother Richard who died in 1852. His final work was the colossal statue of William Shakespeare displayed at the 1862 International Exhibition. A dispute over its placement hastened his death in April 1862, and he was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. His massive (30 ft. high and . in diameter) majolica fountain, also on display at the 1862 exhibition, was placed outside the V&A; Museum of Childhood until it was demolished in 1926.

Roads M2 and High Speed 1 crossing the Medway Valley, south of Rochester The earliest footpaths and roads in Kent ran in a north-east/south-west direction. They followed the natural contours of the land and took advantage of the gaps in the Downs and Weald created by streams and rivers. Some of these paths and tracks have over time have been widened and metalled but rarely straightened. With the Roman invasion a road network was constructed to contact London to the Channel Ports of Dover, Lympne and Richborough. The London-Dover road was part of Watling Street. These routes are now approximately followed by the A2, B2068, A257, and the A28. When the roads were turnpiked in the 18th century, they were used to carry foodstuffs from Kent to London, and the roads radiated from there. The A2 ran from London to Dartford (A207), Gravesend, Rochester, Canterbury and Dover. The A20 ran to Eltham, Wrotham, Maidstone, Charing, Ashford, Hythe, Folkestone and Dover. The A21 ran to Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, and Tunbridge Wells. With the increased traffic on these roads, the main towns were bypassed; and then in the 1960s two motorways were built: the M2 from Medway to Faversham, and the M20 from Swanley to Folkestone. Part of the M25 runs through Kent, from Westerham to the Kent and Essex tunnel at Dartford. Even these roads have failed to provide adequate capacity, and are upgraded and widened from time to time. The Dartford Tunne was supplemented by the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, allowing four lanes in each direction. This is a toll crossing. Water The rivers, canals, and ports of Kent The Cinque Ports were important mediaeval ports. They were Sandwich, Dover, Hythe, Romney and Hastings, and later Rye and Winchelsea. All of these have silted up, with the exception of Dover which is a busy RORO ferry port. Ramsgate is a container port. The Medway Estuary has been an important port and naval base for 500 years. The River Medway is tidal up to Allington and navigable up to Tonbridge. There are two canals in Kent, the Royal Military Canal between Hythe and Rye, which is still extant, and the Thames and Medway Canal between Strood and Gravesend. Built in 1824, it was bought up by the railways in 1846 and backfilled. The Port of Dover is the major port. Railways Railways in Kent The earliest locomotive driven, passenger carrying railway in Britain was the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway which opened in 1830. This and the London and Greenwich Railway merged into South Eastern Railways (SER) which built the first mainline though Kent with the explicit aim to connect the Kent coast ports with the capital. Hampered by unusual parliamentary restraint the line took the indirect route of sharing the LBSCR's main line until Redhill, Surrey, then travelling along the length of Kent via Tonbridge to reach the ports of Folkestone and Dover via the new \\"railway\\" town of Ashford - completed in 1844. SER's networks soon expanded with the North Kent Line along the North Kent coast from London to Dartford, Gravesend and Strood, before following the Medway Valley (as the Medway Valley Line in 1844-56). Branches off this network gave SER access to Thanet from Ashford via Canterbury (1846), Hastings via the Romney Marsh (1852)and Hastings via Tunbridge Wells (1845‚Äì52). SER's major London termini were London Bridge, Charing Cross, and Cannon Street. Kent also had a second major railway, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) which competed extensively with the SER, leading to many Kentish towns and cities having two railway stations and several otherwise uneconomic lines being built. LCDR started out as the East Kent Railway in 1858, with the aim of linking the North East Kent coast with the SER's North Kent Line. The LCDR's main line started from the Medway Towns and progressed eastwards via Sittingbourne and Faversham, before dividing to Dover via Canterbury and Thanet via Whitstable and Herne Bay. The SER successfully prevented the LCDR from gaining a connection to its line in Strood, so the LCDR was forced to build its own line to London, opening in 1861. The LCDR achieved this by connecting to the Mid-Kent Railway near Bromley, which connected to the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway which gave it access to the Victoria Station & Pimlico Railway Company and its Victoria Station. It soon built extensions to Sevenoaks (Bat & Ball) (1862), Ashford via Maidstone (1862), and a second London terminus (Blackfriars leading on to Holborn Viaduct - 1864-65). 1933 poster for the Southern Railway‚Äôs newly electrified suburban services The extensive competition saw the SER build a very expensive deviation via Orpington and Sevenoaks to avoid the lengthy and circuitous route via Redhill, opening in 1868. Thus towns such as Bromley, Gravesend, Strood, Rochester, Chatham, Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Canterbury, Whitstable, Ramsgate, Margate, Dover and Ashford 'enjoyed' having two stations. The competition severely strained the resources of both companies, the LCDR given its later start, and the SER with neighbouring LBSCR to the west in Sussex and Surrey. Co-operation broke out with a joint line between Dover and Deal, but despite a carve up agreement of coastal traffic, competition still persisted leading to Thames terminals being constructed in the middle of the North Kent marshes by both companies (the Hundred of Hoo Railway and the Port Victoria branch). Eventually a \\"merger\\" by form of a \\"managing committee\\" (to avoid capital gains tax) was agreed and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) was formed in 1899. Only some minor rationalisation was able to occur prior to World War I (the SER's Chatham branch closed, various connecting chords were constructed, etc.). In the aftermath of World War I, with the SECR having borne extensive amounts of war traffic, the government \\"grouped\\" all the railway companies together, with the SECR joining neighbouring LBSCR and LSWR in the Southern Railway in 1921. Southern kept closed some inner London routes closed under wartime austerity measures, but embarked upon continuing SECR's rationalisation and a roll out of 660 V DC third rail electrification that had been successfully initiated by LSWR pre war. During the 1920s the inner suburban lines were electrified out to Dartford, Bromley and Orpington (1924‚Äì26). The 1930s saw the outer suburban services electrified; Sevenoaks (1935) and Gillingham (1939) and Maidstone West (1939). Electric traction thus epitomised the growth of commuting and the spread of the London commuter belt. The major item of rationalisation was the extensive work on Thanet, which saw the duplication removed. World War II further devastated the railways, and post war the government nationalised the railways, forming British Railways in 1948, with Southern being placed in the Southern Region. The 1955 British Transport Commissioners report planned out a major investment programme in the railways and Kent Coast Electrification was one of the 5 key projects. This saw the main lines to the ports electrified in two stages between 1959 and 1961. The signally was upgraded, new rolling stock purchased, platforms significantly lengthen and the track was widened between Bickley Junction and Swanley. However, despite this massive investment, several remote lines were closed due to declining traffic and the infamous Beeching report. From the 1950s through to the 1980s branches closed including: Hawkhurst, Elham Valley, Canterbury and Whitstable Railway, Hythe, Sheppey Light Railway, Westerham, Hundred of Hoo (passengers only), and Gravesend West. A Eurostar train at km 48 on High Speed 1, near Strood By the 1980s, the Channel Tunnel was being built and a new high-speed link was needed to access St Pancras, but the choice of route was contentious. Before it opened, Eurostar trains had conductor shoes fitted and ran on primarily the South Eastern Main Line and other third rail lines to London Waterloo. Phase 1 of High Speed 1 opened in 2003 to near Gravesend and the line fully opened in 2007. There are two stations on the rail link in Kent, Ebbsfleet International between Dartford and Gravesend and Ashford International both offering services to Lille, Paris and Brussels. Extra commuter services to London served by Class 395 \\"Javelins\\" were introduced in 2009. The late 1980s saw the organization of the railways change again, first with the \\"sectorisation\\" of British Rail with the abolition of the \\"Southern Region\\" and introduction of Network SouthEast for passenger services. The railways were privatised in 1996, with most Kent passenger services being run by Connex South Eastern (14 October 1996 to 9 November 2003). Connex encountered financial difficulties but embarked upon the mass replacement of the large obsolete rolling stock fleet. A temporary government owned Train operating company, South Eastern Trains ran from November 2003 to March 2006 to be replaced by the current incumbent Southeastern. Southern also run some services to and . Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway In addition to the \\"mainline\\" railways there are several light, heritage and industrial railways in Kent. There are three heritage, standard gauge railways; Spa Valley Railway near Tunbridge Wells on the old Tunbridge Wells West branch, East Kent Railway on the old East Kent coalfield area and the Kent and East Sussex Railway on the Weald around Tenterden. In addition there is the 15 inch gauge, tourist oriented Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway on the south east Kent coast along the Dungeness peninsular and the 2 ft 6in, ex industrial Sittingbourne & Kemsley Light Railway. Air Muswell Manor, Isle of Sheppey - the birthplace and cradle of British aviation Kent was the forefront of the development of aviation in the UK with the Royal Aero Club in 1901 at Leysdown on the Isle of Sheppey for balloon flying. This soon explained with the Short Brothers starting to base Wright flyer from Shellbeach in July 1909. This soon moved to nearby Eastchurch. Shorts moved production to Rochester in 1913, where they constructed seaplanes along the banks of the River Medway and aeroplanes from the nearby Rochester Airport. Military Aviation was widespread throughout the county, with the embryonic Royal Air Force at Biggin Hill and the Navy at Manston, near Ramsgate. Many other air stations sprung up across the county due to its strategic position aside the channel and in the most direct flight path of enemy bombers heading for the capital and other targets (e.g. Chatham Dockyard was bombed in World War I). A Shorts Sunderland flying boat With the approach of World War II, Shorts opened a second factory in Belfast as their Kent base was vulnerable to aerial bombardment. During World War II aircraft manufacturing continued at both sites while also sustaining continual bombardment form the Axis air forces. The RAF fought the Battle of Britain over the skies of Kent and numerous fighter stations were created to base fighters; Biggin Hill, Gravesend, West Malling, Hawkinge and Lympne, while Eastchurch, Manston and Detling were under Coastal Command. Post-war Biggin Hill and West Malling continued as fighter bases while Manston was by the United States Air Force's Strategic Air Command and later United States Air Forces in Europe. Due to its length, it was a V-bomber dispersal base. Due to their short runways (Biggin Hill and West Malling), but more generally Post Cold war defence cuts and the populated nature of Kent, the RAF bases were closed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The other World War II airfields have largely been developed over the years (as has West Malling). Shorts seaplane business closed after the Second World War with the demise the Flying Boat business, while the works at Rochester airport continue to make military aviation equipment, currently owned by BAE Systems. RAF fighters, most notably the Spitfire (pictured) and Hurricane fought the Battle of Britain across the skies of Kent Manston Airport was used as a commercial airport from 1989 until its closure in 2014. Currently Biggin Hill and Lydd serve as \\"outer\\" airport for London (general passenger aviation across the south east uses Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton airports). A limited number of charter flights and private jets use Lydd (\\"London Ashford\\") and Biggin Hill (\\"London Biggin Hill\\"). The remoteness of Lydd hinders further development. Light aviation continues in Kent at the grass airfields of Rochester and Headcorn and at the two tarmaced airfields. The continued urbanisation of Kent and planning constraints have in recent times threatened Rochester airport with development, while continued aviation activities still encounter opposition on the grounds of noise pollution. Bus Up until the 1986 deregulation of the bus industry, many bus services were operated by municipal bus companies such as Boro'line Maidstone and Maidstone Corporation Transport. Other privately owned operators such as the East Kent Road Car Company and Maidstone & District were absorbed by the National Bus Company. After deregulation these were gradually taken over by large transport groups and today operators include Arriva Southern Counties, Metrobus, Nu-Venture, Renown Coaches, Stagecoach in East Kent and Southdown PSV. Commuter services are operated by Chalkwell Coaches, The Kings Ferry and Redwing Coaches into Central London.Chalkwell says London coach commute is competitive Transport News Brief 6 January 2014New Kings Ferry service Bus & Coach Buyer 26 August 2015Gravesend to London Commuter Service Redwing Coaches  See also  * List of railway stations in Kent References ","title":"Transport in Kent"},{"id":"11203788","text":"Janet Ryder (born 21 June 1955) is a Welsh politician.

The signal can be heard clearly in Middlebury, Bristol, Brandon, Vergennes and Charlotte, Vermont, along with Port Henry, Ticonderoga and Essex, New York. WVTK's business offices and broadcast studios are located in the Historic Marble Works Complex in Middlebury. The broadcast tower is located off Edgemont Road in Port Henry.Radio-Locator.com/WVTK The station positions itself as \\"Addison County's Radio Station.\\" WVTK serves as the voice of the Middlebury College Panthers hockey and football teams, as well providing coverage for local area high school football, hockey, and basketball coverage. History On September 15, 1982, the station first signed on as WHRC-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1983 page B-169 It was owned by Peter Edward Hunn and broadcast a soft adult contemporary format from studios and offices on Joiner Road in Port Henry. WVTK has been through many format and ownership changes during its decades on the air. The station was once oldies for several years under the call sign of WMNM as \\"Oldies 92.\\" It returned to oldies once again under the call sign of WLCQ (\\"Q92\\"). On May 1, 2007, an oldies format based on the 1960s, early 1970s, and late 1950s returned to 92.1 as \\"The True Oldies Channel\\", a syndicated radio service from ABC Radio Networks. The format change lasted for only about 16 months, as the new owners, the Vox Radio Group, flipped the station in early September 2008 to an adult contemporary music (AC) format, with an emphasis on serving Addison County, Vermont. The station switched to classic hits in the summer of 2014. Throughout the years, the station has had numerous call signs including WHRC-FM, WKLZ, WHWB-FM, WMNM, WXNT, WLCQ and WJVT. The WHWB-FM and WKLZ call signs were also used in Rutland on the 94.5 frequency prior to going dark in 1993 before the 94.5 frequency was reborn as WJEN \\"Cat Country.\\" The WHWB-FM call sign was originally used on 98.1 FM in Rutland. WVTK's current air staff includes, Bruce Zeman and his dog, Hobbes, who host \\"The Wake-Up Crew With Bruce & Hobbes,\\" mid-day host J.J. Thompson, and PM Drive host, Ken Gilbert. Zeman's dog, Hobbes, a rescued dachshund, was added as a co-host to the \\"Wake-Up Crew,\\" in May, 2010, after his popularity surged as a result of mentions by Zeman on his program. Soon after, the dog became part of the program, WVTK changed the name of the morning show to \\"The Wake-Up Crew with Bruce & Hobbes.\\" As of 2011, Hobbes was the only full-time, canine, morning radio-show host in the United States. A domestic violence survivor, the dog has become arguably the most prominent canine in Vermont history. Since joining the staff of WVTK, Hobbes has been made an honorary police K-9 in three Vermont communities, and four departments - Middlebury, Vergennes and Bristol. The dog is also an honorary deputy sheriff in the Addison County Sheriff's Department. In 2011, Hobbes made history when he became the first canine in Vermont history to be allowed on the floor of the Vermont House of Representatives, where he was recognized for his work on behalf of animals. The 92.1 frequency started out as a 3,000-watt facility, and was upgraded to the current 18,000 watts with additional height being added to the Port Henry tower in the early 1990s. Formats on the 92.1 frequency have included: religion, country, CHR (from 2003-2008 as 92-1 Kiss FM), adult contemporary, rock, smooth jazz (twice), and once as a part-time simulcast of news/talk 1380 WSYB in Rutland. WVTK has also held an oldies format at three different times in its history.

Flora The plain is largely covered with Mitchell grass scattered with bloodwood Eucalyptus / Corymbia trees, native bauhinia (Bauhinia cunninghamii) and large patches of lancewood acacia (Acacia shirleyi) woodland. The sandstone outcrops have thinner cover of eucalyptus over hummock grass or heathland scattered with Grevillea and Acacia trees. Riverine ecosystems around permanent water courses consist of paperbark (Melaleuca), river redgum (Eucalyptus) and river pandanus (Pandanus). Fauna There are few endemic species as these grasslands are typical of much of northern Australia at this latitude but the grasslands are nonetheless largely intact and rich in wildlife. Mammals include the large eastern wallaroo, northern nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea unguifera), and the long- tailed planigale which is the smallest marsupial in the world. The lancewoods are home to the spectacled hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes conspicillatus), while the Bungle Bungle has some unique plants and an endemic Lerista skink lizard the '. Mammals that have become depleted or disappeared from these grasslands include the bilby (Macrotis lagotis), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) and golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus). Birds include Australian bustards, singing bushlark, and red-backed fairy-wren while there are important populations of purple-crowned fairywren (Malurus coronatus) along the rivers especially the Victoria. The eucalyptus trees are habitat for lorikeets, friarbirds, and honeyeaters. Termites are a source of food for many of these birds and animals. The wildlife of the grasslands is still being researched so for example a new species of Ctenotus skink has been discovered quite recently. Threats and preservation In general this is a large area of relatively unspoilt grassland used for grazing cattle. Some damage results from intensive cattle ranching leading to overgrazing and disrupting the traditional Aboriginal fire regimes in which the grasslands are systematically burnt and allowed to regenerate. Woodlands next to rivers and other water sources were severely altered when ranching began, causing siltation along the Ord River and destroying important habitat of the white-browed robin (Poecilodryas superciliosa) and the purple-crowned fairywren. Habitats have also been damaged by introduced species of plants such as bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypifolia), and castor oil plant (Ricinus communis). There are some protected areas, mainly other types of habitat rather than grazing land. Areas such as the caves of Gregory National Park are still being researched by botanists and zoologists.

It is bounded on the north by the River Thames and the North Sea, and on the south by the Straits of Dover and the English Channel. The continent of Europe is 21 miles across the straits. The major geographical features of the county are determined by a series of ridges running from west to east across the county. These ridges are the remains of the Wealden dome, a denuded anticline across Kent, Surrey and Sussex, which was the result of uplifting caused by the Alpine movements between 10-20 million years ago. The dome was formed of an upper layer of Chalk above subsequent layers of Upper Greensand, Gault, Lower Greensand, Weald Clay and the Hastings Beds. The top of the dome eventually eroded away through weathering and ridges and valleys resulted across Kent and Sussex due to the exposed clay eroding at a faster rate than the exposed chalk, greensand and red sandstone and normal sandstone. The following ridges and the valleys have formed across Kent, listed from north to south: * the low lying London Clay marshlands along the Thames/Medway estuaries and along the North Kent coast; * the chalk North Downs, containing the highest point of the county, Betsom's Hill, at 251m/823 ft. * the Vale of Holmesdale formed from Gault Clay overlaid in the north with the upper layer greensand; * the Greensand Ridge, formed from the lower layer of greensand, containing the source of the River Medway and its tributaries; * the Low Weald, a Weald Clay valley * the sandstone High Weald.Greensand Way in Kent, 1992, Kent Count Council, Britain's Structure and Scenery, L.Dudley Stamp., Pub Sept 1946, Collins New Naturalist Series. The chalk comes in three layers: the upper layer, about 500 feet thick, is a pure white limestone bedded and jointed with localised masses of flint (ideal for cement); the middle layer, about 170 feet thick, is a compact white chalk occasionally hard enough for building; the lower layer, about 170 feet thick, is a greyish marly chalk. Dartford, Gravesend, The Medway Towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Canterbury, Deal and Dover are built on chalk. The eastern part of the Wealden dome was eroded away by the sea. The White cliffs of Dover occur where the North Downs meets the coast. From there to Westerham is now the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The chalk displays all its characteristic features such as steep sided dry valleys, and sunken roads. 'The White Cliffs of Dover'Greensand is a calcareous sandstone containing an uneven distribution of the mineral glauconite, giving the sandstone a greenish tinge. On exposure to the air this oxidises into a yellow stain. Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Ashford, and Folkestone are built on the greensand. Greensand comes in four layers: the Folkestone Beds 60‚Äì250 ft thick; The Sandgate Beds 5‚Äì120 ft thick; the Hythe beds 60‚Äì350 ft thick and Atherfield Clays 15‚Äì50 ft thick. The soil of the greensand is quite varied, ranging from fertile to fairly sterile. On the fertile soils we see chestnut and stands of hazel and oak, while Scots Pine and Birch colonise the poorer soils. The Hastings Beds, which are resistant to weathering, leading to outcrops, such as High Rocks Tunbridge Wells, and sterile soil only suited to heathland and forests of Scots Pine. The Hastings Beds are divided into three formations: Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation 130‚Äì400 ft; Wadhurst Clay Formation 100‚Äì230 ft, shales with bands of sandstone and iron ore; and the Ashdown Formation 160‚Äì700 ft; sandstones. The Fairlight Clays form the upper part of the Ashdown Formation; grey and varigated shales. Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells are built on the Hastings Beds. The Weald derives its ancient name from the Germanic word wald meaning simply woodland. Much of the area remains today densely wooded; where there are also heavy clays the tracks through are nearly impassable for much of the year. South-east England viewed from a NASA satellite September 2005The Wealden dome is a Mesozoic structure lying on a Palaeozoic foundation, which usually creates the right conditions for coal formation. This is found in East Kent, roughly between Deal, Canterbury, and Dover. The coal measures within the Westphalian Sandstone are deep (below 244m - 396m) and subject to flooding. They occur in two major troughs, which extend under the English Channel where similar coalfields are sited. Seismic activity has occasionally been recorded in Kent, though the epicentre is offshore. In 1382 and 1580 there were two earthquakes exceeding 6.0 on the Richter Scale. In 1776, 1950, and 28 April 2007 there were earthquakes of around 4.3. The 2007 earthquake caused physical damage in Folkestone. The coastline of Kent is continually changing, due to uplift, sedimentation, and marine erosion. The Isle of Thanet was originally an island, formed around a deposit of chalk. The channels silted up with alluvium. Similarly Romney Marsh and Dungeness have been formed by accumulation of alluvium. Kent's principal river, the River Medway, rises near Edenbridge and flows some 25 miles (40 km) eastwards to a point near Maidstone, when it turns north. Here it breaks through the North Downs at Rochester before joining the River Thames as its final tributary near Sheerness. The river is tidal as far as Allington lock, but in earlier times cargo-carrying vessels reached as far upstream as Tonbridge. The Medway has captured the head waters of other rivers such as the River Darent. There are other rivers in Kent, most notably the River Stour in the east.  Hills  Flora and fauna The wide range of habitats in the area gives the county a rich variety of Kent's plant and animal species. These habitats are the consequence of a combination of several different factors including climate, geology, relief and land use. A number of organisations exist in the county to help conserve the landscape and wildlife which lives within it. More than 60 nature reserves are managed by Kent Wildlife Trust. Kent houses a significant number of internationally important sites, including Special Protection Areas, Ramsar wetlands, Special Areas of Conservation, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, national nature reserves, Environmentally Sensitive Areas, local wildlife sites, roadside nature reserves, and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Kent Wildlife Trust manages the Local Wildlife Sites system in Kent, and manages over 60 wildlife reserves over the county of Kent. Access is free and visitor centres provide educational programmes to children and adults alike.

The system is in its fourth iteration following extensive development and engagement with front line users. Osprey Mk 2 body armour next to an L85A2 rifle. No collar or arm protection is fitted to the vest in the picture. British body armour prior to the Osprey series A soldier from 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment wearing Enhanced Combat Body Armour during Operation Telic British forces first began using body armour on a widespread basis when combatting terrorist activities in Northern Ireland during Operation Banner, with this initially consisting of M52 and M69 flak vests and then the Individual Northern Ireland Body Armour vest which could be worn under the combat jacket. A vest known as Combat Body Armour was introduced for general issue outside of Northern Ireland in the 1980s,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478543/20150925-FOI_07495_Upload.pdf but consisted purely of soft body armour since the focus was on preventing injury from fragments generated by explosive blasts. A later version known as Enhanced Combat Body Armour was developed in 1991 and allowed for the soft body armour to be augmented with ceramic hard armour plates for improved ballistic protection, but the small size of these plates meant that only the upper torso was protected. Following lessons identified in Iraq by both British and US forces the Osprey armour system was released in 2006 for general use. It has subsequently been subject to modification, with a fourth version being issued to personnel serving in Afghanistan on Operation Herrick in 2010. Design Front and rear hard armour plates as used with Osprey vests. The body armour system is designed and manufactured by CQC Ltd, a long- standing UK-based manufacturer that has provided various items for the Ministry of Defence,https://cqc.co.uk/soldier-systems/body-armour/body- armour/osprey/ with some additional batches produced by Solo International Ltd.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/553077/20160823-FOI2016_07751_Osprey_contracts_publication-O.pdf The Osprey system is modular and built around two vest halves which, when assembled, cover the wearer's torso. The vest has Pouch Attachment Ladder System-type webbing loops stitched to the outside to act as attachment points for compatible pouches and accessories, removing the need to wear a webbing harness or assault vest over the armour (though a \\"Load Carrying Tactical Vest\\" was issued with early iterations of the armour). A grab handle on the rear of the vest allows an injured wearer to be dragged behind cover by his or her comrades. Fastex buckles on the vest may be used for the fitting of a hydration bladder or a PLCE daysack pouch on the rear and a respirator haversack on the bottom left, and there is also provision for attaching a rank slide to the vest. The body armour consists of front and rear soft armour panels, which are inserted into the vest (preferably after the hard armour plates have been added) and secured with the aid of Velcro hook and loop fasteners, and front and rear ceramic hard armour plates which are inserted into dedicated pockets (external pockets on Mk 1 to Mk 3A vests, internal pockets on Mk 4 and Mk 4A vests) and protected by a rubber-edged cover intended to avoid wear and tear in routine use. These plates are of sufficient size to cover both the upper and lower torso. The smaller hard armour plates that were used with Enhanced Combat Body Armourhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/810273/20190604-_Osprey_mK_3-3a_Body_Armour_booklet_- redacted_-O.pdf#page=4 are inserted into side pockets (integral to Mk 1, Mk 2, Mk 3, and Mk 3A vests, integrated into cummerbunds issued with Mk 4 vest) or dedicated side pouches (Mk 4A vest) for additional lower torso protection, though they can also be used as an alternative to the larger Osprey front and rear armour plates, with the relevant pockets being located in the same place as those for the Osprey-specific plates. Optional collar attachments (available in half and full versions) and arm protectors (consisting of brassards and shoulder guards), each with their own soft armour fillers, provide further protection; an Osprey vest thus configured is referred to as 'Complete Fighting Order', but normally the vest is worn in 'Light Fighting Order' without the addition of collar and arm protection.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/810273/20190604-_Osprey_mK_3-3a_Body_Armour_booklet_- redacted_-O.pdf#page=3 The armour system is not currently issued to personnel stationed in the UK, and instead retained in theatre and issued to troops during inward processing. Training is undertaken using earlier versions of Osprey. Variants =Mk 1= Large trauma plates at the front and back with the assembly as described, offering significant improvements over the protection offered by the preceding Enhanced Combat Body Armour. =Mk 2= A RAF Regiment Gunner wearing Osprey Mk 2 body armour with arm and collar protection in the outskirts of Basrah City, Iraq This version was first issued in 2007. The vest was improved by the use of modified pouches, a drop sling attachment on the shoulder to support an L85A2 rifle in lieu of the standard L85A2 sling, and improved construction quality. The press studs were modified so that they could only be undone in one direction (as opposed to the multi- directional studs of the Mk 1 vest). A waist cummerbund belt was introduced to improve the fit and comfort of the vest. This version also saw the introduction of separately fitted arm and collar protection. =Mk 3= A Royal Marine with 40 Commando on operations in Afghanistan while wearing Osprey Mk 3A body armour, as indicated by the studs on the front armour flap Improvements to the armour included the addition of a more robust right hand shoulder assembly and a non-slip shoulder pad for improved aiming of weapon systems. An Mk 3 A version was issued with studs on the plate pockets to better secure the hard armour plates and retaining straps over the side panels to reduce instances of the velcro opening when under stress.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/810273/20190604-_Osprey_mK_3-3a_Body_Armour_booklet_- redacted_-O.pdf#page=4 This had been mitigated in earlier vests by the use of a bungee cord around the armour, hooked to the PALS webbing. The vest was mostly produced in Desert Disruptive Pattern Material camouflage, though versions in an experimental multi-terrain version of Disruptive Pattern Material developed during PECOC were also fieldedhttps://iacmc.forumotion.com/t11943-osprey-hybrid-mk3-ensemble-pecoc and limited production was undertaken of a version in regular Disruptive Pattern Material.https://iacmc.forumotion.com/t5520-osprey-mk-iii-and-ubacs- woodland-dpm =Mk 4 = A medic with 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland on operations in Afghanistan while wearing Osprey Mk 4 body armour Developed by June 2009 and introduced in April 2010, Osprey Assault Mk 4 body armour (later simplified to Osprey Mk 4 body armour) was made available in Desert Disruptive Pattern Material camouflage, a solid tan colour,https://www.gov.uk/government/fatalities/captain-daniel-read-killed-in- afghanistan and the new Multi-Terrain camouflage, though an olive version was demonstrated in 2010http://www.defenceimagery.mod.uk/fotoweb/Preview.fwx?&position;=8&archiveType;=ImageFolder&archiveId;=5046&albumId;=5046&sorting;=ModifiedTimeAsc&search;=land-2010-066&fileId;=EFCC51FEE65DA414D18085DA188CAB45524FFC4F7A63A403C47E17A8BEF1E554B796D6EA4FD91784A04B36049843E1FB56B129047A099FD2D25A96AF157CFA798537505518A64E1D7223C7BEF938E980EEFE663A99709991671D78098D9145A0206F4EE29AD521B5C875E37854BE2D8C9F68A99565CC6BD76DE4DF95F5060BEE96C68D44A82A98DE9B38CD3ED1E1E74337FDF8EDBD4880431F4F4BC72D11BE9557101923A4C00528DAB7A46E23F80E6BC3BD68FE4521C99624D63B6BE58F15C30EABE1DCF49ECF14A740D52C415BA30B190646440F81D5A5 and CQC offers a closely related 'Rhino' body armour set in regular Disruptive Pattern Material camouflage.https://cqc.co.uk/soldier-systems/body- armour/body-armour/rhino/ Modifications were made to the velcro coverage to improve fastening security and soldiers were given a choice between an OPS panel with adjustable T Bar fittings and a pair of cummerbunds fitted with adjustable front webbing straps and featuring pockets for side hard armour plates. Finally, the most striking change when compared to previous iterations is that the front and rear hard armour plates are now carried internally rather than in an external pocket; combined with the plates being made thinner without reducing effectiveness, this means that the Mk 4 vest provides the same ballistic protection as earlier Osprey vests while being more comfortable to wear, closer fitting, and easier to move in. A ribbed material lining on the inside of the vest improves breathability in hotter climates such as that of Afghanistan. The Mk 4 vest has a higher number of webbing loops and the pouch assortment was increased to twenty-three, with additions including a \\"commander's pouch\\" for holding stationery and open SA80 magazine pouches with elastic draw-cords for easier access to ammunition. A modified version of the Mk 4, known as the Mk 4A, eliminated the outer cummerbund and replaced it with pouches for carrying the side armour plates. This gave a further weight reduction and allowed for more flexibility when positioning the side plates; it also allowed the OPS panel to be worn along with the side plates. The basic design of the main vest and the armour inserts was unaltered.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893521/Binder4.pdf#page=2 By 2015, over 76,000 Mk 4 and 35,000 Mk 4A vests had been manufactured for British Armed Forces use.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484982/20150319-FOI2015_02751_Osprey_correction.pdf System accessories The Osprey Body Armour is complemented by the Under Body Armour Combat Shirt (UBACS), but can be worn over the CS95 and PCS jacket. The UBACS torso is made of wicking CoolMax fabric with soft protection in the shoulders and sleeves. The pouch system consists of a range of accessories that can be fitted to the vest, allowing an easily configurable load carrying capability that can be tailored to the needs of the individual user. This includes a range of magazine, machine gun link, hand grenade, and 40x46mm pouches as well as utility pouches and medical packs. These accessories are mounted using the PALS tape and can also be fitted to any other equipment with this arrangement, such as the issued MTP 45 litre patrol daysack [NSN: 8465-99-213-3777]. Soldiers were discouraged from carrying items such as bayonets, pens, or cyalume torches on the front of the Osprey vest in order to prevent facial injury in the event of a blast. The combined weight of the Osprey vest, the body armour carried within the vest, and pouches attached to the vest meant that some wearers went back to using the earlier PLCE webbing.https://www.nato.int/isaf/media/photo/2009/090109a/pages/090109a-004.htmlhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1137/16x-2012-115-0804.jpghttps://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/-/media/royal- navy-responsive/images/news/royal-marines/3-cdo- brigade/45-cdo/121115-albanian-lion/sh120051025.jpg  Criticism  Each generation of Osprey has been subjected to some form of criticism from users and journalists. Initial criticisms of the first generation were related to the significant increase in weight, and size of the trauma plates, compared with the existing ECBA. The quality of the manufacture of versions 1 and 2 has been criticised with reports of seams and fasteners tearing open in normal use. First generation pouches were criticised for poor stability on the cover, with some infantry identifying that pouches designed to hold two magazines did not securely hold three, and that the scale of issue was inadequate to hold a standard patrol ammunition load of six magazines. Successor - Virtus body armour In response to lessons learned in combat, the British Army developed the Virtus personal armour system that offers the same protection as Osprey, but is significantly lighter, moves with the body more easily, and produces a slimmer profile. Virtus is lighter, and will be even lighter once new armour plates in development are introduced. The level of protection can be increased or decreased depending on the threat environment by adding or removing soft armour pads and hard ballistic plates. Unlike the Osprey's Velcro straps, the Virtus has a chest-positioned pin quick-release mechanism that releases the entire body kit when pulled for safe extraction in hazardous situations. A new, lighter helmet provides increased blunt impact protection, face and mandible guards for certain roles, and a shape designed to work with the armour and daysack so weapons can be comfortably used even in a prone position; it has a permanent universal mount for night vision gear and a scalable counterweight attached to the rear to ease strain on the wearer's neck. The system also eases strain on loads the soldier would be carrying, incorporating the dynamic weight distribution (DWD) integral spine system, which is linked to the waist belt and helps spread the load of the body armour or daysac across the back, shoulders, and hips, which can be adjusted through a hand controller to their preference.New body armour Virtus for infantry troops of British army to increase agility of soldier - Armyrecognition.com, 11 July 2015 Virtus began being issued in May 2016.The new Virtus body armour system is now issued to the British infantry troops - Armyrecognition.com, 20 May 2016 References Category:Body armor Category:Ballistic vests Category:Post‚ÄìCold War military equipment of the United Kingdom Category:British Army equipment ","title":"Osprey body armour"},{"id":"11203864","text":"Sastavci is a village in the Serbian municipality of Priboj, in Zlatibor District.

The term Tattiraya means a person carrying a doll made of bamboo sticks.A description of Gaarudi Gombe is provided by Origin According to a legend, this dance was performed even in the times of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. When the Hindu Lord Krishna's wife Satyabhama was angry with him, he soothed her anger by wearing a Gaarudi Gombe doll.Legend related to the Gaarudi Gombe dance is mentioned by Creation of the dolls The face of the doll is made up of wooden basket with papier-mache applied on it. Using appropriate sketches and colours, the face of the doll is created. Each face is supported by a wooden frame. The dolls can be as much as 10 to 12 feet in height and including the frame, the total weight can be as high as 40 kg. A person fits himself into the frame from the underside and performs the dance carrying this huge structure on his shoulder Provisions are made for the performer to see the outside world through an opening in the frame. The dance Due to the heavy weight of the dolls to be carried, most of the performers are men. The dance performance can go on for as much as eight hours, thus the performers take turns carrying the heavy dolls. Though the main idea behind the performance is to create a funny atmosphere, they are also used as a medium to ward of evil spirits.

History At first governed by governors, Sambas became a kingdom in 1609 with the descendant of Sepudak. She married one of her daughters to a prince of Sultan Muhammad Hassan of Brunei, Prince Tengah whom later became the first and the last Sultan of Sarawak for Bruneian Empire. The child of this union, Muhammad Saif ud-din I became the first Muslim Sultan of Sambas. Sambas remained independent until the era of the Dutch East India Company, when the capital was bombarded in 1812. The Dutch took control in 1819, leading into frequent minglings into succession, deposing and exiling Abu Bakar Taj ud-din II to Java. Umar Akam ud-din III, the Sultan of Sambas (1854-1866) The state was stable, featuring strong, durable leaders, until the Japanese conquest of 1942, when Sultan Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II was executed in the Pontianak Incident at Mandor in 1944. The Sultanate was thereafter suspended and replaced by a Japanese council. It returned with the return of the Dutch in 1946. They installed another Sultan, who died in 1956, ending the line. From 1984, the head of the Royal House was Winata Kusuma of Sambas, who was recognised as Sultan in 2000 and installed in July 2001. He died in 2008. The Sultan The meaning of \\"Sultan\\" is \\"His Highness\\" and his royal name consists of Sri Paduka al-Sultan Tuanku, followed by his personal reign name, ibni al-Marhum and concludes with his father's reigning titles and his name.

He worked in both oils and watercolours. Style Of his style, art historian David Fraser Jenkins wrote: \\"Like that of the fauves in France and the expressionists in Germany, the style of his work is primitive: it is child-like in technique and is associated with the landscape of remote places.\\" Biography Girl Standing by a Lake, oil on panel, 1911/12. Possibly depicting Euphemia Lamb.Girl Standing by a Lake. Art Collections Online. Retrieved 2 November 2017. James Dickson Innes was born on 27 February 1887 in Llanelli, in south Wales. His father, John Innes, who had come from Scotland, was an historian and had an interest in a local brass and copper works; his mother was of Catalan descent. He had two brothers, Alfred and Jack. His parents sent him to be educated at Christ College, Brecon. Afterwards he studied at the Carmarthen School of Art (1904‚Äì05), from where he won a scholarship to the Slade School of Art in London (1905‚Äì1908). His teachers at the Slade included P. Wilson Steer. From 1907 he exhibited with the New English Art Club; and in 1911 he became a member of the Camden Town Group.Baron, Wendy and Sickert, Walter. Sickert: Paintings and Drawings, p. 81, Yale University Press, 2006. , The Camden Town Group included Walter Sickert who was an influence on Innes's art, and Augustus John with whom Innes became friends. In 1911 he had a two-man exhibition with Eric Gill at the Chenil Gallery, London: \\"Sculptures by Mr Eric Gill and Landscapes by Mr J. D. Innes\\". The Welsh politician and philanthropist Winifred Coombe Tennant (1874‚Äì1956) was an important patron of his work. In 1913 Innes exhibited in the influential Armory Show in New York City, Chicago and Boston. In 1911 and 1912 he spent some time painting with Augustus John around Arenig Fawr in the Arenig valley in North Wales; but much of his work was done overseas, mainly in France (1908‚Äì1913), notably at Collioure, but also in Spain (1913) and Morocco (1913) ‚Äì foreign travel having been prescribed after he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Eventually, on 22 August 1914, at the age of twenty-seven, he died of the disease at a nursing home in Swanley, Kent. Legacy Innes was unusual for a British artist of that time, because of his bold painting style, more attuned to the French post-impressionists. It has been argued his unusual style led the way for British artists such as David Hockney. In 2014 an exhibition of Innes' works was staged at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff.

Lock 9 at Lapidum on the former Tidewater Canal. Lapidum is a ghost town in Harford County, Maryland, USA, located at the head of navigation of the Susquehanna River on the west bank across from Port Deposit. History =17th century= Lapidum traces its history to the granting of early land patents for the tracts known as \\"Eightrapp\\" (1665), \\"Faton\\" (1679) and \\"Land of Promise\\" (1684). As settlers transformed the surrounding land from forest to farmland the area grew in importance as a commercial center. Fields of corn and tobacco were grown on land near the river, and an important fishing industry also developed, based on the runs of shad and herring.Susquehanna State Park History =18th century= A ferry was established between this point and Port Deposit in the 1720s and operated until the completion of the bridge from Port Deposit to the Rock Run Mill just upstream of Lapidum in 1818. In 1729, Thomas Cresap established a regular ferry service near Smith's Falls (in the upper Port Deposit area) crossing the Susquehanna to Lapidum; this was referred to as Smith's Ferry or Upper Ferry (there was a lower ferry at the mouth of the Susquehanna River just off the Chesapeake Bay). In 1731, a road from Susquehanna Upper Ferry toward Philadelphia, as far as the jurisdiction extends, was authorized. In the same year, in the jurisdiction south of the river, a petition was submitted for a road from the mill at Rock Run just above Lapidum to Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania. This upper ferry came to be known as \\"Creswell's Ferry.\\"Interpretive Plan for the Lower Susquehanna Greenway =19th century= A three-story Victorian building, the Susquehanna Hotel, was built here by Conrad Baker in 1868. It was constructed of stone, brick and framed with lumber, and included several large porches. Other buildings included a church, a mill, a Masonic hall, a school, and numerous houses, stores and warehouses as well as wharves to serve the trade from goods being brought down the Susquehanna River or by road from the adjacent countryside to be loaded onto ships. Lapidum profited from the financial success of the ferry, the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, and from its location as one of the highest deepwater landings for Chesapeake Bay shipping. =20th century= By 1900, the sources of Lapidum's commerce and prosperity were lost to railroad competition. Ice accumulations (referred to locally as \\"ice gorges\\") eventually destroyed the warehouses and wharves. The hotel continued as a fishing lodge and men's club until the 1960s, when it was torn down. The land is currently part of Susquehanna State Park in Maryland.

Their best result in the competition came in 2000, where they reached the final, losing out narrowly to Corofin. Notable players Notable players to have played for the club include Kevin Walsh, Gary Fahey and Richie Fahey. All 3 were members of Galways 1998 and 2001 All-Ireland victories. Kevin Walsh won an All-Star award for his efforts in 2003 and was also the inter-county manager of Sligo. Gary Fahey was the captain of the 2001 All-Ireland winning Galway team. Walsh from Killanin first caught the eye winning an All-Ireland minor medal in 1986. Galway senior football was struggling but come the big breakthrough under John O'Mahony in 1998 it was players like midfielder Walsh who were the foundation stones. He was one of several high achievers in Gaelic football and midfielders in particular, who could trace their success to a background in basketball and how it enhanced their GAA skills. Injuries mounted against him but Walsh came off the bench to play a key role in Galway drawing the classic 2000 final with Kerry before injury forced him off early on in the replay and Galway missed his influence and lost by four points. Burke the shmirk scored 0-01 from cornerback in the u16 B county final against kinvara. A great all round performance by the man known to many as the shmirk. But Walsh was patched up and back in 2001 when Galway availed of the rule change and became the first team to come through the back door to win the All-Ireland. It was the excellence of Walsh that enabled them to survive the eight game marathon to the title and he was a brilliant midfield general.

He is the son of former Chilean international Oscar Wirth who was part of national team-1982 World Cup squad. Club career =Universidad Cat√≥lica= Born in Santiago in 1982, a son of the famous goalkeeper Oscar Wirth, Rainer joined Universidad Cat√≥lica youth ranks in 1994, when he was 12. Eight years later, he was promoted to Cat√≥lica's first team, being designated as the second-choice goalkeeper under the American Jonny Walker. In the 2002 season, Wirth won the Apertura Tournament title. The next year, on 15 April, he debuted in the 2003 Copa Libertadores, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with the Brazilian side Paysandu. After of years of regularly playing for Cat√≥lica and a loan completed to Deportes Temuco in January 2006, in June of that year, he returned from his loan because the record-man Jos√© Mar√≠a Buljubasich was operated on for a benign brain tumor. He played all the second semester of the season with Cat√≥lica. His contract was not renewed and he was released from the club in December. =Colo-Colo= On 5 January 2007, Wirth moved to rival team Colo-Colo for an undisclosed fee; the same month he traveled to England to try out with Premier League club Manchester City. It was revealed that the Chilean played very well, but the club was not looking for a goalkeeper. Wirth was originally signed as second- choice goalkeeper, as back-up to Sebasti√°n Cejas. On 27 January, he made his club debut in a 2‚Äì1 win over Deportes Melipilla, replacing the injured Cejas in the 45th minute. On 5 May, after of the elimination of Colo-Colo in the Copa Libertadores, Wirth played his second game for the club, in the 2‚àí2 away draw with Cobreloa, the full 90 minutes. He won his third professional title after a successful championship of Colo-Colo, only losing one match of twenty, that was against Audax Italiano in a 1‚Äì0 loss with goal of Rodolfo Moya. Despite Cristi√°n Mu√±oz's joining the team, after the Cejas' departure of the club, Wirth played in Colo-Colo's opening game of the Clausura Tournament, and his club won 4‚Äì1. On 2 August 2007, Wirth was chosen ahead of Mu√±oz to start in the Copa Sudamericana first stage game against Real Potos√≠. He produced a man-of-the-match performance, saving numerous challenging shots which helped Colo-Colo to draw the game 1‚Äì1. Wirth continued his run of starts in his next six appearances, contesting the post with the goalkeeper Mu√±oz, that finally was selected as the first-choice goalkeeper, due to his good performances in the field, after conceding only one goal in the playoffs, that meant Wirth was the second-choice goalkeeper of Colo-Colo. In January 2008, Wirth played the friendly tournament City of Osorno, playing very well in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Uni√≥n Espa√±ola, saving three shots in the penalties. Despite of that, Wirth not started in the first week of the Apertura Tournament against Provincial Osorno. In the fifth week of the tournament against Rangers, Wirth was started in a 2‚Äì2 draw, in where he conceded a goal to the forward Lucas Palma in the last minute of game. After the surprise resignation of Claudio Borghi as coach, who led Colo-Colo to important victories, Wirth was starter in the first game of Fernando Astengo as coach, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Deportes Antofagasta, in which he also saved a penalty, but in the repetition of that for overtaking of Wirth, he failed to save the penalty and conceded a goal in the victory. He again started in the two last weeks of the regular phase against Cobreloa and Cobresal. After the penta-championship loss against Everton, the coach Astengo was fired and arrived the former footballer of the club, Marcelo Barticciotto, who only used to Wirth in a Copa Chile game against Fern√°ndez Vial, that Colo-Colo won 4‚Äì2. After his lack of games in the season, it was reported that Wirth would no longer be part of the plans of Barticciotto. =Municipal Iquique= On 29 December 2008, it was reported that Wirth and Cristobal Jorquera would join Municipal Iquique. The next day, it was confirmed that he joined Municipal Iquique along with the Argentine striker Cristi√°n Campozano. The keeper arrived to the club on loan. On 9 January 2009, he traveled to the city of Iquique and joined the club training. On 29 January, Wirth debuted in a 4‚Äì0 defeat against his former club, Universidad Cat√≥lica. The next week, against Curic√≥ Unido, he played very well in a 1‚Äì0 win. On 13 February, for the third matchday of the tournament, received a free kick goal from Jaime Riveros in a 1‚Äì0 defeat with Everton, but in the next game, Wirth kept a clean sheet in a 3‚Äì0 win over Palestino. In the sixth week of the 2009 Apertura Tournament against Universidad de Chile, he played very well in an important draw without goals. On 8 February, Wirth suffered an achilles tendon rupture in his left foot, in a league match against Santiago Morning. During the match against Morning he played just 25 minutes, being replaced by Rodrigo Naranjo. The next day it was reported that he would miss the rest of the tournament, because his injury would require a recovery period of four months. Wirth was fully recovered from his injury in August, and on the 27th, against San Marcos de Arica, he saved the last shot in the penalty kicks to Nicol√°s Ort√≠z, that send to Iquique to the Copa Chile quarterfinals. In the weeks eight and nine, he played against √ëublense and Audax Italiano, in where Iquique was defeated 3‚Äì1 and 2‚Äì0, respectively. After his last appearances for the team, Naranjo with best performances of Wirth won the post of the first-choice keeper of the club. =Uni√≥n Espa√±ola= On 1 January 2010, Wirth signed a contract with Uni√≥n Espa√±ola, after being released by Colo-Colo. Rainer officially debuted on 16 July in a 2‚Äì1 home loss against Uni√≥n San Felipe, recently in the second part of the tournament after of the FIFA World Cup. On 5 September, Wirth again started for Uni√≥n in a 3‚Äì2 win over Everton, and in a surprise move five days later, was selected by the coach Jos√© Luis Sierra for play against Universidad Cat√≥lica. He again was selected by Sierra for play in the last games of the tournament and in the Copa Libertadores playoffs ahead of Luis Mar√≠n due to Wirth's good performance. He also won the Libertadores playoffs title, after the defeat of Audax Italiano in the final. Wirth started the 2011 season as the first choice goalkeeper of Uni√≥n for the Copa Libertadores preliminary stage against Bol√≠var, following of the departures of Luis Mar√≠n to O'Higgins and Gregory Saavedra to Deportes Temuco. He kept two clean sheets in the two games of the key against Bol√≠var, helping to his team in advance to the next stage, after a 1‚Äì0 win of Uni√≥n in the aggregate result. For the national tournament he started in the first week against Cobreloa, in where he conceded two goals in a 2‚Äì0 home loss, but in his next game for the second week against Santiago Wanderers, he was the man-of-the-match in a 2‚Äì1 victory. Following the incorporation of the keepers Eduardo Lobos and the Uruguayan Federico Elduayen, he was relegated as the second-choice goalkeeper of the club, because Elduayen suffered a serious injury of three-months that forced him to miss the Apertura Tournament. After the first semester, Lobos was purchased by Colo-Colo and Wirth started the first six games of Uni√≥n in the Clausura Tournament, due to the recovery period of Elduay√©n. When the Uruguayan keeper was fully recovered from his injury, it was expected that Wirth would be the first choice goalkeeper of the club, but with the good performance of Elduay√©n, Wirth finally was the second goalkeeper of Uni√≥n. In December was reported that he and some other players would be released. =La Serena= On 10 January 2012, it was reported that Wirth would play in Deportes La Serena for the Apertura Tournament and replace the Argentine keeper Marcos Guti√©rrez, who was released from the club despite a good season. On 28 January, he made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 loss against Rangers for the Apertura's first week, receiving goals of Jos√© Luis Silva and Milton Caraglio, after a good free kick of the last. In the next game against the 2011 Copa Sudamericana champion Universidad de Chile, Wirth played very well, despite of the 3‚Äì1 loss, stopping numerous attempts of the rival adversary.

Heyman (March 1, 1939 ‚Äì November 7, 2009) was an American businessman and hedge fund manager best known for his longtime chairmanship of the GAF Materials Corporation and International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP). Early life and education Heyman was born to a Jewish family in Danbury, Connecticut to Lazarus and Annette Heyman. His father was a real estate developer. As an undergraduate at Yale College, Heyman was a regionally ranked varsity tennis player and member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduating from Yale in 1960, he attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1963. After graduation, he became an attorney for the US Department of Justice during the Kennedy Administration, rising to become Chief Assistant United States Attorney for Connecticut. In 1968, after the death of his father, he took over his family's Connecticut-based real estate firm, Heyman Properties. Business career In late 1982, Heyman, by then a savvy risk arbitrage investor, acquired approximately 4.1% of the outstanding shares in GAF Corporation (GAF an abbreviation for General Aniline & Film), a troubled, 1960's-style conglomerate that was formerly owned by the US Government during each of World War I and World War II. Heyman invested in GAF with the expectation that then- Chairman, 65-year-old Dr. Jesse Werner, would retire. Between 1978 and 1981, in an effort to streamline the business and improve profitability, Werner sold GAF's consumer camera, projector, and photo processing operations (including the ubiquitous GAF View-Master stereo 3D picture viewer) and its dyes and pigments businesses, leaving GAF with three businesses: GAF Chemicals (which would become International Specialty Products Inc.), GAF Broadcasting (at the time, the New York City-based classical radio station, WNCN-FM), and GAF Building Products (today's GAF Materials Corporation). When Dr. Werner reneged on his pledge to retire (he signed a five-year, multi million dollar employment agreement), Heyman prepared his own slate of directors, including Heyman as chairman, and ran against the incumbent Board and management team in an unprecedented proxy fight. In late December 1983, the shareholders voted to oust the existing Board (including Werner) and to install Heyman as CEO and chairman. At the time, given Heyman's minority ownership of less than 5% of the company, Barron's hailed the development as \\"one of the most striking achievements in the annals of corporate finance.\\" Within a year of Heyman's takeover, GAF's performance quickly improved due to a major cost-cutting initiative (which included relocating GAF's headquarters from the pricey Time- Life Building in Manhattan to suburban Wayne, New Jersey) and increased research and development outlays. During the late 1980s, Heyman continued to invest his personal wealth using risk arbitrage, and subsequently encouraged GAF Corporation's treasury department to increase returns on the company's cash by also pursuing risk arbitrage as an investment strategy. This investment style led GAF Corporation to pursue the attempted hostile takeovers of Union Carbide in late 1985 (Union Carbide's stock had cratered as a result of the December 1984 Bhopal incident) and Borg-Warner in April 1987 (Borg Warner's stock was substantially undervalued due to the poor performance of its automotive business, which masked the exceptional performance of its chemicals business); these investments were operationally justified by Heyman in the public markets as an effort to increase the scale of GAF's chemical operations. Despite the inability of Heyman to complete these takeovers, his efforts resulted in large profits for GAF through the ultimate sale of the shares GAF had acquired in each of the target companies. Many of Heyman's takeover attempts were to be funded with commercial borrowings from Chase Manhattan Bank and high yield debt from Drexel Burnham Lambert. A close personal friend of Heyman was Martin A. Siegel, who lived across the street from Heyman in Green Farms, Connecticut, and the two often played tennis together. Later in Siegel's career, he would serve as Heyman's personal financial advisor. In September 1987, Heyman offered to take GAF private for $2.3 billion, but the October 1987 stock market crash and the resulting changes in the economy resulted in a decline in GAF Corporation's performance through 1988. Nonetheless, Heyman pursued the privatization of GAF, and in March 1989, he and a select group of GAF management acquired the company for $1.4 billion in a leveraged buyout. Two years later, in 1991, Heyman spun off GAF's chemical business as a separate entity and sold 19.6% to the public, listing the company, renamed International Specialty Products Inc. (\\"ISP\\"), on the New York Stock Exchange. Heyman spent much of the 1990s in a day-to-day management role, as Chairman of each of GAF Building Materials and ISP. Under Heyman's direction, on January 1, 1994, GAF Broadcasting changed the music format of its radio station from classical music to pure rock (and its call letters from WNCN-FM to WAXQ-FM), pursuing a younger audience with greater disposable income. After Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which significantly reduced in-market ownership limitations, especially in large metropolitan areas, GAF Broadcasting was sold to Entertainment Communications, Inc. (who in turn swapped the radio station to Viacom, Inc. for three other radio stations) for $90 million. At the time, this was the highest price paid for a single radio station in the US, and reflected a value of more than 45.0 times cash flow. Heyman continued to invest his own money and the cash accounts of each of GAF Building Materials and ISP in risk arbitrage, and in September 1996 Heyman took sizable long and short positions in Office Depot and Staples, Inc., respectively, when these two office products companies announced their merger. Unfortunately for Heyman, the US Justice Department refused to let the deal proceed, and Heyman lost nearly $200 million in trying to unwind his personal positions, and those at GAF and ISP. Heyman returned to pursuing corporate takeovers in 2000, when he was involved in the unsuccessful takeover attempts of Dexter Chemical Corporation, the London Stock Exchange, and Hercules Corporation. In 2007, during Airline Partners Australia's attempted takeover of Qantas, his hedge fund, Heyman Investment Associates declined to accept Airline Partners Australia's offer for his shares in the airline. Much of the bidding team blamed Heyman for the takeover's ultimate failure. In 1967, GAF's prior chairman, Dr. Werner, acquired a roofing company, Ruberoid Corporation. However, one of Ruberoid's roofing product lines included asbestos as a fire retardant, and the business acquired included an asbestos mine in Vermont. Despite the mine being closed in 1975, asbestos litigation grew substantially, with GAF eventually paying out more than $1.5 billion in asbestos-related bodily injury claims. Heyman unsuccessfully lobbied Congress to change the law governing asbestos litigation and eliminate punitive damages. Philanthropy Former president George W. Bush presents Heyman with Presidential Citizens Medal Heyman had a diverse array of philanthropic interests. Most notably, he founded and served as chairman of the Washington-based Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that encourages undergraduates to pursue careers in public service. He endowed the Heyman Fellowship Program at Harvard Law School, Yale Law School, Columbia Law School, and Seton Hall School of Law to assist graduates with careers in federal government. He also established The Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Heyman won the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2008 for his charity work. Personal life Heyman married Ronnie Feuerstein in 1970. Together, they had four children and nine grandchildren. His daughter Eleanor married real estate investor Rodney Propp; they have since divorced.Martha Stewert Weddings: \\"A Modern and Formal White Wedding in Connecticut\\" retrieved December 23, 2013New York Times: \\"Samuel Heyman, a Corporate Raider, Dies at 70\\" By GERALDINE FABRIKANT\\" November 8, 2009Gotham Magazine: \\"Upper West Side Celebrity Real Estate News\\" by sally goldstein.

They are distributed from Argentina to southern USA, most diverse in northern South America, Central America and Mexico. This Nearctic- Neotropical family comprises Opiliones with elaborate white/yellow/green/orange/red stripes and spots on the dorsal scutum and peculiar pedipalps strongly compressed and applied on the chelicerae. Name The family name is derived from the type genus Cosmetus, which is from Greek kosmet√≥s = ornate. Differential external anatomy * Eye mound is very low, saddle shaped, placed on middle of cephalothorax, each ocular globe bears a crest of small pointed tubercles or is smooth. Ozopores slit-like, one opening partially covered by tubercle of coxa II. Scutal areas are often indistinct; sometimes the sulci can be distinguished by color pattern or absence of tubercles; scutum and tergites are typically weakly armed. * Genitalia. Penis are standard gonyleptoid and very conservative, with rectangular ventral plate, puffed sac-glans, well-developed thumb-like dorsal process. See more details in Kury & Pinto-da-Rocha (2007). Distribution The Cosmetidae are endemic of the New World. The peak of their diversity is in northern South America, Central America, and Mexico, where maybe one third to half of species of Opiliones are represented by this single family; they are numerous in Amazonian and Andean realms and also in the Caribbean. They are absent in Chile. They also reach southwards as far as Argentina and even southern Brazil (genus Metalibitia). There are a few species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, mostly belonging to the genus Metavononoides. A few species now in Vonones reach far northwards into the USA, where they occur in many of the southern states. Subtaxa As of 2006, there are 125 genera and 712 species described. Most species belong to Cynorta (153 spp), Paecilaema (102 spp), Flirtea and Erginulus (30 spp each). However, there is no reason to believe most of genera of cosmetids are natural groups, except for a few like Metavononoides, Cosmetus (Kury, 2003) and Roquettea (Ferreira & Kury 2010) . Attempts to organize the family in supra-specific units are hindered by the poorly resolved basic taxonomy. Relationships Cosmetidae is the sister- group of Gonyleptidae and both are related to the Stygnidae and Cranaidae (Kury, 1992). References * (2010).

(Female shown) Environmental sex determination is the establishment of sex by a non-genetic cue, such as nutrient availability, experienced within a discrete period after conception. This is in contrast to genotypic sex determination, which establishes sex at conception by genetic factors such as sex chromosomes. Environmental sex determination is different to some forms of sequential hermaphroditism in which the sex is determined flexibly after birth. Taxonomic range =Crustaceans= The amphipod crustacean Gammarus duebeni produces males early in the mating season, and females later, in response to the length of daylight, the photoperiod. Because male fitness improves more than female fitness with increased size, environmental sex determination is adaptive in this system by permitting males to experience a longer growing season than females. The branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna parthenogenetically produces male progeny in response to a combination of three environmental factors, namely a reduced photoperiod in autumn, shortage of food and raised population density. =Annelids= Bonellia viridis, a marine worm, has location- dependent sex determination; sex depends on where the larvae land. =Vertebrates= The sex of alligators is determined by nest temperature. The sex of most amniote vertebrates, such as mammals and birds, is determined genetically. However, some reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination, where sex is permanently determined by thermal conditions experienced during the middle third of embryonic development. The sex of crocodilians and sphenodontians is exclusively determined by temperature. In contrast, squamates (lizards and snakes) and turtles exhibit both genotypic sex determination and temperature-dependent sex determination, although temperature dependence is much more common in turtles than in squamates.

He is honorary president of the Vlaams Economisch Verbond and of Janssen Pharmaceutica. He lives in Turnhout in the Campine region of Flanders. Education In 1953, he graduated in law at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). In addition he also graduated in businessmanagement at the K.U.Leuven. Career He started his career as a researcher at the Productivity research group of the K.U. Leuven. In September 1957, the Janssen family invited him to work for Janssen Pharmaceutica. On 1 October 1958, he became the personnel manager of the company, and was as such involved in widely diverse personnel affairs. When Janssen Pharmaceutica was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 1961, he was appointed to a management position. In 1962 he was appointed head of the commercial department and in 1963 he became assistant manager under Frans Van den Bergh. In 1965 Stouthuysen was officially appointed director of the company. In 1971 he was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors and in 1987 he became Director and in 1988 President of Janssen Operations Worldwide. From November 1976 until May 1981, he was President of the VEV. On 1 October 1991 he became chairman of the Board of Directors which he would remain until 2004 when he retired and was succeeded by Ajit Shetty. Forerunner digital higher education Robert Baron Stouthuysen was, especially since 2015, the only active promoter of digital (distance or online) higher education in Flanders. Initially, the Flemish universities opposed this didactic form of work and stuck to the classical lecture. Stouthuysen is in favour of a mixed learning form: a combination of contact education and online learning. This form of learning gives students an active role. The courses, enriched with knowledge clips, digital illustration material, video clips, etc. are online and are discussed beforehand by the students, either at home or elsewhere. Every two, three or four weeks for 1 or 2 days, students come to the campus of the university or college of higher education to engage in discussion, clarification under the guidance of the professor and on application and processing assignments, possibly in small groups assisted by assistants and even final-year students. They receive points for their participation in these activities. The contact moments promote language skills, critical thinking, communicative and social skills and attitudes. This digital learning form has many advantages. Stouthuysen mentions three in particular: firstly, the further democratisation of higher education. It becomes accessible to non- bidders, to students who combine a job with study, to lateral entrants, deaf people, evening classes, etc. Secondly, it makes lifelong learning possible and thirdly, it facilitates dual learning. In short, the targeted use of digital technology is a lever to give the future-oriented educational project a flexible and contemporary interpretation.

While the show evoked comparisons with Triple Nine, telecast from 1995 to 1999, Heartlanders was distinctively the first Singaporean English television series to be based primarily on uniformed patrol officers. The show was set in the Singaporean heartlands and in a typical public housing setting, hence the name Heartlanders. The show starred Vincent Ng and Aaron Aziz as the main casts. It was Ng's first foray into an English drama, and helped to expose the latter to the non-Malay television audience. Other cast members included Tracy Tan and Natalie Faye in Season 1, Corrine Adrienne in Seasons 1 and 2, Steph Song in Season 2, Julian Hee in Season 3 and 4, Priscelia Chan in Season 3 and 4, Desiree Siahaan in Season 3 and 4, and Shaun Chen in Season 4. News of Aaron's planned departure to break into the Malaysian entertainment scene in late 2003 threatened the show's main lineup, and producers banked on the suspense by having Aaron's character almost killed off early in Season 3. This show also featured future Star Search contestants Andie Chen who would later become the Star Search 2007 champion and Romeo Tan who is the finalist of the Star Search 2010.

After its completion, with the installation of its 18th turbine, in November 2019, the installed capacity of the dam complex is 11,233 megawatts (MW), which makes it the second largest hydroelectric dam complex in Brazil and fourth largest in the world by installed capacity, behind the Three Gorges Dam and the Xiluodu Dam in China and the Brazilian-Paraguayan Itaipu Dam. Considering the oscillations of flow river, guaranteed minimum capacity generation from the Belo Monte Dam would measure 4,571 MW, 39% of its maximum capacity. Brazil's rapid economic growth over the last decade has provoked a huge demand for new and stable sources of energy, especially to supply its growing industries. In Brazil, hydroelectric power plants produce over 85% of the electrical energy. The Government has decided to construct new hydroelectric dams to guarantee national energy security. However, there is opposition both within Brazil and among the international community to the project's potential construction regarding its economic viability, the generation efficiency of the dams and in particular its impacts on the region's people and environment. In addition, critics worry that construction of the Belo Monte Dam could make the construction of other dams upstream- which could have greater impacts- more viable. Plans for the dam began in 1975 but were soon shelved due to controversy; they were later revitalized in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, the dam was redesigned, but faced renewed controversy and controversial impact assessments were carried out. On 26 August 2010, a contract was signed with Norte Energia to construct the dam once the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) had issued an installation license. A partial installation license was granted on 26 January 2011 and a full license to construct the dam was issued on 1 June 2011. The licensing process and the dam's construction have been mired in federal court battles; the current ruling is that construction is allowed, because the license is based on five different environmental technical reportsVIEIRA, Isabel (2011). \\"Diretora do Ibama diz que licen√ßa para Belo Monte teve por base cinco pareceres t√©cnicos\\" language= Portuguese. Ag√™ncia Brasil, 31 January 2011 and in accordance with the RIMA (Environmental Impact Report, EIA-RIMA) study for Belo Monte.RIMA (2009). \\"Relat√≥rio de Impacto Ambiental do Aproveitamento Hidrel√©trico Belo Monte\\" . Eletrobr√°s. May/2009. The first turbines went online on 5 May 2016. As of October 2019 all turbines at Pimental and 17 turbines in main power powerhouse are online with total installed capacity of 10,388.87 MW at Belo Monte site, totaling 10,621.97 with the Pimental site. The power station was completed in November 2019. History Plans for what would eventually be called the Belo Monte Dam Complex began in 1975 during Brazil's military dictatorship, when Eletronorte contracted the Cons√≥rcio Nacional de Engenheiros Consultores (CNEC) to realize a hydrographic study to locate potential sites for a hydroelectric project on the Xingu River. CNEC completed its study in 1979 and identified the possibility of constructing five dams on the Xingu River and one dam on the Iriri River. Original plans for the project based on the 1979 study included two dams close to Belo Monte. These were: Karara√¥ (called Belo Monte after 1989), Babaquara (called Altamira after 1998) which was the next upstream. Four other dams were planned upstream as well and they include the Ipixuna, Kakraimoro, Iriri and Jarina. The project was part of Eletrobras' \\"2010 Plan\\" which included 297 dams that were to be constructed in Brazil by 2010. The plan was leaked early and officially released in December 1987 to an antagonistic public. The plan had Belo Monte to be constructed by 2000 and Altamira by 2005. Such a speedy timetable was due to the belief that Brazil's relatively new environmental regulations could not stop large projects. The government offered little transparency to the people who would be affected regarding its plans for the hydroelectric project, provoking indigenous tribes of the region to organize what they called the I Encontro das Na√ß√µes Ind√≠genas do Xingu (First Encounter of the Indigenous Nations of the Xingu) or the \\"Altamira Gathering\\", in 1989. The encounter, symbolized by the indigenous woman leader Tu√≠ra holding her machete against the face of then-engineer Jos√© Antonio Muniz Lopes sparked enormous repercussions both in Brazil and internationally over the plans for the six dams. As a result, the five dams above Belo Monte were removed from planning and Karara√¥ was renamed to Belo Monte at the request of the people of that tribe. Eletronorte also stated they would \\"resurvey the fall\\", meaning resurvey the dams on the river. =Redesign= Between 1989 and 2002, the Belo Monte project was redesigned. The reservoir's surface area was reduced from to by moving the dam further upstream. The main rationale for this was to reduce flooding of the Bacaj√° Indigenous Area. In 1998, the Babaquara Dam was again placed into planning but under a new name, the Altamira Dam. This surprised local leaders as they felt plans for the dams above Belo Monte were cancelled. Some officials in Brazil were determined to build a dam on a river with an average flow of and at a site that offers a drop. One engineer said of the dam: \\"God only makes a place like Belo Monte once in a while. This place was made for a dam.\\" President of Eletronorte, Jos√© Muniz Lopes, in an interview with the newspaper O Liberal (Belo Monte entusiasma an Eletronorte por S√¥nia Zaghetto, 15 July 2001), affirmed: > \\"Within the electric sector's planning for the period 2010/2020, we‚Äôre > looking at three dams ‚Äì Marab√° (Tocantins river), Altamira (previously > called Babaquara, Xingu River) and Itaituba (S√£o Lu√≠s do Tapaj√≥s). Some > journalists say that we are not talking about these dams because we‚Äôre > trying to hide them. It‚Äôs just that their time has not yet come. We‚Äôre now > asking for authorization to intensify our studies for these dams. Brazil > would be greatly benefited if we could follow Belo Monte with Marab√°, then > Altamira and Itaituba.\\" =Second study= In 2002, Eletronorte presented a new environmental impact assessment for the Belo Monte Dam Complex, which presented three alternatives. Alternative A included the six original dams planned in 1975. Alternative B included a reduction to four dams, dropping Jarina and Iriri. Alternative C included a reduction to Belo Monte only. The new environmental impact assessment contained reductions in reservoir size and the introduction of a run-of-the-river model, in contrast to the large reservoirs characteristic of the 1975 plans. Also in 2002, Workers' Party leader Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva earned a victory in his campaign for president, having originally run unsuccessful campaigns in 1989, 1994 and 1998. Lula soon brokered political deals with the center and right-wing sectors in 2003, especially with ex- president Jos√© Sarney of the state of Maranh√£o of the PMDB, which would set the precedent that eventually characterized the two Lula administrations: cooperation between the market and the state, a combination of a free market economy with larger social spending and welfare. This economic model provided the rationale and financial support for new efforts to construct Belo Monte. In 2007, at the beginning of Lula's second term in office, a new national investment program was introduced: the Programa de Acelera√ß√£o do Crescimento (Program to Accelerate Growth). The Belo Monte Dam Complex figured as an anchor project of the new investment plan. In 2008, another new environmental impact assessment was written, this time by Eletrobras with the participation of Odebrecht, Camargo Corr√™a, and Andrade Gutierrez, which formally accepted Alternative C or the construction only of the Belo Monte dam itself. The assessment also presented further design changes; in order to avoid inundating indigenous territory, which is not permitted by the Brazilian Constitution, the new design included two canals to divert the water away from indigenous territories and into a reservoir called the Reservatorio dos Canais (Canals Reservoir). An additional reservoir would be created called the Reservatorio da Calha do Xingu (Xingu Riverbed Reservoir), and electricity would be generated from the two reservoirs using three dams: a complementary powerhouse called Pimental (233 MW), a complementary spillway called Bela Vista, and the main powerhouse called Belo Monte (11,000 MW). The Reservatorio dos Canais would be retained by over a dozen large dikes, and water from the reservoirs would be channeled towards the main powerhouse. However, transparency of the government's plans once again became an issue, sparking indigenous tribes of the region to organize another large meeting, called the Segundo Encontro dos Povos do Xingu (the Second Encounter of the Peoples of the Xingu) in the city of Altamira, Par√° on 20 May 2008. =First license granted= In February 2010, Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA granted a provisional environmental license, one of three licenses required by Brazilian legislation for development projects. The provisional license approved the 2008 environmental impact assessment and permitted the project auction to take place in April 2010. In April 2010, Odebrecht, Camargo Corr√™a, and CPFL Energia dropped out of the project tender, arguing that the artificially low price of the auction (R$83/US$47) set by the government was not viable for economic returns on investment. On 20 April 2010, the Norte Energia consortium won the project auction by bidding at R$77.97/MWh, almost 6% below the price ceiling of R$83/MWh. After the auction, local leaders around the project site warned of imminent violence. Kayap√≥ leader Raoni Metuktire stated: \\"There will be a war so the white man cannot interfere in our lands again.\\" U.S. film director James Cameron also visited the site prior to the auction and stated he would produce an anti-Belo Monte Dam film called Message From Pandora which was later released in November. In April 2010 the Brazilian Federal Attorney General's Office suspended the project tender and annulled the provisional environmental license on claims of unconstitutionality. Specifically, Article 176 of the Federal Constitution states that federal law must determine the conditions of mineral and hydroelectric extraction when these activities take place in indigenous peoples' territories, as is the case for the \\"Big Bend\\" (Volta Grande) region. As a result, the electric utility ANEEL canceled the project auction. The same day, the appellate court for Region 1 disenfranchised the Attorney General's suspension, reinstating the project auction at ANEEL. On 26 August 2010, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva signed the contract with the Norte Energia at a ceremony in Bras√≠lia. Construction was not permitted to begin on the Belo Monte Dam Complex until IBAMA granted the second of the federally required environmental licenses, called the Installation License. The Installation License was only to be granted once Norte Energia shows indisputable proof that it has met 40 socio- environmental mitigation conditions upon which the first provisional environmental license was conditioned. According to an October 2010 IBAMA report, at least 23 conditions had not been met. Reports indicate that on 14 January 2011, a report from staff members of FUNAI, Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio, (National Indian Foundation) had sent a report to IBAMA expressing concerns about the location of the project, its impact on reservation land, and the lack of attention to needs of the indigenous people, especially the Paqui√ßamba and recommending that FUNAI oppose any license to operate. Despite this report, FUNAI senior management sent IBAMA a letter on 21 January 2011 stating that it did not oppose the issuance of a limited construction license. On 26 January 2011, a partial installation license was granted by IBAMA, authorizing Norte Energia to begin initial construction activities only including forest clearing, the construction of easement areas, and improvement of existing roads for the transport of equipment and machinery. In February 2011, Norte Energ√≠a signed contracts with multiple suppliers for the design, production, installation and commissioning of generation and associated equipment. On 1 June 2011, IBAMA granted the full license to construct the dam after studies were carried out and the consortium agreed to pay $1.9 billion in costs to address social and environmental problems. The only remaining license is one to operate the dam's power plant. =Federal Court cases= On 25 February 2011, the Federal Public Prosecutor filed its 11th lawsuit against Belo Monte Dam, suspending IBAMA's partial installation license, on the grounds that the Brazilian Constitution does not allow for the granting of partial project licenses. The Federal Public Prosecutor also argued that the 40 social and environmental conditions tied to IBAMA's provisional license of February 2010 had yet to be fulfilled, a prerequisite to the granting of a full installation license. On 25 February 2011, Brazilian federal judge Ronaldo Dest√™rro blocked the project citing environmental concerns. It was Brazil's biggest public hearing ever. The ruling was described by The Guardian as \\"a serious setback\\". President of a federal regional court Olindo Menezes overturned the decision on 3 March 2011 saying there was no need for all conditions to be met in order for preliminary work to begin. Construction site preparation began with a week after the decision. On 28 September though, due to concerns for local fishers, a federal judge prohibited Norte Energia from \\"building a port, using explosives, installing dikes, building canals and any other infrastructure work that would interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, thereby affecting local fish stocks\\". On 9 November, construction was allowed to recommence after federal judge Maria do Carmo Cardoso ruled that indigenous people did not have to be consulted by law before work approval. The ruling is expected to be appealed in the Supreme Federal Court.Minist√©rio P√∫blico de Federal (27 January 2012). \\"Embargos de declaracao proceso Belo Monte\\" (in Portuguese) (PDF).

However, according to the court the contractor company did not violate its terms and as such, its employees will be fined for R$200,000 (US$106,000) per day if they do not attend.Dow Jones Newswires (26 April 2012). \\"Brazilian Judge rules Belo Monte work stoppage illegal\\" (http://www.foxbusiness.com/news/2012/04/26/brazilian-judge-rules-belo-monte- work-stoppage-illegal). Retrieved 5 May 2012 On 14 August 2012, work on the dam was halted by order of the Brazilian Federal Court, when federal judge Souza Prudente, halted construction on the controversial Belo Monte dam in the Amazon, saying that the indigenous peoples had not been consulted. The Supreme Federal Court overturned the decision on 28 August and ordered construction to recommence. A federal court overturned a lower court ruling that had suspended the dam's operating license in January 2016. The lower court suspension was due to allegations of human rights violations. Design Overview of the dam complex Big Bend (Volta Grande) of the Xingu, Belo Monte reservoir inside, dam at top The Belo Monte Dam (AHE Belo Monte) is a complex of three dams, numerous dykes and a series of canals in order to supply two different power stations with water. The Pimental Dam () on the Xingu would be tall and long and have a structural volume of . It would create the Calha Do Xingu Reservoir which would have a normal capacity of and surface area of . The dam would support a power station and its spillway would serve as the complex's principal spillway with 17 floodgates and a maximum discharge. The dam's reservoir would also divert water into two long canals. These canals would supply water to the Dos Canais Reservoir, which is created within the \\"Big Bend\\" by the main dam, Belo Monte (), a series of 28 dykes around the reservoir's perimeter and the Bela Vista Dam () which lies on the Dos Canais Reservoir's eastern perimeter. The Belo Monte Dam would support the main power station in the complex. The power station was to have twenty vertical Francis turbines listed at 550 MW (max 560 MW). Supplying each turbine with water is a , diameter penstock, affording an average of of hydraulic head. The Pimental Dam's power station was to have seven Kaplan bulb turbines, each rated at 25.9 MW and with of hydraulic head. Later the unit count was decreased by using more powerful units (see next section). The Belo Monte Dam would be tall and long and have a structural volume (embankments included) of while the Bella Vista would be high and long and have a structural volume of . The Dos Canais Reservoir would have a normal capacity of , a normal surface area of and a normal elevation area of above sea level. The Bela Vista Dam which serves as the complex's secondary spillway would have a maximum discharge capacity of . =Design flaw= Shortly before the planned installation of the dam's last (18th) turbine in November 2019, it was revealed that catastrophic failure of the dam was possible due to exposure of an unprotected area of the dam wall to wave action in the then prevailing low water level. In an 11 October 2019 Norte Energia report, the company's CEO requested more water from an intermediate reservoir to add to the dangerously low 95.2 meter water level. =Power generation and distribution= The planned capacity of Belo Monte is listed at 11,233 MW. It is composed of the main Belo Monte Dam, and its turbine house with an installed capacity of 11,000 MW. The Pimental Dam which also includes a turbine house would have an installed capacity of 233.1 MW, containing 38.85 MW bulb turbines. The generation facility is planned to have 18 Francis turbines with a capacity of 611.11 MW each. In February 2011, Norte Energ√≠a signed contracts with: *IMPSA worth $450 million to design and install by the fall of 2015 four Francis turbine generation units to provide 2,500 MW of power. *Andritz AG to provide three Francis turbines and the six bulb turbines, and the 14 excitation systems for the main power house and additional equipment for the Pimental power house. *Alstom worth $682.3 million to provide 7 Francis turbines, and 14 gas insulated substations for the facility. =Capacity= Walter Coronado Antunes, the former Secretary of the Environment of the state of S√£o Paulo, and ex-President of the state water and sanitation utility Sabesp, has said that the Belo Monte Dam Complex would be one of the least efficient hydro- power projects in the history of Brazil, producing only 10% of its 11,233 MW nameplate capacity between July and October (1,123 MW, and an average of only 4,419 MW throughout the year, or a 39% capacity factor). According to the president of Brazil's Energy Research Company (EPE), 39% is \\"just a little below\\" Brazil's average of 55%. Normally, the capacity factor of hydroelectric power plants is between 30% and 80%, while wind power is typically between 20% and 40%. According to a study by Eletrobras, even when at reduced capacities, Belo Monte would still have the capacity to supply the entire state of Para with electricity. =Availability= Critics claim that the project would only make financial sense if the Brazilian government builds additional dam reservoirs upstream to guarantee a year-round flow of water, thus increasing the availability of generation. Supporters of the project point out that the seasonal minimum flow of the Xingu river occurs at a time when other Brazilian hydro plants are well supplied, so that no additional dams would have to be built. Reportedly, Brazil's National Council for Power Policies approved a resolution, previously sanctioned by then president Lula, that only one hydroelectric dam would be built on the Xingu. With one dam, critics do not see a cost-to-benefit ratio advantage and question the government's decision to construct only one. Additional upstream dams would directly or indirectly affect 25,000 indigenous people in the entire Xingu basin. Of particular note is the Altamira (Babaquara) Dam, which would flood an additional of reservoir, according to its original design. Developer The project is developed by Norte Energia. The consortium is controlled by the state-owned power company Eletrobras, which directly (15%) and through its subsidiaries Eletronorte (19.98%) and CHESF (15%) controls a 49.98% stake in the consortium.

Retrieved 5 May 2012 Economics The dam complex is expected to cost upwards of $16 billion and the transmission lines $2.5 billion. The project is being developed by the state-owned power company Eletronorte, and would be funded largely by the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). The project will also include substantial amounts of funding from Brazilian pension funds Petros, Previ, and Funcef. Private investors interested in the project include mining giants Alcoa and Vale (to power new mines nearby like the proposed Belo Sun gold mine), construction conglomerates Andrade Gutierrez, Votorantim, Grupo OAS, Queiroz Galv√£o, Odebrecht and Camargo Corr√™a, and energy companies GDF Suez and Neoenergia. In 2006, Conservation Strategy Fund (CSF) analyzed different cost-benefit scenarios for Belo Monte as an energy project, excluding environmental costs. Initial benefits appeared marginal. When simulating energy benefits using a modeling system it became obvious that Belo Monte would require additional upstream dams to provide water storage for dry season generation. CSF concluded that Belo Monte would not be sustainable without the proposed Altamira (Babaquara) dam which would have a reservoir more than 10 times the size of Belo Monte's, flood 30 times the area submerged by Belo Monte, indigenous territories of the Arawet√©/Igarap√© Ipixuna, Koatinemo, Arara, Karara√¥, and Cachoeira Seca do Irir√≠ natives. Due to the project's lack of economic viability and lack of interest from private investors, the government has had to rely on pension funds and lines of credit from BNDES that draw from the Workers' Assistance Fund, oriented towards paying the public debt, to finance the project; up to one-third of the project's official cost would be financed by incentives using public money.\\"Incentivos federais chegam a 1/3 do valor de Belo Monte,\\" =Alternatives= WWF-Brazil released a report in 2007 stating that Brazil could cut its expected demand for electricity by 40% by 2020 by investing in energy efficiency.

The project is strongly criticized by indigenous people and numerous environmental organizations in Brazil plus organizations and individuals around the world. Belo Monte's of reservoir will flood of forest, about 0.01% of the Amazon forest. Though argued to be a relatively small area for a dam's energy output, this output cannot be fully obtained without the construction of other dams planned within the dam complex. The expected area of reservoir for the Belo Monte dam and the necessary Altamira dam together will exceed 6500 km2 of rainforest. The environmental impact assessment written by Eletrobras, Odebrecht, Camargo Corr√™a, and Andrade Gutierrez listed the following possible adverse effects * The loss of vegetation and natural spaces, with changes in fauna and flora; * Changes in the quality and path of the water supply, and fish migration routes; * Temporary disruption of the water supply in the Xingu riverbed for 7 months; =Incomplete environmental assessment= In February 2010, Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA granted an environmental license for the construction of the dam despite uproar from within the agency about incomplete information in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) written by Eletrobras, Odebrecht, Camargo Corr√™a, and Andrade Gutierrez. Previously in October 2009, a panel composed of independent experts and specialists from Brazilian universities and research institutes issued a report on the EIA, finding \\"various omissions and methodological inconsistencies in the EIA...\\" Among the problems cited within the EIA were the project's uncertain cost, deforestation, generation capacity, greenhouse gas emissions and in particular the omission of consideration for those affected by the river being mostly diverted in the long \\"Big Bend\\" (Volta Grande). Two senior officials at IBAMA, Leozildo Tabajara da Silva Benjamin and Sebasti√£o Cust√≥dio Pires, resigned their posts in 2009 citing high-level political pressure to approve the project. In January 2011, IBAMA president Abelardo Azevedo also resigned his post. The previous president Roberto Messias had also stepped down, citing in April 2010 that it was because of pressure from both the government and environmental organizations. 140 organizations and movements from Brazil and across the globe decried the decision-making process in granting the environmental license for the dams in a letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2010. =Loss of biodiversity= Hypancistrus zebra, one of the species found only in the Volta Grande. The fish fauna of the Xingu river is extremely rich with an estimated 600 fish species and with a high degree of endemism.Camargo M., GiarrizzoT. & Isaac V. (2004). \\"Review of the geographic distribution of fish fauna of the Xingu river basin, Brazil\\". Ecotropica 10: 123-147. PDF . The area either dried out or drowned by the dam spans the entire known world distribution of a number of species, e.g. the zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra), the sunshine pleco (Scobinancistrus aureatus), the slender dwarf pike cichlid (Teleocichla centisquama), the killifish Anablepsoides xinguensis and Spectrolebias reticulatus, and the Xingu dart-poison frog (Allobates crombiei). An independent expert review of the costs of the dam concluded that the proposed flow through the Volta Grande meant the river \\"will not be capable of maintaining species diversity\\", risking \\"extinction of hundreds of species\\". =Greenhouse gas budget= The National Amazon Research Institute (INPA) calculated that during its first 10 years, the Belo Monte-Babaquara dam complex would emit 11.2 million metric tons of Carbon dioxide equivalent, and an additional 0.783 million metric tons of equivalent would be generated during construction and connection to the national energy grid. This independent study estimates greenhouse gas emissions of an amount that would require 41 years of optimal energy production from the Belo Monte Dam complex (including the now aborted Altamira Dam) in order to reach environmental sustainability over fossil fuel energy. Dams in Brazil emit high amounts of methane, due to the lush jungle covered by waters each year as the basin fills. Carbon is trapped by foliage, which then decays anaerobically with help from methanogens, converting the carbon to methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. As a result, carbon emissions are emitted from the dam each year it is in operation. A 1990 study of the Curu√°-Una Dam, also in Brazil, found that it pollutes 3.5 times more in carbon dioxide equivalent than an oil power plant generating an equal amount of electricity would; not in the form of the CO2 atmospheric pollution associated with fossil fuel burning, but as the more dangerous methane emissions. Furthermore, the forest will be cleared before flooding of the area, so the CO2 and methane emissions calculated for the flooding of the forested area will be significantly undercut. In addition, a study on the Brazilian Tucuru√≠ dam showed that the actual greenhouse gas emissions were a factor ten higher than its official calculations showed, and this dam is no exception; it is feared that the Belo Monte Dam calculations are also deliberately undercutting reality and that the flooding of its reservoir will create a similar situation.Fearnside, Phillip M. (2006). \\"Mitigation of Climate Change in the Amazon.\\"(http://philip.inpa.gov.br/publ_livres/mss%20and%20in%20press/laurance- peres%20book%20ms.pdf ) Book chapter in: W.F. Laurance and C.A.

Environmental Conservation 22 (1):7-19. Retrieved 5 May 2012. If the dam builders cleared the forest beforehand, they would remove the organic matter from the reservoir floor and the dam would produce less of the greenhouse gas methane. However, in the case of Tucuru√≠, only the economically necessary forest was cut (10%, near the opening to the spillway) and the rest was left intact to be flooded by the reservoir. The contractors had sold the logging rights to the flooded area, but found the plot unviable in the short amount of time they had allocated before the area was set to be flooded. This forest has been decaying under the water through Methanogenesis and producing large amounts of greenhouse gases. On the other hand, the energy generated by the dam for the next 50 years, at an average of 4419 MW, is 1.14 bboe (billion barrels of oil equivalent). This is approximately 9% of the proven oil reserves of Brazil (12.6 bbl ), or 2% of the total oil reserves of Russia (60 bbl), or 5.5% of the proven oil reserves of the U.S. (21 bbl). Social effects Protestors against the dam. The sign translates to \\"Beautiful pile of shit\\". Although strongly criticized by indigenous leaders, the president of Brazil's EPE claims they have popular support for the dam. On 20 April 2010 Folha de Sao Paulo poll showed 52% in favor of the dam. The dam will directly displace over 20,000 people, mainly from the municipalities of Altamira and Vit√≥ria do Xingu. Two river diversion canals wide by long will be excavated. The canals would divert water from the main dam to the power plant. Belo Monte will flood a total area of . Of the total, of flooded area will be forested land. The river diversion canals will reduce river flow by 80% in the area known as the Volta Grande (\\"Big Bend\\"), where the territories of the indigenous Juruna and Arara people, as well as those of sixteen other ethnic groups are located. While these tribes will not be directly impacted by reservoir flooding, and therefore will not be relocated, they may suffer involuntary displacement, as the river diversion negatively affects their fisheries, groundwater, ability to transport on the river and stagnant pools of water offer an environment for water-borne diseases, an issue that is criticized for not being addressed in the Environmental Impact Assessment. Among the 20,000 to be directly displaced by reservoir flooding, resettlement programs have been identified by the government as necessary for mitigation. Norte Energia have failed to obtain free, prior, and informed consent from the Juruna and Arara indigenous tribes to be impacted by Belo Monte. The project would also attract an estimated 100,000 migrants to the area. An estimated 18,700 direct jobs would be created, with an additional 25,000 indirect jobs to accommodate the surge in population. However, only a fraction of the direct jobs will stay available after the project's completion, which critics have argued to spell economic disaster rather than economic prosperity. The influx of immigrants and construction workers has also led to increased social tension between groups. Indigenous groups report attacks and harassment, and in several occasions the destruction of property and the death of indigenous persons as a result from constructing and (illegal) logging activities.Phillips, Tom (15 February 2012). \\"Amazon defenders face death or exile\\" (http://raoni.com/news-283.php ).

Opened in 1849 by the North Staffordshire Railway, the station was part of the Churnet Valley line and served the village of Alton and the country estate at Alton Towers. In 1954, the station was renamed Alton Towers. After being closed in 1965, Alton Towers was purchased by Staffordshire County Council in 1969 to curtail persistent vandalism of the station building, and in 1979 was sold to the Landmark Trust, who renamed the site to Alton Station and converted the former station buildings into holiday accommodation.  History  At the height of the so- called \\"Railway Mania\\", when railways were being built across the whole country, the North Staffordshire Railway obtained Parliament's permission to build a number of lines, one of which was the Churnet Valley Line, on 26 June 1845. It ran from in Cheshire to in East Staffordshire. A temporary station was erected in Alton which opened on 13 July 1849, and the permanent station buildings opened the following year. The station's design followed an Italianate villa style, unique in this respect among all NSR stations, which were a Tudor or Jacobean style. The architecture is variously attributed to A.W. Pugin and Henry Arthur Hunt, the latter of whom designed most of the NSR's stations. Early passengers included many day visitors coming in large numbers from the Staffordshire Potteries to visit nearby Alton Towers, the country estate of the Earl of Shrewsbury. A luggage lift was installed to hoist the Earl's baggage up to Alton Towers. The station also comprised a three-storey tower which contained the Earl's suite of waiting rooms and its platform was made particularly long to satisfy the Earl's desire to have impressive surroundings in which to receive his guests. Several additions were made during the 1880s: * 1882 - goods yard and sidings enlarged, signal box built * 1882 - waiting room extended with a new booking office * 1884 - platforms lengthened, pathway directly to the Towers built The station experienced a great increase in use from 1924, when Alton Towers was sold to become a tourist attraction, with its gardens and parts of the house open for public use, although it did not become a theme park for several decades afterwards. It became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, and thereafter the line began to decline. In January 1954, the station was renamed Alton Towers in recognition of its previous service to the Alton Towers estate. Passenger service was greatly reduced from 1960, with eventual closure by the British Railways Board occurring ten years after the renaming. Vandalism of the waiting room became a problem soon thereafter, and the station buildings, platform and sections of line were purchased by Staffordshire County Council in 1969.  Design and layout  The former station buildings, attributed variously to Augustus Pugin and local architect Henry Arthur Hunt, are of an Italianate villa style unique to the former North Staffordshire Railway and was built at the request of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 19th Earl of Shrewsbury, who owned the Alton Towers estate and wished for an impressive station where he might impress his guests. When in use as a railway station, Alton Towers also possessed a three-storey tower, unusually long platforms, and a luggage lift to the Alton Towers estate, all of which were built at the Earl's request. The site today The station buildings, which are grade II listed, were acquired by the Landmark Trust and the stationmaster's house converted into holiday accommodation, opening in 1972. In 2008 the Landmark Trust converted the waiting-room to provide additional accommodation space. The buildings are occasionally open to the public as part of an \\"Open Day\\" scheme run by the Trust.

Danzer was successful as a solo artist, but also in the group Austria3, along with Wolfgang Ambros and Rainhard Fendrich. Besides his music, he translated two books from Spanish into German, and was strongly involved in highlighting social inequalities, opposing racism and any form of societal discrimination, and the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie for all his life.

After his Matura (high school leaving certificate) he hitchhiked through Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. In autumn 1966 he applied for admission to Vienna's Akademie f√ºr Darstellende K√ºnste (Drama Academy), but was not accepted; so instead he started studying Philosophy and Psychology in Vienna. In a 1968 ORF-Interview he stated his intention to study Journalism, to which moderator Gerhard Bronner replied: \\"Shift to music soon, young man‚Äú.Source was not found until now, it was most probably Das Showfenster, or Die gro√üe Glocke.

The next year he released his first single, Vera, and appeared on Austrian broadcast, but did not get a contract. Hitradio √ñ3 editor Eva-Maria Kaiser took notice of him in 1970, and suggested that he could make a living by writing lyrics for \\"almost everybody in Vienna\\". During the next three years he wrote texts for Marianne Mendt, Margot Werner, Erika Pluhar, Andr√© Heller, Wolfgang Ambros and the singer Wilfried. With Heller, Mendt and other young musicians, ‚ÄûSchurli\\" Schurli, from \\"Schurl\\", is Viennese slang for Georg. often met in Gerhard Bronner's Cabaret Fledermaus. They invented Austrian pop music for the following decades. During this time, singer-songwriters began to sing in Viennese German or even slang, exemplified by hits such as Wia a Glock'n (Marianne Mendt 1970; lyrics: Gerhard Bronner) and Da Hofa (Wolfgang Ambros 1971; lyrics by Joesi Prokopetz. For a while, Danzer was a member of the band The Madcaps and wrote a couple of their songs, among them Schneemensch, Sommer is, John Wayne. In 1972, the single Tschik (a slang word for cigarette) attracted public attention and was perceived as \\"scandalous\\": a homeless man talks and sings about his life! Today the first edition of the single is in great demand as a collector's item; it was housed in a simple paper bag, and no author or singer was credited. Later, Peter Barwitz from √ñ3 had a voice analysis made, which identified ‚ÄûSchurl(i)\\" Danzer. In 1973, Danzer released the album Honigmond, which Danzer partially financed himself and flopped. In 1974, the concept album Der T√§towierer und die Mondprinzessin was released together with a book whillich he ustrated. In 1975 J√∂ schau, a comic song about a streaker at the Caf√© Hawelka, became a No 1 in the Austrian charts and stayed there for 20 weeks. In the same year the album Ollas leiwand (Slang for \\"Everything's all right\\") was released. On 14 October he married Dagmara, with whom he had been in a relationship since 1968. 1976 brought good news for Danzer: his first daughter, Daniela, was born, and he got a contract with a major label Polydor. Furthermore, English Music Week \\"Star of the Year\\", and five of his songs formed the soundtrack for the first Kottan ermittelt TV series.Kottan ermittelt: Musik The series, a parody criminal series set in 1970 Vienna, achieved cult status. Danzer moved towards Germany. In Berlin, the album Unter die Haut was produced in 1977. Michael Gechter (electric guitar), Earl Bostic (bass), Frank L√ºdeke (saxophone), Eberhard \\"B√§r‚Äú Wieland (keyboard) and Olav Gustafson (percussion) formed Danzer's backing band, with which he recorded several successful albums over the following years. Although Danzer's work garnered many good reviews, he was blacklisted by several radio stations for his song War das etwa Haschisch? (\\"Was this possibly dope?\\"). At the end of 1977, the album Ein wenig Hoffnung was published in Germany, and at almost the same time, Narrenhaus (House of fools) was released in Austria. =Popularity and crisis, 1979‚Äì1990= In 1979, the \\"Georg Danzer Tournee 79\\" included 32 shows, all of which had sold out. A double live album appeared in the following year. More successful albums soon followed (Traurig aber wahr 1980, Ruhe vor dem Sturm 1981). Even Austrians began to realize that Danzer was more than J√∂ schau. The ORF produced a 45-minutes feature, Danzer Direkt. In 1981, Danzer played 47 concerts solo (Live-Album Direkt), followed by an Open-Air-Tournee with Ludwig Hirsch, Konstantin Wecker, Chris de Burgh and Georges Moustaki. in 1982 he published Die gn√§dige Frau und das rote Reptil, a book with lyrics and prose. In 1983, Danzer was among the first German-language musicians who created a CD-album (‚Ä¶und so weiter). In the summer of 1984, Danzer dissolved his band and went to Munich to produce Wei√üe Pferde. During the production of its video clip by Rudi Dolezal in Andalusia, he suffered a serious bike accident and had to be flown back to Vienna because of heavy injuries. In 1985, his wife Dagmara filed for divorce, his former manager disappeared, he got in trouble with the financial revenue services, and his contract with Polydor came to an end. In 1986 he was signed by Teldec, which belonged to the Time-Warner group, and went to Spain to study Spanish, among other reasons. In 1988, he moved to Hamburg, travelled to Egypt and Kenya and was infected by malaria. In 1989, Danzer and his new life partner, Bettina, moved to a farm in Werl-Holtum (Westfalen), where he spent most of his time until 1994, and where he translated two works of the Spanish author Manuel Vicent. =Back to Vienna, 1990= From 1990, Danzer spent again some time in Vienna and produced the album Wieder in Wien (\\"Back to Vienna\\"), with Peter Cornelius (guitar), Marianne Mendt (vocals) and Wilfried (vocals). The following tour of Austria was successful. In 1992 he married Bettina and his son Jonas was born. His CD Nahaufnahme (featuring Hans Theessink, Dorretta Carter and others) was followed by a three-month tour of Austria, Germany and Switzerland in 1993. In 1994, another son, Jakob, was born, and the family moved to Austria. In 1995, the album Gro√üe Dinge (featuring Ulli B√§er, Gary Lux, Thomas Mor√° and Peter Barborik) was released, as well as an album of Viennese songs, Liada ohne Grund (with Adi Hirschal and Lukas Goldschmidt). 10 December 1997 was the birth of Austria3. Rainhard Fendrich had gathered two friends for a single charity event for homeless people and thereby created one of the most successful Austrian groups. In the same year, Danzer was the first European musician to publish a CD-Extra with multimedia content ($ex im Internet). Whilst touring with Austria3, he still produced solo albums. In 2000, Danzer became president of the human rights organization \\"SOS Mitmensch\\". In 2002, the double CD Sonne & Mond was released, a retrospective of his 30 years on stage. In 2004, the album Pers√∂nlich was published with Wolfgang Puschnig (saxofone), Achim Tang (bass) and Christian Eigner (percussion), also featuring the singer Zabine and Katja Riemann. =Lung cancer, 2006 ‚Äì 2007= In September 2006 Danzer informed the public that he was suffering from lung cancer. He had to cancel two concerts scheduled for the following October, one in Wiener Stadthalle, the other one in Circus Krone, Munich. In December 2006 he was one of the supporters of activities alerting to the dangers of smoking (√ñsterreichische Lungenunion). The previously cancelled Vienna concert took place on 16 April 2007, and his friends, Ambros and Fendrich, joined Danzer for a few songs to rekindle the spirit of former days. The concert was a perfect success, but also Georg Danzer's last appearance in public. Danzer died at home on 21 June 2007, and was cremated the next day. He wanted to keep his burial place secret; almost none of his friends were invited to the funeral, except his long-time manager Franz Christian \\"Blacky\\" Schwarz, whose duty it was to inform the press a few hours after the burial had taken place. Danzer had stated before his death that, if it were offered to him by Viennese authorities, he would refuse an honorary grave (\\"Ehrengrab\\") usually bestowed to artists of high calibre .APA-press release 15:47 26.06.2007 Discography Albums { width=\\"100%\\" align=\\"center width=\\"33% valign=\\"top\\" * 1972: Der Tschik * 1973: Honigmond * 1974: Der T√§towierer und die Mondprinzessin * 1975: Danzer, Dean & Dracula * 1975: Ollas leiwaund * 1976: Du mi a * 1976: J√∂ schau‚Ä¶ Seine gr√∂√üten Erfolge * 1977: Unter die Haut * 1977: Des kaun do no ned ollas gwesn sein * 1978: Ein wenig Hoffnung * 1978: Narrenhaus * 1978: Liederbuch * 1979: Feine Leute * 1979: Notausgang * 1980: Traurig aber wahr * 1980: Danzer Live ‚Äì Tournee '79 (Live)  width=\\"33% valign=\\"top\\" * 1981: Ruhe vor dem Sturm * 1981: Direkt (Live) * 1982: Jetzt oder nie * 1983: ‚Ä¶ und so weiter * 1984: Menschliche W√§rme * 1984: Wei√üe Pferde * 1985: Alles aus Gold * 1986: Danzer * 1987: Liebes Leben * 1989: Rufze!chen * 1990: Wieder in Wien * 1991: Echt Danzer! ‚Äì Solo (Live) * 1991: Keine Angst * 1992: Kreise * 1993: Nahaufnahme  width=\\"33% valign=\\"top\\" * 1995: Gro√üe Dinge * 1997: $ex im Internet * 1998: AUSTRIA3 ‚Äì Live * 1998: AUSTRIA3 ‚Äì Live Vol. 2 * 1999: Atemz√ºge * 2000: AUSTRIA3 ‚Äì Die Dritte * 2000: Rarit√§ten * 2001: 13 schmutzige Lieder * 2002: Ausverkauft! ‚Äì (Live) (as group DBB, with Ulli B√§er and Andy Baum) * 2002: Sonne & Mond ‚Äì Lieder & Geschichten aus 30 Jahren (Live) * 2004: Pers√∂nlich * 2005: Von Scheibbs bis Nebraska * 2006: Gute Unterhaltung ‚Äì Die besten Geschichten & Lieder (Live) * 2006: Tr√§umer * 2007: Rarit√§ten II } Austrian Charts ‚Äì Singles austriancharts.at ;J√∂ schau :AT: 1 ‚Äì 15 October 1975 ‚Äì 20 Wo. ;So a Dodl mid da Rodl :AT: 3 ‚Äì 15 March 1976 ‚Äì 8 Wo. ;Hupf' in Gatsch :AT: 6 ‚Äì 15 July 1976 ‚Äì 16 Wo. ;Zombieball :AT: 13 ‚Äì 1 November 1983 ‚Äì 6 Wo. ;Atlantis :AT: 19 ‚Äì 1 March 1984 ‚Äì 2 Wo. ;Doppelg√§nger :AT: 24 ‚Äì 15 April 1986 ‚Äì 2 Wo.

It has been estimated that he may have been around 35 years of age when he wrote this work. This work, which is the biggest of Kanakadasa's compositions, contains 42 chapters with 2800 verses in the Sangatya metre.KanakadƒÅsa, and Ke. Bi Ta·∏∑agƒìri. 1989.

Gadaga: VidyƒÅnidhi PrakƒÅ≈õana (Kanakadasa's Ramadhanya Charitre - a translation and analysis) OCLC: 21598584 It contains various pauranika stories about suras, asuras and Krishna which the author narrates to his wife. The work has been inspired by mythological stories from the Bhagavata, the Mahabharata and various other puranas. It is believed that Kanakadasa wrote this work when he lost his beloved wife. He seems to recount his personal experiences in fond remembrance of his wife. There is a close relationship between music and Sangatya poems in his work. This is a Sringara Rasa based book spanning over three generations. It is a story of Manmatha (the god of love), his parents Krishna and Rukmini, Pradumya (Rukmini's son), Rathi (Manmatha's wife), Aniruddha and Ushe. This story ends in defeat of demon Banasura and marriage of Ushe and Aniruddha using a presentation similar to sukumara style (a style of poetics elaborated by Kuntaka, a Sanskrit grammarian in his Vakroktijivita).Classical treatise on poetics, The Hindu Plot In the prosperous city of Dwarakapura, during Krishna‚Äôs rule, Krishna‚Äôs wife Rukmini pines for a child. Krishna blesses her saying that she will give birth to a child who is destined to be burnt to ashes by Shiva. Following this, Rukmini gives birth to Manmatha (God of love). One day, Manmatha, while fleeing from the demon Tarakasura, comes to Shiva who is deep in meditation. Manmatha breaks Shiva's meditation, and this infuriates Shiva who turns him into ashes. A forlorn Rathi (Manmatha's lover) wanders for many years and eventually comes to Shambasura's kingdom and joins the kitchen as a maid. Meanwhile, Manmatha reincarnates as Rukmini's son Pradyumna. Shambasura, fearing that Pradyumna is destined to kill him, kidnaps the ten-day-old Pradyumna and casts him away into the sea, where he is swallowed by a fish. The fish is later caught by a fisherman who presents it to Shambasura. The fish is taken to the kitchen where Rathi cuts it open to find Pradyumna. Shambasura gives Rathi permission to take care of the boy without realising that the boy is actually Pradyumna. The child grows into a handsome young man and becomes an expert in all arts. Later, in a fight with Shambasura, Pradyumna emerges victorious and returns to Dwaraka along with Rathi. Rathi then recounts to Pradyumna that he was actually Manmatha in his previous birth. Pradyumna then weds Rathi and a child is born to them, and they name him Aniruddha. Shombithapura is ruled by Banasura (a demon), a great Shiva devotee and daughter is Ushe. Aniruddha falls in love with Ushe and wishes to marry her, but this results in a war between Krishna and Banasura. In the ensuing battle, Krishna cuts the thousand shoulders of Banasura at which point Shiva intervenes and proclaims to Banasura that He (Hara) and Krishna (Hari) are one and the same. Banasura gives up the fight and Aniruddha marries his daughter Ushe. Highlights The work uses a simple Kannada style and describes the romances of the three pairs that appear in the story. The romances of Krishna and his consort Rukmini is treated in first four Sandhis, the Kama and Rathi romance in next twelve sandhis and that of Anirudha and Ushe in final 26 Sandhis. Though a kavya written in the classical style, with the conventional eighteen descriptions, the work delves into aspects of eroticism in its treatment of the romances. The book also contains some historical accounts which has helped scholars in reconstructing chronologies of Kannada literature and history. For instance, in an attempt to enumerate ancient India, Kanakadasa names the Hoysana (Hoysala) and Cauta countries; with Cauta probably referring to the territory of the Jaina dynasty of that name on the western coast. The author also heaps praise on contemporary kavIshvaras (poets) who were engaged in translating many of the Vaishnava puraNas into Kannada. The descriptions of Dwaravati(Dwaraka) that the work provides are in ways very similar to those of Vijayanagara under Krishnadevaraya as seen in the accounts of Portuguese travelers. The descriptions of market places with colourful stalls and demarcated lanes teeming with craftsmen, clients, merchants; royal garden parties and glorious descriptions of the palace are all reminiscent of Vijayanagara under Krishnadevaraya. A drinking bout of men and women of the working classes is particularly vivid. In some places, it appears as though Kanakadasa has described scenes almost as they happened. Further, Kanakadasa, in spite of being Hari devotee has not used his work to condemn Shiva. He shows equal respect to both Shiva and Vishnu in this secular work.

Spinal Cord  Plateau potentials are of particular importance to spinal cord motor systems. PICs are set up by the influence of descending monoaminergic reticulospinal pathways. Metabotropic neurotransmitters, via monoaminergic input such as 5-HT and norepinephrine, modulate the activity of dendritic L-type Calcium channels that allow a sustained, positive, inward current into the cell. This leads to a lasting depolarisation. In this state, the cell fires action potentials independent of synaptic input. The PICs can be turned off via the activation of high- frequency inhibitory input at which point the cell returns to a resting state.  Olfactory Bulb  Periglomerular cells, inhibitory interneurons that surround and innervate olfactory glomeruli, have also been shown to exhibit plateau potentials.  Cortex and Hippocampus  Plateau potentials are also seen in the cortical, and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Using iontophoretic, or two-photon glutamate uncaging experiments, it has been discovered that these plateau potentials include activities of voltage dependent calcium channels and NMDA receptors.

The ship was laid down as HMS Espoir (BAM-23) for the Royal Navy on 27 October 1942 at Seattle, Washington, by the Associated Shipbuilding Corp. The ship was taken over by the United States Navy in late 1942 or early 1943; named USS Triumph and designated AM-323 on 23 January 1943. It was launched on 25 February 1943; and commissioned on 3 February 1944 with Lt. Comdr. Carl R. Cunningham, Jr., USNR, in command. In 1961 it was transferred to the Norwegian Navy and served as Brage until 1978  World War II Pacific operations  Following outfitting at Seattle, Washington, and shakedown training along the California coast, Triumph stood out of San Francisco, California, on 1 May as a unit in the escort of an Oahu-bound convoy. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 10th and, after a five-day layover, joined the screen of a convoy bound for the Marshall Islands. She entered the lagoon at Majuro on 25 May; two days later, headed back to Hawaii with 24 passengers embarked; and reached Pearl Harbor on 2 June. She got underway again late in the month to escort another convoy to the Marshalls. She reentered Pearl Harbor on 16 July and prepared for her first deployment in the combat zone. On 12 August, Triumph stood out of Pearl Harbor with a convoy bound initially for the Solomon Islands. The minesweeper arrived at Florida Island near Guadalcanal on 24 August and conducted minesweeping rehearsals in the Russell Islands to prepare for the invasion of the Palaus. On 8 September, she departed Guadalcanal with Task Group (TG) 32.4, the transport screen for the Palau Islands invasion force. Triumph reached Kossol Passage at dawn on 15 September and began sweeping mines from the prospective anchorage there. At about 1430 on the next day, struck a mine while supporting the sweeping of Kossol Passage as destruction vessel. Triumph sent a fire and rescue party to assist the destroyer ‚Äî by then completely without power ‚Äî and took over her duties as destruction vessel destroying five floating mines by gunfire. Following that, she stood by Wadleigh until dark, providing what assistance she could. She then took up screening station for the night. Minesweeping operations continued on a daily basis until 18 September when Triumph was devoted entirely to screening and harbor control duties. She remained in the Palaus until mid-October ‚Äî though at Peleliu after 30 September ‚Äî and then got underway to screen a convoy to the Solomons. After stops in the Russell Islands and at Tulagi, Triumph returned to the Palaus on 21 October. She remained there until late November, performing antisubmarine screening duty at Peleliu in the south and at Kossol Passage in the north, as well as escorting ships between the two. On 11 November, Triumph left the Palaus in company with a New Guinea-bound convoy. She reached Humboldt Bay on the 15th and sailed for Ulithi on the 20th. Ordered back to Humboldt Bay on the 22nd, the minesweeper returned two days later. After taking on fuel and provisions, she stood out of Humboldt Bay for San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on the 26th in company with , , and Coast Guard cutter . Triumph reached recently invaded Leyte on the morning of 30 November and began preparations for the flanking landings at Ormoc Bay on the western shore of the island. = Attacked by Japanese fighter planes = After five days patrolling the San Pedro Bay anchorage against enemy submarine incursions, the ship got underway as a unit of task unit TU 78.3.6. En route, Triumph and her traveling companions were the subject of a kamikaze attack by three A6M Zeros. The first tried to crash into but missed and splashed down between that ship and Triumph. The second fighter tried a bombing run but was brought down by the combined anti-aircraft fire of the task unit. The third plane did not make an attack. Later that day, a group of medium bombers overflew the unit but made no attack. Just before noon, the minesweeper and her mates reached Ormoc Bay and streamed their sweep gear to complete their mission. Unmolested, the group of minesweepers completed their sweeping by 2125 that night and took up station in the screen of the Ormoc Bay attack force. The following morning, the Army 77th Division landed unopposed just south of Ormoc town and in the enemy's rear area. The only Japanese attempt to oppose the operation consisted of aerial attacks ‚Äî both conventional and kamikaze. Though the attacks cost the American naval forces two warships sunk, and , two more severely damaged, and , and an LSM abandoned; they failed to impede the landings and the progress of the troops ashore. Triumph departed Ormoc Bay late on the morning of the 7th and headed back to San Pedro Bay. Though her task unit occasionally engaged enemy aircraft during the intermittent air attacks, she concentrated on her role as a part of the antisubmarine screen while the destroyers of the outer screen bore the brunt of the attack. The raids ceased at dark; and, early the next morning, task unit TU 78.3.6 reentered San Pedro Bay. = Supporting landings at Mindoro = Triumph remained at San Pedro Bay until the afternoon of 12 December when she got underway to participate in the occupation of Mindoro. On the second day out, the task organization came under aerial attack. Just after midday, a kamikaze crashed into the flagship , and the light cruiser was forced to drop out of formation and return to San Pedro Bay with . Additional raids occurred that afternoon, but they caused no damage. By the morning of 14 December, the unit was passing Negros Island; and Triumph, along with the rest of the minesweepers, received orders to sweep the waters ahead of the force. During that sweep, the unit was attacked by a formation of three Nakajima Ki-43s. The enemy planes dropped three bombs off Triumph's port quarter but caused no damage. An American combat air patrol drove the raiders off, and the minesweepers completed their mission by late afternoon. Just after midnight on 15 December, Triumph and her mates reached the beaches on the southwestern coast of Mindoro. At 0225, they began sweeping the invasion approaches. They completed their task less than three hours later and moved out while the invasion force moved in. Later, she joined in sweeps of Pandarochan Bay; then returned to Mindoro Strait to form up for the return to Leyte. At 1830, she departed Mindoro and, after a brief but intense aerial attack at dusk, voyaged peacefully back to the anchorage at San Pedro Bay, anchoring there a little after 0800 on the 18th. For the remainder of the month, she remained at San Pedro Bay and conducted antisubmarine patrols in Leyte Gulf. = Supporting the Luzon invasion = On 2 January 1945, the minesweeper once again departed San Pedro Bay ‚Äî this time to participate in the initial invasion of Luzon. The four-day voyage to the beaches at Lingayen Gulf was punctuated by a number of Japanese air assaults. An inconclusive air- to-surface battle on the night of 2 January was followed by the first attack in earnest on the 3d. Shortly after dawn, a formation of A6M Zeroes pounced on the convoy. One near-miss of the oiler caused a fire amidships. All ships joined in a withering fire that discouraged suicide runs; and, consequently, no ship suffered a direct hit. The next morning, enemy planes approached the formation, but combat air patrol downed some and chased others away. On the 5th, general quarters sounded five times before noon, but Triumph observed no planes. Later, three warships peeled off to chase two Japanese destroyers sighted off the convoy's quarter. The enemy ships, however, managed to escape. At 1700, a formation of Aichi D3As hit the task force. Six of them attempted suicide crashes, but only one came close to its target ‚Äî an LCI ‚Äî which lost its mast in the encounter. Early the next morning, the force reached its destination off the beaches at Lingayen Gulf. Between 6 and 9 January, Triumph conducted pre-invasion sweeps of the assault areas in Lingayen Gulf. Though the main task force was subjected to incessant enemy air attacks, the minesweeper continued her mine-sweeping almost unmolested. Each night, she retired from Lingayen Gulf and took up screening station for the transports and cargo ships. On the 9th, the ground troops stormed ashore at Lingayen, and Triumph kept a close watch for enemy submarines and suicide boats. She remained in Lingayen Gulf until the 14th ‚Äî riding at anchor during the last three days of that period ‚Äî and then got underway with a Leyte-bound convoy of LST's and LCI's. After transiting the Sulu Sea, the Mindanao Sea, Surigao Strait, and Leyte Gulf, the Allied ships arrived in San Pedro Bay on the 19th. She remained there until 25 January when she headed out to resume action off Luzon. She reached Subic Bay and swept its coastal waters. On 4 February, she departed and headed back to Leyte, stopped at San Pedro Bay from 8 to 13 February, then put to sea once again on her way to the Marianas. = Duty with the Fifth Fleet = Triumph entered Apra Harbor, Guam, and reported for duty with the U.S. 5th Fleet. Two days later, she set a course for Ulithi, the staging area for Operation Iceberg, the invasion and occupation of the Ry≈´ky≈´s. She arrived at Ulithi the following day and began a period of rest, repairs, and rehearsals. Early in the afternoon of 19 March, Triumph sailed put of the lagoon at Ulithi with the Ryukyu Islands invasion force. When she arrived at her destination early on the morning of the 24th, Triumph and her division mates joined the and a patrol craft in minesweeping operations. On the 26th, the destroyer struck a mine, and it caused explosions in her forward magazine which ripped off most of her forward section. Two ships of Triumph's unit proceeded to assist the stricken warship but managed to rescue only 172 members of Halligan's 325-man complement. The following day, the division swept 15 mines of which Triumph claimed three. On the 28th, her formation endured its first air raid of the campaign when three enemy planes dived in to attack. The formation shot all three done. The minesweeper continued sweeping operations through the end of the month. She and her colleagues concluded their mission on the eve of the landings, 31 March, and began duty with the task force's antisubmarine screen. At 0600 the following morning ‚Äî April Fool's Day and Easter Sunday rolled into one ‚Äî landing craft started their move shoreward; and, soon thereafter, the first wave of U.S. Marines and soldiers hit the beaches on Okinawa. = Screening for kamikazes = During the ensuing four months, Triumph alternated screening duties with minesweeping operations. On several occasions during that time, she became directly involved in the incessant air attacks launched by the Japanese against the invasion force. On 16 April, when received a kamikaze hit, Triumph was soon at hand to rescue three men blown overboard in the action. The minesweeper herself almost required such assistance on the 18th when a Nakajima B5N torpedo bomber apparently tried to crash into her. Near sunset, he came in from astern up the port side, passed under her port yardarm, and splashed down not far from Triumph. The air raids continued, but their primary targets remained the radar picket destroyers. Consequently, Triumph experienced few actual surface-to-air engagements. On 11 May, while she patrolled off Ie Shima, she brought two enemy planes under fire but could not definitely claim credit for the one splashed by antiaircraft fire. Combat air patrol accounted for the other one. Between mid-May and mid-June, she executed her patrols and sweeps under relatively calm circumstances. = Under attack by a torpedo plane = On 15 June, however, she experienced another potentially fatal adventure. At dusk, Triumph was patrolling north of Kerama Retto when an enemy torpedo bomber executed a near-perfect run on her. Initially, the plane was thought to be friendly, though the radarman continued to track the unidentified aircraft just in case. The pilot lined his plane up with the moon, made a well-executed approach, and launched his torpedo. Two sharp-eyed sailors on board Triumph spied the torpedo splash, raised the alarm, and the warship immediately went hard to starboard to evade the torpedo. It passed in her wake, a scant 30 yards astern. Darkness precluded any real antiaircraft response, so Triumph resumed her patrols. Three days after that attack, the minesweeper put into Kerama Retto for supplies and upkeep. Triumph remained in Kerama Retto through the end of June. On the 30th, she got underway to rehearse for sweeps into the East China Sea. Those preparations continued until Independence Day when she sortied with Task Unit TU 39.11.6. She arrived in the assigned area with the rest of her unit on the 5th and conducted a highly productive, eight-day sweep unimpaired by Japanese air activity. She returned to Buckner Bay, located on the western coast of Okinawa, on Bastille Day. There she replenished and refueled over a three-day period before returning to the East China Sea to resume mine-sweeping operations. However, just before beginning that mission, she was detached from the East China Sea minesweeping force and was ordered to report to task force TF 39 for further orders. On 17 July, she was forced to leave the anchorage at Buckner Bay to evade a typhoon. After serving in the antisubmarine screen of the ships forced out of the anchorage, the warship returned to Buckner Bay on 21 July and remained there, awaiting orders, until 5 August. On that day, she stood out of the bay as a unit in the screen of a convoy of tank landing ships. = Japan capitulates = Two days later, she took PGM-11 in tow after the latter ship suffered an engine casualty. On the 11th, Triumph parted company with the convoy to tow PGM-11 into Apra Harbor, Guam. With and YMS-341 in escort, the minesweeper entered Apra Harbor on the morning of 12 August. Three days later, she received word of the Japanese capitulation. Triumph remained at Guam for a month undergoing repairs. She departed on 12 September to participate in the occupation of Japan and former Japanese possessions. She served her entire tour of occupation duty at Okinawa, arriving there on 18 September and departing again on 19 October.  Stateside overhaul and decommissioning  After stops at Guam and Hawaii, she returned to the United States at San Francisco, California, on 15 December. She underwent an extensive overhaul at the Kaiser shipyard at Richmond, California, from 19 January to 12 June 1946 and then began operations along the west coast. That duty continued until Triumph was placed out of commission at San Diego, California on 30 January 1947.  Peacetime operations  Triumph remained in reserve at San Diego until early 1952. After extensive preparations during the late fall of 1951 and the winter of 1952, she was recommissioned at San Diego on 28 February 1952. The warship reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet early in April and ultimately to the Atlantic Fleet on 19 May. Operating out of Charleston, South Carolina, the minesweeper served along the southern portion of the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean until mid-September when she deployed to the Mediterranean for service with the U.S. 6th Fleet. Following another tour of duty in the western Atlantic early in 1954 and a second deployment to the Mediterranean during the winter of 1954 and 1955, Triumph began preparations for deactivation in the spring of 1955. On 7 February 1955 she was redesignated MSF-323. On 29 August 1955, Triumph was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida.  Exit from U.S. service  There, she remained until late in 1959. During that period, she changed designations again on 4 December 1959 when she was redesignated Coastal Minelayer MMC-3. Late in 1959, the decision was made to transfer her to Norway under the Foreign Military Assistance Program.  HNoMS Brage (N49)  On 27 January 1961, she was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy. Her name was struck from the U.S. Navy List on 1 March 1961. She served the Norwegians as Brage until 1978.  Awards  Triumph was awarded six battle stars for World War II service.

Soon after birth, he was recognized by the 13th Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the previous Taktser Rinpoche, who was \\"one of the thirty or so reincarnated lamas who were a part of Kumbum's tradition.\\" On September 5, 2008, Norbu, 86, died at his Indiana, US, home after illness for many years. He was survived by his wife Kunyang Norbu, and 3 sons. Taktser Lama Thubten Jigme Norbu's predecessor as the Taktser Rinpoche, known as Taktser Lama, was Norbu's and his brother the 14th Dalai Lama's paternal grandmother's elder brother, in other words their great uncle. One of the 30 or so reincarnated lamas who were part of Kumbum Monastery's tradition, he had been recognised as the Taktser Lama some time in the 1860s, taken from his family and raised and educated at Kumbum.Thondup, Thurston 2015, pp.5-8. Kumbum is a monastery of the Gelugpa tradition. \\"During the turmoil of the Manchu decline\\", Taktser Lama left Kumbum to live in Mongolia for several decades at the end of the 19th century. Mongolians being fervent devotees of the Gelugpa school, he \\"developed quite a devoted following there.\\" Thanks to his Mongolian disciples' generous offerings, at the start of the twentieth century he returned to Kumbum Monastery a wealthy lama; he was said to have owned 10,000 camels. Taktser Lama then utilised his newly accumulated wealth to benefit his family in Taktser village, including the parents of his eventual successor Thubten Jigme Norbu. He bought back 45 acres of land they had lost when Manchu troops, in quelling a late-nineteenth century rebellion had destroyed the entire village of Taktser and driven the family away to live in caves in poverty. They were also enabled to build a new, large home where Thubten Jigme Norbu as well as the future 14th Dalai Lama were eventually born.Thondup, Thurston 2015, pp.3, 4, 6 et seq. At this time, Taktser Lama came to know the 13th Dalai Lama, who twice stayed long periods at Kumbum, firstly to avoid the Younghusband Expedition to Lhasa in 1904 and again in 1909 when returning to Lhasa after a trip to Beijing. By his support of the Dalai Lama's reform at Kumbum Monastery and his strict re-enforcement of monastic discipline, which had degenerated, Taktser Lama won the Dalai Lama's respect but became unpopular with his fellow monks; when the Dalai Lama left for Lhasa Taktser Lama also left for some years. He returned to Kumbum and Taktser by the time of Thubten Jigme Norbu's parents' wedding in 1917, and died there a year or two later.Thondup, Thurston 2015, pp.6-8. The search for the reincarnation The deceased lama's monastic staff were responsible to search for the next incarnation. Guided by omens and hints the lama might have given before his death, they sought suitable boys recently born in the area. A shortlist was made and sent to the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, a journey of several months, for divination as to the right candidate. The Dalai Lama's response was that the reincarnation was not on the list since he had not yet been born. When Norbu's mother Diki Tsering gave birth to a girl on 1920 her own mother, hoping it would be a boy and a successful candidate to be chosen as the lama, became so distressed and disappointed that she fell ill and died.Thondup, Thurston 2015, pp.8-9. Birthplace home of eldest brother Thubten Jigme Norbu, Tenzin Gyatso- the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, 2nd eldest brother Gyalo Thondup, eldest sister Tsering Dolma The search resumed but after another year of compilation, whittling down the names and travelling to Lhasa to seek a decision from the Dalai Lama, the second shortlist met with the same answer. Now it was the aging search leader's turn to become sick with distress and disappointment on the way back to Kumbum from Lhasa, and he also died.Thondup, Thurston 2015, p.9. A new manager was appointed to take his place and meanwhile, in 1922, Diki Tsering gave birth to a son. This time his name was added to the next shortlist, the third, and at last the response from the 13th Dalai Lama was positive - Diki Tsering had given birth to the incarnation of Taktser Lama and Thubten Jigme Norbu became Taktser Rinpoche.Thondup, Thurston 2015, pp.9-10. In the late 1930s, the original family name of Taktser changed for the other family members. Gyalo Thondup wrote, \\"My family was officially anointed into the aristocracy with my brother's ascension to the Dalai Lama's throne.

A large part of the Sydney public came to believe that Dean was innocent and that his wife and her mother had conspired against him. Although Dean was very likely guilty, his death sentence was commuted and he was later released on a free pardon. He was subsequently convicted of perjury and spent nine years in jail. Early life Dean was born in Albury, New South Wales and worked as a blacksmith in Sydney from about 1880. He worked for the North Shore Steam Ferry Company from about 1884 and received a master's certificate in 1888. In 1890, he became night master of the Possum, operating between Circular Quay and Milsons Point. He was popular with his passengers and on four occasions dived into the harbour to save passengers from drowning. Attempted murder charge In March 1894, Dean married Sarah Annie Gaynor, known as Mary Seymour, and daughter of Catherine Asbury, known as Caroline Seymour, who has been transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1852 for pickpocketing. The Deans settled in North Sydney and soon had a daughter. The Deans' marriage was strained by the presence of Dean's mother-in-law, and Mrs Dean was not happy about her mother's eviction in January 1895. Dean was charged with attempting to murder his wife in March on the basis of his wife's claimed symptoms and evidence of both arsenic and strychnine in lemon syrup and tea and medicines administered by Dean and fortunately preserved for the police investigation. Despite the unsatisfactory nature of some of the evidence, especially a lack of evidence for Dean buying or possessing the poisons, but under strong pressure from Justice Windeyer to come to a verdict, the jury found Dean guilty and the judge sentenced him to death. Royal commission Nevertheless, public opinion quickly turned against the verdict, particularly noting the behaviour of Windeyer, who was already known as a \\"hanging judge\\" as a consequence of the Mount Rennie rape case. As a result, in May the Government appointed a Royal Commission composed of Francis Edward Rogers QC, Dr Philip Sydney Jones and Dr Frederic Norton Manning to consider the case. Paddy Crick and Dean's lawyer, Richard Meagher, presented abundant evidence to the Royal Commission that Seymour had been a procuress, brothel-keeper and pickpocket. The doctors found that the evidence was compatible with self-administration by Mrs Dean, presumably to incriminate Dean, while Rogers dissented strongly. As a result, the Government released Dean on a free pardon at the end of June and he was put in charge of a bigger ferry, the Wallaby. Perjury and conspiracy On 18 July, Meagher boasted to Julian Salomons that after Dean's sentencing he had pretended to Dean that the police had found out where he had purchased the poison and Dean had admitted his guilt and named the chemist, R. J. Smith. Although Dean's confession to his lawyer was a matter of solicitor-client privilege, Salomons found himself compelled to pass on this information to the Attorney General, Jack Want. Rumours of Dean's confession began to circulate. In September, Want was questioned on it, but he declined to comment. On 24 September, Dean petitioned Parliament to clear his name and next day Want read Salomons' account of Meagher's conversation to the House. Although Meagher, who had meanwhile been elected as the member for Sydney-Phillip, vigorously denied the conversation in the House, Smith admitted giving Dean arsenic. As a result, Dean, Meagher, Crick, Meagher's assistant, Daniel Green, and a witness, Jane Reynolds, were charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Dean was also charged with perjury and later signed a full confession to the charge, which he subsequently withdrew. Dean was found guilty of two charges of perjury and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. Meagher and Dean were found guilty of conspiracy, but these convictions were quashed on appeal. Dean was released from Goulburn Gaol in December 1904 with remissions for good behaviour and returned to his job as ferry boat captain. He returned to the Riverina in 1913 and died of endocarditis in Hay, survived by his daughter. Popular culture The story was filmed by the ABC in 1981 as the TV movie The Dean Case.

Craig (December 10, 1933 ‚Äì May 8, 2007) was a writer known for his Martha's Vineyard mysteries. Biography He was born in Santa Monica and raised on a cattle ranch near Durango, Colorado. In 1951 he attended Boston University intending to become a minister, and got a degree in 1957. While at BU, he studied poetry with Robert Lowell, who quickly persuaded him that he had no future in that field, and turned to studying prose with Gerald Warner Brace, who encouraged him to write fiction. He taught English and Journalism at Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts from 1962 to 1965, and at Wheelock College in Boston until 1999, at which point he retired to become a full-time writer. He was invited to join the Olympic fencing squad, but had to decline due to a knee injury. He died May 8, 2007 after a brief fight with cancer. He is survived by his wife Shirley, two children (Kimberlie and James) and five grandchildren. His first novel, Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn, was published in 1969, and is not a part of any series. His second and subsequent novels have all been a part of the J.W. Jackson series, all of which are set on Martha's Vineyard. J. W. Jackson is a true 20th century hero. J. W. Jackson fights evil in the guise of corrupt land developers, the odd nefarious tourist, and people who kill or threaten his friends or acquaintances. Although J. W. Jackson never asks for his idyllic life on Martha's Vineyard with his lovely family to be disrupted, he consistently finds himself having to clear his own name, his friends' names, and keeping his family safe. Yet, in between his happenstance crime fighting, J. W. Jackson enjoys the fine but simple things in life: freshly caught seafood, cooking, good friends, family, outdoor showers, and a job well done. J. W. Jackson is quite reminiscent of John D. MacDonald's hero Travis McGee. To be sure of tasting J. W. Jackson's delightful recipes, look at Delish: The J. W. Jackson Recipes.

He began his career with Ipswich Town but failed to make the first team and played for several non-league teams before joining Queens Park Rangers, where he made his Football League debut in December 2004. He later joined Stevenage Borough, but followed manager Mark Stimson to Gillingham in late 2007. He represented the England National Game XI and played at Wembley Stadium in the final of the FA Trophy. Early life Miller was born in Hemel Hempstead, but grew up in the Monkwick district of Colchester, where his family still lived as of 2004. He attended The Stanway School in the town. At the age of 16 he joined Ipswich Town as a trainee. At around the same time he was called up to represent Northern Ireland at under-18 level, qualifying by virtue of the fact that his maternal grandfather was born in the country. Career =Canvey Island= Miller proved unable to break into Ipswich's first team and was permitted to undertake a trial with Southend United in August 2000. He played for the Essex club's reserve team, which led to him being offered a professional contract, but Alan Little was dismissed as the club's manager shortly afterwards, and the offer of a contract was withdrawn. In October 2000, Miller was released from his contract at Ipswich and dropped into non-league football, joining Canvey Island of the Isthmian League. In the 2000‚Äì01 season he made 36 appearances for the \\"Gulls\\" and helped the team reach the final of the FA Trophy, although he was an unused substitute for Canvey's victory over Forest Green Rovers in the final. The following season, he was a key member of the team that finished second in the Isthmian League Premier Division, playing 48 times in total. =Grays Athletic and Aldershot Town= In August 2002, after two final games for Canvey, he moved to Grays Athletic in a swap deal which saw Jeff Minton go in the opposite direction. Although he played 26 times for Grays in the 2002‚Äì03 season, scoring six goals, he was made available for transfer at the end of the season. He joined Gravesend & Northfleet in September 2003, but played just four games for the club before moving on to Aldershot Town a month later. His form at Aldershot won him The Non-League Paper's Young Player of the Year award for the 2003‚Äì04 season, and also led to a call-up to the England National Game XI in February 2004, although it was to be his only cap for the semi-professional national team. In November 2004, Miller played for Aldershot against the reserve team of Queens Park Rangers, the team he had supported since childhood. =Queens Park Rangers= Rangers manager Ian Holloway, who had received promising reports about Miller from scouts, was sufficiently impressed to sign the player after watching him in person. Although the exact amount was undisclosed, the transfer fee was the highest ever received by Aldershot Town. Miller made his Football League debut on 4 December 2004 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Nottingham Forest, and played in more than half of the team's remaining league matches that season. By late September 2005, he had made just one league appearances since the start of the season, and was sent to Peterborough United on what was originally intended to be a three-month loan. A month later he was recalled to Loftus Road, but he was not to feature again in the Rangers team. =Stevenage= In January 2006, he had a brief trial with Oxford United but the following week he joined Stevenage Borough of the Conference National, initially on an 18-month contract. Miller featured regularly for Stevenage, and was in the starting line-up for the 2007 FA Trophy final, the first competitive match at the new Wembley Stadium, in which Borough came back from two goals down to beat Kidderminster Harriers and win the Trophy. =Gillingham= Stevenage manager, Mark Stimson, was appointed as the new manager of Gillingham in November 2007, and quickly moved to sign Miller and his teammate John Nutter on loan. Miller made his debut for the Kent club in the 2‚Äì1 home win over Hartlepool United on 24 November 2007, and signed a permanent contract in January 2008, set to keep him at the club until 2010. During the team's ultimately unsuccessful struggle to avoid relegation from League One in the 2007‚Äì08 season, Miller was identified as a key player and singled out for praise by Stimson, who said \\"If eight players play like Adam Miller we won't be in this position but if we've only got one or two we will be\\". The following season, he remained a regular selection in Stimson's team, acting as captain in Barry Fuller's absence, but injury kept him out of the team at the end of the season as Gillingham clinched a place in, and ultimately promotion through, the play-offs. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, however, he failed to hold down a regular place in the team, and in November 2009 went to Dagenham & Redbridge on a one-month loan. Miller's debut for Dagenham came on 14 November in a 1‚Äì0 away win against Accrington Stanley. He returned to Gillingham at the end of his loan spell, but Stimson announced that the club was considering paying off the remainder of the player's contract. Despite this, Miller played regularly during the remainder of the 2009‚Äì10 season. =Cambridge United and retirement= At the end of the season he left Gillingham and joined Cambridge United. Miller played several times at the start of the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, but was seriously injured in early September against Eastbourne Borough. Two years later, he announced his retirement from football as a result of the injury. He subsequently set up a company leasing luxury cars to other footballers.

Biography Whitton was born in London, Ontario, Canada in August 1923. From a young age he showed an aptitude for music, studying piano and cello. He continued to study until World War II was declared. Like many other young Canadians, he enlisted, joining the 4th Royal Canadian Field Artillery Regiment (4RCA). Stationed in England until shortly after the D-Day invasion, Whitton and his unit joined the extremely heavy fighting during the Caen/Falaise battles in Normandy. As part of the 2nd Infantry Division, 2nd Canadian Corps, 4RCA suffered heavy casualties in the terrible battles of Normandy, Belgium, the Netherlands (Woensdrecht), and the Rhineland (Hochwald). In addition, it was the target of the first ever bombing attack by a jet plane (an ME262). With 4RCA, Whitton operated in the dangerous role of forward observation signaler, which placed him on the front line with the infantry. Casualty rates among artillery observation teams were very high, but he survived the long odds to see VE day. With the fighting over in Europe, he decided to answer an audition call for forces musicians. Playing on a borrowed instrument, he was successful, even though he'd been unable to practice since the start of the war. He was transferred to an entertainment unit in England where he spent the next year as a cellist with a forces orchestra. On his return home he decided to take a music degree from the University of Toronto. Cornelius Ysselstyn, a famed Canadian cellist at the time, accepted Donald as a student. Donald once again showed great promise. He went on in the next five years to study with many great cellists, including the genius cellist-editor Leonard Rose. The National Arts Center, in Ottawa, home of the National Arts Center Orchestra Whitton auditioned for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) in 1948, and was awarded the position of principal's assistant the following year. While in Toronto he also joined the CBC Radio Orchestra, and several other small music groups. In 1960 Donald quit the TSO, but remained in the CBC radio orchestra. For the next eight years Whitton remained in Toronto, recording with various artists, and playing in dozens of chamber groups, as well as joining the group Lighthouse. In 1970 Donald heard about the newly created National Arts Centre Orchestra, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and that it was in need of musicians. Donald, without hesitation, left both Lighthouse, and the CBC radio orchestra to audition for the NACO, 450 km north-east of Toronto to Ottawa. He landed the top spot as the founding principal cellist of the NACO. During this period Donald took up teaching, and taught some of Canada's current cellists, the most notable of these being; Julian Armour,and Jan J√§rvlepp. In 1984 he was a tone judge for the Violin society of America's international competition. After retiring from the NACO, in 1994, he continued to teach, and contribute to the Ottawa arts scene. He died in Ottawa in April 2018 at the age of 94.DONALD RICHARD WHITTON Obituary A CBC reviewer of the performing arts wrote about Whitton: \\\\- James Wegg Lighthouse From 1968 to October 1970, Whitton performed with the Canadian rock group Lighthouse, alongside fellow Canadian Howard Shore in the string/brass section. He was one of the original members of the group, but when he had to leave for Ottawa to continue his classical music career, he had to leave Lighthouse as well. Lighthouse was one of the last non-classical music groups he was involved with. Paul Hoffert, the co-founder of Lighthouse, who had the idea for the string/brass section, was disappointed that Don had to leave. \\\\- Paul Hoffert Playing style Whitton was known for his diversity of styles of playing. He could easily switch from classical to baroque, and many other styles, even including rock and jazz. He was an excellent ripieno musician, but also had the skill of a virtuoso for solo performances. He led his section with direction, and was a strong leader. He is particularly noted for the magnificence of his large, rich, and beautiful tone quality. Recording and radio =Recording= Whitton frequented the recording studio with various artists, both classical, and non-classical. He compiled 7 jazz recordings between 1967 and 1969, with various artists. He recorded with Glenn Gould, on his version of several Bach Brandenburg concertos. In 1973 he played with the Ron Collier orchestra on Duke Ellington's album \\"Collages\\". Whitton was also the member of several music groups which recorded music including: The Jack Groob Trio and the Jack Groob String Quartet, the Toronto Baroque Ensemble (1958‚Äì1963), and the Pack Quartet. =Radio= During Donald's tenure in both of his major orchestras; the National Arts Centre Orchestra, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he was being broadcast nationwide on a regular basis. Also while he was a member of the CBC Radio Orchestra, he would perform on radio weekly. He would also occasionally perform for a radio jingle.

The show features all four of the original Monkees and was the last time Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork appeared together in a new television program. Michael Nesmith wrote and directed the program. This special is not to be confused with the similarly titled documentary from 1997, Hey, Hey, We're the Monkees. Overview The special shows the now middle-aged Monkees trying to come up with a new plot (apparently they have all been done by now) while still trying to catch their big break. Much of the music featured in the special came from the quartet's 1996 album Justus, along with a medley of their hits from the 1960s. As of June 2019, it has not been made available on DVD or Blu-ray. Game show host Chuck Woolery makes a cameo. Plot While Davy tries to get the band to rehearse for a very important gig, Micky seeks to find a gimmick to give them an identity, and Mike debates the necessity for anything other than just hanging out together. Various potential story lines present themselves, but each time the Monkees are quick to point out that they have already used that plot line in a previous episode and do not want to do it again. Several musical sequences and comedy sketches are included. Development The project began when ABC approached Monkees manager Ward Sylvester in November, 1996 about producing a Monkees retrospective. Sylvester countered with the idea of doing a special in the format of an episode from the original series. Post production delays caused the final print to be delivered too late for advanced screening, but the marketing push included ads run during some of ABC's most popular shows at the time.  Premise of the special  The news media have described the premise of the special as, \\"the group had kept filming TV shows since its weekly TV series on NBC was canceled in 1968, but they didn't have any place to air them.\\" Micky Dolenz has said, \\"We thought we'd go all the way and do another TV episode.\\" References External links * Category:The Monkees Category:Music television specials Category:American Broadcasting Company television specials Category:1997 television specials ","title":"Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees"},{"id":"11204948","title":"Coral Springs Fire Department"},{"id":"11204963","text":"Robert Francis Perrino, also known as \\"Bobby Perrino\\" (February 9, 1938, Fordham, Bronx - May 4, 1992, Port Richmond, Staten Island) was the superintendent of deliveries at the New York Post from the 1970s until 1992, when he was murdered. He was a Bonanno crime family associate of Italian- American descent. Perrino was the leader of \\"The Post Circulation Crew\\" (as referred to by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau in court) which allegedly existed to control the circulation department of (the now defunct) New York Post printing press and distribution center (located at 210 South Street) by means of extortion, coercion, the falsification of business records, larceny and bribery. The crew also became involved in loan sharking, drug trafficking and the selling of stolen firearms. Biography Robert Perrino was the son-in-law of Bonanno crime family underboss and former consigliere Nicholas Marangello. He was born to American born parents of Italian immigrants from Gallo Matese, Italy, and not to be mistaken as a relative of Anthony Peraino. Perrino was a former New York Police Department (NYPD) law enforcement officer policing the Little Italy, Manhattan neighborhood during an unremarkable twenty-year career. His retirement from the NYPD and introduction to his subsequent career in organized crime remains a mystery to authorities. Perrino lived in Knickerbocker Village, where his father-in-law Nicholas Marangello and other members of the Bonanno crime family resided. He maintained daily contact and worked alongside other crime family members at the New York Post, a mere three blocks away from his home. Perrino was hired in the late 1960s as the Superintendent of Deliveries for the New York Post to replace Bonanno crime family mobster Anthony Michele. Later, he moved from Knickerbocker Village to a waterfront mansion on Huntington Bay in Huntington, New York with his wife and children. After his disappearance, police discovered in his Huntington home a stunning arsenal of firearms, including some with erased serial numbers, plus $105,000 in loose currency. Months following his disappearance, Perrino's picture was broadcast on the television show America's Most Wanted, but the show elicited no tips. Law enforcement officials and most Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union (NMDU) workers assumed Perrino had been murdered. He was declared legally dead in 1997. The Post Circulation Crew The Post Circulation Crew was formed in the early 1960s before Perrino was hired at The Post by Albert Embarrato to replace Anthony Michele, another Post Circulation Crew member who had been promoted to Director of Circulation. Perrino led a double life as a powerful and influential associate of the Bonanno crime family for twenty years, unknown to his fellow \\"citizen\\" employees and family members. During his employment, Perrino allowed the New York Post labor force to be infested with button-men, or \\"sidewalk soldiers\\", from the Bonanno crime family. The Post Circulation Crew included three \\"made\\" soldiers: Richard Cantarella, Joseph D'Amico and Albert Embarrato. They among other members of the Bonanno crime family were all employed by The Post and received wages, some of which amounted to $50,000 a year. An estimated 51 crime family members were no-show employees while others were partially or wholly present at the newspaper distribution plant including Cantarella, D'Amico and Embarrato. For years, through the influence of Joseph Massino and Salvatore Vitale, Perrino while leading The Post Circulation Crew organized the theft of thousands of newspapers every day and sold them to non-connected independent street vendors and stores in Manhattan and Staten Island at a rate of twenty to thirty cents each; the standard newspaper price at the time was fifty cents. Although Perrino helped the Bonanno crime family orchestrate many rackets at the newspaper they demonstrated no interest in the actual content that was printed by The Post and did not control its content. With Perrino's help the Bonanno crime family became entrenched at the newspaper ‚Äì the mobsters organized loan shark operations to employees, sold small quantities of stolen firearms, ammunition and drugs. Perrino collected the loan shark debts by threatening his indebted employees with chukka sticks. While the Bonanno crime family operation prospered under Perrino, the New York State Marshals began probing La Cosa Nostra infiltration of the New York Post and Perrino became the main target and focal point of a labor racketeering probe brought on by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. As the investigation came to show promise, the U.S. Marshals planted a transmitter in Perrino's office at the distribution plant. While Perrino was Superintendent of Distribution, he employed The Post Circulation Crew that consisted of truck drivers, Richard Cantarella, Paul Cantarella, Frank Cantarella, Joseph D'Amico, Albert Embarrato, Vincent DiSario, Gerard Bilboa, Anthony Vitale, John Vispisiano (NMDU business agent for the New York Post), Douglas LaChance (former NMDU president), Anthony Turzio, John Vispisiano (NMDU business agent for the New York Post), Michael Diana (NMDU business agent), John Nobile, Armando DiCostanzo, Leo D'Angelo (general foreman at Metropolitan News Company), James Galante, John Piervencenti (assistant foreman), Thomas Carrube (assistant foreman), Michael Alvino (NMDU President from 1989 to 1991), Joe Torre (Citiwide News Corporation business agent), Anthony Michele (Director of Circulation), Gerard Bilboa (newspaper foreman), Corey Ellenthal (newspaper foreman), Michael Fago (newspaper foreman), and for a short period of time, Salvatore Vitale's youngest son, and Anthony Vitale who worked as a delivery truck drivers. Relationship with the Mafia Richard Cantarella and Robert Perrino spoke freely in his office about racketeering matters. He was also a close friend of Bonanno crime family capo Albert Embarrato. A wire transmitter in Perrino's office caught saying to Richard Cantarella, as reported in The Village Voice's article \\"The Newspaper Racket: Tough Guys and Wiseguys in the Truck Drivers Union\\", \\"Al Walker's the smartest guy in the whole Bonanno family, and he's the toughest fuckin' guy\\". Perrino was in regular contact with Bonanno crime family underboss Salvatore Vitale to whom he handed over the weekly proceeds from their racketeering ventures. When law enforcement finally came down on the newspaper's crooked workforce, Perrino was not arrested or indicted although Bonanno crime family members and several others were caught in the sting operation ‚Äì making Salvatore Vitale nervous. A secret video camera placed in Perrino's office in late 1991 caught Perrino discussing his important role in the Bonanno crime family. It also taped Perrino and other Post employees discussing the finer points of bootlegging, newspaper theft and passing around loaded pistols to admire. Perrino was heard advising truck drivers, \\"It's bad to carry a fuckin' piece in the car, you'll have to shoot everybody\\", as reported in \\"The Newspaper Racket: Tough Guys and Wiseguys in the Truck Drivers Union\\" in The Village Voice. Although Salvatore Vitale had not been named in the initial indictments, he thought that Perrino could become an informant because of his immense involvement with the rackets at the New York Post. Perrino's father-in-law, Nicholas Marangello, was incarcerated for racketeering as a result of the Donnie Brasco investigation at the time of his execution. Two of Perrino's executive co-workers, including his friend Director of Circulation, Anthony Michele, pleaded guilty to racketeering. A number of Bonanno crime family connected members of the Newspaper Mail Deliverer's Union later pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and were imprisoned at Riker's Island. Salvatore Vitale suggested that Richard Cantarella replace Perrino shortly before the racketeering investigation was revealed. Botched execution Richard Cantarella told Perrino that he needed to attend a meeting and discuss the case against the Bonanno crime family and the investigation of their infiltration of the New York Post. He accompanied Michael \\"Mickey Bats\\" Cardella to a Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, social club owned by Bonanno mob associate Anthony Basile, a relative of Long Island discoth√®que owner and Lucchese crime family associate Phillip Basile. As Perrino entered the club, Baldassare Amato, waiting inside the social club, shot Perrino several times in the back of the skull and immediately left with Cardello. Frank Lino was then notified of the completion of the execution and sent over a \\"clean up team\\" that consisted of his cousin Robert Lino, Frank Ambrosiano and Anthony Basile. Upon entering the club, the trio were shocked to discover that Perrino was still alive, and one of the team stabbed Perrino to death with an ice pick to the chest. Frank Lino, angered at the botched execution, would later tell Salvatore Vitale in Joey Massino: The Rise and Fall of the Last Godfather, \\"Tell the guy that did the shooting to make sure that next time that the victim was dead\\". Perrino's car was later recovered nearby with a parking ticket in the windshield. According to The Last Godfather, the men wrapped Perrino's corpse in a carpet and drove to a construction company, Commercial Brick, located at 98 Jewett Avenue in Port Richmond, Staten Island owned by Anthony Basile and buried him underneath the cement floor of the store. Several weeks later, one of his limbs was said to have risen up from the floor, making the mobsters dig a deeper grave. Years later, Anthony Basile was indicted on drug trafficking charges; Salvatore Vitale and Joseph Massino feared Anthony would become an informant and reveal Perrino's gravesite. His remains were removed from the cement floor and buried again. The New York Post labor racketeering investigation After the disappearance and later confirmed murder of Perrino, only a handful of Bonanno crime family members and associates involved in the News and Mail Deliverer's Union were incarcerated for racketeering at Riker's Island. Many of those convicted in the Robert Morgenthau probe went back to work at the New York Post, some elevated to management positions following their release. Albert Embarrato was recruited as a potential partner by former New York Post owner Steve Hoffenberg. Bonanno crime family mobster Armond DiCostanzo went on disability leave from the newspaper, but his allies retained influence when The Daily News moved its plant to Jersey City, where Douglas LaChance, a close friend of Perrino and Albert Embarrato was named circulation manager. Perrino's body remained hidden until December 2003, when his skeleton was found embedded in the concrete floor of the construction company. He had been shot multiple times in the head. Richard Cantarella, Frank Ambrosiano, Baldassare Amato, Frank Lino and Robert Cardello were all convicted of the murder. Bonanno crime family don Joseph Massino was not indicted for involvement in Perrino's murder because he was in prison at the time. At the trial, Perrino's daughter, Nicola Langora, testified that on the night Perrino disappeared, that she ate pizza at their home and watched the movie All Dogs Go To Heaven on television with his granddaughter. \\"I asked him why he was in a hurry, and he said he had to meet somebody in Brooklyn\\", Langora testified, \\"I asked him who he had to meet, and joking around he said, 'What's the matter-are you writing a book?'\\" That was the last time she saw her father. Hit men convicted After an eight-week trial on October 27, 2006, Bonanno crime family capo Baldassare Amato, a cousin of Bonanno crime family capo Cesare Bonventre, and Bonanno crime family mob associates Stephen Locurto and Anthony Basile, were convicted of murdering Robert Perrino, Joseph Platia and Sebastiano DiFalco along with Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act charges. The government's case was tried by Assistant U.S. District Attorneys John Buretta, Jeffrey A. Goldberg and Andrea Goldbarg. Trivia After Perrino was indicted for fraud and racketeering, he was represented by the criminal attorney Matthew Marie. In 2004, Marie would represent Richard Cantarella, one of Perrino's accused executioners. During the Perrino murder trial Marie argued that his client had nothing to do with Perrino's murder ‚Äì Cantarella was found not guilty. Discrepancies in articles Perrino is wrongfully labeled as being the son of former Bonanno crime family underboss Nicholas Marangello in The Last Godfather: The Rise and Fall of Joey Massino and several online articles, when this is impossible, Marangello and Perrino having two different last names. In Simon Crittle's book, he also mistakenly changes Perrino's name to \\"Anthony Perrino\\". Perrino is sometimes labeled as a mobster with the Bonanno crime family, which is false because of his history working with law enforcement.

In the Manx Notebook it is given as 1788, but his obituary in the Isle of Man Times of 20 March 1847 lists the year as 1787. His father, Gilbert McHutchin, came from Scotland and arrived on the Isle of Man around 1785 (although again this is subject to conjecture).http://www.isle-of- man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/v054p385.htm Initially taking employment as an agent for Sir George Moore, Speaker of the House of Keys, McHutchin's father held the post of Constable of Peel for many years. His mother, Catherine Dawson, came from a Manx family; McHutchin's parents married in 1785. The marriage of Gilbert McHutchin and Catherine Dawson produced four children: two sons and two daughters. McHutchin's younger sister, Margaret, married John Gell and was the mother of Sir James Gell. His brother, Gilbert, also became and advocate working at the Rolls Office where the young James Gell was articled. Although not from a wealthy background, McHutchin received the rudiments of his education as a free scholar at Peel Grammar School and then from the Reverend Joseph Stowell and John Stowell, brothers of Thomas Stowell. McHutchin was subsequently articled to Thomas Stowell who was appointed Clerk of the Rolls in 1804 following the death of Mark Hidesley Quayle. =Professional career= In 1808 McHutchin was admitted to the Bar and was a successful lawyer. His ability in his chosen field had already been noticed when, at the age of 20, he was appointed Secretary to the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Cornelius Smelt, prior to the completion of his studies. The position was one which he held for two years. In 1810 McHutchin was appointed to the Seneschal's Office in Douglas, and following the appointment as Second Deemster of Thomas Gawne in 1816, McHutchin was appointed High Bailiff of Douglas under the patronage of the Duke of Athol, the appointment being made with a view to using him judicially with regard to the green crop tithe question. McHutchin was appointed Deemster to the northern district in 1819 and in 1821, on the death of Thomas Stowell, he was made the Clerk of the Rolls at the unusually early age of 34. =Personal life= McHutchin married Sabrina Rann (1792 - 1847) in 1811; she was the daughter of Colonel James Rann, a retired military officer who had spent the majority of his wealth (¬£8,000) in raising and equipping a regiment for the defence of the Crown during the American War of Independence and Napoleonic Wars. The marriage produced twelve children (eight sons and four daughters). Three of his sons died during his lifetime. McHutchin was highly regarded by his peers; he rose from a modest rank in life to the heights of the judiciary by his own efforts and application. He was opposed to the reform of the Isle of Man's system of government, and particularly to democratic elections for the House of Keys, a position he held until his death. =Death= In the winter of 1846-47 HcHutchin's health began to decline, and this was hastened by the death of his wife on 10 February. He died at his home in Castletown, aged 59Mona's Herald, Wednesday, March 17, 1847; Page: 3 on 14 March 1847; just over a month after the death of his wife.

It extends for just under on a northeast‚Äìsouthwest alignment from an intersection with New York State Route 17 (NY 17) in the village of Sloatsburg to a junction with U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and US 202 south of the Bear Mountain Bridge in the town of Stony Point. Most of the highway is located in either Harriman or Bear Mountain state parks, except for a small stretch near its western end. Ownership of Seven Lakes Drive is split between three entities, two of which are also responsible for maintenance of the road. Sections of Seven Lakes Drive and several other roads in the park system (Tiorati Brook Road, Lake Welch Drive, and Perkins Memorial Drive), are closed for the winter from December through March. Route description The western terminus of Seven Lakes Drive in Sloatsburg. As its name implies, Seven Lakes Drive passes by seven lakes located at various points along the road. From south to north, the lakes are Lake Sebago and Lake Kanawauke in the towns of Haverstraw and Tuxedo; Lake Skannatati and Lake Askoti in Tuxedo; Lake Tiorati in Tuxedo and Woodbury; Silver Mine Lake in Woodbury; and Queensboro Lake in Highlands. The highway is not owned by a single entity; instead, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC), and the village of Sloatsburg all own different parts of the road. In Sloatsburg, the westernmost from NY 17 to Waldron Terrace is state-owned and maintained as New York State Route 981G (NY 981G). Seven Lakes Drive is locally owned and maintained for another east to Johnsontown Road. The remaining is owned by PIPC and maintained by NYSDOT as New York State Route 987E (NY 987E). The NY 981G and NY 987E designations are reference routes and are unsigned. =Southern Rockland County= Seven Lakes Drive begins at an intersection with NY 17 in the village of Sloatsburg. It heads northeast through the community, crossing over the Ramapo River and intersecting a handful of residential village streets before passing under the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87). The highway continues to run past homes on the opposite side of the Thruway overpass, where it intersects Johnsontown Road, a road that parallels Seven Lakes Drive for before terminating at a dead end adjacent to the parkway. Seven Lakes Drive meets a short, unnamed connector to Johnsontown Road just later, at which point the road begins to pass through undeveloped wooded areas on its way across Stony Brook and into Harriman State Park. Seven Lakes Drive sign at the western entrance to Harriman State Park Just east of the Stony Brook bridge, the Pine Meadow Trail begins on the southeast side of the highway. The road loosely parallels Stony Brook as it heads deeper into the park and serves the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center. The center is also a trailhead for the Reeves Brook Trail, with the Pine Meadow Trail passing the facility on its southeast side. Past the visitor center, the parallel alignments of Seven Lakes Drive and Johnsontown Road come to an end as the latter ends at a cul-de-sac adjacent to the former. The dead end serves as the trailhead for two hiking trails: the Blue Disc Trail, which starts just before the cul-de-sac; and the White Bar Trail, which begins at the cul-de-sac's northern end. Not far from this point, the Kakiat Trail crosses Seven Lakes Drive on its way toward Kakiat County Park. Continuing on, Seven Lakes Drive begins to parallel the White Bar Trail as both head to the northeast through the rugged, forested terrain of the park. Eventually, the White Bar Trail splits from the parkway and proceeds to the north while Seven Lakes Drive remains on a generally northeasterly track. Stony Brook reaches its source at Lake Sebago, the first of the seven lakes the road passes, where the Tuxedo‚ÄìMount Ivy Trail briefly follows the parkway before turning off to the east. The highway runs along the southeastern shore of Lake Sebago for just over , passing a lakeside parking area and a ski trail. Past the lake, Seven Lakes Drive makes a slight turn to the north before intersecting with the Lake Welch Parkway by way of an elongated traffic circle. The road reverts to a northeasterly routing past the junction, briefly paralleling the Rockland‚ÄìOrange county line as it runs past Lake Kanawauke's southeastern edge. Seven Lakes Drive crosses the county line near the lake's midpoint. =Orange and northern Rockland counties= Signpost for Seven Lakes Drive at Tiorati Circle The parkway continues to follow Lake Kanawauke to Kanawauke Circle, where it intersects with County Route 106 (CR 106), formerly part of NY 210. Not far from the junction, Seven Lakes Drive passes two more lakes, Lake Skannatati to the west and Lake Askoti to the east, as it slowly curves to the north. The highway crosses the Long Path near Lake Skannatati and connects to a parking area near Lake Askoti. Another trail, the Red Cross Trail, traverses Seven Lakes Drive at the northern end of Lake Askoti. About a half-mile (0.8 km) north of Lake Askoti is Lake Tiorati, located along the eastern edge of the road. As the highway runs past the lake, it turns back to the northeast and eventually reaches Tiorati Circle at the northern tip of the lake. The junction serves as the east end of Arden Valley Road, the west end of Tiorati Brook Road, and the trailhead of the Lake Tiorati Trail. Seven Lakes Drive continues northeast from the circle, intersecting with several trails, including the Ramapo‚ÄìDunderberg Trail and the Appalachian Trail. A crossing of the Menomine Trail follows as the parkway turns to the east. The Menomine Trail follows Seven Lakes Drive for a short distance to nearby Silver Mine Lake on the south edge of the road. The Silver Mine Ski Road, a trail paralleling most of the lake, meets the parkway at the eastern lakeshore. From here, the road parallels Queensboro Brook for roughly to reach the Long Mountain Roundabout adjacent to Queensboro Lake, the last of the seven lakes from south to north. Here, Seven Lakes Drive directly intersects US 6 and indirectly connects to the nearby Palisades Interstate Parkway (PIP) by way of ramps leading away from the circle. Seven Lakes Drive follows US 6 through the circle, joining the route as both roads merge onto the PIP. Seven Lakes Drive's eastern beginning at US 9W and US 202 in Bear Mountain State Park The overlap with both US 6 and the PIP lasts for just as Seven Lakes Drive leaves the PIP at the next junction, a trumpet interchange southwest of Bear Mountain. Seven Lakes Drive heads eastward from the interchange, running along the southern base of the large mountain as it intersects with several trails and passes seamlessly into the adjacent Bear Mountain State Park. Just east of the park boundary, the highway crosses the county line once again, re-entering Rockland County near its northernmost point. At the southeastern edge of Bear Mountain, Seven Lakes Drive begins to descend a series of switchbacks as it enters the Hudson River valley. The road gradually makes its way to the western edge of the river, where it ends at an intersection with US 9W and US 202 due east of Bear Mountain's and just south of the Bear Mountain Bridge. History The cul-de-sac at the east end of Johnsontown Road (CR 97), located adjacent to Seven Lakes Drive The origins of Seven Lakes Drive date as far back as the 1920s, by which time the basis for the modern road was in place from the southern tip of Lake Kanawauke to the banks of the Hudson River. At its south end, the highway connected to Johnstown Road, which continued southwest to Sloatsburg and northeast to Lake Welch. The section of Johnstown Road southwest of this point was also known as Stony Brook Drive, named for its proximity to Stony Brook, a tributary of the Ramapo River. Stony Brook and Seven Lakes drives were renamed Seven Lakes Parkway . Although the road's name has since reverted to Seven Lakes Drive, the Seven Lakes Parkway name is still used by NYSDOT for the section owned by PIPC and designated NY 987E. In 1960, the state of New York made plans to construct a extension of Seven Lakes Drive leading southwest from Kanawauke Circle to Sloatsburg. As planned, it would be built in the then-Stony Brook Drive corridor as a straighter alternative to the original highway. The new road was completed in 1962, lessening or eliminating several curves that existed in the old route. Most of what was originally Stony Brook Drive was dismantled as part of the route's construction; however, a section near Sloatsburg was left intact and renamed Johnsontown Road. The road only connects to Seven Lakes Drive at its west end; the east end of the highway is at a cul-de-sac adjacent to where Seven Lakes Drive merges into Stony Brook Drive's old right-of-way. The portion of Johnsontown Road outside of the Sloatsburg village limits is now maintained by Rockland County as CR 97.

Bacchiocchi (29 January 1938Endtime Issues #194 gives this date approximately ‚Äì 20 December 2008The Bacchiocchi Family, Passing of Dr. Bacchiocchi Spectrum Magazine 21 December 2008.) was a Seventh-day Adventist author and theologian, best known for his work on the Sabbath in Christianity, particularly in the historical work From Sabbath to Sunday, based on his doctoral thesis from the Pontifical Gregorian University. Bacchiocchi defended the validity of the Feasts of the Lord, situated in Leviticus 23, he wrote two books on the subject. He was also known within the Seventh-day Adventist church for his opposition to rock and contemporary Christian music, jewelry, the celebration of Christmas and Easter, certain dress standards and alcohol.  Biography  Bacchiocchi was born in Rome, Italy on 20 January 1938.WHO IS DR. SAMUELE BACCHIOCCHI? He later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in theology from Newbold College in England, which was followed by a Master of Arts and Bachelor of Divinity at Andrews University in Michigan, United States; finishing in 1964. Bacchiocchi moved with his wife Anna to Kuyera, Shashamane district, Ethiopia, where he lectured in Bible and history. In 1969 they returned to Rome where Bacchiocchi studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was the first non-Catholic to be admitted since its establishment in the 16th century.Who is Dr. Samuele Bacchiocchi? He completed a Doctoratus in Church History in 1974 on the subject of the decline of Sabbath observance in the Early Christian church, based on his research in the Vatican libraries. Bacchiocchi taught in the religion department of Andrews University from 1974 till his retirement in 2000. He taught theology and church history. He regularly presented seminars worldwide, and wrote many self-published books and articles on biblical topics. He was married to Anna Gandin Bacchiocchi. They had three children. In May 2007, Bacchiocchi announced that he had developed liver and colon cancer.Endtime Issues Newsletter No He ultimately succumbed to 4th stage liver cancer, shortly after midnight, Saturday 20 December 2008, the day before what would have been his 47th wedding anniversary. He was with his three children and his wife.  Impact  In 1977 Bacchiocchi published From Sabbath to Sunday, documenting the historical transition from the Saturday Sabbath to Sunday in the early Christian church due to social, pagan and political factors, and also the decline of standards for the day.From Sabbath to Sunday: A Historical Investigation of the Rise of Sunday Observance in Early Christianity Biblical Perspectives The book made an impact on the wider academic community outside Adventism, as well as within Adventism. Prior to his work, Seventh-day Adventists had focused on the role played by either the Pope, or by Roman Emperor Constantine I in the transition from Sabbath to Sunday, with Constantine's law declaring Sunday as a day of rest for those not involved in farming work. Subsequent to Bacchiocchi's work, Adventists have emphasized that the shift from Sabbath to Sunday was a more gradual process. Bacchiocchi has also been influential in the Worldwide Church of God (and its offshoots), which supported Sabbath-keeping until 1995, and also other Sabbath keeping groups.  Beliefs  Bacchiocchi supported the conservative lifestyle habits of Seventh-day Adventists, such as a vegetarian diet; abstinence from alcohol, coffee, and tea; and avoidance of rock music in church worship services. In one newsletter he submitted an hypothesis, expanding upon the Adventist (and historical Protestant) teaching that the antichrist is the papacy, to also include Islam,\\"Islam and The Papacy in Prophecy\\", Endtime Issues no. 86, 6 July 2002 which he reported \\"generated a lot of hate mail\\".\\"Church Growth Experiments in Secular Australia\\"  Controversy over academic awards  There was some controversy in the 2000s over Bacchiocchi's claim to have received the awards summa cum laude (Latin for \\"with highest honors\\"), the Pope's Gold Medal, and an official Roman Catholic imprimatur (Latin for \\"let it be printed\\") for his doctorate at the Pontifical Gregorian University. An official letter claimed Bacchiocchi did not receive these awards.Barbara Bergami, then General Secretary of the Pontifical Gregorian University, to Bishop James A. Murray of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalamazoo in Michigan, which covers the area where Bacchiocchi lived. As republished by Bacchiocchi in \\"Bacchiocchi Responds to False Allegations\\". Endtime Issues newsletter #159, self-published by Bacchiocchi. Bacchiocchi says the controversy was initiated by Stephen Korsman, who runs a website \\"Catholicism and Adventism\\" By 2007, both parties agreed he had received a summa cum laude and the Pope's Gold Medal, for the Licentia [a phase of the doctoral program]; and only a magna cum laude for the Doctoratus itself. Bacchiocchi defended his actions by claiming the difference between the Licentia and the Doctoratus is small and would not be understood by most English speakers.Gianfranco Ghirlanda, the Rector (President) of the university, official letter to Bacchiocchi, 23 February 2007; as republished by Bacchiocchi.

Angwin, CA: LLT Productions, 1983 Rivera was a fundamentalist Christian who claimed to be a former Jesuit priest, however this point and many of his other claims are discredited by most authors.

(1596 in EdinburghDurie timeline ‚Äì 1680 in Kassel) was a Scottish Calvinist minister and a significant intellectual of the English Civil War period. He made efforts to re-unite the Calvinist and Lutheran wings of Protestantism, hoping to succeed when he moved to Kassel in 1661, but he did not accomplish this. He was a prolific preacher, pamphleteer, and writer. Early life He was the fourth son of the exiled Scottish presbyterian minister Robert Durie; John was brought up in the Netherlands, at Leiden, attending the university there.Turnbull, 1947, p. 127. In a letter to Hartlib he writes that he was brought up in Leiden and attended the French College there. He was in Cologne, at the Walloon Church, 1624-6,J. T. Young (1998), Faith, Alchemy and Natural Philosophy: Johann Moriaen, Reformed Intelligencer, and the Hartlib Circle, p.11. and subsequently at ElblƒÖg (Elbing). He was a close associate of Samuel Hartlib, a native of ElblƒÖg, whom he met there, and shared his interest in education.Hugh Trevor-Roper, Three Foreigners, p.251 in Religion, the Reformation, and Social Change; online PDF . According to Richard Popkin,Popkin, The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy/Columbia History (1998/9), p. 334. another key influence was Joseph Mede, from whom Dury took a method of scriptural interpretation; this interpretation has been challenged by recent research claiming that Dury developed his \\"Scriptural Analysis\\" before meeting with the works of Mede.L√©chot, Un christianisme sans partialit√© (2011), p. 417-419. While at Elbing he translated an anti- trinitarian work of Samuel Przypkowski into English.http://www.belreform.org/eng/katlarcuk_eng.php From 1628 Dury petitioned Gustavus Adolphus for help in the cause of Protestant unity.Hartlib Circle Catalogue Number 66 He spent much time from 1630 to 1661 wandering through Europe, working for ecclesiastical peace between Calvinists and Lutherans.Turnbull, 1947, pp.132-291. Through an introduction from Hartlib, he also met Comenius, who spent some years in Elbing as well. Up to 1633, Dury had Anglican support from George Abbot. In that year, Abbot died and was replaced by William Laud, with whom Dury had a much more difficult relationship;Hugh Trevor-Roper, Archbishop Laud (1962 edition), pp. 264‚Äì9. Christopher HillA Nation of Change and Novelty (1990), p. 83. states Laud had no use for the efforts of Comenius, Dury and Hartlib to reunite Protestants. Dury was ordained in 1634, and went to Sweden, supported by 38 English Puritans.Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1965), p. 100. Hill lists among Dury's English supporters Richard Holdsworth (p.100), John Stoughton (p.101), John Pym (p. 107); Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye and Henry Burton (p.308). The networking of Dury and Hartlib in the 1630s brought them close to Oliver Cromwell, through Oliver St John (a relation by marriage, and friend) and the Godmanchester preacher Walter Welles, a neighbour.PDF, p.4; John Morrill, The Nature of the English Revolution (1993), p. 138 ‚Äì Welles had studied in Leiden. Dury then travelled widely in northern Europe, and was tutor to Mary, Princess of Orange in the Hague.Concise Dictionary of National Biography He had a long though unproductive meeting with Ren√© Descartes in 1635;Jonathan Israel, The Dutch Republic (1995) p.589; see also Popkin, p. 334.Jonathan Israel, The Radical Enlightenment (2001) p.204, speaking of 30 years later, describes Dury as anti-Cartesian and a correspondent of Johann Heinrich Heidegger. also in the Netherlands he was an associate of Adam Boreel and Petrus Serrarius, and an influential figure. In Civil War and Commonwealth England At a key moment in English and European politics, Dury in August 1641 published Concerning the Work of Peace Ecclesiastical, urging Protestants to unite across national boundaries. This work was dedicated to his patron Sir Thomas Rowe, and had been written in 1638. In 1639 Viscount Mandeville was writing to Dury, in the context that the situation in particular of German Protestants was being mooted and linked to the possibility of the English and Scottish churches could organise or broker such a union.John Adamson, The Noble Revolt (2007), p. 361. In 1641, Dury and Comenius came to England; an invitation had been mooted in a sermon by John Gauden in 1641, at the start of the Long Parliament.Hill, Intellectual Origins, p. 104. The backers of the scheme to bring Comenius then included John Pym and Lord Brooke as well as Mandeville. Dury gave a well-known sermon to the Parliament on 26 November 1645, Israels Call to March out of Babylon into Jerusalem.Christopher Hill, The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution (1993), p. 111. He was given an official appointment, as tutor to the younger children of Charles I;Hill, Intellectual Origins, p. 102. from 1646 these had been in the care of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland. After the war in England had ended, he argued both for religious toleration, and for acceptance of the Parliamentarian regime. He incurred the displeasure of the Westminster Assembly, to which he belonged,A List of the Members of the Westminster Assembly for his part in the 1648 publication (with Hartlib and John Goodwin) in translation of part the theological work Satanae Strategemata of Jacob Acontius on toleration.Hill, Intellectual Origins, p. 102; Hill, Milton, p. 289. He called on the Ranter Abiezer Coppe to repent,Christopher Hill, The Experience of Defeat (1984), p. 42. and helped in drafting his recantation.Hill, A Nation of Change, p. 201. He provided arguments in pamphlets of March and October 1649 for supporting the Rump Parliament.Richard Tuck, Philosophy and Government 1572‚Äì1651 (1993), pp. 257‚Äì259. HillChristopher Hill, A Turbulent, Seditious, and Factious People (1988), p. 314; also Hill, Experience p. 101. places Dury with Anthony Ascham and Marchamont Nedham as propounding the theory that Parliament had legitimacy conferred by God because it held power de facto. Barbara Lewalski calls Dury's arguments 'Hobbesian'.The Life of John Milton (2000) p. 249; Hill, Intellectual Consequences p. 21 endorses the idea that these theorists anticipated Thomas Hobbes. HillSome Intellectual Consequences of the English Revolution (1980), p. 73. considers that the failure of Cromwell's plan to create a unified Protestant church in England of the 1650s put paid to Dury's ecumenical ideas. In 1652 he translated John Milton's Eikonoklastes into French as Eikonoklastƒìs, ou, R√©ponse au livre intitul√© Eikon basilikƒì. In 1655 Milton quoted from letters of Dury in his Pro se defensio contra Alexandrum Morum.Barbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton (2000), p. 324. In 1654 he was sent as a diplomat by Oliver Cromwell to Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.Trevor-Roper, Three Foreigners, p.283., letter 19 To Evangelical Churches, given as March 1654, with signatories. In 1652/3 he had travelled with Bulstrode Whitelocke to Sweden.Hill, Intellectual Origins, p. 103. He also worked with Whitelocke as a deputy librarian, from 1649, of the collection going back to Jane Lumley. His book of 1650 on librarianship, sometimes said to be the first such work, came out of his experience in this post.Hill, Intellectual Origins, p. 215. Jews and Hebraists Dury met Manasseh ben Israel in 1644, and heard from him an account of Antonio de Montesinos's alleged discovery of the Ten Tribes in America.E.g. . See Tudor Parfitt, The Lost Tribes of Israel (2002), pp.74‚Äì7. Dury wrote in favour of a Hartlib Circle project, for a College of Jewish Studies.Young, p.43. The first college for Jewish studies (1984), Richard Henry Popkin. Parliament was lobbied for funds. The proposed faculty were Johann Stephanus Rittangel, Christian Ravius and Menasseh ben Israel. In 1649 Dury addressed a further inquiry to Manasseh on the subject of the Ten Tribes, which resulted in the publication of The Hope of Israel. In 1650 appeared Thomas Thorowgood's Jewes in America; Dury read it in manuscript, and contributed to later editions. He included information on the Karaites, in whom he had a particular interest, from Rittangel.Mordecai L. Wilensky, Thomas Barlow's and John Dury's Attitude Towards the Readmission of the Jews to England, The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Ser., Vol. 50, No. 3 (Jan. 1960), pp. 256‚Äì268. Dury is considered to have been one of those around Cromwell influencing the decision to allow Jews to enter England officially (they were expelled by Edward I).Hill, Intellectual Origins, p. 102-3. He was the cautious author of a pamphlet of 1656, A Case of Conscience: Whether It Be Lawful to Admit Jews into a Christian Commonwealth, in it he laid down certain conditions that Jews must fulfil in order to be admitted (no blasphemy or proselytism etc).Scult, Mel (1978). Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century. Brill Archive. pps.26-27. To a question put to him by Hartlib, as to the general lawfulness of their admission, Dury replied in the affirmative; but from the point of view of expediency he considered that circumstances as to a particular time and place might render their admission unwise. Irenicism and millenarianism Dury's long ecumenical efforts have earned him a name as an irenicist.S. Mandelbrote, John Dury and the practice of Irenicism, in Religious change in Europe 1650‚Äì1914: Essays for John McManners, ed. N. Aston, 41‚Äì58. (Oxford, 1997); A. Milton, 'The Unchanged Peacemaker'? John Dury and the politics of Irenicism in England, 1628‚Äì1643 in Samuel Hartlib and Universal Reformation: studies in intellectual communication, ed. M. Greengrass, M. Leslie, and T. Raylor, 95‚Äì117. (Cambridge 1994). This territory he shared, to an extent, with his contemporary Hugo Grotius. Dury made contact with Grotius through his follower Samson Johnson (1603‚Äì1661).PDF, p.181, note. That relationship soured, since Dury had a hand in Johnson's dismissal as chaplain to Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, suspected of Socinianism.Hugh Trevor-Roper, From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution (1992) pp.71‚Äì2. According to Trevor-Roper, :Dury, like Grotius, was an idealist, but their ideals were not quite the same. He wished to achieve not reunion for the peace of the Church but union of all Protestants for the holy war: in particular union of Lutherans and Calvinists.Hugh Trevor-Roper, From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution (1992) p.68. Dury‚Äôs irenicism and philosemitism can be understood as interrelated aspects of an expansionist Protestant cause focussed on Britain, Ireland, continental Europe, and the Atlantic world. In this understanding, the Portuguese Jews (and American Indians) appear as victims of Spanish Catholicism in desperate need of Protestant help.Fradkin, Jeremy, (April 2017). Protestant Unity and Anti-Catholicism: The Irenicism and Philo-Semitism of John Dury in Context. Journal of British Studies, 56(2), pps. 273-294. doi:10.1017/jbr.2017.2 Richard Popkin and Jefferey Jue have argued that Dury was a millenarian. His millenarian views are said to have pointed to 1655 as apocalyptic.Parfitt, p.80. Against that view it has been argued that Dury warned readers about attempts to predict the onset of the Millennium. In his preface to the millenarian tract Clavis Apocalyptica Dury seems to come out against the idea of a political millenarianism and to defend a more \\"moral\\" interpretation of millenarianism.Gibson, The Apocalyptic Thought of John Dury: A Reassessment, Journal of Ecclesiastical History, Volume 60, No. 3, July 2009 pp.1‚Äì15; see the more careful interpretation of L√©chot, Un christianisme sans partialit√© (2011), p., p. 447-454. Position in the Hartlib Circle Pansophism and alchemy Alchemy was within the interests of the Hartlibian group,Young, p. 161. and both Dury and his wife were involved. In 1649 they were quizzing Worsley on distillation.William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe (2002), Alchemy Tried in the Fire, p. 244. In the first half of 1651 Dury was a witness to George Starkey, in an apparent transmutation,Young p. 229. and then recommended Starkey to Moriaen.Newman and Principe, p. 246. Family In 1645 he married Dorothy Moore, an Irish Puritan widow. Dorothy Durie (sic) was a noted writer on education and the role of women in the church. The match was arranged by Dorothy's niece, Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh (1615‚Äì1691), daughter of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, and wife of Arthur Jones, 2nd Viscount Ranelagh.Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (1977), p. 146; Hill there also confirm the Lycidas connection. To be precise on the somewhat tenuous relationship, Arthur Moore, Dorothy's first husband, and Frances Jones n√©e Moore, mother of Arthur Jones, were half-brother and half-sister, children of Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore of Drogheda, by different wives. By this marriage Dury was connected to Robert Boyle, brother of Lady Ranelagh. Their daughter Dora Katherina Dury (1654‚Äì77) was Henry Oldenburg's second wife.Hill, Milton, p. 215.

The new town currently falls mainly within the Longstanton ward of South Cambridgeshire District Council. Northstowe has been in development for around 15 years and through varying political administrations. Originally proposed to be \\"an exemplar of sustainability in the use of renewable energy resources and reducing carbon emissions\\",Hansard, 21 Jan 2008 : Column 1536W, Sustainable Development: Northstowe Northstowe will still have many exemplar features including a Sustainable urban Drainage Scheme (SUDS) and bus only link. The Northstowe site is northwest of the city of Cambridge, between the villages of Oakington and Longstanton. The Northstowe development is being led by Homes England the successor body to Homes and Communities Agency and the developers Gallagher Estates (part of L&Q;). Northstowe  Home From its inception circa 2003 Northstowe was expected to be a low-carbon development, with the knowledge gained being applied elsewhere in the region. In January 2008, however, Yvette Cooper, Minister for Housing and Planning Department for Communities and Local Government at the time, confirmed in Parliament that Northstowe had not been adopted as an eco-town because the 2007 planning application submitted \\"predate[s] the eco-towns programme\\", and because it would not be zero-carbon. Northstowe is linked to Cambridge and St Ives by the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway which was opened in 2011. In 2012 outline consent was given to Gallagher to progress with the first phase of 1500 homes, a primary school, road improvements and a local centre. The primary school, The Pathfinder Church of England School, opened its gates to pupils in September 2017, taking pupils from the new housing development between Willingham and Longstanton and other local villages. In 2015 outline consent was also agreed in principle to build a further 3,500 homes, a town centre, 3 more schools including a secondary school education campus and a link road to the A14, plus a road linking the town to the Guided Busway. The homes in phase two cannot be occupied until a major A14 upgrade is completed which started in 2016 and was completed in early 2020. In 2017 outline consent was granted for phase 2, a further 3,000 homes, a town centre, 3 more schools including a secondary education campus and a link to the A14, plus a road linking the town to the Guided Busway. The homes in phase 2 could not be occupied until the major A14 upgrade had been completed. The first new homes at Northstowe were occupied in April 2017. In May 2020 the outline planning applications for the third and final phase were submitted for 5,000 homes, consisting of 4,000 homes on phase 3a an 1,000 homes on phase 3b. History A lake on the Northstowe development site. The site covers Oakington Barracks on the former RAF Oakington, a World War II airfield which was used for Short Stirling bomber forces and other assorted units. It was used for flight training until the 1970s. From 2000 to 2010\\"Oakington immigration centre's future plans\\", BBC News, 2010-11-11, accessed 14 July 2011 the barracks was leased to the Home Office for use as the Oakington Immigration Reception Centre. In the phase one Local Management Study, published in February 2006 it was suggested that a community-based energy company might be formed, owning assets such as wind turbines or combined heat and power plants for the benefit of the town, perhaps based on the models of the Vauban district of Freiburg, Germany, and the cooperative energy companies of Denmark and Sweden. Car clubs, cycling and walking were also envisaged. In March 2006 the site was acquired by English Partnerships who subsequently became the Homes and Communities Agency and now Homes England.Government land deal will ease Cambridgeshire housing pressure , English Partnerships, published 2006-03-27, accessed 15 May 2007 In March 2007 planning inspectors recommended that Northstowe should consist of 10,000 homes rather than the 8,000 originally planned, and ruled that a country park need not be incorporated. The news was greeted with concern by many in the area who feared further expansion in the future. In the same month Yvette Cooper, Minister for Housing and Planning Department for Communities and Local Government at the time announced that Northstowe would be designed with energy and water efficiency standards up to 50% above conventional buildings. On 13 May 2007, Gordon Brown went further, announcing that the housing on the development would be built to zero-carbon building standards if he were elected to succeed Tony Blair as leader of the Labour Party. In response, local Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge, David Howarth, called on the Chancellor to allow local authorities to impose zero-carbon standards on other developments too, and to provide a serious investment in public transport for the new eco-towns. A planning application for the new town was submitted to South Cambridgeshire District Council on 19 December 2007. Plans included the construction of around 9,500 homes, a town centre area, schools and employment areas. In January 2008, however, Cooper confirmed in Parliament that Northstowe had not been adopted as an eco-town because the planning application \\"predate[s] the eco-towns programme\\", and because it would not be zero-carbon. In November 2008 it was announced that the scheme would be delayed by at least a year due to the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. In March 2008 the Cambridge Cycling Campaign submitted a formal objection to the Northstowe planning application due to the inadequate cycling and walking provision. In June 2009 the scheme was not included in the first round of schemes to be given the go-ahead because it did not score highly enough for sustainability; only one scheme, Rackheath eco-town, received an 'A' and was approved. In December 2009 it was announced that the scheme was 'back on the government's eco-town list' because elements had been redesigned to meet even higher sustainability standards. In February 2012 a Development Framework Document was adopted by the planning authority to progress the town. The plan envisages a maximum of 10,000 new homes created in phases building services and facilities along with homes piece by piece, the first being to the north adjoining the existing Longstanton park-and-ride site owned by Gallagher and the second on the former Government-owned barracks. In October 2012, the first phase of the new town was approved by South Cambridgeshire council. with completion of the whole town envisaged after about 25 years. In December 2014 the government announced that the Government-owned land at Northstowe could be a test location for a new government initiative that directly commissioned homes, overseen by the Homes and Communities Agency. First houses built by Bloor Homes In the 2015 United Kingdom budget on 18 March 2015, George Osborne confirmed the Government's intent to create a joint venture with a private sector partner to lead development on the Government-owned part of the town location. This initiative has subsequently not been pursued. The first building, a primary school, started on site in April 2015 and the first homes occupied in 2017. In 2015 outline consent was also agreed in principle to build a further 3,500 homes, a town centre, 3 more schools including a secondary school education campus and a link road to the A14, plus a road linking the town to the Guided Busway. Planning permission was granted in January 2017 The homes in phase two could not be occupied until a major A14 upgrade was completed . In April 2016, Bloor Homes was named as the first housebulder for the site with 92 new homes planned in a range of types and sizes up to five bedrooms. Northstowe was announced as an NHS Healthy New Town in March 2016. A Healthy Living Strategy for Northstowe was commended at the Landscape Institute awards 2018. In the spring of 2018 Homes England invested ¬£55 million to provide a new road linking the town to the upgraded A14 and other essential infrastructure to allow more homes to be built. In November 2018 the first phase of the secondary school was started and it was completed to welcome children for the academic year 2019-20. Northstowe Secondary College is operated by the Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust. In the spring of 2019 Homes England built their new regional office at Northstowe, designed and built off site using Modern Methods of Construction to help pioneer new techniques in the construction sector. In February 2020 a planning application was submitted to build a new heritage centre adjacent to the Homes England offices to showcase the historical artefacts found on site and more importantly during the construction of the nearby upgraded A14 As of May 2020 approximately 550 homes in Northstowe were occupied, with the Bloor Homes site completed and 5 active housebuilding sites: Bovis Homes, Linden Homes, Taylor Wimpey, and Barratt Homes as both Barratt and David Wilson Homes brands. Playing fields, allotments, and public spaces were under development. In 2020 Urban Splash in partnership with the Japanese construction company Sekesui are starting to build the first homes in phase 2 ‚Äì 406 homes built using innovative Modern Methods of Construction. In 2020 Homes England submitted a Town Centre Strategy, setting out the principles for a new town centre to be developed for the town. The Strategy proposes a shift away from a reliance on retail on its high street and instead focuses on the potential of creative industries, leisure, education, high-quality food and small-scale manufacturing. Public transport links Northstowe will be connected to the Cambridge guided busway, and will also be served by a light railway station for the proposed Cambridge Metro.

In 2020, a boy named Nathan Hrushkin discovered a dinosaur fossil at the canyon dating back to 69 million years.https://www.bbc.com/news/election- us-2020-54547987http://globalnews.ca/news/7399017/badlands-alberta-dinosaur- fossil-teen-nathan/ See also *Geography of Alberta References External links Category:Landforms of Alberta Category:Canyons and gorges of Canada Category:Kneehill County ","title":"Horseshoe Canyon (Alberta)"},{"id":"11205140","text":"Holy Ghost panel in the Great Gallery, Horseshoe Canyon, August 2009 photograph Horseshoe Canyon, formerly known as Barrier Canyon, is in a remote area west of the Green River and north of the Canyonlands National Park Maze District in Utah, United States. It is known for its collection of Barrier Canyon Style (BCS) rock art, including both pictographs and petroglyphs, which was first recognized as a unique style here. A portion of Horseshoe Canyon containing The Great Gallery is part of a detached unit of Canyonlands National Park. The Horseshoe Canyon Unit was added to the park in 1971 in an attempt to preserve and protect the rock art found along much of its length. History Part of the Great Gallery, February 2012 photograph Human presence in Horseshoe Canyon has been dated as far back as 9000-7000 B.C., when Paleo- Indians hunted large mammals such as mastodons and mammoths across the southwest. Later inhabitants included the Desert Archaic culture, the Fremont culture, and Ancestral Puebloans. Occupation by the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloans was relatively brief; it is believed that the canyon was abandoned by Native American peoples by 1300 A.D. The Great Gallery is one of the largest and best preserved collections of Barrier Canyon Style rock art. The gallery was a product of the Desert Archaic culture, a nomadic group of hunter-gatherers predating the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloans. The panel itself measures about long and high. The panel contains about 20 life-sized anthropomorphic images, the largest of which measures over tall. A Works Projects Administration produced reproduction of the paintings is located at the Natural History Museum of Utah. The Holy Ghost panel of the Great Gallery has been dated to between 400 A.D. and 1100 A.D. by dating two rockfall events of which one exposed the rock face the panel on which it was made and the second damaging part of the panel.Utah's famous Canyonlands rock art unexpectedly recent, By Brian Maffly, August 27, 2014, The Salt Lake Tribune The Great Gallery, Canyonlands National Park, October 2007 photograph Access The Horseshoe Canyon trailhead is located on the west rim of the canyon. It can be accessed from State Route 24 via of graded dirt road, or from Green River via of dirt road. Both routes include segments of road that may become impassable when wet. Visitors may camp at the west rim trailhead, on public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. A vault toilet is provided but there is no water available. Overnight camping is not permitted in Horseshoe Canyon inside the Park boundaries. To see the rock art, visitors must descend 750 vertical feet (228 m) to the canyon bottom and hike approximately . The hike from the West Rim trailhead to the Great Gallery is roughly round trip, and requires 3 to 6 hours to complete. The trail is fairly well marked, but reaching the Great Gallery requires a certain amount of stamina and endurance, particularly in the heat. Three other significant panels of rock art are passed en route to the Great Gallery.

He is U18 academy coach at Brighton & Hove Albion. Beard began his career at Millwall in 1991. He signed his first professional contract in 1993, and made his first-team debut shortly after. He spent two years at the club, scoring a memorable goal against Arsenal in an FA Cup victory in January 1995. He was transferred to Sheffield United ahead of the 1995‚Äì96 season, spending three years at the club. In 1998, he joined Southend United, who he had also spent time on loan at in 1997. He went on to enjoy regular first-team football with the Essex side over two spells, as well as having two spells at Kingstonian. In 2004, Beard moved to Spain to set up a youth academy for Spanish side UD San Pedro, eventually ending up as part of the playing squad. After two years in Spain, he returned to England to sign for Stevenage Borough, spending one year with the club and winning the FA Trophy as part of the first side to win a competitive cup final at the new Wembley Stadium in May 2007. Beard went on to spend time at AFC Wimbledon during the 2007‚Äì08 season, and the club were promoted to the Conference South via the play-offs during his time there. Following his playing career, Beard has gone into coaching and management, and has been first-team manager at Haywards Heath Town, Tooting & Mitcham and Loxwood respectively. He was named as U18 academy coach at Brighton in May 2017. Playing career Beard started his career with Millwall, joining the club's youth system in 1991 \\"straight from school\\". He was captain of the successful youth team that won the FA Youth Cup, beating Sheffield Wednesday in the final. During his time at youth level, he also helped the side win the Southern Junior Cup, as well as finishing runners-up in the South East Counties league. After impressing in the youth team, Millwall manager Mick McCarthy gave Beard his first professional contract in 1993. He made his debut as an 18-year-old, playing in Millwall's 4‚Äì1 victory against Watford. Beard went on to make 18 appearances that season, scoring one goal. During the 1994‚Äì95 season, he was a regular in the first-team, with the highlight of his campaign coming when he scored in Millwall's 2‚Äì0 win over Arsenal in an FA Cup third round replay at Highbury in January 1995. In the summer of 1995, Beard was transferred to Sheffield United for a fee of ¬£117,500, with Dave Bassett signing him. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2‚Äì0 loss to Tranmere Rovers in August 1995, and went on to make 56 appearances during his time at the club. At the start of the 1997‚Äì98 season, Beard was loaned out to Southend United for two months, making his debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Oldham Athletic. He went on to make ten appearances during the brief loan agreement. He returned to his parent club in January 1998, making four appearances during the second half of the campaign. Ahead of the 1998‚Äì99 season, Beard signed for Southend on a permanent basis. He was a regular during the season, making 40 appearances in all competitions, and earning the Player of the Year award at the end of the season. He remained at Southend for the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign, starting in the club's first game of the season, a 2‚Äì1 home win over Plymouth Argyle. He made 42 appearances during the season as Southend finished 16th in Division Three, scoring what turned out to be his only goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Hull City in November 1999. During his first spell at Southend, he made 82 appearances for the Essex side. He then signed for Football Conference club Kingstonian on a free transfer in July 2000. He made his debut for the side in a 1‚Äì0 home victory over Northwich Victoria on 19 August 2000, and made 29 appearances for the club during a season in which Kingstonian were relegated. The club did reach the Fourth round of the FA Cup that season, narrowly losing to Bristol City in a replay after the two teams had drawn at Ashton Gate, with Beard playing in both matches. He left the club at the end of the season, and subsequently rejoined Southend United two months into the 2001‚Äì02 season, making 17 appearances that season. Another season at Southend followed, during which he made 42 appearances, before leaving the club at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. He returned to Kingstonian for the following season, with the club playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division, scoring six times in 40 league games. At the end of the season, he travelled to Spain to set up a youth academy at Marbella based club U.D San Pedro in the Spanish Third Division, and ended up as part of the playing squad during his time there. After a two-year spell both playing and coaching in Spain, Beard signed for Stevenage Borough of the Conference National on 11 September 2006. On signing for Stevenage, Beard stated ‚Äì \\"I got my brother Matt to ring a few managers for me. Mark Stimson was one of them. Boro' hadn't started the season very well and he wanted to add some grit into midfield. So, I flew home, trained for a week to prove my fitness and then played for a couple of weeks for nothing\\". He had previously played alongside Stevenage manager Stimson at Southend. Beard made his debut for Stevenage in a 6‚Äì0 home victory over Stafford Rangers on 9 September, coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute in the club's first win of the season. He made his first start a week later in a defeat to Cambridge United, before scoring his first goal three days later in a 1‚Äì0 victory against Weymouth at Broadhall Way. Beard was almost ever-present during the campaign, making 49 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals. This appearance tally included eight appearances in the FA Trophy, with Beard playing every minute en route to Stevenage becoming the first team to win a competitive cup final at the new Wembley Stadium, beating Kidderminster Harriers 3‚Äì2 in-front of a competition record crowd of 53,262. Despite being a regular fixture in the side, he was released at the end of the season ‚Äì \\"I still felt I had another couple of seasons in me but Stimmo wanted to bring Johnny Martin in. I was gutted to leave\\". Following his release from Stevenage, Beard joined Conference South club St Albans City as player-assistant manager on 20 June 2007. He was assistant to Ritchie Hanlon, who stated ‚Äì \\"Mark has all the relevant coaching badges and I'm looking forward to working with him as he is someone I trust. He will bring experience to the team and is someone the other players can look up to\\". However, Hanlon was sacked just ten games into the 2007‚Äì08 season, and Beard subsequently departed too. He then signed for AFC Wimbledon of the Isthmian League Premier Division towards the latter stages of 2007, and he helped the side gain promotion to the Conference South, scoring once in 17 league appearances. He left Wimbledon at the end of the season, and then spent two years at Haywards Heath Town in the Sussex County League, making 56 appearances and scoring six times, as well as managing the side during the 2009‚Äì10 campaign. Following an injury crisis as manager of Tooting and Mitcham United, he briefly returned to playing during the 2010‚Äì11 season, scoring one goal in three games. Coaching career Beard gained his UEFA coaching badges in 2007, and already had previous experience of coaching in both Spain and Cyprus. He was appointed Director of Youth at Spanish Third Division side UD San Pedro, combining the position with his playing duties. With the aid of former Spurs midfielder Vinny Samways, Beard watched over seven academy teams before returning to the England when he signed for Stevenage. He was brought in to set up a youth academy at Sussex County League side Haywards Heath Town in 2008, and ultimately ended up managing the side during the 2009‚Äì10 season. He was appointed manager of Isthmian Premier Division team Tooting and Mitcham United in July 2010, spending 18-months in- charge, describing his tenure as \\"a great experience which will stand me in good stead for my future as a coach/manager\\". He left the club in December 2011, stating ‚Äì \\"It was on the cards for the last couple of months. It is down to the results, they haven't been good enough and for one reason or another we have not been winning games. It has been a struggle. Last season, we didn't have a lot of money and we worked hard with a whole lot of youngsters and, this year, too many things have been going on behind the scenes and affecting things on the pitch\\". Beard was appointed as youth team coach at League One club Crawley Town in February 2012. He spent two years coaching in the youth set-up at Crawley, before starting up his own academy in 2014, creating the Love The Ball (LTB) Sussex Academy. The LTB Sussex Academy joined together with Southern Combination Premier Division side Loxwood ahead of the 2014‚Äì15 season, providing a direct route for academy players to play first-team semi- professional football. After a year serving as head coach at the LTB Sussex Academy, Beard took over as manager of the Loxwood first-team in 2015. Half of his academy players were subsequently promoted to the Loxwood first-team. He combined the role of first-team manager at Loxwood alongside coaching the U15 and U16 sides at Brighton & Hove Albion. In March 2017, Beard left his role at Loxwood with immediate effect, due to a change in coaching responsibilities at Brighton. Two months later, in May 2017, he was promoted to U18 academy coach at Brighton. Personal life Beard was born in Roehampton. He is a Millwall supporter. He is the older brother of Matt Beard.

The tree is quite variable and has many recognised varieties, though some are also maintained to be separate species by certain authorities. The tree was recently discovered in the mountains of northern Vietnam, making that the southernmost extension of its range. Description Tsuga chinensis is a large tree with bark that is a blackish brown in colour. The scaly bark has irregular longitudinal breaks, and lenticels that are very inconspicuous. The outer bark is about 6 mm thick with alternating tiered layers of pale yellowish brown corky bark, and brown lignified fibrous bark. The newly formed periderm is a purplish red. The inner bark is about 4 to 5 mm thick and pale reddish brown in colour. It is fibrous in texture with minute, almost inconspicuous sclereid, or stone cell groups. The cambium as well as the newly formed phloem are nearly inconspicuous. Freshly cut wood is a pale yellowish white with inconspicuous wood rays. The branchlets that have leaf- cushions. The leaves are arranged spirally in a manner more or less 2-ranked. They are linear and flat in shape and olive green in colour. The upper side of the leaf is grooved and keeled, while the underside has 2 white stomatic bands. The apex of the leaves are emerginate and they measure 16 to 20 mm long. The petioles are crooked. The foliage is very similar to that of T. heterophylla, but T. chinensis has nodding shoots and the stomatic bands are paler and more sparse. Also the colour above is a paler yellowish-green. The stamenate flowers appear singly on one-year-old shoots, or in groups of 1 to 5 on two-year-old shoots. They are a dull purple in colour and measure about 8 mm. The pistillate flowers are terminal on a very short shoot. They nod, are rosy-purple and are about 6 mm in length. The mature cones are green, later turning to red-brown, long-ovoid in shape and measure 2 to 2.5 cm long by about 1 cm wide. They are pendulous and the cone scales are large and suborbicular with longitudinal streaks. The bracts are small and 2 lobed at the apex. The seeds are winged and measure about 7 mm long with the wing included. Range and habitat The range of T. chinensis begins in the west in Tibet and continues east into China, north to southern Shanxi province and south to Taiwan, Guangdong province and the north of Ha Giang province in northern Vietnam. In the very south of their range they are only found high in the mountains. For example, in Vietnam the tree is only found in mountains 1,300 to 1,700 metres above sea level. In China it is present at altitudes of 1,000 to 3,500 metres in the following provinces: Anhui, Fujian, southern Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, northern Guizhou, western Henan, western Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, southern Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. This comprises the southern half of the country with a few population farther north. It is found primarily in mixed forests near river basins and in mountains and valleys. In Taiwan it is found mainly in Nantou County and Taoyuan City at heights of 1700 to 3500 metres in mixed broadleaf forests. It can be found in Taiwans's Yushan National Park and Lalashan Preserve, as well as in China's Hailuogou Glacier Park in Sichuan province. Taxonomy There are a number of varieties of T. chinensis, though there is much dispute over which are valid and whether some constitute distinct species or not. All in all there are six varieties, though not all are accepted universally. These are: * T. c. var. chinensis is the type variety and occurs across most of the range in mainland China and Tibet. Its seed scales are pentagonal-ovate, subsquare, or suborbicular, while its branchlets are 1 mm in diameter and grey to yellow-grey in colour. The cones are ovoid and 1.5 to 2.5 cm tall by 1.2 to 1.6 cm wide. * T. c. var. formosana is the variety that occurs exclusively in Taiwan. Aljos Farjon, a conifer expert from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, considers this variety identical with the type, but according to Raven and Wu it differs from the type by having seed scales which are compressed orbicular to nearly semiorbicular. Otherwise, however, it is like the type. * T. c. var. patens is found only in western Hubei province on Changyang Xian. It differs in having brownish yellow to brown branchlets, which are between to 0.5 to 1 mm longer in diameter than the type. The seed cones also differ in being slightly larger, ovoid-globose in shape, and with seed scales that are smooth, shiny and almost square. This variety is recognized by Raven and Wu. * T. c. var. forrestii is treated as a separate species, namely Tsuga forrestii, by some authorities. The cones are larger, more slender and narrow-ovoid to ovoid-cylindric. The branchlets are slightly thicker, while the seed scales are narrowly ovate or oblong with the exposed part striate and glabrous with a thickened margin. Regardless of its taxonomic status, it is considered threatened by the IUCN. It occurs only in northeast Guizhou, southwest Sichuan and northwest Yunnan. * T. c. var. robusta is probably the most universally recognised of the varieties. It is present in western Hubei and western Sichuan. It again exhibits the thicker branchlets and larger cones, but the cones are stout and shortly cylindric. Also, the seed scales are square- orbicular with the exposed part being pubescent and the margin not thickened. In addition, the bracts are cuspidate at the apex. * T. c. var. oblongisquamata is considered a separate species by Raven and Wu, namely T. oblongisquamata, but as a variety by Farjon. It occurs in the northern part of the range, namely in southern Gansu, western Hubei and northwest Sichuan. It differs most sharply in lacking visible stomatic bands beneath the leaves. Otherwise the seed scales are more loosely arranged and loosely elliptic in shape, being nearly twice as long as they are wide. Uses The timber obtained from T. chinensis is used in construction, furniture making, and as a support in mines. The bark is high in tannins, which is often extracted and used as a dye. The trunk is used as a source of resin. In addition, the roots, trunk, and branches are all used in the production of aromatic oils due to their pleasing scent.

It showcases historical and cultural artefacts relating to the London Borough of Croydon and its people. The museum is owned and run by Croydon Council. It is located on the upper ground floor of Croydon Clocktower, but also incorporates the Riesco Gallery, on the lower ground floor, which displays Roman and Anglo-Saxon collections and a collection of Chinese ceramics. The museum originally opened under the name Lifetimes in 1995; and re-opened under its present name, following a major redevelopment and redesign, in 2006.

History Prior to the end of the 20th century, the County Borough and its successor the London Borough of Croydon did not run a local museum, despite many decades of lobbying by, among others, the Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society. However, the two councils had acquired an art collection of over 2,000 items, and also the Riesco Collection of Chinese pottery and porcelain, assembled by local collector Raymond Riesco and bequeathed to the County Borough in 1964.MacDonald 1992, p. 21.

Plans for the museum were developed over five years, from 1989 to 1994.

A particular effort was made to involve non-traditional museum users: participants in 8 out of 10 focus groups were selected on the basis of their ethnic diversity, their lack of educational qualifications, and their agreement with the statement that \\"I wouldn't be seen dead in a museum or arts centre\\".MacDonald 1992, p. 23. The research found that the words \\"Croydon\\" and \\"museum\\" both held negative connotations, and so the new institution was given the neutral name of \\"Lifetimes\\".MacDonald 1995, pp. 166‚Äì7.MacDonald 1998, p. 61. Sally MacDonald, the principal museum officer, later explained: Lifetimes opened in March 1995.Davies 1995. It set out to tell the story of Croydon and its people from 1840 to the present (and into the future), with the main emphasis being on the period from 1939 onwards. Exhibits were mainly borrowed from local residents; much information was drawn from oral history interviews; and there were no glass cases or labels (interpretation and explanation being supplied entirely through multimedia computer terminals). In a token acknowledgement of the borough's earlier history, an entrance sculpture was commissioned tracing Croydon's story back to the Big Bang.MacDonald 1998, p. 70. Lifetimes won an Interpret Britain Award in 1995; and the National Heritage Multimedia Award in 1996. Gaynor Kavanagh, lecturer in Museum Studies at the University of Leicester, hailed it as: However, it was also criticised for being \\"politically correct\\" (for example, in over-emphasising the presence of ethnic minorities in Croydon, even in historical periods at which their presence was highly exceptional); for its excessive populism; and for its over-reliance on new technology.Reinhardt 1998. \\"In the absence of labelling,\\" wrote Maurice Davies in the Museums Journal, \\"screens are a cumbersome way to present basic information.\\" The late start date of 1840, which left much of the borough's story unaddressed, particularly irked local historians. Caroline Reinhardt in The Spectator wrote: The museum published three leaflets relating to ethnic minority groups in Croydon, titled Black Lifetimes, South Asian Lifetimes and Irish Lifetimes. The last of these was withdrawn after it drew complaints from David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, of pro-republican bias.Reinhardt 1998, p. 44. Lifetimes closed for a major refurbishment and redesign in December 2004. It re-opened, now rebranded as the Museum of Croydon, in September 2006. The re-styled galleries won the FX International Interior Design Award for Best Museum & Gallery in 2007. Many of the exhibits and themes included in Lifetimes were retained in the new displays; but, among other changes, the start date for the historical story was pushed back to 1800, and the Riesco Gallery was redesigned so that it could also display, in addition to the ceramics, items from Croydon's Roman and Anglo-Saxon collections. Displays The museum has a range of exhibits reflecting different aspects of the history of Croydon and the surrounding areas, from 1800 to the present. The visitor to the main galleries has a choice of entering through one of two doors, \\"Then\\" or \\"Now\\", and so can follow the story in either chronological or reverse chronological order. The museum also incorporates (on the lower ground floor) the Riesco Gallery, which features Roman and Anglo-Saxon collections and the Riesco Collection of Chinese ceramics. The museum includes exhibits about the important black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875‚Äì1912) who lived most of his life in Croydon; items that the local IKEA in Purley Way sold when it first opened, such as furniture and catalogues; and artefacts from the local football club, Crystal Palace, such as Peter Taylor's contract. The museum has exhibitions for young people to voice and direct their opinion, so many other people can come and see their work. Art collection The museum's art collection comprises over 2,000 works, including paintings, prints, drawings and sketches. Only a small proportion are on permanent display. Artists represented include a number with strong local connections, such as Cicely Mary Barker, Rosa Petherick, Horace William Petherick, Juliet Pannett, Bridget Riley, and Malcolm McLaren; as well as others, such as Valentine Prinsep and Rabindranath Tagore, whose work has entered the collections through more indirect routes. Over three hundred of the works in the collection can be seen online at the Art UK website. Accreditation In December 2009, the museum was awarded official recognition by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, showing that the management of its collections, and facilities provided for visitors, had met national standards. In November 2013, it was stripped of its accreditation (now under the auspices of Arts Council England), and excluded from reapplying for five years, following its decision to put 24 items from the Riesco Collection up for sale at auction in what was described as a \\"deliberate contravention\\" of the Museums Association's code of ethics. Under threat of disciplinary action, Croydon Council resigned its membership of the Museums Association at this time.  References  Bibliography     External links  (366 works online).

He served as Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Religious in the Roman Curia from 1953 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1953 by Pope Pius XII. President Charles de Gaulle insisted that Valeri be removed as Apostolic Nuncio to France (1936-1944) for collaborating with the Vichy regime.International Herald Tribune. Church to Voice Sorrow for \\"Silence\\" During War Deportations: Catholic Apology to Jews of France September 22, 1997CatholicIreland.net. The Unlikely Election of John XXIII  Biography  Valerio Valeri was born in Santa Fiora, and studied at the Roman-Pio Seminary and the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare, where he was made a professor in 1904. Ordained to the priesthood on 21 December 1907, he then taught at the Pontifical Regional Seminary in Fano until 1909. After serving as a military chaplain during World War I, Valeri entered the Roman Curia, as a staff member of the Secretariat of State, in 1920. From 1921 to 1927, he was auditor of the French nunciature. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 6 July 1921, and later Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 22 July 1923. On 18 October 1927, Valeri was appointed Titular Archbishop of Ephesus and Apostolic Delegate to Egypt and Arabia. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 28 October from Cardinal Donato Sbarretti, with Archbishop Pietro Benedetti, MSC, and Bishop Giuseppe Angelucci serving as co-consecrators. Valeri was later named Nuncio to Romania on 1 July 1933, and finally Apostolic Nuncio to France on 11 July 1936. In August 1942, the nuncio disputed Marshal P√©tain's claim that Pope Pius XII understood and approved of France's increased hostility towards the Jews.TIME Magazine. Sacrificium Abramae 17 August 1942EWTN. The Good Samaritan: Jewish Praise for Pope Pius XII He was awarded the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur upon leaving France in 1944 to again work in the Secretariat of State, specifically the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. After becoming President of the Central Committee for the Holy Year on 28 June 1948, Archbishop Valeri was made assessor of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches on 1 September of that same year. He was created Cardinal- Priest of S. Silvestro in Capite by Pius XII in the consistory of 12 January 1953. Pope Pius advanced him to Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Religious five days later, on 17 January. Cardinal Valeri was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1958 papal conclave that selected Pope John XXIII, who had earlier succeeded him as the French nuncio. Cardinal Valeri lived long enough to only attend the first session of the Second Vatican Council in 1962, and to participate in the conclave of 1963, which resulted in the election of Pope Paul VI. Valeri died in Rome, at age 79. He is buried in his family's tomb in Santa Fiora.

Overview MC/DC requires all of the below during testing: #Each entry and exit point is invoked #Each decision takes every possible outcome #Each condition in a decision takes every possible outcome #Each condition in a decision is shown to independently affect the outcome of the decision. Independence of a condition is shown by proving that only one condition changes at a time. MC/DC is used in avionics software development guidance DO-178B and DO-178C to ensure adequate testing of the most critical (Level A) software, which is defined as that software which could provide (or prevent failure of) continued safe flight and landing of an aircraft. It is also highly recommended for SIL 4 in part 3 Annex B of the basic safety publicationIEC 61508-3:2010 and ASIL D in part 6 of automotive standard ISO 26262.ISO 26262-2011 Part 6 Table 12 Definitions ;Condition: A condition is a leaf-level Boolean expression (it cannot be broken down into simpler Boolean expressions). ;Decision: A Boolean expression composed of conditions and zero or more Boolean operators. A decision without a Boolean operator is a condition. ;Condition coverage: Every condition in a decision in the program has taken all possible outcomes at least once. ;Decision coverage: Every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once, and every decision in the program has taken all possible outcomes at least once. ;Condition/decision coverage: Every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once, every condition in a decision in the program has taken all possible outcomes at least once, and every decision in the program has taken all possible outcomes at least once. ;Modified condition/decision coverage: Every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once, every condition in a decision in the program has taken all possible outcomes at least once, and each condition has been shown to affect that decision outcome independently. A condition is shown to affect a decision's outcome independently by varying just that condition while holding fixed all other possible conditions. The condition/decision criterion does not guarantee the coverage of all conditions in the module because in many test cases, some conditions of a decision are masked by the other conditions. Using the modified condition/decision criterion, each condition must be shown to be able to act on the decision outcome by itself, everything else being held fixed. The MC/DC criterion is thus much stronger than the condition/decision coverage. Criticism Purely syntactic rearrangements of decisions (breaking them into several independently evaluated conditions using temporary variables, the values of which are then used in the decision) which do not change the semantics of a program can lower the difficulty of obtaining complete MC/DC coverage. This is because MC/DC is driven by the program syntax. However, this kind of \\"cheating\\" can be done to simplify expressions, not simply to avoid MC/DC complexities. For example, assignment of the number of days in a month (excluding leap years) could be achieved by using either a switch statement or by using a table with an enumeration value as an index. The number of tests required based on the source code could be considerably different depending upon the coverage required, although semantically we would want to test both approaches with a minimum number of tests. RC/DC Reinforced condition/decision coverage (RC/DC) is a stronger version of the MC/DC coverage criterion, suitable for safety-critical systems. It was originally proposed by Sergiy Vilkomir in 2002. A second publication refutes this claim and indicates that MCDC (at least the Unique Cause Strong MCDC \\"UCMS\\" or Masking) variants of MCDC have superior coverage to the referenced Reinforced condition/decision coverage (RC/DC).

The exterior is generally strong enough that one could pound a nail into a block of wood using the bottle as a hammer; however, even a small scratch on the interior would cause it to crumble. It is created by heating a glass bottle and then rapidly cooling the outside whilst slowly cooling the inside. Eggert, Gerhard (2007). \\"Hot Glass, Cold Water: Experiments in the History of Glass Fracture\\". Interim Meeting of the ICOM-CC Working Group: 8‚Äì13. This causes external compression and internal tension such that even a scratch on the inside is sufficient to shatter the bottle. The effect is utilized in several magic effects, including the \\"Devil's Flask\\". Manufacture To create the desired effect, the bottles are rapidly cooled on the outside and slow cooled on the inside during the glass-making process. This causes the outside to be extremely hard, and the inside to be soft and susceptible to damage which can release the powerful internal stresses. The glass is not annealed. Reheating the glass and then allowing it to cool slowly will remove the unique properties from the glass. Uses Because of the seemingly paradoxical nature of the glass (being both extremely durable and extremely fragile), Bologna bottles are often used as props in magic tricks, where the bottle can be shattered by rattling a small object inside it. History Mentioned in the publication of the Royal Society around 1740s, the Bologna bottle is named for where it was first discovered in Bologna, Italy. During this period, a glassblower would create a Bologna bottle by leaving the bottle in the open air instead of immediately placing the bottle back into the furnace to cool (annealing). This produced a special phenomenon, where the bottle would remain intact even when dropped from a distance onto the brick floor, but would immediately rupture if a small piece of flint were placed inside. The Philosophical Transactions and Collections ‚Äì Royal society of London: Abridged and Disposed Under General Heads, Volume 10 (1743-1750). p. 1343 Although the bottle can resist a strong external force, the extremely fragile flaws inside the bottle prevent it from being used in practical applications.

Family She was the daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet, of Hawarden Castle, who died when she was only three, and was reared with her sister Mary by her mother. The Glynne sisters, very close, were renowned for their beauty. They married on the same day in Hawarden Church, and their families visited one another and holidayed together incessantly. When Mary died, as Lady Lyttelton, in 1857, Catherine acted in some ways as mother to her children. Her brother Stephen succeeded to the baronetcy in 1815. On his death in 1874, the Glynne baronetcy became extinct and the estates passed to Catherine and William's eldest son, William Henry. Through the myriad strains and links in her heredity, Catherine found herself, according to Lucy Masterman, related in one way or another to \\"half the famous names in English political history\\". Gladstone William and Catherine Gladstone's grave in Westminster Abbey It was through her brother, who represented Flint as a Liberal MP, that Catherine met William Gladstone, reputedly in 1834 at the home in Tilney Street, London, of James Milnes Gaskell, one of Gladstone's Old Etonian friends and then Tory MP for Wenlock. They were married on 25 July 1839 and lived at her ancestral home Hawarden Castle, in Flintshire, Wales. They had eight children, including Herbert John and Henry Neville Gladstone. She was buried next to her late husband in Westminster Abbey. Their daughter Mary referred to them collectively as \\"The Great People\\".

These palsies can affect gaze in a horizontal, upward, or downward direction. These entities overlap with ophthalmoparesis and ophthalmoplegia.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of conjugate gaze palsies include the impairment of gaze in various directions and different types of movement, depending on the type of gaze palsy. Signs of a person with a gaze palsy may be frequent movement of the head instead of the eyes. For example, a person with a horizontal saccadic palsy may jerk their head around while watching a movie or high action event instead of keeping their head steady and moving their eyes, which usually goes unnoticed. Someone with a nonselective horizontal gaze palsy may slowly rotate their head back and forth while reading a book instead of slowly scanning their eyes across the page. Cause A lesion, which is an abnormality in tissue due to injury or disease, can disrupt the transmission of signals from the brain to the eye. Almost all conjugate gaze palsies originate from a lesion somewhere in the brain stem, usually the midbrain, or pons. These lesions can be caused by stroke, or conditions such as Koerber-Salus-Elschnig syndrome, Progressive supranuclear palsy, Olivopontocerebellar syndrome, Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C, or envenomation such as from a scorpion bite. Mechanism The location of the lesion determines the type of palsy. Nonselective horizontal gaze palsies are caused by lesions in the Abducens nucleus. This is where the cranial nerve VI leaves on its way to the Lateral rectus muscle, which controls eye movement horizontally away from the midline of the body. The cranial nerve VI also has interneurons connecting to the medial rectus, which controls horizontal eye movement towards from the midline of the body. Since the lateral rectus controls movement away from the center of the body, a lesion in the abducens nucleus disrupts the pathways controlling outward movements, not allowing the right eye to move right and the left eye to move left. Nerve VI has the longest subarachnoid distance to its target tissue, making it susceptible to lesions. Lesions anywhere in the abducens nucleus, cranial nerve VI neurons, or interneurons can affect eye movement towards the side of the lesion. Lesions on both sides of the abducens nucleus can cause a total loss of horizontal eye movement. One other type of gaze palsy is a horizontal saccadic palsy. Saccades are very quick involuntary eye movements. The paramedian pontine reticular formation(PPRF), also in the pons is responsible for saccadic movement, relaying signals to the abducens nucleus. Lesions in the PPRF cause what would be saccadic horizontal eye movements to be much slower or in the case of very severe lesions, nonexistent. Horizontal gaze palsies are known to be linked to Progressive Scoliosis. This occurs because pathways controlling saccadic movements are disrupted by the lesion and only a slow movements controlled by a different motor pathways are ineffected. Lesions in the midbrain can interfere with efferent motor signals before they arrive at the pons. This can also cause slowed horizontal saccadic movements and failure for the eye to reach its target location during saccades. This damage normally happens in the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain As in horizontal saccadic palsy, the saccades are stopped or slowed from the disrupted pathway, only in this case the signal is disrupted before it reaches the PPRF. One-and-a-half syndrome is associated with damage to the paramedian pontine reticular formation and the medial longitudinal fasciculus. These combined damages cause both a complete gaze impairment on the ipsilateral side and a \\"half\\" gaze impairment on the contralateral side. As seen in horizontal saccadic palsy, the impairment of the contralateral side gaze is caused by the disrupted pathways coming from the PPRF, while the \\"half\\" impairment is from the signal passing through the medial longitudinal fascicles not being able to reach its target. One-and-a-Half syndrome is normally associated with horizontal gaze. Although more rare than horizontal, one-and-a-half syndrome from damage to the paramedian pontine reticular formation and the medial longitudinal fasciculus can be shown to affect vertical gaze. This can cause impairment of vertical gaze, allowing only one eye to move vertically. Diagnosis A patient may be diagnosed with a conjugate gaze palsy by a physician performing a number of tests to examine the patient's eye movement abilities. In most cases, the gaze palsy can simply be seen by inability to move both eyes in one direction. However, sometimes a patient exhibits an abduction nystagmus in both eyes, indicating evidence of a conjugate gaze palsy. A nystagmus is a back and forth \\"jerk\\" of the eye when attempting to hold a gaze in one direction.Hertle RW. Nystagmus in Infancy and Childhood. Seminars in Ophthalmology. 2008;23:307-317 =Classification= Conjugate gaze palsies can be classified into palsies affecting horizontal gaze and vertical gaze. Horizontal gaze palsies Horizontal gaze palsies affect gaze of both eyes either toward or away from the midline of the body. Horizontal gaze palsies are generally caused by a lesion in the brain stem and connecting nerves, normally in the pons. Progressive scoliosis Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) is a very rare form of conjugate gaze palsy, appearing only in a few dozen families worldwide. HGPPS prevents horizontal movement of both eyes, causing people with this condition to have to move their head to see moving objects. In addition to the eye movement impairment, HGPPS is coupled with progressive scoliosis, although eye symptoms usually appear before scoliosis. HGPPS is caused by a mutation in the ROBO3 gene, which is important in cross- over of motor and sensory signals, preventing horizontal eye movement. In addition to the mutation, lesions in the midbrain and pons are common. This can also include a complete absence of a formation in the pons, the facial colliculus, which is responsible for some facial movements. The cause of progressive scoliosisin HGPPS and why HGPPS does not affect vertical gaze is unclear. Progressive scoliosis is normally treated with surgery. Vertical gaze palsies Vertical gaze palsies affect movement of one or both eyes either in upward direction, up and down direction, or more rarely only downward direction. Very rarely only movement of one eye in one direction is affected, although by definition this is not a conjugate gaze palsy, because by definition conjugate gaze palsies affect movement of both eyes. Vertical gaze palsies are often caused by lesions to the midbrain due to a stroke or a tumor. In the case that only downward gaze is affected, the cause is normally progressive supranuclear palsy. Treatment There is no treatment of conjugate gaze palsy itself, so the disease or condition causing the gaze palsy must be treated, likely by surgery. As stated in the causes section, the gaze palsy may be due to a lesion caused by stroke or a condition. Some of the conditions such as Progressive supra nuclear palsy are not curable, and treatment only includes therapy to regain some tasks, not including gaze control. Other conditions such as Niemann-Pick disease type C have limited drug therapeutic options. Stroke victims with conjugate gaze palsies may be treated with intravenous therapy if the patent presents early enough, or with a surgical procedure for other cases. Prognosis The prognosis of a lesion in the visual neural pathways that causes a conjugate gaze palsy varies greatly. Depending on the nature of the lesion, recovery may happen rapidly or recovery may never progress. For example, optic neuritis, which is caused by inflammation, may heal in just weeks, while patients with an ischemic optic neuropathy may never recover.National Stroke Association. Stroke Treatment.

Founded in 1968, Savio College is a Salesian Catholic school founded on the educational philosophy of St. John Bosco. It is a secondary school for boys situated in the midst of the countryside outside of Dingli, Malta. The college has a vast academic curriculum enhanced by a number to extracurricular activities. The college caters for 260 students, supported and guided to develop and grow in all spheres of their life, be it academically, physically, spiritually, emotionally and socially.  Founding  Works on a large house in ƒ¶ad-Dingli intended for the fostering and formation of religious vocations began on February 5, 1965. The land in Dingli was provided by Sliema resident Miss Maude Bugeja and Fr. Joseph Mangion was put in charge of construction. The construction of the school received financial support from the United States' Mission Office. On June 20, the late Archbishop Michael Gonzi blessed the foundation stone. It opened its doors three years later and welcomed its first group of 12 students. Some of these students had come from the Summer Camps at the Salesian Oratory in Sliema.  School Complex  The school complex is divided into 2 sections: The Main School Building and the Sports Complex. Since 2015, the school went through a significant facelift with new electrical and water systems, new furniture, new windows and new technology. = Main Building = The main building, in which most classes take place and students spend most of their time houses the live-in areas, a small inner hall & and a chapel. It is also equipped with science laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology as well as two Computer labs. = Sports Complex = :The Sports Complex consists of two areas: the indoor gym and the outdoor sporting area. ;Indoor Gym :The indoor area houses the gym is also used as a hall for large ceremonies and a 'Games Room' equipped with snooker tables, table soccer (foosball) tables and ping pong tables. The Games Room is primarily used by students who arrive early and during recess when they are unable to go outside due to bad weather. ;Outdoor Gym :The outdoor area houses the basketball court, a pavilion that serves as a handball court, a medium- sized volleyball court, a full-sized UEFA-compliant turf football pitch and an athletics track. The sports complex was completed in 2003 and the outdoor facilities were upgraded with synthetic grass and athletic field facilities 11 years later.  After-school activities  Apart from usual school activities, Savio College runs an athletics club formally known as Savio Athletics which hosts a number of inner sporting activities and also takes part in national sporting tournaments and leagues. The school also offers a Robotics Club which actively participates in international robotics competitions and has an active presence in the Malta Robotics Olympiad. A School Council made up of students help raise funds for school-wide activities, organize social events and plan community projects. The School Council also helps raise environmental awareness in collaboration with the EkoSkola Committee. The EkoSkola Committee acts as a branch of the School Council, often made up of students who are also in the School Council. Its main task is to make the school greener by reducing carbon emissions and waste, while also pushing towards more environmentally- friendly upgrades to the school.

It is one of two major observation areas to overlook the falls and lower Niagara Gorge on the New York side, the other being Prospect Point further downriver. Before the second half of the 20th century Terrapin Point was a group of rocks on the brink of the falls, disconnected from Goat Island. They were known as the Terrapin Rocks because they resembled giant tortoises. In 1827, the then owners of the land on the American side, brothers Peter and Augustes Porter, built a 300-foot wooden bridge from Goat Island to just off the edge of the falls. In 1833, they added a lighthouse-like building, Terrapin Tower, to this viewpoint. Its height is estimated at 30 to 45 feet, its diameter at 12 feet. A spiral staircase inside allowed visitors to reach a viewing platform. Although the tower quickly attracted many visitors, there were also critical voices that found it disturbing in view of the beauty of the waterfalls. In 1873 the Porter brothers lost interest in the Terrapin Tower and blew it up. The bridge lasted longer. It can still be seen in photos from 1934. By 1954, however, it had also disappeared. While work was being carried out on the dredging of the upper Niagara River in 1953 to spread the flow of water more evenly along the crest of the Horseshoe Falls, dirt and fill from the dredging was taken over to Terrapin Point, increasing its area and affording visitors views of the cataract not seen before. This area was closed to tourists in 1969, however, due to cracks being found in the rock foundation. Terrapin Point was closed to visitors after 1969 when a large crack in the rock was discovered.http://www.niagarafrontier.com/cataract.html In 1983 the United States Army Corps of Engineers blasted away 25,000 tons of unstable rock, added more landfill, and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether of the Horseshoe Falls was eliminated, including on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada.

In Nuremberg, connections to the ICE trains to the Ruhr region and many further regional services can be made. According to Deutsche Bahn sources, about 5,000 passengers per day used the train in the first weeks of service. The train is the only regional train in Bavaria where tickets are sold on board; on-board ticket sales ceased in the other trains on April 1, 2007.  Rolling stock  M√ºnchen-N√ºrnberg-Express on the open line As of the 2007 schedule, the M√ºnchen-N√ºrnberg-Express is the only regional train in Germany with a maximum speed of 200 km/h. This high speed is necessary to not hinder the ICE traffic, which travels at speeds of up to 300 km/h. However, since Deutsche Bahn does not own regional rolling stock capable of travelling at such high speeds, push-pull InterCity train compositions are used for the service. Between September and November 2006, 26 coaches (among them three control cars) were specially equipped for the M√ºnchen-N√ºrnberg-Express in the Neum√ºnster workshop. The coaches were repainted to the red livery used by regional trains. The interior remains largely unchanged from the regular InterCity, providing tables, folding tables, reading lamps and laptop sockets. The normal InterCity passenger information system is installed in the coaches, however seats cannot be reserved on the train. Coaches are pressurised to avoid uncomfortable pressure variations in tunnels. The train does not have a buffet car, but snacks and drinks are served from a trolley. The train is a non smoking train, just like any other German train. The train usually is a push- pull set operated with the refurbished coaches and a Class 101 engine. On occasion, a Class 120 or Class 182 engine is used as well. A full trainset normally consists of six coaches: * Control car: driver's compartment, 31 2nd class seats, 16 bicycle racks and five folding seats, two wheelchair stands, disabled toilet * four saloon coaches Bpmz (80 2nd class seats each), toilet and luggage rack at each end of the coach. In total, 20 cars were repainted for the MNE. * End coach: open seating area with 40 seats (2nd class), mother and child compartment with six seats (of which two folding), special compartment with six seats, two 1st class compartments (six seats each) and conductor's compartment. Four Bvmsz cars were rebuilt into these special coaches (now called ABvmsz). On weekday mornings, a ten-coach train pulled by two Class 101 engines operates on the line. Due to the length of the train, the last four coaches are locked between Ingolstadt and Nuremberg, as they do not come to stop at the platforms on the high speed line.

It is also sold in Flint, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Kalamazoo, Saginaw, Traverse City, Tampa, Florida, Indianapolis, Indiana, Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio at one time. History Towne Club was owned and operated by Harold Samhat. The company first started selling its pop in the mid-1960s in its own retail outlets in Detroit, known as \\"pop centers\\". It was an affordable alternative to bigger brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and often sold well in Detroit's poorer neighborhoods. The pop centers offered many more flavors of soda pop than were typically seen in grocery stores, and the pop was sold by the 24-glass-bottle wooden case. People would enter the store, grab a wooden crate, and walk around the various stacks of pop around the warehouse-type store. Customers would bring back empty bottles and cases and start all over again. The company carved out its niche by offering multiple flavors in both regular and diet varieties in an attempt to rival its more powerful regional competitor, Faygo. The attempt proved successful, as Towne Club was able to expand its reach further North in Michigan, South into Central Indiana, parts of Northwestern Ohio, Upstate New York and Florida. Samhat sold the company in 1978 to Pop Shoppes of Toronto, Canada (controlled by Venturetech of Toronto, Canada). He remained with the company until 1982. The company began falling on hard times in the mid- to late-1980s, after the decision was made to close its retail pop centers, though Towne Club was still available. Sales continued to slide, not out of disloyalty, but buyers of the products were left wondering what outlets still sold it. Comeback Towne Club Bottling announced a comeback in the mid-1990s (though they had never really left) and through a very aggressive media campaign, made an effort to make fans of the soft drinks aware of where to purchase the products. Returning in 1997, Towne Club had changed little of its product or its packaging. Unlike many of its multinational competitors, Towne Club pop was still sold in 12 ounce returnable crowned glass bottles, which, in keeping with Michigan's deposit law, are worth ten cents each when returned to retailers. The bottles required a standard bottle opener to be used in order to consume the product. The Towne Club brand is now controlled by Intrastate Distributors, Inc., known as IDI, Inc. Within a couple of years, the Towne Club brands switched to plastic re-sealable bottles and new labeling. IDI also bottles other beverages, including Orange Crush, Frostie Root Beer and Stewart's Root Beer. As of 2013, Towne Club products are available in glass bottles with screw-top caps. Current flavor offerings include Orange, Peach, Cola, Grape, Tropical Punch, Strawberry, City Rush (Their version of M.Mist/M.Dew), Vanilla Cream, Michigan Cherry, Strawberry Melon, Mango Orange, Root Beer, Honolulu Blue (Cream Soda, Honolulu Blue is the team color of the Detroit Lions), Pineapple Passionfruit, and Gingerale along with the three recently introduced new flavors Michigan Berries, Tiger Citrus Punch and Lion Energy.

Moylan joined the team during the 1970 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1981 championship. During that time he won three All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals, two National League medals and one All-Star award. At club level Moylan was a three-time All-Ireland medalist with Blackrock. In addition to this he has also won five Munster medals and five county club championship medals. Playing career =Club= Moylan played his club hurling with Blackrock and enjoyed much success in hugely successful decade for the club. In 1971 he lined out in his first senior decider as Blackrock faced St. Finbarr's. After a decade in the doldrums the Rockies were back and a 2‚Äì19 to 5‚Äì4 victory secured a championship medal for Moylan. Blackrock subsequently represented Cork in the provincial series of games and faced Moyne-Templetuohy in the decider. An impressive 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì1 victory gave Moylan a Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Blackrock against Rathnure. A high- scoring game followed, however, a narrow 5‚Äì13 to 6‚Äì9 victory gave Moylan an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal. Blackrock surrendered their club, provincial and All-Ireland decider the following year, however, in 1973 Moylan lined out in a second county championship final. A 2‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì10 defeat of Glen Rovers gave him a second championship medal. A subsequent two- point defeat of Newmarket-on-Fergus in the provincial decider gave Moylan a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Blackrock against Rathnure. A rousing draw was followed by a great replay. Superb late goals by Donie Collins and √âamonn O'Donoghue secured a 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì9 victory and a second All-Ireland medal for Moylan. Once again back-to-back championship titles eluded the Rockies, however, a 4‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Glen Rovers in 1975 gave Moylan a third championship medal. He later added a third Munster medal to his collection following a decisive 8‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì8 defeat of Mount Sion. Kilkenny's James Stephen provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Five points down at half-time, the Kilkenny club came storming back and defeated Moylan's side by 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì4. It was 1978 before Moylan enjoyed his next success. A 4‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì7 defeat of Glen Rovers gave him a fourth championship medal. Once again the Rockies stormed through the provincial championship and defeated Newmarket-on-Fergus by two goals, giving Moylan a fourth Munster medal. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny again. This time it was Blackrock versus Ballyhale Shamrocks. Ray Cummins scored two goals in rapid succession in the opening thirty minutes to put Blackrock in the driving seat. At the full-time whistle Blackrock were the winners by 5‚Äì7 to 5‚Äì5, giving Moylan a third All-Ireland medal. A 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of St. Finbarr's in 1979 gave Moylan his fifth and final championship medal. It was the first time that Blackrock had won back-to-back championships in almost fifty years. He later picked up a fifth Munster medal following a 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8 defeat of Dunhill. =Minor and under-21= Moylan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1966. He made his debut in the provincial quarter-final that year and subsequently collected a Munster medal following a 6‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì8 defeat of Galway. Cork later faced Wexford in the All-Ireland decider, however, a high-scoring 6‚Äì7 apiece draw was the result. The replay was much more conclusive with Wexford claiming a 4‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì8 victory. In 1967 Moylan added a second Munster medal to his collection in the minor grade following a 4‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì3 rout of Limerick. Cork later faced Wexford in the All-Ireland decider once again. A 2‚Äì15 to 5‚Äì3 victory gave Moylan an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal, while he also had the honour of collecting the cup as captain of the team. Moylan progressed onto the Cork under-21 team in 1968 and enjoyed immediate success on one of the most successful teams of all-time in that grade. Tipperary were bested by 4‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì13 to secure a first Munster medal. Moylan was later at midfield for the All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny. A 2‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì9 victory gave him his first All-Ireland medal in that grade. In 1969 Cork had an even more comprehensive victory over Tipp in the provincial decider and Moylan added a second Munster medal to his collection. Old rivals Wexford provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and a high-scoring game ensued. A 5‚Äì13 to 4‚Äì7 victory gave Moylan a second consecutive All-Ireland medal. Having retained the title, Cork set out to become the first team to win three successive under-21 championships. Moylan collected a third Munster medal that year following a 3‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Tipperary once again. Cork faced their old rivals Wexford in the subsequent All-Ireland decider, however, that game ended in a draw. In the replay Cork went into overdrive and Moylan won a third All-Ireland medal following a 5‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì8 thrashing. =Senior= Moylan made his senior debut for Cork during the 1969‚Äì70 National League. It was a successful campaign for the Rebels as an aggregate 5‚Äì21 to 6‚Äì16 defeat of New York secured the National Hurling League title for Cork. Moylan was an unused substitute for the final. It would be a Munster semi-final defeat by Tipperary in 1973 before he made his championship debut. After being dropped from the team for a number of seasons, 1976 saw Moylan win his first Munster medal as Limerick were beaten by 3‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì5. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork face old rivals Wexford. In one of the worst starts to a championship decider, Cork were 2‚Äì2 to no score in arrears after just six minutes. The Rebels fought back to level matters by half-time, however, it was the long- range point-scoring by Moylan that turned the game for Cork. A 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 victory gave him his first All-Ireland medal. Moylan later collected an All- Star award. Moylan missed Cork's 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì10 Munster final defeat of newly crowned National League champions Clare in 1977, however, he was introduced as a substitute in the All-Ireland decider against Wexford. Se√°nie O'Leary played the game with a broken nose after being hit in the face by a sliotar in a pre- match warm-up while the two oldest men on the team, Denis Coughlan and Gerald McCarthy, gave noteworthy displays. Martin Coleman made some miraculous saves in the dying minutes as Cork held on for a 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 victory. It was Moylan's second All-Ireland medal. In 1978 Cork set out to secure an impressive third successive All-Ireland title. The team go off to a good start with Moylan, having been restored to the starting fifteen, collecting a second Munster medal after a 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì11 defeat of Clare in a dour provincial decider. This victory paved the way for Cork to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. The stakes were high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 victory over their age-old rivals. This victory gave Cork a third All- Ireland title in succession and gave Moylan his own personal three-in-a-row of winners' medals. In 1979 Cork set about capturing a record-equaling fourth successive All-Ireland. All went to plan as the Rebels secured a fifth consecutive provincial title following a 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Limerick. It was Moylan's third and final Munster medal. Age and the exertions of the three previous campaigns finally caught up with Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and a 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì13 defeat by Galway brought the four-in-a-row dream to an end. A 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì6 defeat of Limerick in a replay of the National League final gave Moylan his first winners' medal in that competition in 1980. Cork later failed in their effort to secure a record sixth provincial title in succession. The following year Moylan enjoyed his final success with Cork, as a 3‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì8 defeat of an up-and-coming Offaly team secured his second National League medal. Cork exited the subsequent championship at the first hurdle and Moylan decided to retire from inter-county activity. =Inter-provincial= Moylan also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He lined out for the province in 1977, however, arch rivals Leinster defeated Munster in the final of the Railway Cup.

The Texas League underwent a massive face lift in the late 1950s after three of its top franchises ‚Äî Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston ‚Äî moved up to the Triple-A American Association for the 1959 season. The Corpus Christi Giants, which joined the TL in 1958, finished last in attendance (61,500) in 1959, and transferred to Harlingen over the winter. Harlingen had been represented in numerous lower-level minor leagues, most recently the Big State League (1954‚Äì55). In 1960, the Rio Grande Valley club won the regular-season pennant and finished third in attendance (75,000) in the six-team league. But the following season, a poor club on the field resulted in a severe attendance decline, and the Giants moved to Victoria, Texas, in mid-June.

The image acquisition is generally performed by radiographers, and the images are often examined by radiologists. Both the procedure and any resultant images are often simply called \\"X-ray\\". Plain radiography generally refers to projectional radiography (without the use of more advanced techniques such as computed tomography that can generate 3D-images). Plain radiography can also refer to radiography without a radiocontrast agent or radiography that generates single static images, as contrasted to fluoroscopy, which are technically also projectional.  Equipment  Acquisition of projectional radiography, with an X-ray generator and a detector =X-ray generator= Projectional radiographs generally use X-rays created by X-ray generators, which generate X-rays from X-ray tubes. =Grid= A Bucky-Potter grid may be placed between the patient and the detector to reduce the quantity of scattered x-rays that reach the detector. This improves the contrast resolution of the image, but also increases radiation exposure for the patient. =Detector= Detectors can be divided into two major categories: imaging detectors (such as photographic plates and X-ray film (photographic film), now mostly replaced by various digitizing devices like image plates or flat panel detectors) and dose measurement devices (such as ionization chambers, Geiger counters, and dosimeters used to measure the local radiation exposure, dose, and/or dose rate, for example, for verifying that radiation protection equipment and procedures are effective on an ongoing basis). =Shielding= Lead is the main material used by radiography personnel for shielding against scattered X-rays.  Image properties  Projectional radiography relies on the characteristics of x-ray radiation (quantity and quality of the beam) and knowledge of how it interacts with human tissue to create diagnostic images. X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, meaning it has sufficient energy to potentially remove electrons from an atom, thus giving it a charge and making it an ion. =X-ray attenuation= When an exposure is made, x-ray radiation exits the tube as what is known as the primary beam. When the primary beam passes through the body, some of the radiation is absorbed in a process known as attenuation. Anatomy that is denser has a higher rate of attenuation than anatomy that is less dense, so bone will absorb more x-rays than soft tissue. What remains of the primary beam after attenuation is known as the remnant beam. The remnant beam is responsible for exposing the image receptor. Areas on the image receptor that receive the most radiation (portions of the remnant beam experiencing the least attenuation) will be more heavily exposed, and therefore will be processed as being darker. Conversely, areas on the image receptor that receive the least radiation (portions of the remnant beam experience the most attenuation) will be less exposed and will be processed as being lighter. This is why bone, which is very dense, process as being ‚Äòwhite‚Äô on radio graphs, and the lungs, which contain mostly air and is the least dense, shows up as ‚Äòblack‚Äô. =Density= Radiographic density is the measure of overall darkening of the image. Density is a logarithmic unit that describes the ratio between light hitting the film and light being transmitted through the film. A higher radiographic density represents more opaque areas of the film, and lower density more transparent areas of the film. With digital imaging, however, density may be referred to as brightness. The brightness of the radiograph in digital imaging is determined by computer software and the monitor on which the image is being viewed. =Contrast= Contrast is defined as the difference in radiographic density between adjacent portions of the image. The range between black and white on the final radiograph. High contrast, or short-scale contrast, means there is little gray on the radiograph, and there are fewer gray shades between black and white. Low contrast, or long-scale contrast, means there is much gray on the radiograph, and there are many gray shades between black and white. Closely related to radiographic contrast is the concept of exposure latitude. Exposure latitude is the range of exposures over which the recording medium (image receptor) will respond with a diagnostically useful density; in other words, this is the \\"flexibility\\" or \\"leeway\\" that a radiographer has when setting his/her exposure factors. Images having a short-scale of contrast will have narrow exposure latitude. Images having long-scale contrast will have a wide exposure latitude; that is, the radiographer will be able to utilize a broader range of technical factors to produce a diagnostic-quality image. Contrast is determined by the kilovoltage (kV; energy/quality/penetrability) of the x-ray beam and the tissue composition of the body part being radiographed. Selection of look-up tables (LUT) in digital imaging also affects contrast. Generally speaking, high contrast is necessary for body parts in which bony anatomy is of clinical interest (extremities, bony thorax, etc.). When soft tissue is of interest (ex. abdomen or chest), lower contrast is preferable in order to accurately demonstrate all of the soft tissue tones in these areas. =Geometric magnification= Image relating focal spot size to geometric unsharpness in projectional radiography. Geometric magnification results from the detector being farther away from the X-ray source than the object. In this regard, the source-detector distance or SDDPage 359 in: is a measurement of the distance between the generator and the detector. Alternative names are source/focus to detector/image-receptor/film (latter used when using X-ray film) distance (SID, FID or FRD). The estimated radiographic magnification factor (ERMF) is the ratio of the source-detector distance (SDD) over the source-object distance (SOD). The size of the object is given as: Size_{object} = \\\\frac{Size_{projection}}{ERMF}, where Sizeprojection is the size of the projection that the object forms on the detector. On lumbar and chest radiographs, it is anticipated that ERMF is between 1.05 and 1.40. Report 90. Jan. 1999. ISRN: LIU-RAD-R-090 Because of the uncertainty of the true size of objects seen on projectional radiography, their sizes are often compared to other structures within the body, such as dimensions of the vertebrae, or empirically by clinical experience.Page 788 in: The source-detector distance (SDD) is roughly related to the source- object distance (SOD) and the object-detector distance (ODD) by the equation SOD + ODD = SDD. =Geometric unsharpness= Geometric unsharpness is caused by the X-ray generator not creating X-rays from a single point but rather from an area, as can be measured as the focal spot size. Geometric unsharpness increases proportionally to the focal spot size, as well as the estimated radiographic magnification factor (ERMF). =Geometric distortion= Organs will have different relative distances to the detector depending on which direction the X-rays come from. For example, chest radiographs are preferably taken with X-rays coming from behind (called a \\"posteroanterior\\" or \\"PA\\" radiograph). However, in case the patient cannot stand, the radiograph often needs to be taken with the patient lying in a supine position (called a \\"bedside\\" radiograph) with the X-rays coming from above (\\"anteroposterior\\" or \\"AP\\"), and geometric magnification will then cause for example the heart to appear larger than it actually is because it is further away from the detector.Page 278 in: =Scatter= In addition to using a Bucky-Potter grid, increasing the ODD alone can improve image contrast by decreasing the amount of scattered radiation that reaches the receptor. However, this needs to be weighted against increased geometric unsharpness if the SDD is not also proportionally increased. Imaging variations by target tissue Projection radiography uses X-rays in different amounts and strengths depending on what body part is being imaged: *Hard tissues such as bone require a relatively high energy photon source, and typically a tungsten anode is used with a high voltage (50-150 kVp) on a 3-phase or high-frequency machine to generate bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. Bony tissue and metals are denser than the surrounding tissue, and thus by absorbing more of the X-ray photons they prevent the film from getting exposed as much.Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry, http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/59/6/R183/article Wherever dense tissue absorbs or stops the X-rays, the resulting X-ray film is unexposed, and appears translucent blue, whereas the black parts of the film represent lower-density tissues such as fat, skin, and internal organs, which could not stop the X-rays. This is usually used to see bony fractures, foreign objects (such as ingested coins), and used for finding bony pathology such as osteoarthritis, infection (osteomyelitis), cancer (osteosarcoma), as well as growth studies (leg length, achondroplasia, scoliosis, etc.). * Soft tissues are seen with the same machine as for hard tissues, but a \\"softer\\" or less- penetrating X-ray beam is used. Tissues commonly imaged include the lungs and heart shadow in a chest X-ray, the air pattern of the bowel in abdominal X-rays, the soft tissues of the neck, the orbits by a skull X-ray before an MRI to check for radiopaque foreign bodies (especially metal), and of course the soft tissue shadows in X-rays of bony injuries are looked at by the radiologist for signs of hidden trauma (for example, the famous \\"fat pad\\" sign on a fractured elbow).  Projectional radiography terminology  X-ray under examination NOTE: The simplified word 'view' is often used to describe a radiographic projection. Plain radiography generally refers to projectional radiography (without the use of more advanced techniques such as computed tomography). Plain radiography can also refer to radiography without a radiocontrast agent or radiography that generates single static images, as contrasted to fluoroscopy. *AP - Antero-Posterior *PA - Postero-Anterior *DP - Dorsal-Plantar *Lateral - Projection taken with the central ray perpendicular to the midsagittal plane *Oblique - Projection taken with the central ray at an angle to any of the body planes. Described by the angle of obliquity and the portion of the body the X-ray beam exits; right or left and posterior or anterior. For example, a 45 degree Right Anterior Oblique of the Cervical Spine. *Flexion - Joint is radiographed while in flexion *Extension - Joint is radiographed while in extension *Stress Views - Typically taken of joints with external force applied in a direction that is different from main movement of the joint. Test of stability. *Weight-bearing - Generally with the subject standing up *HBL, HRL, HCR or CTL - Horizontal Beam Lateral, Horizontal Ray Lateral, Horizontal Central Ray, or Cross Table Lateral. Used to obtain a lateral projection usually when patients are unable to move. *Prone - Patient lies on their front *Supine - Patient lies on the back *Decubitus - Patient lying down. Further described by the downside body surface: dorsal (backside down), ventral (frontside down), or lateral (left or right side down). *OM - occipito-mental, an imaginary positioning line extending from the menti (chin) to the occiput (particularly the external occiputal protuberance) *Cranial or Cephalad - Tube angulation towards the head *Caudal - Tube angulation towards the feet  By target organ or structure  =Breasts= Normal (left) versus cancerous (right) mammography image. Projectional radiography of the breasts is called mammography. This has been used mostly on women to screen for breast cancer, but is also used to view male breasts, and used in conjunction with a radiologist or a surgeon to localise suspicious tissues before a biopsy or a lumpectomy. Breast implants designed to enlarge the breasts reduce the viewing ability of mammography, and require more time for imaging as more views need to be taken. This is because the material used in the implant is very dense compared to breast tissue, and looks white (clear) on the film. The radiation used for mammography tends to be softer (has a lower photon energy) than that used for the harder tissues. Often a tube with a molybdenum anode is used with about 30 000 volts (30 kV), giving a range of X-ray energies of about 15-30 keV. Many of these photons are \\"characteristic radiation\\" of a specific energy determined by the atomic structure of the target material (Mo-K radiation). =Chest= A normal posteroanterior (PA) chest radiograph. Chest radiographs are used to diagnose many conditions involving the chest wall, including its bones, and also structures contained within the thoracic cavity including the lungs, heart, and great vessels. Conditions commonly identified by chest radiography include pneumonia, pneumothorax, interstitial lung disease, heart failure, bone fracture and hiatal hernia. Typically an erect postero-anterior (PA) projection is the preferred projection. Chest radiographs are also used to screen for job-related lung disease in industries such as mining where workers are exposed to dust.Using Digital Chest Images to Monitor the Health of Coal Miners and Other Workers. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. For some conditions of the chest, radiography is good for screening but poor for diagnosis. When a condition is suspected based on chest radiography, additional imaging of the chest can be obtained to definitively diagnose the condition or to provide evidence in favor of the diagnosis suggested by initial chest radiography. Unless a fractured rib is suspected of being displaced, and therefore likely to cause damage to the lungs and other tissue structures, x-ray of the chest is not necessary as it will not alter patient management. =Abdomen= Abdominal radiograph. In children, abdominal radiography is indicated in the acute setting in suspected bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, foreign body in the alimentary tract, suspected abdominal mass and intussusception (latter as part of the differential diagnosis). Yet, CT scan is the best alternative for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury in children. For acute abdominal pain in adults, an abdominal x-ray has a low sensitivity and accuracy in general. Computed tomography provides an overall better surgical strategy planning, and possibly less unnecessary laparotomies. Abdominal x-ray is therefore not recommended for adults presenting in the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. The standard abdominal X-ray protocol is usually a single anteroposterior projection in supine position. A Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder projection (KUB) is an anteroposterior abdominal projection that covers the levels of the urinary system, but does not necessarily include the diaphragm. =Axial skeleton= Head *Cerebral angiography allows visualization of blood vessels in and around the brain. A contrast agent is injected prior to the radiographs of the head, *Orbital radiography, imaging both left and right eye sockets, generally including the frontal and maxillary sinuses. *Dental radiography uses a small radiation dose with high penetration to view teeth, which are relatively dense. A dentist may examine a painful tooth and gum using X-ray equipment. The machines used are typically single-phase pulsating DC, the oldest and simplest sort. Dental technicians or the dentist may run these machines; radiographers are not required by law to be present. An derivative technique from projectional radiography used in dental radiography is orthopantomography. This is a panoramic imaging technique of the upper and lower jaw using focal plane tomography, where the X-ray generator and X-ray detector are simultaneously moved so as to keep a consistent exposure of only the plane of interest during image acquisition. *Sinus - The standard protocol in the UK is OM with open mouth. *Facial Bones - The standard protocol in the UK is OM and OM 30¬∞. In case of trauma, the standard UK protocol is to have a CT scan of the skull instead of projectional radiography. A skeletal survey including the skull can be indicated in for example multiple myeloma. Other axial skeleton Whole-body radiograph of a major trauma case (where, however, full-body CT scan is usually preferable), showing bilateral femur fractures. (CC-BY-2.0) *The spine (that is, the vertebral column. A projectional radiograph of the spine confers an effective dose of approximately 1.5 mSv, comparable to a background radiation equivalent time of 6 months. :*Cervical spine: The standard projections in the UK AP and Lateral. Peg projection with trauma only. Obliques and Flexion and Extension on special request. In the US, five or six projections are common; a Lateral, two 45 degree obliques, an AP axial (Cephalad), an AP \\"Open Mouth\\" for C1-C2, and Cervicothoracic Lateral (Swimmer's) to better visualize C7-T1 if necessary. Special projections include a Lateral with Flexion and Extension of the cervical spine, an Axial for C1-C2 (Fuchs or Judd method), and an AP Axial (Caudad) for articular pillars. :*Thoracic Spine - AP and Lateral in the UK. In the US, an AP and Lateral are basic projections. Obliques 20 degrees from lateral may be ordered to better visualize the zygapophysial joint. :*Lumbar Spine - AP and Lateral +/- L5/S1 view in the UK, with obliques and Flexion and Extension requests being rare. In the US, basic projections include an AP, two Obliques, a Lateral, and a Lateral L5-S1 spot to better visualize the L5-S1 interspace. Special projections are AP Right and Left bending, and Laterals with Flexion and Extension. :*Pelvis - AP only in the UK, with SIJ projections (prone) on special request. ::*Sacrum and Coccyx: In the US, if both bones are to be examined separate cephalad and caudad AP axial projections are obtained for the sacrum and coccyx respectively as well as a single Lateral of both bones. *Ribs: In the US, common rib projections are based on the location of the area of interest. These are obtained with shorter wavelengths/higher frequencies/higher levels of radiation than a standard CXR. :*Anterior area of interest - a PA chest X-ray, a PA projection of the ribs, and a 45 degree Anterior Oblique with the non-interest side closest to the image receptor. :*Posterior area of interest - a PA chest X-ray, an AP projection of the ribs, and a 45 degree Posterior Oblique with the side of interest closest to the image receptor. *Sternum. The standard projections in the UK are PA chest and lateral sternum. In the US, the two basic projections are a 15 to 20 degree Right Anterior Oblique and a Lateral. :*Sternoclavicular Joints - Are usually ordered as a single PA and a Right and Left 15 degree Right Anterior Obliques in the US. =Shoulders= AP glenoid (Grashey view). These include: ;AP- projection 40¬∞ posterior oblique after Grashey The body has to be rotated about 30 to 45 degrees towards the shoulder to be imaged, and the standing or sitting patient lets the arm hang. This method reveals the joint gap and the vertical alignment towards the socket. ;Transaxillary projection The arm should be abducted 80 to 100 degrees. This method reveals: * The horizontal alignment of the humerus head in respect to the socket, and the lateral clavicle in respect to the acromion. * Lesions of the anterior and posterior socket border or of the tuberculum minus. * The eventual non-closure of the acromial apophysis. * The coraco-humeral interval ;Y-projection The lateral contour of the shoulder should be positioned in front of the film in a way that the longitudinal axis of the scapula continues parallel to the path of the rays. This method reveals: * The horizontal centralization of the humerus head and socket. * The osseous margins of the coraco-acromial arch and hence the supraspinatus outlet canal. * The shape of the acromion This projection has a low tolerance for errors and accordingly needs proper execution. The Y-projection can be traced back to Wijnblath‚Äôs 1933 published cavitas-en-face projection. In the UK, the standard projections of the shoulder are AP and Lateral Scapula or Axillary Projection.

History The name Wanroij was found first in 1265. A person called Bertradis van Wanrode signed, together with son Johan, a certificate. From the French period on Wanroij was an individual municipality. In 1942 it was expanded with the villages Rijkevoort and Landhorst.

The church in Wanroij was named after the Pope Cornelius. Until 1994 Cornelius was represented in the flag of the municipality. For a long period of time Wanroij was very isolated. Around 1850 the infrastructure developed a lot. The first street lanterns were placed in 1922. The first road which was not just a path to other villages was made in 1922, going from Wanroij to Haps. In the 19th century the amount of inhabitants was around 1100. In 1942, it were 1895 people. In a few years it grew to about 3000, and at this moment the estimated amount of inhabitants is 4800.

History Many countries have been plagued by revolutions, coups and civil war. After such turmoil the leaders of the outgoing regime that want, or are forced, to restore democracy in their country are confronted with possible litigation regarding the \\"counterinsurgency\\" actions taken during their reign. It is not uncommon for people to make allegations of human rights abuse and crimes against humanity. To overcome the hazard of facing prosecution, many countries have absolved those involved of their alleged crimes. Amnesty laws are often also equally problematic to the opposing side as a cost-benefit problem: Is bringing the old leadership to justice worth extending the conflict or rule of the previous regime, with an accompanying increase in suffering and casualties, as the old regime refuses to let go of power? Victims, their families and human rights organisations‚Äîe.g., Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Humanitarian Law Project‚Äîhave opposed such laws through demonstrations and litigation, their argument being that an amnesty law violates local constitutional law and international law by upholding impunity. Providing amnesty for ‚Äúinternational crimes‚Äù‚Äîwhich include crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide‚Äîis increasingly considered to be prohibited by international law. This understanding is drawn from the obligations set out in human rights treaties, the decisions of international and regional courts and the law emerging from long-standing state practice (customary international law). International, regional and national courts have increasingly overturned general amnesties. And recent peace agreements have largely avoided granting amnesty for serious crimes.\\"Pursuing Peace, Justice or Both?\\", International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) With that in mind, the International Criminal Court was established to ensure that perpetrators do not evade command responsibility for their crimes should the local government fail to prosecute. The Belfast Guidelines on Amnesty and Accountability set out a framework to evaluate the legality and legitimacy of amnesties in accordance with the multiple legal obligations faced by states undergoing conflict or political transition. They have been collectively authored by a group of international human rights and conflict resolution experts led by Louise Mallinder and Tom Hadden at the Transitional Justice Institute.

Later, Parliament adopted a bill that provided a nearly blanket amnesty for all those involved in the Afghan conflict. The drafting of the amnesty bill was pioneered by some of the former commanders known to have committed human rights abuses and who felt threatened by the sudden emphasis on accountability. Although this bill was never formally recognized as law, it has had major political significance, serving as a clear signal of some human rights violators‚Äô continuing power.\\"Transitional Justice in the Context of Ongoing Conflict: the Case of Afghanistan\\" by Sari Kouvo, International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) =Algeria= A decree by the President in 2006 makes prosecution impossible for human rights abuses, and even muzzle open debate by criminalizing public discussion about the nation's decade-long conflict. *Algeria: New Amnesty Law Will Ensure Atrocities Go Unpunished The International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), March 1, 2006 *Algeria : New Amnesty Law Will Ensure Atrocities Go Unpunished - Muzzles Discussion of Civil Conflict Algeria-Watch =Argentina= The National Commission for Forced Disappearances (CONADEP), led by writer Ernesto Sabato, was created in 1983.

Most of the top officers who were tried were sentenced to life imprisonment: Jorge Rafael Videla, Emilio Eduardo Massera, Roberto Eduardo Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Ra√∫l Agosti, Rub√©n Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo. However, Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's government voted two amnesty laws in order to avoid the escalation of trials against militaries involved in human rights abuses: the 1986 Ley de Punto Final and the 1987 Ley de Obediencia Debida. President Carlos Menem then pardoned the leaders of the junta and the surviving commanders of the armed leftist guerrilla organizations in 1989‚Äì1990. Following persistent activism by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and other associations, the amnesty laws were overturned by the Argentine Supreme Court nearly twenty years later, in June 2005. However, the ruling wasn't applied to the guerrilla leaders, who remained at large. =Benin= In the 1980s, incompetent economic management and ballooning domestic graft, including the draining of funds from parastatals, combined with a continent-wide economic crisis, effectively bankrupted the economy. The government turned to the Bretton Woods institutions for support, which required the implementation of unpopular economic austerity measures. In 1988, when France refused to meet the budgetary shortfall, the three main banks, all state-owned, collapsed and the government was unable to pay teachers, civil servants and soldiers their salaries, nor students their grants. This caused domestic opposition to mushroom, rendering the country ‚Äòvirtually ungovernable‚Äô.20 The World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) refused to provide emergency assistance because of Benin's failure to adhere to prior agreements.21 K√©r√©kou convened a national conference to discuss the country's future course, bringing together representatives of all sectors of Beninese society, including ‚Äòteachers, students, the military, government officials, religious authorities, non- governmental organizations, more than 50 political parties, ex-presidents, labor unions, business interests, farmers, and dozens of local development organizations‚Äô.22 K√©r√©kou believed that he could retain control of the 488 delegates. Instead, when it met in February 1990, the convention declared itself sovereign, redefined the powers of the presidency, reducing K√©r√©kou to a figurehead role, and appointed Nic√©phore Soglo, a former World Bank staff member, to act as executive prime minister. In exchange for a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed, K√©r√©kou peacefully ceded power.

Chilean judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia would eventually make jurisprudence concerning \\"permanent kidnapping\\" crime: since the bodies of the victims could not be found, he deemed that the kidnapping may be said to continue, therefore refusing to grant to the military the benefices of the statute of limitation.

The Government has announced that the amnesty will be introduced in England and Wales as an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill 2016. =Lebanon= Throughout the Lebanese history, several occasions of amnesty can be detected that precluded prosecution for war crimes committed in conflicts in previous decades. In the context of Lebanon, amnesty has been considered to be a \\"politics of protracted conflict,\\" affecting the anticipation of future violence and influencing the sectarian reality in the country. An official amnesty law in Lebanon has only been adopted in 1991, following the civil war that lasted between 1975 and 1990. Other instances of amnesty were enacted following earlier conflicts in the region. In 1839 amnesty was granted by Ibrahim Pasha to the Druze population who had committed crimes against the Maronite population of Mount Lebanon. In 1845 amnesty was granted by Ottoman foreign minister Sakib Efendi to the Druze and Christian communal leaders, following communal tensions in the 'Double Kaymakamate'. In 1860, a third amnesty materialized following the popular revolt led by Tanyus Shahin. In 1958, following a crisis in Lebanon, a politics of 'No Victor, No Vanquished' was first invoked by Saeb Salam.  1839: Druze-Christian tensions in Mount Lebanon  A year before, in 1838, fighting erupted between Druze and Christian Ottomans, following the reforms of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt in Syria. The insurgents were granted amnesty in order to restore civil peace in the region. Under the rule of Pasha, who was the son of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, power in the region was altered from Istanbul to Cairo and the Druze were conscripted to fight along his side. However, the request of Druze arms was highly unpopular among the Druze population, as were following conscription orders, resulting in a major insurrection of the Druze population of Wadi al- Taym and Mount Lebanon against the authority of Pasha. This revolt, commonly known as the 1838 Druze revolt, was suppressed by Pasha with the collaboration of Bashir Shihab II, the Lebanese emir by that time, and Maronite villagers. Pasha succeeded to put down the rebellion, and the total submission of the Druze leaders and population was accepted. Although several authors have interpreted the Egyptian policy of arming Christian villagers in order to suppress the Druzes as a turning point in Druze-Maronite relationships, others have argued that the antagonism between Druzes and Maronites can be explained more in terms of loyalty, as the insurrection of the Druzes was justified in terms of their loyalty to the Sultan, and the armed Christian villagers were obedient to Ibrahim Pasha. Given the successive defeats of the Druze, their chiefs were convinced that an agreement was to be reached with Ibrahim Pasha in order to end the revolt. In this agreement, the Druze insurgents were granted aman, referring to the notion of clemency or amnesty granted by a ruler, and exempted from conscription in return for their disarmament. In a letter, Pasha wrote to Bashir Shihab: > \\"Emir. As regards the Druzes if Jabal al-Shuf, let bygones be bygones. Do > not harm them when they return to their homes. Allay their fears and set > their minds at rest.\\" In this peace agreement, Pasha agreed to give amnesty to the insurgents and the past crimes of the Druze population were forgotten according to the principle of 'let bygones be bygones'. Doing so, Pasha intended to restore civil peace in Mount Lebanon and \\"abolish the memory of past deeds and transgressions.\\" However, the decision to abolish this memory of past crimes could not undo the history of inter-communal conflict with sectarian underpinnings. Despite the attempts of Pasha's amnesty to restore the social order between the Druze and Christian communities, and erase the Druze- Christian dichotomy in order to return to previous loyalties that were based on Ottoman authority, social order was yet again destabilized in the 1840s when Mount Lebanon became a battlefield between Europeans, Ottomans, and local communities over the future of the Ottoman Empire.  1845: Communal tensions in the Kaymakamate  A second amnesty in the context of Lebanon, which similarly attempted to restore the social order and regenerate loyalty to the ruling powers, was adopted in 1845 by Ottoman foreign minister Sakib Efendi. Bitter conflicts between the Christian and Druze communities had been simmering under Ibrahim Pasha's rule, and following other incidents of communal violence the sultan deposed Bashir III on January 13, 1842 and replaced him with Omar Pasha as the new governor of Mount Lebanon. This appointment, nevertheless, did generate more problems than it clarified. European ambassadors and Ottoman foreign ministry officials and military commanders met in 1842, in order to discuss the issue of communal violence. The Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich proposed the administrative partition of Lebanon into Christian and Druze districts. This proposal, known as the 'Double Kaymakamate', was adopted on December 7, 1842, creating a 'Christian' Northern district under the rule of a Christian Kaymakam and a 'Druze' southern district ruled by a Druze district governor. Communal tension between the Druze and Christian communities continued, when the Ottoman foreign minister Sakib Efendi, under the pressure of the European powers, arrived in Lebanon to arrange a settlement between the communal leaders. The system of the double Kaymakamate was to remain in place, but Mount Lebanon was to be pacified in terms of communal relations. \\"The old-regime social order\\" had to be maintained. Sakib Efendi tried to reimpose absolute Ottoman sovereignty in the region, promoting an official Ottoman nationalism in order to contain sectarian mobilizations. His vision of this new sectarian order came to be known as the R√®glement, which based itself on the idea of an ancient rivalry between the Christians and Druzes. Efendi reconfirmed the Kaymakams, however, created for each district an administrative council that included a judge and an advisor for each of the communities, being it Maronite, Druze, Sunni, Greet Orthodox, or Greek Catholic. With regard to amnesty, the notables of each of these sects were reconfirmed in their function to maintain law and order. With this restoration, the elites were \\"rehabilitated in the eyes of the state.\\" Efendi forced the communal notables to sign and accept a peace treaty that was based upon the same principle as the amnesty of 1839: 'let bygones be bygones'. The past of transgression was abolished and the status quo of the political sectarian harmony under the benign Ottoman rule became underscored. Yet again, the leaders of the sects were protected in their position, and the local inhabitants of Mount Lebanon had to subject themselves to the rule of the communal and Ottoman notables. Peace was imposed in the region due to the amnesty law adopted in 1845, however, the source of the sectarian clashes was not resolved and distrust among sects increased.  1860: Mount Lebanon civil war  Following the general rebellion led by Tanyus Shahin, which led to the overthrow of the notably Khazin family in Keserwan District, a third amnesty materialized in 1860 under the leadership of Ottoman governor Hurshid Pasha. Portrait of Hurshid Pasha Tensions continued within the double Kamaykamate system, expressing themselves both in class (Maronites against Maronites) and sectarian (Maronites against Druzes) clashes, which ultimately culminated in the massacre of 1860 in Damascus. The sectarian tensions in this period originated partly in the chaos of the restoration period, and clarified more drastically following the popular revolt led by Tanyus Shahin, which started in the north of Mount Lebanon in 1858 as a rebellion of Maronite peasants against their, mostly Druze, overlords, the heavy taxes imposed upon them, and the feudal practices prevailing in the region. During this rebellion, Shahin managed to convince a part of the Maronite population that the Druze were \\"unbelievers\\" and were treating the Christians unjustly. Stating so, Shahin created a sectarian discourse that shifted \\"the basis of loyalty away from a notable family toward an imagined political sectarian community,\\" a unified Christian sect. Following these events, the rebellion spread to the south of the country where the Druze population increasingly turned against the Maronite Christians, resulting in heavy losses on both sides. When the last major Christian centers in the sectarian landscape were contested, and the Druzes appeared victorious in destroying Shahin's dream of a unified Christian sect, the local Ottoman government of Hurshid Pasha adopted a peace treaty in July between Druze and Christian notables. The purpose of this treaty was to restore social order and the elite political life of the communal leaders. The treaty reinstated an imperial Ottoman authority over the population of Mount Lebanon and underscored the illegitimacy of previous popular revolts, reinforcing \\"a strict sectarian hierarchy.\\" Although with some resistance on the side of the Maronite leaders, peace was agreed upon by the Druze and Christian notables by July 12, 1860. The ahali, the common Druze and Christian villagers that constituted the mass of indigenous society, yet again found themselves back in the position of the obedient followers of the Ottoman Sultan's will. > \\"Each person was to return to his place ... and to take back all his > property and lands as it was in the past.\\" Hurshid did grant amnesty to the notables of both the Druze and Christian kaymakams, however, reprimanded them for their failure to prevent the inter- communal violence of the civil war. Following the principle of 'let bygones be bygones', this third amnesty intended to protect the social order, restore the political life of the communal notables, the elite, and make everyone forget the past violations. Nevertheless, rather than forgetting, \\"memory intensified\\" and \\"the structures of a culture of sectarianism were deeply forming.\\"  1958: Lebanon crisis  An amnesty politics of \\"No Victor, No Vanquished\\" was first invoked by former prime minister Saeb Salam following the 1958 civil war. The 1958 Lebanon crisis was a Lebanese political crisis caused both by political and religious tensions within the country, and by tensions between forces in favor of and against the pro-Western Baghdad Pact. During the crisis, Lebanon was facing inter-communal tensions between the Maronite and the Muslim population of the country. At the same time, tensions were escalating between Lebanon and the United Arab Republic, consisting of Egypt and Syria, who feared that Lebanon posed a threat to the Arab nationalism of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Within Lebanon, Muslims pushed the government of President Camille Chamoun to join the newly created United Arab Republic, however, Lebanese Christians preferred the country's alliance with the Western powers. In June 1958, groups backed by Nasser, supported by a considerable amount of the Lebanese Muslim population, attempted to overthrow Chamoun's government. Appealing to the United States for help under the new Eisenhower Doctrine, Chamoun was backed by American forces that intervened in Lebanon. The crisis ended with an agreement, which allowed Chamoun to end his term after which Fuad Chehabwould succeed him. The prime minister by that time, Saeb Salam, declared the end of the violence with the phrase \\"No Victor, No Vanquished,\\" which made him a communal hero in that period. The politics of 'No Victor, No Vanquished', as invoked by former prime minister Saeb Salam, implied that no political party or sect in the country could eliminate any of the other parties or sects. All of the political groupings were to be represented in the political system in order to ensure coexistence and national unity in Lebanon, and preserve a nation that was tolerant of diverse religions and communities. Whereas the intention of amnesty politics in previous occasions centered around the idea of restoring order for the elite class, this was different in the case of the amnesty adopted in 1958. Rather, the amnesty politics of 1958 came with a preservation of the 1943 National Pact, which preserved a Political sectarianism that centered around the protection of an equal share between Muslims and Christians in the Lebanese government.  1991: Post-Lebanese Civil War  Following the supposed end of the Lebanese Civil War, the Lebanese government adopted a general amnesty law on August 26, 1991. Between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon experienced a brutal civil war in which a range of domestic and international actors were involved. The war did not formally end with a peace agreement, but a regionally established Taif Agreement reached a compromise between the actors involved in 1989. This agreement intended to tackle national reconciliation and promote administrative reforms in the country, however, a topic that was not addressed was the war and its repercussions. According to official data, a 144,240 people died throughout the war, a 197,506 were wounded, and 17,415 people disappeared. Nevertheless, these violations have not been addressed formally, nor have prosecutions been conducted for such crimes. This lack of accountability for past war crimes can be ascribed to the comprehensive amnesty law that was passed in 1991. = Law 84/91 = Following the end of the civil war in Lebanon, the Lebanese Parliament decided on March 28, 1991 to disarm and demobilize all militias, and reintegrate these militias into the regular forces. Heavy weaponry, headquarters and barracks were supposed to be handed over to the Lebanese or Syrian army officials prior to the deadline of April 30. In reality, however, post-war militias \\"sold armaments abroad, hid heavy weapons in remote mountainous areas, kept light and medium weapons to hand and continued to train potential fighters.\\" Exemptions to this decision of dissolvement included Palestinian militias and Hezbollah, which both continued as a force of resistance against the ongoing occupation of Israel. A militia that rejected the proposal for its reintegration into the regular forces was the Israeli proxy, the South Lebanon Army. This militia's continued collaboration with Israel prevented it from benefiting from the amnesty law. After the governmental decision of disarmament, a general amnesty law (law 84/91) was adopted on August 28, 1991 by the Lebanese Parliament, which included several former militia officials who had been appointed to fill vacant seats. The amnesty law, reminiscent of the blanket amnesty that was adopted in the wake of the civil war in 1958, applied to all political and wartime crimes, including crimes against humanity and human dignity, conducted prior to the date of March 28, 1991. Exempted from the law only were crimes committed against political and religious leaders. Covering abduction and hostage-taking, the law pardoned offenses that are usually punishable under Article 569 of the Lebanese Penal Code, which prescribes life imprisonment for such crimes. By adopting an amnesty law that \\"sought to present Lebanon as a national community\\" that was \\"able to maneuver past ideological disagreements and even armed conflict,\\" the political elite promoted a politics of 'No Victor, No Vanquished,' similar to the politics of amnesty of 1958. Doing so, the political elite reconciled with each other over mutual interests and armed opponents were encouraged to set aside their differences in order to share political power. = Aftermath = Hitherto, passed amnesty law of 1991 has had consequences permeating socio-political life in Lebanon. The passing of the amnesty law has allowed the continuation of political careers for those who had committed crimes throughout the Lebanese civil war. Today, leaders of some of the militias that were responsible for abductions throughout the Lebanese Civil War are still serving as government ministers. The UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon in Leidschendam, The Netherlands. As the law intended to \\"eliminate a history of social and political disorder and create the appearance that nobody was wrong and nobody had to be held full accountable,\\" victims of the civil war in Lebanon have not been compensated, and perpetrators have not been held accountable for crimes committed throughout the civil war. As several authors have pointed out, little public discussion of the past is present in contemporary Lebanon: > \\"There is no plan for broader war crimes or human rights trials, and there > are no policies in place for transitional justice mechanisms or a national > reconciliation process. There is relatively little public discussion of the > past, and certainly no shared narrative regarding the conflict, although the > latter is often difficult if not impossible.\\" To date, there has been little transitional justice for crimes committed during and following the civil war, which has contributed to \\"a culture of impunity\\" in Lebanon, characterized by the absence of any serious accountability process for past violations, a lack of opportunities to address the abuses conducted during the conflict, and a selective approach to criminal justice. The only current measure in place for accountability is the internationalized UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon to carry out the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the assassination of Lebanon's former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on February 14, 2005 alongside several related assassinations. Nevertheless, this tribunal was not designed to address any of the events during the civil war and many have, therefore, criticized the tribunal for being \\"politicised and unable to deliver accountability.\\" Another severe consequence of the amnesty law of 1991 has been the strengthening of communitarian frameworks in Lebanese society. Due to the amnesty law, all Lebanese citizens were absolved from any responsibility for possible past actions during war time. With the law in place, the political elites of Lebanon did undermine the individual accountability of citizens \\"on which rests a democratic and secular state.\\" Subsequently, memory and reconciliation with regard to the past war continues to take place within a communitarian framework, reinforcing the role of the zu'amƒÅ, the politico- religious leaders. = International criticism = The amnesty law of 1991 has been received with plenty of academic and international critique, particularly from a human rights perspective. A general criticism to the amnesty law has been concerned with the preservation of leadership by the political elite. In his review of the trial of the assassination attempt against Michel Murr, Lebanese lawyer Nizar Saghieh observes the consecration of the Lebanese leaders, stating that \\"while the United Nations consecrated the Universal Declaration for Human Rights as a lesson learned in the wake of the Second World War, it seemed that the lesson the Lebanese people learned at the end of their war was the necessity to protect and revere their leaders.\\"Saghieh, Nizar (2006) Crimes Against Humanity in a Charismatic State. Speech given at the Srebrenica: Crime and Punishment forum, organized by UMAM Documentation and Research together with Heinrich Boll Foundation Middle East Office in Lebanon. Original in Arabic. Official institutions have similarly criticized the 1991 Lebanese amnesty law. For example, following a report by the Lebanese Government on its implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights Committee stated that: > ‚ÄúThe Committee notes with concern the amnesty granted to civilian and > military personnel for human rights violations they may have committed > against civilians during the civil war. Such a sweeping amnesty may prevent > the appropriate investigation and punishment of the perpetrators of past > human rights violations, undermine efforts to establish respect for human > rights, and constitute an impediment to efforts undertaken to consolidate > democracy.‚Äù The amnesty law of 1991 has also been criticized by human-rights organization Amnesty International, arguing that critical and impartial investigations should be conducted into the allegations of human rights violations in order to \\"determine individual and collective responsibility and to provide a full account of truth to the victim, their relatives and society.\\" =Paraguay= =Peru= On 14 June 1995, President Alberto Fujimori signed a bill granting amnesty for any human rights abuses or other criminal acts committed from May 1982 to 14 June 1995 as part of the counterinsurgency war by military, police, and civilians.The New Amnesty Law in Peru by NACLA Report on the Americas (Sept/Oct 1995) The amnesty laws created a new challenge for the human rights movement in Peru. They thwarted the demands for truth and justice that thousands of family members of victims of political violence have been making since the 1980s. Thus, after the fall of Alberto Fujimori in 2001, the Inter- American Court ruled that the amnesty laws 26.479 and 26.492 were invalid because they were incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights. The court later specified that the ruling was applicable to all Peruvian cases.The Legacy of Truth: Criminal Justice in the Peruvian Transition, International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) =Senegal= A bill absolved anyone convicted for committing political crimes.

Along with a cease-fire agreement between the government of Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) it contained proposals to \\"expunge responsibility for all offences including international crimes, otherwise known as delict jus gentium such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, torture and other serious violations of international humanitarian law.\\"Is the Sierra Leonean Amnesty Law Compatible with International Law? by Phenyo Keiseng Rakate, MenschenRechtsMagazin Heft 3 / 2000 =South Africa= Following the end of apartheid South Africa decided not to prosecute but instead created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Its aim was to investigate and elucidate the crimes committed during the apartheid regime while not indicting in an attempt to make the alleged perpetrators more compliant to cooperate. The TRC offered of ‚Äúamnesty for truth‚Äù to perpetrators of human rights abuses during the apartheid era. This enabled abusers to confess their actions to the TRC in order to be granted amnesty. It aroused much controversy in the country and internationally.South Africa, International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) =Spain= In 1977, the first democratic government elected after Franco's death passed the Law 46/1977, of amnesty, which exempted of responsibility to everyone who committed any offence for political reasons prior to this date. This law allowed the commutation of sentences of those accused to attack the dictatorship and secured that those crimes committed during the Francoism would not be prosecuted. =United States= During the War on Terror, the United States enacted the Military Commissions Act of 2006 in an attempt to regulate the legal procedures involving illegal combatants. Part of the act was an amendment which retroactively rewrote the War Crimes Act effectively making policy makers (i.e., politicians and military leaders) and those applying policy (i.e., CIA interrogators and U.S. soldiers) no longer subject to legal prosecution under U.S. law for acts defined as war crimes before the amendment was passed.No longer punishable under U.S. law *Thoughts on the \\"Bringing Terrorists to Justice Act of 2006\\" John Dean, FindLaw, September 22, 2006 *Joanne Mariner, \\"The Military Commissions Act of 2006: A Short Primer - Part Two of a Two-Part Series\\", FindLaw, October 25, 2006 *Michael C.

Until the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the early Muslim conquests of the eastern Mediterranean, the main centers of Hellenistic Judaism were Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria (now in southern Turkey), the two main Greek urban settlements of the Middle East and North Africa region, both founded at the end of the fourth century BCE in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Hellenistic Judaism also existed in Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period, where there was conflict between Hellenizers and traditionalists. The major literary product of the contact of Second Temple Judaism and Hellenistic culture is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koine Greek, specifically, Jewish Koin√© Greek. Mentionable are also the philosophic and ethical treatises of Philo and the historiographical works of the other Hellenistic Jewish authors.Walter, N. J√ºdisch-hellenistische Literatur vor Philon von Alexandrien (unter Ausschluss der Historiker), ANRW II: 20.1.67-120 The decline of Hellenistic Judaism started in the second century and its causes are still not fully understood. It may be that it was eventually marginalized by, partially absorbed into or became progressively the Koine-speaking core of Early Christianity centered on Antioch and its traditions, such as the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.  Hellenism  ancient Macedonia. The conquests of Alexander in the late fourth century BCE spread Greek culture and colonization‚Äîa process of cultural change called Hellenization‚Äîover non-Greek lands, including the Levant. This gave rise to the Hellenistic period, which sought to create a common or universal culture in the Alexandrian empire based on that of fifth-century Athens, along with a fusion of Near Eastern cultures.Roy M. MacLeod, The Library Of Alexandria: Centre Of Learning In The Ancient World The period is characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa,Ulrich Wilcken, Griechische Geschichte im Rahmen der Alterumsgeschichte. the most famous being Alexandria in Egypt. New cities were established composed of colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not from a specific metropolis (\\"mother city\\") as before. Mosaic floor of a Jewish Synagogue Aegina (300 BCE). These Jews living in countries west of the Levant formed the Hellenistic diaspora. The Egyptian diaspora is the most well-known of these. It witnessed close ties, indeed the firm economic integration, of Judea with the Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled from Alexandria, and the friendly relations which existed between the royal court and the leaders of the Jewish community. This was a diaspora of choice, not of imposition. Information is less robust regarding diasporas in other territories. It suggests that the situation was by and large the same as it was in Egypt. Jewish life in both Judea and the diaspora was influenced by the culture and language of Hellenism. The Greeks viewed Jewish culture favorably, while vice versa, Hellenism gained adherents among the Jews. While Hellenism has sometimes been presented (under the influence of 2 Maccabees, itself notably a work in Koine Greek), as a threat of assimilation diametrically opposed to Jewish tradition, The main religious issue dividing Hellenized Jews from traditional Jews was the application of biblical laws in a Hellenistic (or Roman or other non-Jewish) empire.\\"Hellenism\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, Quote: \\"Post-exilic Judaism was largely recruited from those returned exiles who regarded it as their chief task to preserve their religion uncontaminated, a task that required the strict separation of the congregation both from all foreign peoples (Ezra x. 11; Neh. ix. 2) and from the Jewish inhabitants of Palestine who did not strictly observe the Law (Ezra vi. 22; Neh. x. 29). \\" =Hellenistic rulers of Judea= Under the suzerainty of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and later the Seleucid Empire, Judea witnessed a period of peace and protection of its institutions. For their aid against his Ptolemaic enemies, Antiochus III the Great promised his Jewish subjects a reduction in taxes and funds to repair the city of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. Relations deteriorated under Antiochus's successor Seleucus IV Philopator, and then, for reasons not fully understood, his successor Antiochus IV Epiphanes drastically overturned the previous policy of respect and protection, banning key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea (though not among the diaspora) and sparking a traditionalist revolt against Greek rule. Out of this revolt was formed an independent Jewish kingdom known as the Hasmonean dynasty, which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated due to civil war, which coincided with civil wars in Rome. Hasmonean civil war The Hasmonean civil war began when the High Priest Hyrcanus II (a supporter of the Pharisees) was overthrown by his younger brother, Aristobulus II (a supporter of the Sadducees). A third faction, consisting primarily of Idumeans from Maresha, led by Antipater and his son Herod, re-installed Hyrcanus, who, according to Josephus, was merely Antipater's puppet. In 47 BCE, Antigonus, a nephew of Hyrcanus II and son of Aristobulus II, asked Julius Caesar for permission to overthrow Antipater. Caesar ignored him, and in 42 BCE Antigonus, with the aid of the Parthians, defeated Herod. Antigonus ruled for only three years, until Herod, with the aid of Rome, overthrew him and had him executed. Antigonus was the last Hasmonean ruler.  Influence  The major literary product of the contact of Judaism and Hellenistic culture is the Septuagint, as well as the Book of Wisdom, Sirach, apocrypha and pseudepigraphic apocalyptic literature (such as the Assumption of Moses, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Book of Baruch, the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, etc.) dating to the period. Important sources are Philo of Alexandria and Flavius Josephus. Some scholars\\"Saul of Tarsus: Not a Hebrew Scholar; a Hellenist\\", Jewish Encyclopedia consider Paul of Tarsus to be a Hellenist as well, even though he himself claimed to be a Pharisee (Acts 23:6). Philo of Alexandria was an important apologist of Judaism, presenting it as a tradition of venerable antiquity that, far from being a barbarian cult of an oriental nomadic tribe, with its doctrine of monotheism had anticipated tenets of Hellenistic philosophy. Philo could draw on Jewish tradition to use customs which Greeks thought as primitive or exotic as the basis for metaphors: such as \\"circumcision of the heart\\" in the pursuit of virtue.E. g., Leviticus 26:41, Ezekiel 44:7 Consequently, Hellenistic Judaism emphasized monotheistic doctrine (heis theos), and represented reason (logos) and wisdom (sophia) as emanations from God. Beyond Tarsus, Alexandretta, Antioch and Northwestern Syria (the main \\"Cilician and Asiatic\\" centers of Hellenistic Judaism in the Levant), the second half of the Second Temple period witnessed an acceleration of Hellenization in Israel itself, with Jewish high priests and aristocrats alike adopting Greek names:  'There is neither Jew nor Greek'  Ethnic, cultural, philosophical, and social tensions within the Hellenistic Jewish world were partly overcome by the emergence of a new, typically Antiochian, Middle-Eastern Greek doctrine (doxa), either by # established, autochthonous Hellenized Cilician-Western Syrian Jews (themselves descendants of Babylonian Jewish migrants who had long adopted various elements of Greek culture and civilization while retaining a generally conservative, strict attachment to Halakha), # heathen, 'Classical' Greeks, Macedonian Greeks and Greco-Syrian gentiles, or # the local, autochthonous descendants of Greek or Greco-Syrian converts to mainstream Judaism ‚Äì known as proselytes (Greek: œÄœÅŒøœÉŒÆŒªœÖœÑŒøœÇ/proselytes) and Greek-speaking Jews born of mixed marriages. Their efforts were probably facilitated by the arrival of a fourth wave of Greek-speaking newcomers to Cilicia/Southern Turkey and Northwestern Syria: Cypriot Jews and 'Cyrenian' (Libyan) Jewish migrants of non-Egyptian North African Jewish origin, as well as gentile Roman settlers from Italy‚Äîmany of whom already spoke fluent Koine Greek and/or sent their children to Greek schools. Some scholars believe that, at the time, these Cypriot and Cyrenian North African Jewish migrants, such as Simon of Cyrene, were generally less affluent than the autochthonous Cilician-Syrian Jews and practiced a more 'liberal' form of Judaism, more propitious for the formation of a new canon: But Paul, himself a strict conservative Hellenist convert to Christianity, was later threatened by religiously conservative Jewish Hellenists as seen in the New Testament Acts 9 verse 29: \\"And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him.\\" These subtle, progressive socio-cultural shifts and tensions are somehow summarized succinctly in Chapter 3 of the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians:  Decline of the Hellenistai and partial conversion to Christianity  Joshua. Fresco from Dura-Europos synagogue. The reasons for the decline of Hellenistic Judaism are obscure. It may be that it was marginalized by, absorbed into, or became Early Christianity (see the Gospel according to the Hebrews). The Epistles of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles report that, after his initial focus on the conversion of Hellenized Jews across Anatolia, Macedonia, Thrace and Northern Syria without criticizing their laws and traditions,McGarvey on Acts 16: \\"Yet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this 'on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters. '\\" Paul the Apostle eventually preferred to evangelize communities of Greek and Macedonian proselytes and Godfearers, or Greek circles sympathetic to Judaism: the Apostolic Decree allowing converts to forego circumcision made Christianity a more attractive option for interested pagans than Rabbinic Judaism, which required ritual circumcision for converts (see Brit milah).

The attractiveness of Christianity may, however, have suffered a setback with its being explicitly outlawed in the 80s CE by Domitian as a \\"Jewish superstition\\", while Judaism retained its privileges as long as members paid the fiscus Judaicus. The opening verse of Acts 6 points to the problematic cultural divisions between Hellenized Jews and Aramaic-speaking Israelites in Jerusalem, a disunion that reverberated within the emerging Christian community itself: Some historians believe that a sizeable proportion of the Hellenized Jewish communities of Southern Turkey (Antioch, Alexandretta and neighboring cities) and Syria/Lebanon converted progressively to the Greco-Roman branch of Christianity that eventually constituted the \\"Melkite\\" (or \\"Imperial\\") Hellenistic churches of the MENA area:  Cultural legacy  = Widespread influence beyond Second Temple Judaism = Both Early Christianity and Early Rabbinical Judaism were far less 'orthodox' and less theologically homogeneous than they are today; and both were significantly influenced by Hellenistic religion and borrowed allegories and concepts from Classical Hellenistic philosophy and the works of Greek-speaking Jewish authors of the end of the Second Temple period before the two schools of thought eventually affirmed their respective 'norms' and doctrines, notably by diverging increasingly on key issues such as the status of 'purity laws', the validity of Judeo-Christian messianic beliefs, and, more importantly, the use of Koin√© Greek and Latin as liturgical languages replacing Biblical Hebrew, etc.Daniel Boyarin. \\"Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism\\" [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999, p. 15. = First synagogues in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East = The word synagogue itself comes from Jewish Koin√© Greek, a language spoken by Hellenized Jews across Southeastern Europe (Macedonia, Thrace, Northern Greece), North Africa and the Middle East after the 3rd century BCE. Many synagogues were built by the Hellenistai or adherents of Hellenistic Judaism in the Greek Isles, Cilicia, Northwestern and Eastern Syria and Northern Israel as early as the first century BCE- notably in Delos, Antioch, Alexandretta, Galilee and Dura- Europos: because of the mosaics and frescos representing heroic figures and Biblical characters (viewed as potentially conductive of \\"image worship\\" by later generations of Jewish scholars and rabbis), many of these early synagogues were at first mistaken for heathen Greek temples or Antiochian Greek Orthodox churches. = Mishnaic and Talmudic concepts = Many of the Jewish sages who compiled the Mishnah and earliest versions of the Talmud were Hellenized Jews, including Johanan ben Zakai, the first Jewish sage attributed the title of rabbi and Rabbi Meir Baal HaNes, the son of Proselyte Anatolian Greek converts to Early Rabbinical Judaism.

But many of the surviving liturgical traditions of these communities rooted in Hellenistic Judaism and, more generally, Second Temple Greco-Jewish Septuagint culture, were expunged progressively in the late medieval and modern eras by both Phanariot European-Greek (Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople) and Vatican (Roman Catholic) gentile theologians who sought to 'bring back' Levantine Greek Orthodox and Greek-Catholic communities into the European Christian fold: some ancient Judeo-Greek traditions were thus deliberately abolished or reduced in the process. Members of these communities still call themselves \\"R√ªm\\" (literally \\"Roman\\"; usually referred to as \\"Byzantine\\" in English) and referring to Greeks in Turkish, Persian and Levantine Arabic.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II listed building. It is now in use as a private residence. Peddimore was first mentioned in 1281 when it was conveyed by Thomas Arden of Ratley to Hugh de Vienne and subsequently to Thomas and Rose de Arden of Hanwell in 1286. In 1288, the owners of Peddimore Hall were allowed by the Earl of Warwick, William de Beauchamp to fish in Ebrook (now Plants Brook) on his land, allow his pigs to roam in the woods and was allowed to remove timber for building reparations.Walmley Residents Association: A brief history of Peddimore A building on site is first mentioned in 1361 when John de Arden was granted a licence for a private chapel. Peddimore Hall is encircled by a double moat, which forms a rectangular site. A double moat was often used as a status symbol during the time, however, it was also practical in preventing access from thieves, enclosing livestock and also provided water for fires or animals. The double moat dates to the 13th century and a manor has been located on the rectangular site since 1281. The current brick structure was built in 1659 on the site of an earlier homestead, the structure of which many partly be incorporated into it.Sutton Coldfield, 1974-84: The Story of a Decade : a Look at Life and Events in the Royal Town, Douglas V. Jones, 1984, Westwood Press () It was built by William Wilson and first occupied by William Wood, a prominent Royalist and Warden of the Sutton Corporation in 1662 and 1676. There are farm buildings within the grounds, some of which are timber- framed. The building is built of red brick with red sandstone angle-dressings and moulded plinth. It is two storeys tall. A drawbridge crosses the moat at the entrance.Midlands Moats: Warwickshire The old timber-framed barn on the farm dates from 1385 and is believed to have not been altered since that date.Walmley and its surroundings, Douglas V.

He had an early effect on the direction that American psychiatry took during the mid- to late-twentieth century. With Theodore Lidz and Alice Cornelison, he was a co-author of the seminal book Schizophrenia and the Family (1965), a significant influence on the modern psychiatric thought and practice regarding the origins and treatments of schizophrenia. Early life One of four sons and one daughter born in Frankfurt, Germany, to Georg and Anna Fleck, he was a young medical student in 1933 when a professor warned him and several other Jewish students that there were Nazi warrants out for their arrests. Fleck and most of his immediate family fled Hitler's Germany, first to The Netherlands and then, in 1935, to Boston, Massachusetts, where he became a U.S. citizen. He finished medical school at Harvard, where he was a graduate assistant to John Rock while Rock was performing the preliminary research that led to the invention of the first birth control pill. This helped to spark Fleck's lifelong interest in contraception and family planning issues. Military service In 1941, Fleck enlisted in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. He was first stationed as a medical officer at Camp Aliceville, a U.S. Army Prisoner of War Camp at Aliceville, Alabama, where he was involved in treating a diphtheria epidemic that spread quickly among the prisoners. Among the Nazi prisoners were a number of Rommel Corps soldiers, some of whom, even while incarcerated in west central Alabama, attempted to assassinate other Nazis they saw as having been disloyal to the Third Reich. Since Fleck kept his national origin and fluency in German secret from the prisoners, he was able to prevent some of these plotted murders.Wall, Randy. the Wire: Aliceville and the Afrika Korps,\\" Alabama Heritage Magazine (Winter 1988, No. 7) He was subsequently shipped to the European Theater, and first posted in England in Army camp hospitals. Just before D-Day, Fleck was posted to Bournemouth, England, to await transport over the channel with the medical (ambulance) corps. While in Bournemouth, he met Louise Harlan, an American Red Cross volunteer. Fleck stayed with ambulance corps attached to the 72nd and 76th Divisions as they moved through Belgium. He was present at the Battle of the Bulge and afterward was briefly in charge of the medical needs of some 30,000 captured German soldiers. Subsequently, he was involved in interrogating POWs and evacuating and treating concentration camp prisoners; he also traveled to several camps to search for records or other signs of surviving friends and extended family. Early medical career Fleck and Harlan were shipped home in August and September 1945; they were married on October 13, 1945. Fleck did his psychiatric residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, where he first met his lifelong colleague Theodore Lidz. He had a faculty position at the University of Washington School of Medicine from 1949 until 1953, when Lidz invited Fleck to join him at the Yale School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry. Career at Yale Fleck and Lidz \\"worked from the late 1940s on to change the direction of psychiatry from the purely psychoanalytic to a specialty incorporating social- scientific methodology, medical, behavioral, neurological and public-health factors, and especially familial considerations.\\" They focused their long- term research on schizophrenic patients and their families, culminating in the 1966 publication of the ground-breaking Schizophrenia and the Family, for which Lidz, Fleck and Cornelison won the 1985 American Family Therapy Academy \\"Pioneering Contribution to Family Therapy\\" award. American Family Therapy Academy awards list In addition to his research, professorial, and supervisory roles at the school of medicine, Fleck was also chief psychiatrist at both the Yale Psychiatric Institute and the Connecticut Mental Health Center. Fleck officially retired from Yale in 1983 but continued to publish and to consult on colleagues' cases until a few months before his 2002 death. The Stephen Fleck Clinician and Teacher Award at the Yale School of Medicine is named in his honor. Personal life The Flecks had three children in quick succession: Anna Lou (b. 1947), Stephen Harlan (b. 1948), and Carra Ruth (b. 1949). Together, the Flecks were campaigners for legalized birth control and abortion, participating in the activism that led to the landmark 1965 Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut. Louise Fleck had grown up in Nome, Alaska among other places, and had traveled and worked internationally before and after World War II receiving a BA (honors) in Spanish from the University of Washington. In New Haven, she became active in public school issues, and acquired an MAT-Reading. She tutored many illiterate adults, generally without fee.

It was built first in 1800 by Sultan Selim III for the soldiers of the newly established Nizam-ƒ± Cedid (literally \\"New Order\\") in frame of the Ottoman military reform efforts.Istanbul Being the world's largest barracks of it time, it was where Florence Nightingale laid the foundation for modern nursing during the Crimean War. Construction The initially wooden barracks was designed by Krikor Balyan. It was burnt down in 1806 by revolting Janissaries, who were against the reforms. Ordered by Sultan Mahmud II, rebuilding of the barracks in stone began in 1825 and it was completed on 6 February 1828. It is a gigantic rectangle building with a large parade ground in the centre. The structure has three floors on three wings and two floors only on the eastern wing due to inclined terrain. Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality During the reign of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I, the barracks were renovated twice, first in 1842‚Äì43 and again in 1849‚Äì50. During this process, a tower seven stories in height was added to each of the four corners, giving the barracks the look they have today. Crimean War During the Crimean War (1854‚Äì56), the barracks were allocated to the British Army, which was on the way from Britain to the Crimea. After the troops of its 33rd and 41st regiments of foot left for the front, the barracks were converted into a temporary military hospital. On 4 November 1854, Florence Nightingale arrived in Scutari with 37 volunteer nurses. They cared for thousands of wounded and infected soldiers until she returned home in 1857 as a heroine. Around 6,000 soldiers died in the Selimiye Barracks during the war, mostly as the result of cholera epidemic. The dead were buried at a plot next to the barracks, which became later the Haydarpa≈üa Cemetery. Today, the northernmost tower of the barracks is a museum.

It is a clinical sign or condition that constitutes insufficient tear film drainage from the eyes, in that tears will drain down the face rather than through the nasolacrimal system. Cause Causes of epiphora are any that cause either overproduction of tears or decreased drainage of tears, resulting in tearing onto the cheek. This can be due to ocular irritation and inflammation (including trichiasis and entropion) or an obstructed tear outflow tract which is divided according to its anatomical location (i.e. ectropion, punctal, canalicular or nasolacrimal duct obstruction). The latter is often due to aging (a spontaneous process), conjunctivochalasis, infection (i.e. dacryocystitis), rhinitis, and in neonates or infants, failure of the nasolacrimal duct to open. Another cause could be poor reconstruction of the nasolacrimal duct system after trauma to the area. Cause of trauma could be facial fractures (including nasoethmoid fractures or maxillary Le Fort fractures), and soft tissue trauma involving the nose and/or the eyelid. This condition is often frustrating or irritating. A systematic review studying the usage of punctal plugs for treatment of dry eye reported a few cases of epiphora among participants. Diagnosis Diagnosis of epiphora is clinical by history presentation and observation of the lids. Fluorescein dye can be used to examine for punctal reflux by pressing on the canaliculi in which the clinician should note resistance of reflux as it irrigates through the punctum into the nose. Management If epiphora is caused by ectropion or entropion, lid repair is indicated. Punctal irrigation is also required. In infants with nasolacrimal defects, a nasolacrimal duct probe is used and a tube replacement, either temporary (Crawford) or permanent (Jones), is carried out. A surgical procedure called a dacryocystorhinostomy is done to join the lacrimal sac to the nasal mucosa in order to restore lacrimal drainage.

Cummins joined the team during the 1971-72 National Hurling League and was a semi-regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1976 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal and one Munster medal. At club level Cummins was a three-time All-Ireland medalist with Blackrock. In addition to this he has also won two Munster medals. Playing career =Club= Cummins played his club hurling with Blackrock and enjoyed much success during a golden age for the cub. In 1971 he lined out in his first senior decider as Blackrock faced St. Finbarr's. After a decade in the doldrums the Rockies were back and a 2-19 to 5-4 victory secured a championship medal for Cummins. Blackrock subsequently represented Cork in the provincial series of games and faced Moyne-Templetuohy in the decider. An impressive 4-10 to 3-1 victory gave Cummins a Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Blackrock against Rathnure. A high-scoring game followed, however, a narrow 5-13 to 6-9 victory gave Cummins an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal. Blackrock surrendered their club, provincial and All-Ireland decider the following year, however, in 1973 Cummins lined out in a second county championship final. A 2-12 to 2-10 defeat of Glen Rovers gave him a second championship medal. A subsequent two-point defeat of Newmarket-on-Fergus in the provincial decider gave Cummins a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Blackrock against Rathnure. A rousing draw was followed by a great replay, however, Cummins was dropped for the replay. Superb late goals by Donie Collins and √âamonn O'Donoghue secured a 3-8 to 1-9 victory and a second All-Ireland medal for Cummins, albeit as an unused su. =Minor and under-21= Cummins first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1967. He was an unused substitute that year as Cork claimed both the Munster and All-Ireland crowns. In 1968 Cummins made his minor championship debut in a Munster semi-final defeat of Galway. He later won his first Munster medal on the field of play following a high-scoring 7-8 to 5-4 defeat of Waterford. Cummins was at full- back for Cork's subsequent All-Ireland final defeat by Wexford. The following year Cummins made his under-21 debut when he came on as a sub in a Munster quarter-final victory over Waterford. He missed the subsequent provincial final victory but was on the starting fifteen in the All-Ireland final against Wexford. A 5-13 to 4-7 victory gave Cummins his first All-Ireland medal. Cummins won his first Munster medal on the field of play in 1970 following a 3-11 to 2-7 defeat of Tipperary. Cork faced their old rivals Wexford in the subsequent All-Ireland decider, however, that game ended in a draw. In the replay Cork went into overdrive and Cummins won a second All-Ireland medal following a 5-17 to 0-8 thrashing. In 1971 Cummins missed the Munster final but was back on the starting fifteen for the subsequent All-Ireland decider. Wexford stood in the way of Cork securing a record-breaking fourth successive championship and a high-scoring game ensued. A 7-8 to 1-11 victory gave Cummins his third All-Ireland medal. =Senior= Cummins made his senior debut for Cork during the 1971-72 National League. It was a successful campaign for the Rebels as a 3-14 to 2-14 defeat of Limerick gave him a National Hurling League medal as an unused substitute. Cork later reached the All-Ireland decider and Cummins was a late addition to the extended panel. He was an unused sub once again as Cork were defeated by Kilkenny. After a number of years off the panel Cummins returned in 1976 and made his championship debut in a Munster semi-final defeat of Tipperary. He later won his sole Munster medal as Limerick were bested by 3-15 to 4-5. The subsequent All- Ireland final saw Cork face old rivals Wexford. In one of the worst starts to a championship decider, Cork were 2-2 to no score in arrears after just six minutes. The Rebels fought back to level matters by half-time, however, it was the long-range point-scoring by Pat Moylan that turned the game for Cork. A 2-21 to 4-11 victory gave Cummins his sole All-Ireland medal. Personal life Born in Ballinlough, Cummins is part of a Cork hurling dynasty. His grandfather, William \\"Bowler\\" Walsh, played hurling with Cork in the early part of the twentieth century. He lined out in two All-Ireland finals in 1912 and 1915, however, he ended up on the losing side on both occasions. Cummins' father, Willie, was an All-Ireland minor medalist with Cork and also lined out for the senior team. His older brothers, Kevin and Ray, both wore the red jersey of Cork at various levels from the 1960s until the 1980s. In his professional life Cummins worked as a secondary school teacher in Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠. After retiring from teaching he became involved as a director with Cummins Sports.

If the two teams make a draw in 90 minutes, then they go to a sudden death extra time, where the golden goal will be counted as two goals. If no team scores in the extra time, then they go to the penalty shootout to determine the winner. =Group 1= \\\\ \\\\ Anomaly Grenada went into the match with a superior goal difference, meaning that Barbados needed to win by at least two goals to progress to the finals. The trouble was caused by two things. First, unlike most group stages in football competitions, the organizers had deemed that all games must have a winner. All games drawn over 90 minutes would go to sudden death extra time. Secondly and most importantly, there was an unusual rule which stated that in the event of a game going to sudden death extra time the goal would count double, meaning that the winner would be awarded a two- goal victory. Barbados was leading 2‚Äì0 until the 83rd minute, when Grenada scored, making it 2‚Äì1. Approaching the dying moments, the Barbadians realized they had little chance of scoring past Grenada's mass defense in the time available, so they deliberately scored an own goal to tie the game at 2‚Äì2. This would send the game into extra time and give them another half-hour to break down the defense. The Grenadians realized what was happening and attempted to score an own goal as well, which would put Barbados back in front by one goal and would eliminate Barbados from the competition. However, the Barbados players started defending their opposition's goal to prevent them from doing this, and during the game's last five minutes, the fans were treated to the incredible sight of Grenada trying to score in either goal while Barbados defended both ends of the pitch. Barbados successfully held off Grenada for the final five minutes, sending the game into extra time.

The Vyborg Manifesto (; also called the Vyborg Appeal) was a proclamation signed by several Russian politicians, primarily Kadets and Trudoviks) of the dissolved First Duma on . In the wake of the 1905 Revolution, Russia's first modern parliament, the State Duma, was convoked. It rapidly became a voice of radicalism and liberalism, and was subsequently dissolved by the Tsarist government 72 days after convocation. Outraged, several of the members of the first Duma travelled to Vyborg in the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, where they signed a 'manifesto' calling for public resistance and tax and draft evasion. The manifesto was met with 'universal indifference', which allowed the Tsarist authorities to silence the manifesto's contributors, and they were all banned from participating in future Dumas. The result was that the Kadet party turned towards conservatism and no longer consciously identifying themselves as a party for 'the people'. History =Background= The Constitutional Democratic Party was formed in Moscow on 12‚Äì18 October 1905 at the height of the Russian Revolution of 1905 when Tsar Nicholas II was forced to sign the October Manifesto granting basic civil liberties. The Kadets were to the immediate Left of the Octobrists, another liberal party organized at the same time. Unlike the Octobrists, who were committed to constitutional monarchy from the start, the Kadets were at first ambiguous on the subject, demanding universal suffrage (even for women) and a Constituent Assembly that would determine the country's form of government. The Kadets were one of the parties invited by the reform-minded prime minister Sergei Witte to join his cabinet in October and November 1905, but the negotiations broke down over the Kadets' radical demands and Witte's refusal to drop notorious reactionaries like Petr Nikolayevich Durnovo from the cabinet. In the wake of the 1905 Revolution, Russia's first modern parliament, the first Duma, was convoked. It rapidly turned into a revolutionary tribune, \\"a rhetorical battering ram against the fortress of autocracy\\".Figes, p. 218 Day one of the Duma the parliamentarians condemned the government's political repression, and demands of amnesty of political prisoners became voiced from the Tauride Palace; the calls commenced after a boat full of representatives sailed down the Neva, passing by the Kresty prison, whereupon a tearful and emotional waving encounter between the prisoners and the representatives happened. As the representatives found their seats Ivan Petrunkevich, the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), asked upon the assembly to devote their first free thoughts and words to \\"those who sacrificed their own freedom for the liberation of our dear Russia\\". The hall burst into shouting \\"mnesty, Amnesty\\" towards the ministers attending, and amnesty for the political prisoners, a prerogative exclusively held by the Tsar, were included in an address to the Emperor which also included demands for increased liberties such as universal suffrage, radical land reforms, further executive powers to the Duma, a government responsible to the parliament, and the abolition of the reactionary consultative State Council. After two weeks of silence, the government passed its two first bills for the approval of the Duma, one for the construction of a greenhouse at the University of Dorpat and one for the a new laundry. This was in effect a declaration of a \\"legislative war\\", as the government would not even recognise the demands of reform from the Duma.Figes, p. 219 It was clear by this time that it was only a matter of time before the Duma became dissolved, and after further radical speeches in the Duma stand, the parliament was dissolved 72 days after it was convoked, on the 21 July (8 July O.S.) New elections for a second Duma was called for the following February, and Prime Minister Ivan Goremykin was replaced by Stolypin, who was a well known advocate for the abolition of the communal system, and known for repressive measures to restore order in the provinces. The liberals of the first Duma were subsequently outraged. Prince Georgy Lvov was one of those outraged by this \\"blatant attack on the parliamentary principle\\", even though he had opposed the land reform; he subsequently became radicalised, after previously being a 'moderate liberal'.Figes, p. 220 The government on the other hand deemed the Duma \\"dysfunctional\\". =The Manifesto= State Duma arrive from Saint Petersburg to Vyborg to sign the Manifesto Lvov became one of the Kadets who now travelled to Vyborg (Finnish: Viipuri), a Finnish resort town, in protest of the government. Here the Kadet members and liberals signed a \\"manifesto\\" where they called on the Russian people to rebel against the government by refusing to pay taxes or provide recruits for the army. According to historian Orlando Figes, the Vyborg Manifesto was \\"a typical example of the Kadets' militant posturing\\" since Duma's opening.Figes, p. 221 The Manifesto was written by Pavel Milyukov, and signed by 120 Kadet and 80 Trudovik and Social Democrat deputies, alongside some other political representatives like Social Revolutionaries and Muslims. =Aftermath= Gathering during the trial of politicians involved in the Vyborg Manifesto. All except two were sentenced to three months in prison. The Manifesto was met with near universal indifference from the people. This allowed the government employ repressive methods to silence its most outspoken \\"brave, but naive\\" liberal critics. Over 100 leading members of the Kadet Party were brought to trial, and subsequently suspended from the Duma due to their participation in the manifesto. They were replaced in the second and third Duma by less radical and less talented politicians than those who had been suspended. These politicians also went along a more conservative line, staying within the Tsar's laws, in defence of the parliament, as the party now were living in the \\"shadow of the \\"Vyborg complex\\"\\". The entire Kadet leadership was one of the groups targeted by being banned from participation in future Dumas. As a result of the events surrounding the Manifesto, the Kadet Party lost all trust in the people's support, and would no longer claim to represent them either. Instead they consciously became what they de facto had been all along: the \\"natural party\\" of the bourgeois. The liberals' failure to rally the masses in defence of the Duma in practice left them \\"high and dry\\", only clinging on to a hope of persuading the Tsarist regime to liberalise itself, and with an even bigger fear of 'the masses'.Figes, p. 276‚Äì277 Despite the change towards conservatism, the government, remained suspicious of the Kadets until the fall of the monarchy in 1917.

Training He was a self-taught artist, born in a farming family and raised among the hills behind Leonardo da Vinci's land. Martini was discovered by the artist Ardengo Soffici in 1926, when he went to visit Soffici's workshop in Poggio a Caiano, close to Seano, where the latter retired to paint the nature and traditional Tuscan farmers' world. Looking at the young Martini's first experiments, the maestro Soffici recognised the kind of genuine and intimate traits he valued in traditional Italian art. Quinto Martini was then taught drawing and art techniques, and exposed to art and literature with Soffici as his patron and mentor. In Soffici's library, Quinto Martini studied the French Impressionists and other modern artists: C√©zanne, Degas, Picasso and the cubists, as well as Italian artists such as Giorgio Morandi, Armando Spadini, and the futurists. In Prato, the closest city to his hometown, Quinto Martini joined a group of workers, intellectuals, and artists spontaneously formed in 1925. Among those artists were Oscar Gallo, Leonetto Tintori, Gino Brogi, and Arrigo Del Rigo. Almost all of them studied at the \\"Leonardo\\" Art School of Prato, and were inspired by Ardengo Soffici and by the movement \\"Il Selvaggio\\". In February 1927, still under the aegis of Soffici, Martini was invited to participate in the collective exhibition il Selvaggio, together with Mino Maccari, Carlo Carr√†, Ottone Rosai, Giorgio Morandi, Achille Lega, Pio Semenghini, Nicola Galante and Evaristo Boncinelli. He later published in the same review il Selvaggio etchings and drawings, entering the Florence artists' and intellectuals' world. Between 1928 and 1929 Quinto Martini went to Turin for military service, where he moved in bohemian caf√©s and cultural circles enlivened by a Parisian avant-garde atmosphere. There Martini met Felice Casorati, Cesare Pavese and \\"The Six Painters\\" group, who were typical interpreters of an anti-fascist and communist-oriented culture inspired by the French C√©zanne and Manet. In Turin the young artist encountered the intellectual Carlo Levi who would be, together with Soffici, one of the fundamental interlocutors of his life. After a period of military service in Turin, in the early 1930s he started working on the \\"Mendicanti\\" series which he investigated again and again throughout his whole life production. Martini's mendicants are painted in a realistic manner, where their poverty is described through poverty of tools, and the figures are symbolically lengthened and bent to the earth. The sculptures of Quinto Martini were also inspired by the Etruscan style, which was deeply rooted in his area where there are important Etruscan archeological sites. In 1935 Martini relocated from the Tuscan countryside to Florence, where he died in 1990. Quinto Martini as sculptor and mature artist Across the 1930s and '40s, the artist's attention shifted progressively to sculpture. He used simple and \\"poor\\" terracotta, a material typical of his rural environment which was already common in the Seano area when the Etruscans settled and expressed their culture millenniums before. Terracotta was like the mud from which Martini had moulded animal figures as a child, playing in the farm yard. One terracotta sculpture was \\"la ragazza seanese\\", which was unveiled at the XIX Biennale di Venezia in 1934. From that moment on, Quinto Martini gained the appreciation of the critics and the public. From 1935 onward, Quinto Martini was present in all editions of the Quadriennale di Roma until the 1972‚Äì73 edition. At the 1939 edition, an entire salon was dedicated to his sculptures alone. In the same year, the artist published some of his etchings in the review Frontespizio which was gathering together the most relevant contemporary artists from Ottone Rosai to Giorgio Morandi, from Giacomo Manz√π to Fiorenzo Tomea, and also important writers like Mario Luzi and Carlo Bo. Quinto Martini participated in the XXth Biennale di Venezia edition, where his work was appreciated by the important Italian critic Giuseppe Marchiori. The review Domus published an interview with him, and he was the protagonist of some exhibitions in Florence, Milan, and Rome at the \\"Quadriennale d'arte nazionale\\". In the same years, the artist will continue publishing drawings and etchings in the cultural reviews il Selvaggio, Frontespizio of the writer and politician Piero Bargellini, and in the art and literature review l'Orto from Bologna. The \\"Mendicanti\\" series, some of which were displayed at the \\"Lyceum\\" in Florence in 1943, were considered to be against the regime warlike propaganda. Quinto Martini was jailed shortly after the exhibition, together with Carlo Levi, in the same prison where his brother had been kept for almost fifteen years. Once released, the artist went into hiding in the Chianti countryside to avoid being captured by the Nazis. In that period he wrote the novel I giorni sono lunghi (The Days Are Long) to render that experience memorable, which was published in 1957 with a preface from Levi himself. Intimate reflections expressed in verses, opened Martini's road to poetry. Across the '50s and '60s, Quinto Martini published some tales and poems for the \\"Nuovo Corriere\\" of Firenze, while many more remain still unpublished. In 1974, his second novel Chi ha paura va alla guerra is printed in Catanzaro for the Frama's Publisher edited by Pasquino Crupi, where Quinto Martini tells the story of a deserter during the First World War. With clear inspiration and sound form of expression, the artist animated the \\"Nuovo Umanesimo\\" art group with Ugo Capocchini, Emanuele Cavalli, Giovanni Colacicchi, Oscar Gallo, and Onofrio Martinelli in 1947. Their \\"manifesto\\" announced their opposition to any concept of abstract art. Late in the 1940s Martini's sculptures won some first prizes at the national level, and early in the 1950s they started to be exposed abroad. Quinto Martini's paintings turned into a mature revision of Ardengo Soffici's style, and experimentation of some of the 20th-century artistic currents including cubism and futurism. Quinto Martini paid particular attention to \\"Portraits\\" and to \\"the Rain\\" theme. The artist exercised portraiture since his first sculpture experiences, portraying relatives, friends, and peasants of his homeland. Many portraits were made in terracotta, plaster cast, bronze of his mother, Ardengo Soffici, his wife Maria Ferri, often shown at important exhibitions. \\"Portraits\\" of artists, scholars, intellectuals, were made by Quinto Martini from the end of the Second World War until his death, in a sort of continuous dialogue with them that lasted for decades and at times with repeated portraits across the years. In 1992, two years after the artist's death, 30 of these \\"Portraits\\" were exposed in an exhibition hosted at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, to realize a project that the artist imagined in 1984. The disastrous inundation of Florence of 1966 intensified the inspiration of Quinto Martini for \\"the Rain\\" theme, expressed through drawings and bas-reliefs, but also through operas in bronze. The poets and intellectuals Mario Luzi, Renzo Federici, Tommaso Paloscia, Carlo Levi, many of whom were subjects of the \\"Portraits\\" themselves, wrote about these operas hosted again in Palazzo Strozzi in 1978. He was a professor of sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence from 1961 across the 1960s and 1970s. During the same years, the artist continued in his experimentation, developing the \\"Rain\\" theme and participating in exhibitions at the national and international level like the International Small Bronze Competition. Some of his small bronzes were exhibited at the \\"Contemporary Italian Sculptors\\" exhibition in 1970, which went on world tour (Florence, Budapest, Milan, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Tokyo, Osaka, Hakone, Strasbourg, and locations in the Netherlands}. Quinto Martini lectured in many conferences and symposia, and wrote a number of essays on the sculpture of Donatello, Michelangelo, Rodin, and others. Personal and anthologizing exhibitions have been widely shown in the 1970s and '80s. Some of his most notable works were inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy, and he himself has been described as \\"an important fixture in the cultural and artistic life of 20th-century Florence.\\"The Florentine, op cit, p. 5. The artist dedicated to Dante's masterpiece a complete set of lithographs which toured in Rome, at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, and also in Warsaw and five different cities in the former U.S.S.R. Three books were published on this series of Martini. Places named for him The Parco museo Quinto Martini was dedicated to the artist by his authorities and his countrymen in Seano in 1988, while Martini was still alive, and displays 36 of his bronzes which were made throughout his all artistic life, placed in an open air setting.

Hosted by the 2nd Bomb Wing, it maintains a large collection of military aircraft and historical artifacts that illuminate the early days of United States military aviation, the Barksdale base, and the formations of the 2nd Bomb Wing and the 8th Air Force. The museum aims to preserve the heritage and traditions of the Air Force, particularly those of the 2nd Bomb Wing and other bomber units; to stimulate esprit de corps among Air Force personnel; to educate the public about the Air Force; and to ensure proper stewardship of its aircraft, artifacts, and art.  History  The museum opened in 1979 through the efforts of Buck Rigg, who became the volunteer curator. Work was started to return a B-17 on permanent loan from the United States Air Force Museum to flight. This was followed by restoration of a B-24. In 1980, two airmen rabbit hunting found the remains of a Keystone B-6A bomber in the woods near the airbase. The wreckage was added to the museum's collection. In 1982, an Avro Vulcan was donated to the museum and later that year plans for recreating a World War II 8th Air Force base were announced. By 1985, the museum had also acquired a B-52, KC-97, C-47, and F-84. A B-29 was added in 1992. However, an inspection by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in 2008 revealed that collections management procedures were insufficient and the museum was threatened with closure. A rebranding effort led to the museum changing its name in 2012 to become the Barksdale Global Power Museum, to reflect an expanded mission and avoid confusion with the Mighty Eighth Air Force Museum in Savannah, Georgia. The museum completed a three year long renovation in 2015, during which all the rooms were rebuilt and many of the airplanes repainted.

Name The street was originally called Queene Street in medieval times before becoming known as Knyfesmyth Street, after the tradesmen there. The Middle English pronunciation of Knyfesmyth, with the K sounded, may be the origin of the street's modern name. An alternative theory is based on the nativity scene found in a stained glass window of The Chapel of the Three Kings of Cologne, which stands at the top of the steps. In the 17th century, the Christmas Steps is also believed to have been called Lonsford's Stairs for a short period, in honour of a Cavalier officer who was killed at the top of the steps during the siege of Bristol in the English Civil War. After the main set of steps the steps continue on the other side of Colston Street and then again across Perry Lane, leading to St Michael's Church these steps were originally unbroken by road and known as St. Michael's steps. History The steep-slanted steps were constructed in September 1669 and were paid for by wealthy wine merchant, Jonathan Blackwell. Prior to this there had been a steep, muddy and narrow street leading from the bridge over the Frome outside the city walls near the old St Bartholomew's Hospital, towards St Michael's church.

The highway begins in the community of Manchester, where Highway 7 is concurrent with Highway 12, and travels east through Port Perry, Nestleton Station, Bethany and Cavan, ending at Highway 115 southwest of Peterborough. From there, Highway 7 can be reached via Highway 115 northbound. Near its midpoint the route is concurrent with Highway 35 for . Highway 7A is long, passing through the Regional Municipality of Durham, city of Kawartha Lakes and Peterborough County. Outside of the communities it serves, the highway passes through generally agricultural areas, though it enters the Oak Ridges Moraine near Highway 35\\\\. The highway was designated in the 1930s in downtown Peterborough and shortly thereafter was extended west to Manchester. The causeways over Lake Scugog date back to the 1850s, and were repeatedly reinforced over the course of a century to reach their current state. During the 1950s, the construction of Highway 115 caused the route of Highway 7A to be modified. At the end of the decade, the causeways were reconstructed for the final time. The eastern end of the highway was reconfigured several times before arriving at its current routing after the 1960s.  Route description  Highway 7A facing west from its eastern terminus at Highway 115 Highway 7A is a highway which serves as an alternative route to Highway 7, bypassing Lindsay and providing a shorter and more direct southern route between Whitby and Peterborough. It begins in the community of Manchester at an intersection with Highway 7 and Highway 12\\\\. West of this intersection, the road continues as Durham Regional Road 21 towards Stouffville. The highway travels northeast into the town of Port Perry, where it curves east and becomes Scugog Street. Passing through the town, the highway serves as a commercial strip, centring on Simcoe Street. In the east end of the town, the highway passes several big- box retailers before crossing the western arm of Lake Scugog on the Scugog Causeway. On Scugog Island now, the highway first passes Island Road (Durham Regional Road 7), which leads to Great Blue Heron Casino and the Mississaugas of Scugog Island reserve, then curves southeast and enters the Osler Marsh. It once continued east along what is now Reader Road and curved southeast at the end of that road. The modern route, constructed when the causeways were reinforced in the 1960s, lies south of the original route. The route continues southeast across the Cartwright Causeway, separating the eastern arm of Lake Scugog from the marsh. After approximately a kilometre (0.6 miles), the highway curves east and continues for to the end of the causeway. For the next , the highway travels straight to the east past farmland, then curves north near Blackstock. It intersects Durham Regional Road 57, which travels south to Bowmanville. The two routes travels north concurrently with for before Road 57 departs north towards Caesarea as Highway 7A gently curves east and passes through the former railway village of Nestleton Station. A reverse curve east of Port Perry. The Osler Marsh, a southern extension of Lake Scugog, is visible in the distance. Returning to farmland, the highway enters the northern tip of the Oak Ridges Moraine and the terrain begins to undulate near the border between Durham Region and Kawartha Lakes. Eventually, the farmland transitions into forests and the highway dives into and out of glacial ravines; these form the headwaters of the Pigeon River. The route intersects Highway 35 approximately east of Nesleton Station; both highways travel south concurrently for before Highway 7A branches east and Highway 35 continues south to Orono and Newcastle. A carpool parking lot is also available at this junction. Highway 7A continues east through a valley-ridden region containing a mix of thick deciduous forests and farmland. Shortly after passing the northern terminus of City Road 32 (Porter Road), the highway enters the village of Bethany, where it crosses the Victoria Rail Trail and intersects the southern terminus of City Road 38 (Ski Hill Road) before curving southeast and entering Peterborough County. The highway curves back to the east and passes through a final ravine. It crosses through farmland before entering the community of Cavan, where it meets County Road 10. Approximately east of Cavan, Highway 7A ends at an interchange with Highway 115, which itself intersects and becomes concurrent with Highway 7 approximately northeast of this point, thereafter continuing into Peterborough.  History  Highway 7A in Bethany The history of Highway 7A is largely connected to that of Lake Scugog, and has played an important role for over a century, although the highway was not designated until the 1930s. Joseph Bigelow, a businessman and later the Reeve of Port Perry and James Graham, Reeve of Scugog, played a significant role in the construction of two causeways across the lake - the Scugog and the Cartwright Causeways. These were gradually reinforced over the span of a century (1856‚Äì1960) before reaching their present state, and now carry Highway 7A. = Development = Lake Scugog was created when William Purdy and his sons dammed the Scugog River in Lindsay (Upstream from the current dam and locks) in 1834 to power his grist mill. With the raised water levels, the highlands of Scugog Township became an island, separated from Cartwright Township to the southeast, and from Port Perry and Reach Township to the west. As a result, residents were forced to ferry across the lake during the summer and across the ice during the winter. The periods between were precarious, with many carts falling through the thawing ice and into the marsh. In 1852, Ontario County was formed, and residents began to petition the new government for construction of a bridge from Port Perry across to the island. Scugog Township passed Bylaw No. 2 on February 25, 1856, which granted $1000 towards construction of a floating bridge. The bridge proved to be an expensive burden, and for many years the responsibility for maintaining it was repeatedly shifted from township to county and back again. Ice would often carry away entire sections of the bridge during the spring thaw, requiring replanking or complete reconstruction. In the spring of 1876, work began to convert the first of the Port Perry side of the floating bridge into a permanent embankment. Logs were placed along both sides the bridge and various materials piled between them, sinking it into the soft soil below. Earth laid over top to provide a stable surface. The process also increased the width of the roadbed from to . The floating bridge, shortly after completion in the 1850s Further construction on the Scugog Causeway met fierce opposition from county officials, who argued that the new method had not even faced a winter season. It took until July 1878 for work to resume, when Port Perry Reeve Joshua Wright managed to manipulate the county council, convincing them \\"to strike out the magnificent $150 [grant for seasonal maintenance which they had offered] and stipulate that 600 feet be filled in on the east end of the bridge.\\" A contract for this work was tendered in June 1879, and completed one year later. Finally, in early 1885, work on the final 180 metres began. This work was completed in July, at which point repairs were carried out on the existing sections. Construction of the Cartwright Causeway took place after nearly two decades of effort by its chief promoter, Joseph Bigelow. Bigelow witnessed the business opportunity that the Scugog Bridge opened up, and wished to construct a second structure towards Blackstock, opening the Port Perry markets to the fertile agricultural land of Cartwright Township. He first approached the Ontario County council in 1872 with his proposal, but was refused the funding. The council agreed to set up a committee, through which Bigelow sought out investors. In 1882, the Lake Scugog Marsh Lands Drainage Company, which had purchased the marshlands south of the proposed causeway, approached Bigelow with an offer to build his causeway as part of their plans to drain the marsh. They required a small investment in order to proceed with the work, but council ultimately refused even this, forcing the company to sell off its lands. Undeterred, Bigelow continued to accrue funds from other level of government and surrounding townships. By 1889, he had enough to begin work. Unlike the Scugog Bridge, Bigelow ensured that his structure would be permanent from the beginning and constructed a majority of the causeway by removing the top layer of peat from the marsh, piling logs in lengthwise approximately a metre deep and covering the exposed surface with the same depth of earth. By early 1891, the causeway was completed, and shortly thereafter trees were planted along both sides. The combined route quickly grew to be the main east-west transportation corridor in the area. However, due to the soft soils and clay on which the causeway was built, it sank at a continuous rate and still required maintenance to keep it above water during the spring thaw. In 1928, both causeways were reinforced, widened and heightened in response to growing automobile usage. = King's Highway = Reconstruction of the Cartwright Causeway in late 1960 By 1934, the Department of Highways assumed Lansdowne Street in Peterborough as Highway 7A, providing an alternate route south of downtown. At that point in time, Highway 7 entered Peterborough by following Lindsay Street east from Fowlers Corners to Chemong Road and curving southeast. It followed Chemong Road to Reid Street, which it then followed south. The route proceeded west along McDonnel Street and south along George Street to Lansdowne Street, which it followed east out of Peterborough. Highway 28 entered Peterborough from the west along Lansdowne Street, curving north at what is now Ford Street. It followed this onto what is now Clonsilla Avenue, and curved east onto Charlotte Street, which it followed to George Street. Highway 7A thus provided a direct route between Highway 28 and Highway 7 south of Peterborough. In May 1938, Highway 7A was extended west to Highway 7 and Highway 12 at Manchester via Bethany and Port Perry. This created a concurrency with Highway 28 and brought the length of the highway to . The new extension was a gravel road between Port Perry and Highway 28, but the section between Port Perry and Blackstock was paved by October 1939. In late 1954, Highway 115 was opened between Highway 35 at Enterprise Hill and Highway 28 south of Springville. As a result, Highway 7A was rerouted concurrently along a short section of the new highway. Several highways were rerouted in 1960, including Highway 7, which was redirected at Fowlers Corners to curve south and meet Highway 28 near Springville; the former route became Highway 7B. During the spring of 2003, Highway 7A was truncated at Highway 115 near Cavan, taking on its current routing. During the late 1950s, spring flooding began to become problematic on both causeways, prompting the Department of Highways to reconstruct them and the approaches. Soil investigations were carried out over the length of the road in mid-1959, and in August 1960 contracts were tendered for construction. The existing causeways were both closed as the adjacent marsh was excavated up to deep. Nearby properties were purchased for the sole purpose of excavating for earth for fill, which was trucked at a continuous rate. Over of organic material was removed from the marsh and of fill placed over several years of construction. As a result of this, the roadbed no longer sinks into the marsh and spring melt no longer poses an issue.

Harrill (February 2, 1893 ‚Äì June 4, 1972) was an American man also known as the Fort Fisher Hermit. He became a hermit in 1955, at the age of 62, having hitchhiked to Fort Fisher on the North Carolina coast from Morganton, North Carolina. He had previously been committed to a mental hospital in Morganton, after his marriage failed. Harrill settled in an abandoned World War II bunker set in a salt marsh beside the Cape Fear River in the Fort Fisher State Recreation Area. Harrill fed himself by fishing and scavenging. He became a tourist attraction and visitors would come to hear about his \\"School of Common Sense\\", leaving donations in a frying pan. After living as a hermit for 17 years, he died under mysterious circumstances in 1972, with the official cause of death given as a heart attack. His life has been commemorated in book, film and theatre.  Early life  Robert E. Harrill was born in Shelby, North Carolina on 2 February, 1893. He was educated at Boiling Springs High School and then Gardner-Webb Jr. College. His parents were abusive and he spent a lot of his time in the local woods. He married Katie Hamrick in 1913 and they had five children. The eldest son committed suicide and the family later fell apart in the 1930s due in part to Harrill's mental health problems.  Hermit  The hermit's bunker in October 2007 The name \\"Fort Fisher Hermit\\" came from Fort Fisher and the Fort Fisher State Recreation Area, where Harrill settled. He arrived in 1955, having left a mental institution in Morganton and then hitchhiking to the coast. At first Harrill lived in a tent near to the Confederate monument by the fort. He then squatted in an abandoned World War II era bunker set in a salt marsh beside the Cape Fear River. He collected driftwood to furnish his humble house and was able to gather much of the food that he needed from the marsh. He ate fish, clams and oysters, and planted a vegetable garden to supplement his diet. Harrill learned many of his survival skills from Empie Hewett, a true hermit, who also lived in the salt marshes of the Fort Fisher area. Harrill loved to talk to visitors (who left donations in a frying pan) and his guestbook recorded thousands of entries.  Attraction  Robert Harrill became the second largest tourist attraction in the state of North Carolina, trailing only the USS North Carolina in terms of numbers of visitors. Visitors to Carolina Beach would routinely take time to visit the hermit, and he would talk about his philosophy, which he termed the \\"School of Common Sense\\". He told people who came to see him that he was writing a book entitled A Tyrant in Every Home. Alongside the curious, Harrill met drunk youths and developers who wanted to evict him; two men even kidnapped and robbed him. Once, after falling asleep on the beach, Harrill was arrested and charged with vagrancy, defending himself in court. Harrill also attracted a large number of journalists to his bunker interested to write about his lifestyle and beliefs. He explained his popularity in 1968:  Death  Harrill's grave is located at the Federal Point Cemetery. The headstone states \\"He made people think\\". After living as a hermit for 17 years, Harrill died under mysterious circumstances on June 4, 1972. The New Hanover County coroner pronounced the cause of death as a heart attack, yet local rumours suggested Harrill may have been killed after a violent attack by a group of three men, a fisherman alleging that he saw them speeding away in a car. However, there was no autopsy and the case was closed as a natural death. Harrill was first buried in a cemetery off River Road near Fort Fisher, and then later moved to the Federal Point Cemetery at Dow Road, Carolina Beach.  Memorial and legacy  A documentary film directed by Rob Hill and narrated by Barry Corbin was released in 2007. It was called The Fort Fisher Hermit: The Life and Death of Robert E. Harrill. Hill filmed 35 hours' worth of material and interviewed 16 people who knew Harrill. Fred Pickler knew Harrill and with Anne Russell co- authored the book Life and Times of the Fort Fisher Hermit, Through the Lens of Fred Pickler. A local theatre company producedThe Hermit of Fort Fisher, written by David Wright. It premiered in July 2014 at the Cape Fear Playhouse and had a sold-out run. Michael Edwards is president of the Hermit Society and wrote The Battle for Independence: The Story of the Fort Fisher Hermit. The bunker where Harrill lived is still standing and can be reached by following the Basin Trail at the Fort Fisher State Recreation Area. A plaque on the bunker commemorates his occupation.

It was founded in 1583 in a narrow valley close to the village of Lusar in the historical Tibetan region of Amdo. Its superior monastery is Drepung Monastery, immediately to the west of Lhasa. It is ranked in importance as second only to Lhasa. Description Alexandra David-N√©el, the famous Belgian-French explorer who spent more than two years studying and translating Tibetan books at the monastery, said of it: =Origins: The Tree of Great Merit= Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, was born in nearby Tsongkha in 1357. According to one tradition, Tsongkhapa's father took the afterbirth and buried it where the monastery is now and soon a sandalwood tree grew on the spot. Another version has it that the tree grew up where drops of blood from Tsongkhapa's umbilical cord had fallen on the ground. In any case this tree became known as the \\"Tree of Great Merit.\\" The leaves and the bark of this tree were reputed to bear impressions of the Buddha's face and various mystic syllables and its blossoms were said to give off a peculiarly pleasing scent. The four-storied golden-roofed temple built around the tree where Tsongkhapa is said to have been born is called \\"Golden Tree\\" (, metaphorically \\"wish-fulfilling tree\\") and is considered the holiest place at Kumbum. This is the origin of its Chinese name, Little Tower Temple. Gombojab Tsybikov took this photo in 1900 of Kumbum Monastery, Amdo, Tibet Two Catholic missionaries, √âvariste R√©gis Huc and Joseph Gabet who arrived here in the 1840s when the tree was still living were fully prepared to dismiss \\"The Tree of Great Merit\\" as just another fanciful legend.Section of this tree are now preserved in a stupa in the Great Golden Temple. History =Foundation= Kumbum Monastery In the 1360s Tsongkhapa's mother, with the help of locals, had a small temple with a stupa built on the site of his birthplace. In 1560 the meditator Ts√∂ndr√º Gyeltsen () built a small monastery there called Gonpalung for intensive meditation practice. At first, it had seven monks at a time, but soon expanded to hold fifteen. In 1576, Altan Khan (1507‚Äì1583) of the T√ºmed Mongols invited the future 3rd Dalai Lama, S√∂nam Gyatso (1543‚Äì1588) to bring Buddhism to Mongolia. After Altan Khan adopted Buddhism, he gave S√∂nam Gyatso the title Dalai Lama: Dalai is the Mongolian translation of the name Gyatso \\"ocean.\\" On his way to meet Altan Khan near Qinghai Lake, the 3rd Dalai Lama stopped at the isolated retreat by the holy tree marking the spot where Tsongkhapa had been born. He requested Ts√∂ndr√º Gyeltsen to construct a larger monastery at this site and appointed him as the head lama. The monastery was built completely in 1583 and a fence was erected around the \\"Tree of Great Merit\\". An annual Monlam Prayer Festival () was inaugurated, like the one held in Lhasa. The new monastery was called Kumbum Jampa Ling. \\"Kumbum\\" means \\"100,000 enlightening bodies of the Buddha\\". It is named after the 100,000 images of Si·πÉhanƒÅda which appear on the leaves of the holy sandalwood tree. \\"Jampa ling\\" means \\"Maitreya Cloister.\\" This refers to the Maitreya temple built by Ts√∂ndr√º Gyeltsen to the right of the precious tree. The first Throne Holder of Kumbum was D√ºldzin √ñzer Gyatso (, born 1557). In 1603, the 4th Dalai Lama (1589‚Äì1616) stopped at Kumbum on his way from his native Mongolia to √ú-Tsang. At that time, he proclaimed the need for a study division to be built and for D√ºldzin √ñzer Gyatso to be appointed as the head of the entire monastery. At Kumbum's Monlam of 1612, D√ºldzin √ñzer Gyatso first ascended to the throne of abbot and opened a debate college (). By the middle of the 20th century, Kumbum Monastery included thirty temples and a thousand or so houses. The Hui General Ma Bufang patronized the Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama and the Nyingma against the Dalai Lama. Qinghai served as a \\"sanctuary\\" for Nyingma members. Ma Bufang allowed Kumbum Monastery to be totally self-governed by the Panchen Lama. =Monastic colleges= Statue of Je Tsongkhapa at Kumbum Monastery Kumbum has four monastic colleges or faculties (dratsang). The largest is the Debate College or Faculty for Logic, the Shadupling Dratsang. Most of its divisions use the textbooks of Jetsunpa Chokyi-gyeltsen (1469‚Äì1544), as at Ganden Jangtsey and Sera Jey Colleges near Lhasa. A few of the divisions follow the textbooks of Kunkyen Jamyang-zhaypa Ngawang-tsondru (1648‚Äì1722), as at Gomang College of Drepung Monastery and Labrang Monastery. The highest degrees of Geshe Rabjampa and Geshe Shayrampa are awarded at the Kumbum Monlam Prayer Festival each year. Gy√ºpa Dratsang, the Tantric College, or Sangngag Dechenling Datsang was founded by Chojey Legpa-gyatso in 1649. The curriculum follows that of Gyumay Lower Tantric College of Lhasa. After study of the major texts and commentaries of the GuhyasamƒÅja tantra, Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra () and Vajrabhairava tantra, monks receive the geshe ngagrampa degree. In 1711, Chuzang Lozang-tenpay-gyeltsen built a new Tantric College, Ngagpa Dratsang. In 1723, the Qing armies severely damaged the four great monasteries of the Qinghai region ‚Äì Kumbum, Gonlung, Serkog and Chuzang and many monks fled. Soon afterwards, the Qing commander asked the 21st Throne Holder to convert the new Ngagpa Dratsang into a Medical College, and this was done. With the appointment of several famous doctors, the Medical College, Menpa Dratsang Sorig-dargyey-zhenpen-norbuling was opened in 1725. It became a separate college during the time of the 22nd Throne Holder. The doctors who are graduated receive the Menrampa degree. The fourth college at Kumbum is the Kalachakra College, D√ºkhor Dratsang or Dukor Dratsang Rigden Losel ling. It was founded in 1820 by Ngawang Shedrub Tenp√© Nyima. Monks at this college also study astrology and receive the tsirampa degree upon completion of their education. Current situation Bhik·π£us at Kumbum Monastery Before 1958, Kumbum had 3600 monks. At present, there are 400, as the monastery was affected by Chinese Communist policies since the late 1950s. Of these, 300 are at the Debate College and the rest are distributed evenly among the other three colleges. Traditionally, the majority of the Kumbum monks have been Tibetans from Amdo, as at Labrang Monastery. The remainder have been Khalkha Mongols from Mongolia () or Inner Mongolia (), Upper Mongols () from Amdo east of Kumbum or Yugurs () from Gansu. Kumbum is still a major pilgrimage for Vajrayana believers and scholars, visited by many thousands of people a year. The Arjia tulkus are traditionally given the position of abbot of Kumbum. The 8th Arjia Rinpoche defected to the United States in 1998. He is currently developing an exile campus of Kumbum Monastery in Bloomington, Indiana, known as Kumbum Chamtse Ling or Kumbum West. The Kumbum monastery is still very much a repository of Tibetan culture and art, including various sculptures, statues and religious artifacts. It certainly is a repository of the Western respect for Tibet, as so many wayfarers from the West apart from David-N√©el (Paul Pelliot, Ella Maillart, Peter Fleming, Evariste Huc, Andr√© Migot) have spent time there.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of f√∂delsehemort (\\"domicile of birth\\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\\"Newborn children are registered as born in the parish where the mother was registered at the time of delivery.\\" Tables on the population of Sweden 2006, page 430 The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept. In some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's \\"country of birth\\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \\"place of birth\\" or \\"nationality at birth\\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

He is a former American football running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and Buffalo Bills. He also was a member of the Calgary Stampeders and Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football at Nicholls State University. Early years Vital attended Loreauville High School, where he practiced football and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from NCAA Division I-AA Nicholls State University. As a freshman, he was used sparingly as a kickoff returner. As a sophomore, he was a backup at running back. As a junior in 1983, starter Oscar Smith (second rusher in school history) missed the semester due to an academic suspension, putting Vital in a position to replace him as the starter and set a single- season record with 776 rushing yards. As a senior, Smith regained his starting position and Vital went back to a backup role. He finished his college career with 1,518 rushing yards and 9 touchdowns. In 2017, he was inducted into the Nicholls State Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career Vital was selected by the Washington Redskins in the seventh round (185th overall) of the 1985 NFL Draft. He was also selected by the Arizona Outlaws in the 13th round (187th overall) of the 1985 USFL Draft. He was placed on the injured reserve list with a hamstring tear before the start of the season. He was waived on August 19, 1986. On August 21, 1986, he was claimed off waivers by the New York Giants. He was released when running back Joe Morris ended his contract holdout on August 26. In September 1986, he was signed as a free agent by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. On October 8, after bouncing between the practice and the active roster, he terminated his practice agreement to play outfield for the Chicago White Sox Instructional League squad. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Vital was signed to be a part of the Redskins replacement team, that was given the mock name \\"Redscabs\\" by the media. He was released after the NFL strike ended. He led the replacement games with 346 rushing yards. The rushing yards he registered in the three games, would be the NFL record for most rushing yards per game in a career (115.3) if he had played enough contests. After the strike was over, he was declared inactive from week 7 to week 9. He was cut on November 3. On December 9, 1987, he was signed as a free agent by the Buffalo Bills. He was declared inactive for the last 3 games of the season. He was released off the injured reserve list on September 19, 1988.

Short Bull later recalled that they agreed they would go in to the Red Cloud Agency, located in northwestern Nebraska. The Sorebacks soon joined a village of Northern Cheyenne on the Powder River. While Short Bull was absent from the village on a raiding party, the village was attacked by General George Crook's troops, under the direct command of Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds. Short Bull returned in time to help recapture part of the village's horse herd. \\"This attack was the turning point of the situation,\\" Short Bull explained. \\"If it had not been for that attack by Crook on Powder River, we would have come in to the agency that spring, and there would have been no Sioux war.\\"Short Bull Interview.

Short Bull's Family Short Bull married Good Hawk about 1875. During the early reservation period, she became known as Matilda or Nellie Short Bull; he became known as Grant Short Bull. They had two grown children: Charlie Short Bull, born in 1884, and Katie, born about 1893-95. She later married Arthur Blue Horse Owner. Final years Short Bull lived the remainder of his life on the Pine Ridge Reservation where he and his wife received an allotment. He and his wife were remarried in the Presbyterian Church Dec. 28, 1911. Matilda died on May 20, 1925. Grant made regular visits to the Agate Ranch in northwestern Nebraska, home of the frontiersman James Cook.Short Bull correspondence, Cook Papers, Agate Fossil Beds National Monument. Short Bull was among the elder Oglala who attended the dedication of the Crazy Horse marker at Fort Robinson in 1934.Nebraska History, vol. 22 no. 1 (1941) p. 74. Tragically, Grant Short Bull and his son Charlie were killed in an automobile accident north of Oglala, South Dakota, on August 20, 1935. The family was en route to a memorial dinner for Henry Young Skunk. With that single tragedy, much of the family oral history was lost.

It originated with the 1979 book, The Animals of Farthing Wood, by Colin Dann, and was followed by six sequels and a prequel by Dann. An animated Animals of Farthing Wood television series based on the books aired in the 1990s, created by the European Broadcasting Union. The books tell the story of a group of woodland animals whose home has been paved over by developers. They learn of a nature reserve, White Deer Park, where they will be safe, and undertake to make the journey together. They form an Oath, promising to protect one another and overcome their natural instincts until they reach their destination.  Publication history  The Animals of Farthing Wood, the first book in the series, was first published by John Goodchild Publishers in the United Kingdom in the first half of 1979 as two separate paperbacks. The first was known as Escape from Danger and the second was known as The Way to White Deer. After this one instance, they have been released as one novel. The original book was meant to be a stand-alone book, with the animals reaching White Deer Park at the end. The success of the book led to a further six novels detailing the adventures of the animals once they reached White Deer Park, and a prequel showing how Farthing Wood came to be destroyed. The cover illustrations for this original series were painted by Portal artist Frances Broomfield. Dann revealed in an interview with the \\"Green Action\\" radio program on Q96 that the two-book version was special-issue for a children's book club that operated through British primary schools and included some illustrations left out of the original. In the Grip of Winter was published in 1981, Fox's Feud was published in 1982, and The Fox Cub Bold was published in 1983. An omnibus edition of all three books was published in 1994 by Hutchinson. The Siege of White Deer Park was first published in 1985, In the Path of the Storm was first published in 1989, and Battle for the Park was first published in 1992. Those three books were made into a second omnibus in 1995 by Hutchinson. In 1994, the last book in the series, Farthing Wood: The Adventure Begins, was released.

It is raised mainly within Bashkortostan, a republic within the Russian Federation which lies in the southern Ural Mountains and westwards. The principal centre of breeding is the capital, Ufa. History The origins of the Bashkir horse are not known. In the nineteenth century its economic value was recognised, and steps were taken to increase both its working abilities and its traditional qualities as a producer of milk and meat. Breeding centres were set up in 1845. The Bashkir horse has been crossed with other breeds of the former USSR such as the Russian Heavy Draught; experimental crosses with Kazakh and Yakut horses have also been made. Bashkortostan has the third-highest horse population of the federal subjects of Russia, after the Altai Krai and the Sakha Republic. In 2003 the population of Bashkir horses was reported as 94,470. Characteristics The Bashkir is a small horse, standing about at the withers. It is wide in the body and deep-chested, with a thoracic circumference (girth) averaging about ; it has a large head and a short neck, low withers and a flat back. The legs are short with heavy bone; cannon bone measurement may reach . The commonest coat colours are bay, chestnut, mouse grey and roan. The mane and tail are thick and the coat is also thick and often curly. A two-year study published in 1990 found it unlikely that the North American Curly Horse, which also has a curly coat and may be called \\"American Bashkir Curly\\", descends from the Bashkir breed. There are two distinct types of Bashkir horse: a smaller, lighter mountain type used mainly for riding, and a somewhat heavier steppe type. The Bashkir horse is remarkably hardy. Herds are managed extensively, and remain in the open in winter in snow and blizzard conditions where temperatures may reach Uses The Bashkir horse is used for riding and for pack, harness, draught and farm work. It shows remarkable endurance; there are reports of Bashkir horses drawing troikas, three-horse sleighs, over distances of per day. Bashkir mares are prolific producers of milk. Average yield per year is 1500 or in a lactation of 240 days, with the best mares reaching . Much of the milk is made into kumis; kumis-making is a national activity of the Bashkiri people. Hair combed from the thick winter coat of the breed can be woven into cloth.

The process can preserve all the information in the frequency band of interest of the original signal. The input and output signals can be real or complex samples. Often the DDC converts from the raw radio frequency or intermediate frequency down to a complex baseband signal.  Architecture  A DDC consists of three subcomponents: a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), a low-pass filter (LPF), and a downsampler (which may be integrated into the low-pass filter). 450px The DDS generates a complex sinusoid at the intermediate frequency (IF). Multiplication of the intermediate frequency with the input signal creates images centered at the sum and difference frequency (which follows from the frequency shifting properties of the Fourier transform). The lowpass filters pass the difference (i.e. baseband) frequency while rejecting the sum frequency image, resulting in a complex baseband representation of the original signal. Assuming judicious choice of IF and LPF bandwidth, the complex baseband signal is mathematically equivalent to the original signal. In its new form, it can readily be downsampled and is more convenient to many DSP algorithms. Any suitable low-pass filter can be used including FIR, IIR and CIC filters. The most common choice is a FIR filter for low amounts of decimation (less than ten) or a CIC filter followed by a FIR filter for larger downsampling ratios.  Variations on the DDC  Several variations on the DDC are useful, including many that input a feedback signal into the DDS. These include: *Decision directed carrier recovery phase locked loops in which the I and Q are compared to the nearest ideal constellation point of a PSK signal, and the resulting error signal is filtered and fed back into the DDS *A Costas loop in which the I and Q are multiplied and low pass filtered as part of a BPSK/QPSK carrier recovery loop  Implementation  DDCs are most commonly implemented in logic in field-programmable gate arrays or application-specific integrated circuits. While software implementations are also possible, operations in the DDS, multipliers and input stages of the lowpass filters all run at the sampling rate of the input data. This data is commonly taken directly from analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) sampling at tens or hundreds of MHz. CORDICs are an alternative to the use of multipliers in the implementation of digital down converters.M. Loehning, T. Hentschel and G.

It is a small horse and is used both as a pack animal and for riding. Breed numbers were severely reduced during the Bosnian War of 1992‚Äì1995, and, unlike populations of other farm animals, continued to fall after the end of the war. History At the Borike state stud Selective breeding of the Bosnian Mountain Horse began at the stud of Gora≈æde in 1908. The principal centres for the selection of the breed were the stud farms of Borike, in the municipality of Rogatica, and Han Pijesak. Three stallion lines ‚Äì Agan, Barut and Mi≈°ko ‚Äì and nine mare lines were established; the Agan line is lost, and the Barut and Mi≈°ko lines heavily mixed. Arab stallions at the Borike stud were used to improve the Bosnian Mountain Horse. The Glasinacki type has substantial Arab influence; it is named after the village of on the Romanija mountain, in the eastern part of the Republika Srpska. A smaller type, the Podvele≈°ki, is found in Herzegovina. During the Bosnian War of 1992‚Äì1995 horse populations, like those of other farm animals, suffered heavily. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the total number of horses fell from 46,628 in 1990 to 16,080 in 1995, and by 2002 had fallen further to 7,014, or about 15% of the pre-war number; in the Republika Srpska numbers also fell, though not so steeply. Overall, horse numbers in Bosnia and Herzegovina fell by 68% between 1990 and 2002. The breed has not been substantially affected by importations of foreign horses. It is in some areas the principal, or even the only, means of transportation. References Further reading * Enver ≈Ωiga, Refik Telalba≈°iƒç (2008).

The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to > commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons > guilty of that act. Since this definition is restricted to the high seas, piracy in British territorial waters would today be treated as robbery, assault or attempted murder under the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878, or as hijacking under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990 (which can also be applied to piracy on the high seas).

It delivers training in workplace locations across England. The college is a member of the Collab Group of high-performing further-education institutions. History Derby College of Higher Education split from Derby College of Further Education (FE) during the 1960s. Derby FE was primarily targeted at part-time students from engineering companies such as Rolls-Royce and British Rail. This provision continued through to the 1980s until a major restructuring of industry and the apprenticeship system. The FE colleges then took on different types of students and evolved into new areas. In 1989 Derbyshire County Council was responsible for education, and formed two Tertiary colleges, Wilmorton and Mackworth to serve different parts of the city. =Mackworth Campus= This was opened on the site of the former Parkfields Cedars Grammar School, which moved there in 1969. It became a comprehensive school, then became Mackworth College in 1989. In 1997 there were plans to merge with the University of Derby, but these stalled in 1998. The building has a 1969 glass- tile mural by the artist Alan Boyson, but this is now hidden behind a partition wall. =Wilmorton Campus= The former Wilmorton College in April 2005 This was situated at the current junction of the Wilmorton Link and London Road on the A6. This was some distance from the town centre. =Broomfield Campus= Is situated in the ground of Broomfield Hall. Built in 1873, it was originally the country home of Charles Schwind, and became the Derbyshire Farm Institute. The former students of Broomfield Hall alumni association is called ‚Äì Broomfield Old Students Association (BOSA). =Ilkeston Campus= Is situated in Ilkeston in Derbyshire and began as Ilkeston College of Further Education on 14 September 1953. The official opening ceremony took place on 25 June 1954, the college became South East Derbyshire College of Further Education in 1966. When it opened, in 1974, a site in Heanor on the former Heanor Grammar School was an annex of the main college. Heanor Grammar School closed in 1976, it had around 550 boys and girls. Geoffrey Stone was the headmaster for twenty years and became Principal. In 2010 Derby College in Ilkeston was formed between the merges of three campuses of the college that where situated in Ilkeston and Heanor. The former Field Road and Cavendish Road campus were both auctioned off in 2013 and newly built campus was opened in 2014 on the grounds of the Old Magistrates Court in Ilkeston. In 2015 Derby College scrapped plans to turn the remaining Heanor campus into a new education facility. =Mergers= Derby College was established as a single institution in 2002 by merging three further education colleges: Mackworth Tertiary College, Wilmorton Tertiary College and Broomfield Agricultural College. Since then Wilmorton College has been demolished and turned into a housing estate; and Derby College has built two new purpose built sites; The Joseph Wright Centre (JWC), which specialises in A' levels and in 2010 Derby College reported a 99% success rate for the second year in a row. The Roundhouse redevelopment is the College's flagship site with a focus on vocational qualifications. A merger between South East Derbyshire College and Derby College was approved on 2 February 2010. Curriculum The college offers a wide variety of courses at various levels of education.

Theme song The theme song \\"A View to a Kill\\", was written by John Barry and Duran Duran, and was recorded in London with a 60-piece orchestra. \\"A View to a Kill\\" is the most successful Bond theme to date. In 1986 Barry and Duran Duran were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Duran Duran was chosen to do the song after bassist John Taylor (a lifelong Bond fan) approached producer Cubby Broccoli at a party, and somewhat drunkenly asked \\"When are you going to get someone decent to do one of your theme songs?\\" Malins, Steve. (2005) Notorious: The Unauthorized Biography, Andr√© Deutsch/Carlton Publishing, UK (). pp 161-162Paul Gambaccini Interview with John Taylor, 1985, Greatest DVD extras. The single was released in May 1985, and on July 13 it hit number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, and remains the only Bond theme to do so. On May 25, it made it to number two in the UK Singles Chart, also a record for Bond themes until \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" by Sam Smith made it to number one in 2015. The b-side was an instrumental piece orchestrated by John Barry, titled \\"A View To A Kill (That Fatal Kiss)\\". The song was the last track that the original five members of Duran Duran recorded together until 2001. The video for the single was directed by the duo Godley & Creme, with shots of the band at the Eiffel Tower intercut with scenes from the movie, so that it appears that Roger Moore and Grace Jones are participating in the same storyline. The singer ends the video with a parody of James Bond, introducing himself as \\"Bon. Simon Le Bon.\\" Other music During the opening teaser, a cover version of the 1965 Beach Boys song \\"California Girls\\", performed by Gidea Park (a tribute band), is used during a chase in which Bond snowboards; it has been suggested that this teaser sequence helped initiate interest in snowboarding.Snowboard Club UK FAQs The film features Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, which is performed during the reception that Bond attends undercover at Zorin's stud in France. In the remastered CD edition, the third track is incorrectly labeled \\"May Day Jumpers\\" on the back of the case. Leitmotifs Composer John Barry utilises four leitmotifs on the soundtrack, that recurs in two or more of the tracks listed. One is pinned to the theme songs by Duran Duran, one is pinned to henchwoman May Day, one is pinned to the action set- pieces and one appears more generally throughout the film. Barry often called the secondary themes he composed as \\"action themes\\" that underscored the action on the screen with hints of the film's theme song, the \\"James Bond Theme\\" itself, or simply another theme used only in that particular film. Such themes were occasionally reused, such as his \\"007 Theme\\", originally composed for From Russia with Love but brought back for four subsequent Bond pictures. The action theme composed for this film is easily a memorable as those secondary themes he used in You Only Live Twice (the \\"Space March\\"), Diamonds Are Forever (a similar space-themed piece, and the \\"Bond Meets Bambi and Thumper\\" theme which echoed both the \\"James Bond Theme\\" and the title song) among others. The action theme used within A View To A Kill (in the pieces \\"Snow Job\\", \\"He's Dangerous\\" and \\"Golden Gate Fight\\") was similar in its basic composition to that used in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film), although it features a wailing electric guitar in the background - at this point Barry was using more contemporary sounding instrumentation within the Bond soundtracks, something he would take further in his next and final score for The Living Daylights.

The Water Works, also known as the Erie City Water Authority, replaced the Erie Water Systems. Its board of commissioners operates independently of the city government.  Origins  A simple pump log system (see 'bored logs') provided the first systematic water works for Erie beginning in 1840, tapping spring water on the Reed farm south of 18th Street and Parade Street. The city began inquiries towards a more substantial system beginning in 1853. A state law passed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on 11 March 1857 on the formation and organization of gas and water companies was the basis for incorporation in 1865 and subsequent construction and provision of utility service.Sloan, B. F., Erie, Pennsylvania Illustrated, 1888  Infrastructure  Erie's city government decided on 16 July 1866 to seek a hydraulic engineer to oversee construction. The city engaged Henry P M Birkinbine, Esq, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who reported his findings on 23 February 1867. A formal contract to provide fire safety water for twenty years‚Äî50 fire hydrants at $9,000 per year‚Äîwas signed by the city government but never enforced.Sloan The location of the water works at the foot of Chestnut Street was determined in November 1867. The West Engine Company of Norristown, Pennsylvania was contracted in November 1867 to provide two Cornish Bull engines. A single engine pumped per day, while per day were pumped when the engines were doubled. The city contracted with the Holly Manufacturing Company of Lockport, New York in 1885 to provide a Gaskill Engine to provide per day of water. That engine was installed in a new pump house on 11 June 1887. The Erie City Iron Works was contracted in December 1867 to erect a standpipe, which eventually reached a height of , thought to have been the tallest standpipe in the world. John M Kuhn, Esq was hired in 1868 to build the standpipe tower, and Captain James Dunlap was contracted that year to construct the crib work. The foundation for the water works was excavated beginning on 7 April 1868. The city government decided in 1870 that it needed a reservoir. Seven acres of land at the Cochran estate, south of 26th Street between Chestnut Street and Cherry Street, was acquired for that purpose in 1871. Work on the reservoir was completed in 1874. The Chestnut Street Water Treatment Plant and Sommerheim Water Treatment Plant filter water received from Lake Erie and the Sommerheim Reservoir, which is spring fed. Sommerheim pumps of water per day to homes and businesses in Erie and surrounding communities. Erie Water Works is the second largest consumer of electricity in Erie after GE Transportation. As a result of a vulnerability assessment conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, the Sommerheim plant is to receive a new power generation facility to back up its Penelec electrical service. The facility, which will cost $1.2 million, is to consist of two diesel-powered electric generators with a day tank and a bulk storage fuel tank.Maciag, Mike, Backup Facility to Power Water Works During Outages, Erie Times-News, 7 June 2007, pg 5B, says that the Erie Water Works is due to have a bulk storage tank and a day tank installed to support two diesel-fueled generators serving as backups to the Sommerheim Water Treatment Plant in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Organization  As of 4 April 1867, three water commissioners were appointed by the judge of the Court of Common Pleas to serve staggered three-year terms: Henry Rawle, William Ward Reed (1 April 1824 - 10 January 1904) , and William Lawrence Scott. The Water Works, also known as the Erie City Water Authority, took over the Erie Water Systems as of 1 January 1992. The Erie Times-News suggests that the Water Authority replaced the Water System in 1989.  Politics  * The mayoral election of 1867 hinged on water issues, especially whether water should be collected from Presque Isle Bay or from local spring water. * An effort to stop fluoridation of the water supply was debated in late 2001, but no referendum was added to the November 2001 ballot. Council members threatened to temporarily disband the Erie City Water Authority to remove its board members if they persisted in their plans to fluoridate the water.Flowers, Kevin, Council Threatens Water Authority, Erie Times-News, 19 September 2002 * A $21 million development project is aimed at improving water quality at the Sommerheim treatment plant in three phases, with completion expected by early 2009. Filtration is currently handled with a sand and charcoal process, achieving turbidity levels of 0.1 - 0.2 NTU. Replacement of the current system is being weighed against installation of a new sophisticated membrane system at $5 million to $7 million additional cost, adjusting the total cost of the project to as much as $28 million. The membrane system would help the city anticipate new federal water treatment standards, lower pre-treatment costs, and achieve turbidity levels of 0.004 NTU, 125 times better than the state standard of 0.5 NTU.Miller, George, Our Water As Good As ...: Erie Water Works Tests Cutting Edge Treatment Systems, Erie Times-News, 11 May 2007, pp 1A, 4A * Plans have been laid for an extension of water service to the Borough of McKean, Pennsylvania  References   External links  * Erie Water Works * The Berkinbine Engineering Firm Papers * Erie, Pennsylvania Illustrated (1888) * Public Involvement in Security Planning Category:Water companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Erie, Pennsylvania ","title":"Erie Water Works"},{"id":"11206378","text":"Two LeO 25 bombers at Aleppo.

Gallus was born in K√∂then. At Wittenberg, where he became a student in 1530 and received the master's degree in 1537, he won the commendation of Melanchthon. In 1543 Luther sent Hieronymus Nopus as preacher to Regensburg at the request of the city council and with him went Gallus, who was ordained by Bugenhagen in April. In 1548 trouble arose in Regensburg over the acceptance of the Interim. Gallus wrote a treatise against it, and had to leave the city; services in the only Evangelical church there were discontinued. For a time Gallus preached for Cruciger (who was ill) at Wittenberg, then in 1549, through the influence of his brother in law, Heinrich Merkel, city secretary at Magdeburg, he went to the Ulrich Church in that city. He joined Flacius in opposition to the adiaphorism of the Wittenberg circle and published a Disputation von Mitteldingen in 1550. He remained in Magdeburg after its capitulation in 1551, and kept up the dispute against Osiander and Major. In June, 1553, Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt called him to his native city to assist in the settlement of the administration of the church property. In August, 1553, Gallus was called back to Regensburg as leader of the Evangelical cause. He worked there for almost seventeen years, and the effects of his activity were felt far beyond the borders of the town. In the disputes of the following years he fought faithfully on the side of Flacius. Like him he tried to influence Melanchthon by letters, but the latter treated Gallus rather haughtily. It probably angered him that Gallus had republished (1554) his Sententiae veterum de coena Domini, which was directed against Oecolampadius. In 1561 Gallus warned the princes convened at Naumburg of the spreading Calvinistic doctrine of the Lord's Supper (see: Crypto-Calvinism). He also got into a dispute with Brenz, whom he suspected of leanings toward Philippism. From 1562 to 1566 he furnished a refuge to Flacius, who had been expelled from Jena. Melanchthon reproached Gallus for fighting continually against the Evangelicals, instead of combating Romanism. However, during the diet in 1556, Gallus preached against the Roman Catholics, and there are still extant manuscripts containing theses of disputation against the Ingolstadt Catholics. In this connection may be mentioned Gallus' writing directed against Corpus Christi day: Vom abg√∂ttischen Fest, Frohnleichnams-Tag genannt (1561). He died in Bad Liebenzell.

The following ratings existed during the war for male or female enlisted personnel training, or with training, in the operation and maintenance of radar sets:  Levels of Rating  * Radarman, striker (E-3) - designated RD. * Radarman, RDSN (E-3) - designated RDSN. * Radarman 3rd class (E-4)- designated RD3. * Radarman 2nd class (E-5) - designated RD2. * Radarman 1st class (E-6) - designated RD1. * Radarman, chief (E-7) - designated RDC. * Radarman, senior chief (E-8) - designated RDCS. * Radarman, master chief (E-9) - designated RDCM. Duties The radarman was generally required to attend and complete a U.S. Navy Class \\"A\\" radar school at a designated Naval Training Centers (NTC) in the United States. Once assigned to a ship or shore station, the radarman was required to operate and maintain the installed radar and electronic warfare equipment. Radarmen were specially trained in emergency repair procedures, as their assigned vessels went into combat areas. The Radarman (RD) rating was changed to Operations Specialist (OS) in October 1972, with its operational duties assigned to the OS rating, electronic warfare operation and maintenance to the Electronic Warfare Technician (EW), and its radar maintenance duties to the Electronics Technician (ET) rating. Operations Specialists play an important role with search-and-rescue teams, such as man overboard and directing search-and-rescue helicopters to downed pilots at sea. The Operations Specialist also operates radar, navigation, and communications equipment in shipboard and combat information centers (CICs) or bridges. They detect and track ships, planes, and missiles. They operate and maintain IFF (identification friend or foe) systems. Since changing from RD to OS, the OS rating has taken on more functions or duties. Besides Radar navigation, tactical communications, naval gunfire support, and Air Intercept Control (AIC), the OS now directs amphibious operations, establishes and maintains tactical data links, Anti-Submarine Tactical Air Control (ASTAC), Strike control, and other duties.

VI p. 90 Early and family life Born in Augusta, Maine, Potter attended common schools and Phillips Exeter Academy. He married Frances Elizabeth Lewis Fox Potter (1818‚Äì1863) of Portland, Maine. Her father George Fox (1791‚Äì1864) and unmarried sisters would move to Wisconsin and farm alongside the Potters. Their son John Kendall Potter (1853‚Äì1864) barely survived his mother. However, their children Rebecca (1841‚Äì1908), Alfred (1843‚Äì1915) and Frances (1847‚Äìafter 1900) did survive and have children.1860 U.S. Federal Census for Walworth, East Troy, Walworth County, Wisconsin and various ancestry.com and findagrave.com entries Career Admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1837, Potter began his legal practice in East Troy, Wisconsin. He served as a judge in Walworth County, Wisconsin from 1842 to 1846. A Whig, Potter was elected a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, and served a term (1856‚Äì1857). He was a delegate to the 1852 Whig National Convention and 1856 Whig National Convention. With the demise of the Whig party, Potter became a Republican and became a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1860 and 1864. =Member of Congress= Wisconsin voters elected Potter to the United States House of Representatives in 1856 and he won re-election twice. Thus, Potter served in the 35th through the 37th Congresses (1857 to 1863). Potter received his nickname in 1860, as a result of an aborted duel with Virginia Congressman Roger A. Pryor after Illinois Congressman (and abolitionist) Owen Lovejoy's remarks concerning the 1837 murder of his brother Elijah Lovejoy. Pryor had edited Potter's follow-up remarks to eliminate a mention of the Republican Party, to which Potter had objected, then Pryor challenged Potter to a duel, but his seconds objected when Potter chose bowie knives as the prospective weapon, decrying his selection of weapon as \\"vulgar, barbarous, and inhuman.\\" William B. Hesseltine, \\"The Pryor-Potter Duel,\\" The Wisconsin Magazine of HistoryThe Wisconsin Magazine of History, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Jun., 1944), pp. 400-409 The incident received considerable press, and Potter's friends afterward often accompanied him when on Washington's streets, lest he be accosted again to test his mettle.Charles E.

In this latter role, his committee handled the Homestead Act of 1862. In 1861, Potter was one of the participants in the Peace Conference of 1861, which failed to avert the American Civil War. He was defeated in his race for reelection in 1862 by fellow Maine-born lawyer James S. Brown, a Democrat who had been Milwaukee prosecutor and mayor, and who would defeated the following year by a Republican general. During the campaign, his son Alfred C. Potter had enlisted in the 28th Wisconsin Infantry in August 1862 as a sergeant, but would be mustered out the following April, and began receiving a pension in 1896.U.S. Civil War records on ancestry.com Later career After Potter's congressional term ended in early 1863, he declined appointment as governor of Dakota Territory, and his wife died in May 1863 in Washington, D.C., leaving Potter a widower with a ten year old son. The Lincoln administration then appointed Potter as Consul General of the United States in the British- controlled Province of Canada from 1863 to 1866. Thus Potter resided in what was then the Canadian capital of Montreal, Lower Canada. In 1866, Potter returned to East Troy, Wisconsin, where he resumed his legal practice.

After the revolution they would dominate Mexican politics as the PRI until the early 1980s. Revolutionary factions Although not as visible as the two other main factions in the Mexican Revolution because of their lack of a highly charismatic leader like Emiliano Zapata or Pancho Villa, there was a third group vying for power during the fighting in Mexico, and they played a critical role mainly because in the end, they won. This faction was known as the Constitutionalists, and consisted of predominately of liberal intellectuals and middle-class citizens ‚Äì in other words, Mexicans who were not of purely indigenous backgrounds but also not of the elite class, and who therefore did not benefit all that much from the foreign investment boom of the D√≠az reign. The Constitutionalists differed from the Zapatistas and Villa's men, who were fighting for a mostly singular cause. They did call for ejidos (or common lands) to be returned to villages and for large estates to be divided up, although not to the extent that Zapata wanted, as this was his primary goal in the Revolution. They also demanded a nationalization of all Mexican land and resources under foreign control, which is something all Mexicans wanted. However, these liberals also realized that the Mexican prosperity of the Diaz period had sacrificed many rights of the Mexican citizen, and also left law and order in the hands of a dictator who could bend it at his will. They sought to end Mexico's struggle with a constitution that had only Mexico's Hacienda owners interests at heart. Francisco Madero's impact The rise of the Constitutionalists actually began at the end of the 19th century, before an official \\"revolution\\" broke out. Porfirio D√≠az was still in power, but the nation of Mexico was beginning to brim with rebellious sentiments. By 1900, a small group had actually formed that officially labeled themselves as anti-Diaz. With this groups' formation, the Mexican peoples' resentment for the Diaz regime began to make itself apparent. More and more uprisings began to take place, especially in areas where foreign businesses owned interests. In 1904, three liberal brothers, Jes√∫s, Enrique, and Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, published a liberal journal in which they issued a call to revolution. With this publication came an unexpected ally ‚Äì Francisco Madero, who was the son of a wealthy hacienda owner. Madero began to publicly denounce D√≠az and tour the country to talk of free elections, democracy and social change. Because of harassment by D√≠az, he joined the Flores Mag√≥n brothers and other Mexican liberals in El Paso, Texas, where he continued to fuel the fires of revolution from afar. In 1910, with the issuance of the Plan of San Luis Potosi by Madero, Mexico, for the first time in its history, was thrust into a full-blown revolution. Because of the writings of Madero, the Flores Mag√≥n brothers and other Constitutionalists (although they were still just labeled liberals), people from every social class and from every ethnic background rose up to answer the revolution's call. During this time not only do leaders such as Zapata and Villa arise, but many Constitutionalists, most of them lawyers, journalists or leading intellectuals, also gained in power and popularity. By the time D√≠az agreed to step down and Madero was elected president, the Constitutionalists had gained a power base in most of Mexico's urban population centers, which were mainly located in the center of the country. Zapata held most of the southern regions where the people of indigenous descent were located, and Pancho Villa led the northern areas dominated mostly by ranchers and miners. Rise of Venustiano Carranza Madero's presidency proved to be short-lived, as he alienated almost all of his supporters by refusing to enact land reforms and developing weak and unsatisfactory programs for social change. General Victoriano Huerta eventually staged a coup that overthrew Madero and installed himself as president. His authoritarian and brutal methods of ruling, however, soon united the Constitutionalists, who were now being led by Venustiano Carranza, with Zapata and Villa in overthrowing Huerta. Carranza replaced Huerta as president of Mexico in 1913 after the U.S. intervention at Veracruz forced Huerta to abdicate. In 1914, all the leaders of the Revolution met at the Convention of Aguascalientes in order to decide on a plan of action for the future. The Convention was quickly reduced to arguments, as Carranza could not agree with Zapata and Villa, who thought he was too power-hungry and not a true leader of the revolution. An especially sensitive subject was the issue of rights for Indians, in which supporters of Zapata accused Carranza and the Constitutionalists of favoring the \\"heirs of the conquerors who continue abuse and cheat the oppressed Indians.\\" Carranza was removed as president, and Villa's forces occupied Mexico City. However, the urban centers continued to be powerhouses of Constitutionalist support, and Villa's actions in the capital soon forced him to leave in 1915. Constitutionalist forces continued to hound him until he was defeated in battle in April 1915. The United States officially recognized Carranza as the president of Mexico in 1916, and in 1917, the population elected him. Constitution of 1917 Carranza's most important action as a Constitutionalist leader came in 1917, when the Constitution of 1917 was published. It was the culmination of most the Revolution's goals, and perhaps the most important document in modern Mexican history. The signing of this document also began the reign of the Constitutionalists. Although Carranza was not in power long enough to enact many changes, his successors would strengthen the Constitutionalist movement in the 1920s. Zapata and Villa were assassinated, along with any other caudillo that threatened the power of the Constitutionalists and thereby solidifying their position. Later on, they would fight off the Cristeros, who were pro-Catholic Church rebels in the northern regions. But perhaps the most important move the Constitutionalists enacted was the establishment of a one- party system. This single party (the PRI) would dominant Mexican politics until the later years of the 20th century. Sources *Chasteen, John Charles. Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America.

In 1843 he founded the Welsh language journal Yr Amserau (\\"The Times\\") in Liverpool. He used the newspaper to campaign for the disestablishment of the Church in Wales.

Penguin Books, 1987, p.313 Among these changes Barrett suggested was the new title Guido Ferranti, named after the lead hero rather than heroine, under which he claimed it would have greater success. He also requested that Wilde's name not be attached to the play after the failure of Vera; or, The Nihilists, although this did not deceive the New York Tribune who correctly identified the author in their review, after which it was advertised as \\"Oscar Wilde's Love Tragedy\\".Ellmann, Richard. Oscar Wilde. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 314 The play was first produced in January 1891 in New York, with Barrett in the role of Ferranti and Minna K. Gale as the Duchess of Padua. It ran for twenty-one performances over three weeks until stopped by Barrett. Wilde sought to produce a second run of the play in London, but was refused by both Henry Irving and George Alexander. It was not produced in England until 1907, for copyright purposes; after which it was not performed there again until 2010. It was also performed twice in Germany, in 1904 and 1906. Plot synopsis The Duchess of Padua tells the story of a young man named Guido who was left in the charge of a man he calls his uncle as a baby. Guido gets a notice to meet a man in Padua in regards to something concerning his parentage. When he arrives in Padua he is convinced by a man named Moranzone to abandon his only friend, Ascanio, in order to dedicate himself to revenging his father‚Äôs death at the hands of Simone Gesso, the Duke of Padua. In the course of the play Guido finds he has fallen in love with Beatrice, the title character, and confides his love to her, a love which she returns. By this time Guido has had a change of heart and decides not to kill the Duke of Padua, and instead intends to leave his father‚Äôs dagger at the Duke‚Äôs bedside to let the Duke know that his life could have been taken if Guido had wanted to kill him. On the way to the bedchamber, however, Guido is met by Beatrice, who has herself stabbed and killed the Duke so that she might be with Guido. Guido is appalled at the sin committed on his behalf and rejects Beatrice, claiming that their love has been soiled. She runs from him and when she comes across some guards she claims that Guido killed the Duke. He is brought to trial the next day. Beatrice tries to prevent Guido from speaking on his behalf for fear that she might be exposed as the killer, but Guido admits to the killing to protect her, and so the date for his execution is set. Beatrice goes to visit Guido in his cell and tells him that she has confessed to the murder but that the magistrates did not believe her and would not allow her to pardon Guido. Before waking Guido, Beatrice drinks some poison and when Guido discovers that the poison is all but gone, he shares a kiss with Beatrice before she dies, at which time Guido takes her knife and kills himself. =Dramatis Personae= *Simone Gesso, Duke of Padua *Beatrice, his Wife *Andrea Pollajuolo, Cardinal of Padua *Maffio Petrucci, Gentleman of the Duke's Household *Jeppo Vitellozzo, Gentleman of the Duke's Household *Taddeo Bardi, Gentleman of the Duke's Household *Guido Ferranti *Ascanio Cristofano, his Friend *Count Moranzone, an Old Noble *Bernardo Calvacanti, Lord Justice of Padua *Ugo, the Headsman *Lucia, a Tire Woman *Servants, Citizens, Soldiers, Monks and Falconers with hawks and dogs =Act I= Guido Ferranti, a young man, travels to Padua with his friend Ascanio after receiving a mysterious letter from a stranger, claiming to know the true secret of Guido's birth. Guido meets him in the market, as the letter instructs, and after Ascanio leaves, he reveals himself as Count Moranzone. He tells Guido that his father was the Duke Lorenzo, who had been executed after being betrayed by a close friend in exchange for land, that his mother died in a swoon on hearing the news, and it was he who had taken the young Guido to the family he had grown up with. He encourages Guido in his revenge, and telling him that betraying the Duke is better than merely killing him, and shows him his father's knife. Before Moranzone can tell Guido the traitor's name, the Duke of Padua enters with his court, and Moranzone indicates the Duke's guilt by kneeling before him. He introduces Guido as one who wants service in the Duke's household. The Duke accepts him, then continues to the Cathedral. Moranzone tells Guido that until he is avenged, he should put aside all other things - when Ascanio returns, Guido sends him away. As Guido speaks a soliloquy, swearing this, he sees the Duchess of Padua pass. Their eyes meet. =Act II= Guido has risen in the Duke's confidence sufficiently that he rests on his arm. A mob outside the palace calls for the Duke's death, and when he orders them fired upon, the Duchess stands between them. She intercedes for them with the Duke, and when he will not listen to their grievances, divides her whole purse between them. The Duke expresses his displeasure, but does not notice the mutual attraction between her and Guido. The court leaves - the Duchess alone wonders how Guido can dote on the Duke as he does. Guido returns alone as she prays and declares his love for her, which she eagerly returns. Their kiss is interrupted by a servant, who delivers to Guido his father's dagger - the sign from Moranzone that he should now kill the Duke. Guido tells the Duchess that they must part forever, and leaves for his revenge. =Act III= Guido meets Moranzone on the way to the Duke - he explains that he has decided not to kill the Duke. Instead he intends to leave the dagger with a letter, so the Duke will know Guido had him in his power and chose to spare him. Moranzone calls him a coward and bad son, and blames his contact with the Duchess for his change of heart. While Guido prays alone that he has done the right thing, the Duchess enters, and tells him there is nothing separating them any more - because she has killed the Duke. Guido rejects her in horror, and they argue. He repents of his reaction as she leaves, and the act drops on her leading the guard to arrest Guido. =Act IV= During the trial, Guido declares that he will tell the truth before the verdict falls upon him. Fearing that Guido will identify her as the real murderer, the Duchess orders the judges not to allow him to speak. However, the judges finally grant Guido the right to defend himself, at which time he claims that he is the murderer. The duchess faints in shame, shock and gratefulness. =Act V= The Duchess masks herself in a cloak to visit Guido in jail. She plans to substitute herself for him at the execution on the next day. Determined to die, she drank the poison that was put next to the sleeping Guido. Guido wakes up and admits that he has forgiven the Duchess and that he loves her. The Duchess urges Guido to flee but he refuses. Guido finally kills himself with the Duchess's dagger after she dies in his arms. Critical reception Wilde himself described the play to Anderson: \\"I have no hesitation in saying that it is the masterpiece of all my literary work, the chef d'oeuvre of my youth.\\"Ellmann, Richard. Oscar Wilde. Penguin Books, 1987, p.210 Mary Anderson, however, was less enthusiastic: \\"The play in its present form, I fear, would no more please the public of today than would 'Venus Preserved' or 'Lucretia Borgia'. Neither of can afford failure now, and your Duchess in my hands would not succeed, as the part does not fit me. My admiration of your ability is as great as ever.\\" Ellmann, Richard. Oscar Wilde. Penguin Books, 1987, p.212 William Winter reviewed the first production in The New York Tribune on 27 January 1891: > \\"The new play is deftly constructed in five short acts, and is written in a > strain of blank verse that is always melodious, often eloquent, and > sometimes freighted with fanciful figures of rare beauty. It is less a > tragedy, however, than a melodrama...the radical defect of the work is > insincerity. No one in it is natural.\\"Ellmann, Richard. Oscar Wilde. Penguin > Books, 1987, p.314 The Duchess of Padua is not regarded as one of Wilde's major works, and has rarely been performed or discussed. Leon√©e Ormond suggests several reasons for this: it is \\"quite unlike the plays for which Wilde is most famous, and biographers and critics have been inclined to say that it is unstageable, that it draws too heavily upon Shakespeare, Jacobean tragedy and Shelley‚Äôs The Cenci.\\" Robert Shore commented on the play itself while reviewing a rare contemporary production: > \\"...his tale of Renaissance realpolitik, revenge and big love is about as > far removed from the sophisticated social ironies of The Importance of Being > Earnest as you can get. The dramatist affects the high Jacobean manner but > the results are more cold pastiche than hot homage. Shakespearean archetypes > stand behind the action - especially Lady Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet - but > the smoothness of the verse means Wilde's characters never burn with the > knotty tormented passion of their dramatic forebears. Basically, it's > Victorian melodrama.\\" However, Joseph Pearce is more receptive to Wilde's Shakespearian influence: \\"Unfortunately, the derivativeness of The Duchess of Padua has devalued it in the eyes of the critics...Yet if The Duchess of Padua is an imitation of Shakespeare, it is a very good imitation.\\"Pearce, Joseph \\"The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde\\", p. 164 He emphasises the presence of Wilde's own paradoxical style in lines such as \\"She is worse than ugly, she is good\\", and views it as sharing major themes and language with the rest of Wilde's canon. Adaptations The Duchess of Padua was the basis of a one-act opera by Jane Van Etten, titled Guido Ferranti, which premiered in Chicago in 1914 and was one of the first American operas by a woman to be produced by a regular company.

The subject concerns Simone, a wealthy 16th-century Florentine merchant who finds his wife Bianca in the arms of a local prince, Guido Bardi. After feigning hospitality, Simone challenges the interloper to a duel, disarms him, and strangles him. This awakens the affection of his wife; and the two are reconciled. The original manuscript for the play is held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin as part of their larger holdings by and about Oscar Wilde. In 1914 the young Italian composer Carlo Ravasegna (Turin 1891-Rome 1964) wrote a short opera Una Tragedia Fiorentina to a translation/libretto by Ettore Moschino. The libretto was published with Wilde's name by the Tipografia Subalpina, Turin, 1914. Alexander von Zemlinsky wrote an opera based on a German translation of the play, entitled Eine florentinische Trag√∂die, which premiered in 1917. Sergei Prokofiev wrote his opera Maddalena to his own libretto based on a play by Magda Gustavovna Lieven-Orlov written under the pen name Baron Lieven. That play was in turn based on Oscar Wilde's play. The opera had its premiere in a BBC studio recording in London in 1979; and its first live staging was in Austria in 1981. T. Sturge Moore wrote an opening scene for this play for \\"presentation\\" purposes.; Luce/Methuen premiere of the Moore edition, 1908 In 1989, C. Ren√© Hirschfeld wrote a chamber opera titled Bianca based on the Florentine Tragedy. He used the German translation by Max Meyerfeld. Filling in for the absent first scene, a love scene between Bianca and the prince, Hirschfeld used love poetry from Oscar Wilde himself. The opera was first performed at the Salzburg Festival in 1991.

It is administered under Arawa Rural LLG. The town was largely destroyed during the Bougainville Civil War, resulting in the relocation of the capital to Buka, though there are plans to rebuild Arawa and make it the capital again. The land where Arawa is now situated was previously a large expatriate plantation. History When Bougainville Copper Ltd needed a civic headquarters for dealing with the local and national government instrumentalities, Arawa Plantation was an obvious candidate. It was in close proximity to Kieta, the historic district headquarters whose geographical location made expansion difficult. It was also close to new commercial port facilities at Loloho in Anewa Bay north of Arawa, in addition to the small longstanding port near Kieta, which allowed rural agricultural products to be loaded onto cargo ships. The extremely busy Aropa Airport was south of Kieta, immediately adjacent to the sea. The townsite was quickly developed through the 1970s and 1980s with residential neighbourhoods, commercial enterprises, large public schools in addition to long-established Roman Catholic schools in Kieta, a public library, hotels and restaurants and entertainment facilities such as a film theatre. Villagers throughout Bougainville Island and Buka Island had long been accustomed to seeing films at church stations, while residents from elsewhere greatly desired them; videos were common and frequently shown by Lutheran, Anglican and Baptist churches in the area in an attempt to attract converts. These denominations did not previously operate on Bougainville and Buka, which prior to the Panguna mine had largely been Roman Catholic and Methodist-cum-United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

At age two, Arjia Rinpoche was recognized by Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama as the 20th Arjia Danpei Gyaltsen, the reincarnation of Je Tsongkhapa's father, Lumbum Ghe, the throne holder and abbot of Kumbum Monastery. He has trained with lineage teachers, such as the 14th Dalai Lama, the 10th Panchen Lama, and Gyayak Rinpoche‚Äîfrom whom he received many sacred teachings and ritual instructions. During the Cultural Revolution in Chinese controlled Tibet, Arjia Rinpoche was forced to leave his monastery and attend a Chinese school, yet secretly continued to practice and study with his tutors. In addition, he was required to work in a forced Labor Camp for 16 years. Following the Cultural Revolution, Rinpoche continued serving as Abbot of Kumbum‚Äîoverseeing the renovations in the monastery and reestablishing monastic studies. In 1998, due to the strained political climate in Tibet, Arjia Rinpoche went into exile because he would not compromise his spiritual beliefs and practices. He escaped to the United States where he now lives and started a Buddhist Center for Compassion and Wisdom (TCCW) in Mill Valley, California, a center committed to the preservation of Buddhist teachings, art and culture within and outside of Tibet and Mongolia. In 2005, he was appointed Director of the Tibetan Cultural Center (TCC) in Bloomington, Indiana by the 14th Dalai Lama. TCC was recently renamed the Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center. Presently, he directs both TCCW and TMBCC. Arjia Rinpoche excels in the knowledge and understanding of Tibetan art, architecture and the Tibetan Language. He has given classes in Buddhist Art and Sutra throughout the United States, Canada, Taiwan, India and Guatemala. In 1999, Rinpoche built a three-dimensional Kalachakra mandala and presented it to the Dalai Lama. Later, the Dalai Lama donated this mandala to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Kumbum Monastery, one of the six largest monasteries of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, is the birthplace of Je Tsongkhapa (founder of the school which is now headed by the Dalai Lama). Kumbum Monastery was once the home of 3,600 monks and well revered by the four well known Buddhist Colleges for higher learning: The Institute of Sutra, Institute of Tantra, Institute of Tibetan Medicine, and the Institute of the Kalachakra (Astrology). In the 1980s, after Buddhism began to revive in Tibet and in China, Arjia Rinpoche reestablished monastic life and traditional studies at Kumbum. Throughout his life, Arjia Rinpoche was tutored by specialized teachers in the area of Buddhist philosophy, sutra and tantra teachings, as well as in Buddhist art and architectural design. He was in charge of the renovations of Kumbum monastery in 1991 and launched several projects including the following: Red Cross Organization in Kumbum, Disaster Relief Project for local villages, a clinic for villagers run by monks of the Tibetan Medical Institute and a school for local village children. Arjia Rinpoche became vegetarian in 1999.

She was the second warship to bear the name. Notes on USS Velocity by LCdr Roland Blandford Velocity was laid down on 21 July 1941 at Chickasaw, Alabama, by the Gulf Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 15 April 1942; sponsored by Mrs. K. B. Hover, the wife of the shipbuilder's destroyer hull foreman; and commissioned on 4 April 1943, Lt. Comdr. Joseph L. Bull, Jr., USNR, in command.  Initial operations  After fitting out and conducting sea trials, Velocity took on further supplies, underwent yard work at New Orleans, Louisiana, conducted minesweeping training out of Burrwood, Louisiana, and practiced anti-submarine tactics out of Key West, Florida. Departing the Florida Keys on 3 May, the minecraft arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on the 6th and escorted a coastal convoy to Charleston, South Carolina, before undergoing further yard work at the Norfolk, Virginia, Navy Yard. Departing Norfolk, Virginia, on 6 June, Velocity arrived at Key West, Florida, three days later, en route to the Panama Canal Zone. She then escorted eight LST's across the Gulf of Mexico to Balboa, before she transited the canal on 18 June. She departed the Panama Canal Zone on the 24th, but her onward routing was cancelled; and she put back into port soon thereafter. She conducted local operations out of Balboa into July, after which time she transported a cargo of diesel fuel oil to Baltra Island, in the Galapagos group, to alleviate a critical fuel shortage there. When she returned to Balboa, she conducted further local operations, including towing targets for the aircraft from a carrier task group training in the vicinity ‚Äî including , , and . Velocity subsequently escorted floating drydocks ABD-1 and ABD-2 and their tows, and , to the New Hebrides Islands, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 24 September. The minesweeper soon shifted to Noumea, New Caledonia. She operated put of this port on convoy escort and local patrol duties into mid-1944, escorting ships to the New Hebrides, the Solomons, the Ellice Islands, and the Bismarck Archipelago.  Pacific Operations with the Third Fleet  In mid-August, Velocity joined the U.S. 3rd Fleet. On 8 September, she departed Guadalcanal in company with Task Group (TG) 32.17, in the screen, escorting a convoy bound for the invasion of the western Carolines. Soon thereafter, Velocity, in company with and , arrived off Kossol Roads early on 15 September. Together, the three ships swept 13 mines. The next day, struck a mine which very nearly broke the ship's back and sank her. However, prompt damage control saved the destroyer, and Velocity was among the ships which sent a fire and rescue party to lend assistance to the stricken Wadleigh. Upon completion of the operation at Kossol Roads, Velocity shifted to Ulithi, arriving on the last day of September. Here, the minesweeper conducted sweeping operations in the harbor before serving as a convoy escort, screening ships to Humboldt Bay, New Guinea. Soon thereafter, she then shifted to Seeadler Harbor, at Manus in the Admiralties.  Leyte Gulf operations  Velocity departed Manus on 10 October with the remainder of her division, Mine Division (MinDiv) 14. Arriving off Leyte Gulf on the 17th, the minecraft and her sisters commenced sweeping the area in the path of the invasion slated to begin on the 20th. On the 19th, a Japanese \\"Val\\" dive bomber dropped a bomb near the ship and attempted to strafe her, but was driven off by brisk anti- aircraft fire. That evening, Velocity and MinDiv 14 swept ahead of the battleships of Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf ‚Äî the same ships which a few nights hence would win the Battle of Surigao Strait. Velocity operated as mine-disposal vessel for the division and ended up with a tally of 24 mines sunk and 15 destroyed.  Velocity shoots down attacking aircraft  She conducted sweeping operations on the day of the landings, 20 October, at Leyte and continued this duty until the 23rd, at which time she and her sister sweepers were ordered to join the antiaircraft screen for the transports. On the 26th, when a formation of twin-engined \\"Betty\\" bombers attacked the anchorage area, Velocity splashed one of the attackers. During the confused melee, an American Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter went down due to a fuel shortage. Velocity quickly sent her motor whaleboat to pick up the aviator, but a boat from arrived on the scene first. On the 27th, however, Velocity took her turn at bat and rescued a pilot from a crashed American aircraft.  Stateside overhaul  Following the Leyte operation, Velocity departed the Philippines on 28 October and proceeded via Manus to Portland, Oregon, where she arrived on 4 December. After a major availability at the Albina Engine and Machine Works Dock there, the minesweeper departed Portland on 3 March, bound for San Pedro, California. Subsequently, shifting to San Francisco, California, Velocity departed the U.S. West Coast on 4 April and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 14th.  Return to the Far East  Departing Hawaiian waters two days later, Velocity escorted the ammunition ship to Guam, via Eniwetok, in the Marshalls. She then moved to Saipan, where she joined the U.S. 5th Fleet. Shifting to Kerama Retto, Okinawa, on 11 May, the minesweeper operated in the Ry≈´ky≈´s as minesweeper, anti-aircraft vessel, and anti- submarine ship. When was hit by a Japanese kamikaze on the night of 21 June, Velocity went to her aid. On 4 July, Velocity departed Kerama Retto for minesweeping operations in the East China Sea. With her base of operations now at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, the ship proceeded to sweep 13 mines between 4 and 30 July and continued operations into the East China Sea into August and past the end of the war with Japan.  Post-World War II operations  In the operation concluded on 25 August, Velocity tallied a score of 35 mines located and destroyed. The minesweeper operated in Japanese waters into October 1945, between Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç, to clear shipping lanes for the ships of the occupation forces. During this time, she was based at Ominato, Japan. After a brief period at Shanghai, China, at the end of December 1945, Velocity shifted to Japanese waters. Departing Sasebo, Japan, on 21 January 1946, Velocity arrived at San Francisco, California, on 1 March, via Saipan, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned and placed in inactive status on 7 October 1946, the minesweeper remained in reserve through the 1960s. During this time, her classification was changed to fleet minesweeper, and she was designated MSF-128 on 7 February 1955. Struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1972, Velocity was simultaneously sold to the government of Mexico. She was renamed ARM Ignacio L. Vallarta (C82). Her pennant number was later changed to G14, and changed a final time to P113 in 1993. , Ignacio L. Vallarta was in active service for the Mexican Navy.

Plot  Detective Ma investigates a mass murder at the residence of Ms. Park. Five were killed with two survivors: Ms. Park and her caretaker, Mi- Ja. Mi-Ja recounts her story to Ma. Mi-Ja takes care of her ex-teacher, Ms. Park. They organize a class reunion with Ms. Park's past students: Se-Ho, Eun- Young, Dal-Bong, Sun-Hee, Myung-Ho, and Jung-Won. Each resent Ms. Park for different reasons: the couple Se-Ho and Eun-Young because of Ms. Park's belittling of their poverty; Dal-Bong because of his cast leg caused by Ms. Park punishing him with repeated squatting after losing a relay at track; Sun- Hee because of Ms. Park's criticizing of her former obesity; and Myung-Ho because of Ms. Park sexually abusing him. The friendless and quiet Jung-Won, once ridiculed for defecating in class, stopped attending school when his mother was hit by a car. Nevertheless, they all try to maintain a facade of jolliness for the reunion. However, tensions arise as the former classmates become more open about their anger. Se-Ho drunkenly explodes during the barbecue party and accuses the others of lying to themselves. A bunny-masked figure later drags him to the basement, where he is killed. Eun-Young tries to drown Ms. Park while the latter is bathing, though it fails. She is attacked next by the bunny figure and killed. Dal-Bong tries to attack Ms. Park but is caught by the bunny figure, who inserts insects into his ear to kill him. Throughout the murders, flashbacks show the students laughing at Ms. Park's deformed son, who wore a bunny mask to hide his face. Only Jung-Won wanted to befriend him, but Ms. Park mistakenly assumed him the bully. Sun-Hee tries to throw Ms. Park off the cliff, but is interrupted by Mi-Ja. In the ensuing struggle, Sun-Hee falls off instead and dies. Mi-Ja is knocked out by Myung- Ho, who would have set Ms. Park on fire if not for the bunny figure killing him. The figure is revealed to be Jung-Won. Detective Ma investigates Jung- Won's supposed apartment. All he finds is his mother's decaying corpse, women's clothing, and articles about the success of Ms. Park's ex-students, contrary to Mi-Ja's claims. It is revealed that there is no male student of Ms. Park's bearing the name \\"Jung-Won\\"; it is instead the real name of Mi-Ja. She fabricated the story about her life: she was the one who was poor, obese, broke her leg after doing Ms. Park's punishment, and defecated in the class. Her mother was handicapped during the car accident and died when she was an adult. Jung-Won then took the identity of Mi-Ja and became Ms. Park's caretaker until she could kill her classmates at the reunion. Jung-Won drives Ms. Park to the beach and vents her frustration at her before committing suicide by jumping from the pier, while Ms. Park can only watch. The film closes with Ms. Park's wheelchair lying empty on the pier.  Cast  * Mi-hee Oh as Ms. Park, the old teacher dying of an illness and is resented by the other characters. In her eyes she thought she was doing what was best for them. * Seo Young-hee as Mi-Ja/Jung-Won, the only student who doesn't resent Ms. Park and works as her caretaker. Mi-Ja and Ms. Park share a special bond. * Lee Ji-Hyun as Sun-Hee, was once obese and teased by Ms. Park but then became skinny and obsessed with her appearance and weight. She has to wear sunglasses to hide the stitches from a recent eye surgery. * Lee Dong-kyu as Myung-Ho, a boy who was always favoured by Mrs Park. It is hinted that she made sexual contact with him that has left him scarred for life. * Yu Seol-ah as Eun-Young, the class vice president whose family was to be poor. For a present, she made her a card that said \\"I love you Ms. Park\\". Ms. Park then ridiculed her in front of the entire class. * Park Hyo-jun as Dal-Bong, used to be the most athletic boy in school. After he came last in a relay, Ms. Park slapped him and made him spend a day doing squats, which later caused him to permanently injure his knee when playing soccer the next day. * Yeo Hyun-soo as Se-Ho, the former class president who was close to Eun-Young. Ms. Park bullied him for being poor. He is the first to tell Ms. Park how he feels in a drunken rage. * Jang Seong-won as \\"Jung-Won\\", the shy boy that no one used to talk to. He apparently \\"pooped his pants\\" during lesson once and the entire class laughed at him including Ms. Park. His mother was then severely injured in a car accident and he dropped out of school, only to reappear at the reunion years later. * Kim Eung-soo as Detective Ma, trying to figure out the case of the murders.

History Norman Foote received his first guitar from his parents at the age of 11. Influenced by the Beatles, Hank Williams, and Elvis, he soon switched to the electric guitar. This led to performing with garage bands throughout his high school career. At the age of 20, Foote left home to travel Australia and New Zealand and it was while he was abroad and performing with a travelling theatre group in New South Wales, Australia that Foote discovered his passion for puppetry and slapstick comedy. Foote was one of the first artists to sign on for the Music Box Artist Series with Walt Disney Records. It is with Disney that he recorded his first two albums, FootePrints and If the Shoe Fits. In 1995, Foote teamed up with another children's performer, Fred Penner, and his company Oak Street Music to release his next album Shake a Leg. Oak Street Music continued to be a major contributor in the production of future records, including Pictures on the Fridge, released in 1997. Foote's music has been called exuberant, good-natured, and fun with refined mannerisms. AllMusic.com While Foote uses only his voice and guitar as instruments, he combines light jazz, pop, and folk music to create his own style that has helped keep his name alive for over 20 years. His first contemporary album, Domestic Rendez-vous, is geared towards an adult audience rather than children.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online He was involved in ship camouflage in the First World War, and through his pupil Hugh B. Cott influenced military camouflage thinking in the Second World War also. Early life He was born at Rowley Lodge, Arkley in Hertfordshire to Scottish parents: John Kerr former Principal of Hooghly College in Calcutta and his wife, Sybella Graham. Kerr was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then studied Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Zoology Kerr interrupted his medical studies to join an Argentinian expedition to study the natural history of the Pilcomayo River. On his return, he studied natural sciences at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating with first class honours in 1896. The Argentinian expedition had ended with the loss of most of the collections, but after graduating he mounted an expedition to the Gran Chaco, bringing home a large collection of material related to the South American lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa.Who's Who in Glasgow 1909 Kerr was accompanied by John Samuel Budgett, who studied the frogs of the area and discovered a new genus.Budgett J.

Kerr stayed until 1935The post was renamed the following year, 1903, as Regius Professor of Zoology. being succeeded by Prof Edward Hindle. Kerr was particularly interested in teaching medical students, and published widely. In 1903 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour, James Cossar Ewart, Frederick Orpen Bower, and James Geikie. He won the Society's Neill Prize in 1904. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1928 to 1931. He was President of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh from 1906 to 1909 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1909. He received LLDs from the University of Edinburgh in 1935 and the University of St Andrews in 1950.Dictionary of National Biography: Kerr, Sir (John) Graham (1869‚Äì1957) Camouflage Kerr made early contributions to ship camouflage in the First World War. He wrote to First Sea Lord Winston Churchill on 24 September 1914, advocating camouflage by disruptive coloration ‚Äî breaking up outlines with patches of strongly contrasting tone ‚Äî and countershading ‚Äî shading guns into invisibility with lighter paint below, darker paint above. Kerr openly supported the controversial camouflage claims of American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer. Kerr's aim was to make ships difficult to spot and fool range finders by disrupting their outlines, or in his own words \\"to destroy completely the continuity of outlines by splashes of white\\", to make ships harder to hit with gunfire at long range. Kerr's principle was applied to ships in various ways, but Kerr found it difficult to promote or control the use of his camouflage ideas, and they fell out of favour after Churchill's departure from the Admiralty. The Royal Navy reverted to plain grey. A rival proposal for disruptive camouflage emerged in 1917 from the marine artist Norman Wilkinson. Wilkinson, unlike Kerr, had little difficulty fitting in with the naval establishment, and was put in charge of a large-scale program of painting ships in disruptive patterns that became known as \\"Dazzle camouflage\\". After the war, Kerr engaged in an unsuccessful legal dispute over the credit for creating dazzle camouflage. Wilkinson successfully promoted the false idea that Kerr's camouflage sought invisibility rather than image disruption.Forbes, Peter (2009) Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage. Yale. . pp. 85‚Äì92 and 97‚Äì100. Kerr again influenced British camouflage in the Second World War, this time through his pupil Hugh B.

Biography He was born at Talence, Gironde. After having graduated with the highest honors at the √âcole Polytechnique and √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es, he was attached as engineer to the Southern Railroad; and under his direction the lines from Tech to Rivesaltes and from Tet to Perpignan were built, including the remarkable viaduct of Bouzanne. Afterward Carvallo became director of the work of canalizing the Ebro (Spain); and he established in the delta of that river a system of irrigation which permitted the cultivation of enormous tracts of land hitherto unproductive. From Spain Carvallo went to Italy, where he directed the works of the Roman railroads. On his return to Spain he was entrusted with the building of the line from Pamplona to Zaragoza, and later became the chief engineer of a Spanish water company. Carvallo was the author of many dissertations printed in the Comptes-Rendus do l'Acad√©mic des Sciences and in many other scientific publications. Among his numerous contributions the most noteworthy were those on the piling up and solidification of embankments; on the formula of the maximum of stability and minimum of expense in public works; on the laws of oscillation of chain bridges, etc. Amid his numerous works, Carvallo found time to devote himself to Jewish interests. He was one of the founders of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, and for many years served on the executive committee of that institution. He was a Saint- Simonian. According to M. Chouraqui, he was considered too open to Christianity, in that he considered the possibility that Jesus had a mission from providence.Elie Kedourie, Arabic Political Memoirs and Other Studies.

As a researcher at the University of Ibadan, he mapped out the effects of severe anaemia on the mother and her baby, and established the safety of treating gross anaemia by packed cell transfusion combined with rapidly acting diuretic. He was also part of a group that discovered the dangerous threat posed by sickle cell disease to maternal and fetal lives among Africans. In Zaria, the results of the work of a team he led, became the most powerful boost to international advocacy for better maternal and perinatal health in developing countries. Now retired, his life is summed up thus - an obstetrician and gynaecologist, a teacher and trainer, medical academic, university administrator, a sort of social activist, and a cricket and music fan. Life Professor Kelsey Atangamuerimo Harrison was born in Abonnema, Rivers State, on 9 January 1933. He received his primary school education locally at Bishop Crowther Memorial School. After an outstanding secondary school career at Government College Umuahia, he trained at University College Ibadan and at University College Hospital London, graduating MB BS with honours and distinction in Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1958. Towards specializing in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, he received his postgraduate research and clinical training in Nigeria and United Kingdom (UK), most notably under John Lawson in Ibadan, W.C.W Nixon in London, and F. E. Hytten in various U K Medical Research Council units. He became a member in 1964, and a fellow in 1973, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London. Already a foundation member of the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria in 1965, he was professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, first in Ibadan in 1972, then in Zaria from 1972 to 1981, and lastly in Port Harcourt, 1981‚Äì1998, where he became that university's Vice- Chancellor from 1989‚Äì1992, having earlier been the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. He retired from the Nigerian university system in 1998, and was appointed in July 1999, an emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Port Harcourt. He is a recognised authority on anaemia, sickle cell disease and malaria in pregnancy.Harrison, K.A. (1982) \\"Anaemia, malaria and sickle cell disease\\". Clinics in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. 9. 445 ‚Äì 477. His researches on anaemia at Ibadan University led to the development of the solution to the serious life-threatening problem of extreme anaemia in late pregnancy. Another group to which he belonged, unraveled the influence of several haemoglobinopathies on pregnant women and their babies under African conditions, and how best to deal with the most dangerous of them, namely sickle cell disease. In Zaria, his collaborative studies on malaria in pregnancy discovered that protecting early teenage pregnant girls against malaria and anaemia conferred a hitherto unknown benefit: the protected girls grew taller, they produced bigger babies, yet the proportion of those of them who developed cephalopelvic disproportion and needed operative delivery, fell sharply.Harrison, K. A, Fleming A. F, Briggs N. D, Rossiter C. E. (1985) \\"Growth during pregnancy in Nigerian teenage primigravidae.\\" In Harrison, K. A. editor. \\"Childbearing, Health and Social Priorities: a survey of 22774 consecutive hospital births in Zaria, Northern Nigeria\\". British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. 92. Supplement 5. pages 32‚Äì39. This offers hope that in malaria endemic areas, obstructed labour and vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) might be prevented by protecting these vulnerable girls against malaria and by adding nutritional supplements to their diets during pregnancy. The Zaria Maternity Survey by a team Harrison led, was his most influential work. Between 1976 and 1979, Harrison and his colleagues collected data on over 22,000 births that when analysed, threw open the problems of traditional forms of interference, of adolescent marriage and pregnancy, of women's inferior status, and of their neglect in pregnancy, labour and afterwards, and of the consequences of this neglect especially high levels of both maternal mortality and VVF. The strongest message that came through this work was that both maternal and perinatal health benefitted hugely when women were educated, but not when they were illiterate. Harrison concluded that although the real priority in the area is reducing maternal deaths, the real problem to be faced is not so much medical but sociological, and that the eradication of mass illiteracy through universal formal education is a fundamental key to better maternal health.Editorial (1987) \\"Maternal Health in Sub-Saharan Africa\\". Lancet. 329. pages 255‚Äì257. In other words, if we want to reduce maternal mortality we should stop looking at the problem in isolation. Harrison's work was published by British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in October 1985.,Harrison, K.A.(1985) \\"Childbearing, Health and Social Priorities ‚Äì a survey of 22774 consecutive hospital births in Zaria, Northern Nigeria\\". British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 92. Supplement 5. pages 1‚Äì119.. The work gained instant recognition as a major advance in maternity care, and featured as a major factor in the planning and launching of the international safe motherhood movement in 1987. /ref> Back in Zaria, the activities of the team Kelsey Harrison led, that included sociologistsMurphy M and Baba Turku M (1981) \\"Rural dwellers and health care in Northern Nigeria\\".

A.(1980)\\"Traditional Birth Attendants\\".Lancet.316.pages 43‚Äì44. although it resurged after he had left the area. Besides Harrison's heavy clinical, teaching and research activities, he took active part in various community services and international assignments throughout his working life and afterwards. In the 1970s, it was the rehabilitation of sections of the health care services of the Rivers state of Nigeria, destroyed through military operations in the country's civil war. As part of the post civil war rehabilitation effort, he helped to ensure that displaced students of Eastern Nigeria origin were reabsorbed back to their former places in university of Ibadan. In the same decade, he was a member of the medical research council of Nigeria. In the 1980s, he took part in various WHO technical working groups on anaemia, maternal mortality and VVF. In the 1990s, he influenced the formation of the National Foundation of VVF - a local NGO - becoming its president in 1997-1998. Its activities placed the surgical treatment of VVF in Nigeria's national agendaNigeria Campaign to end fistula www.endfistula.org The WHO and other powerful international organisations and many NGOs have since taken over the concept and extended it to other African and some Asian countries.International Day to End Fistula 23 May http://www.un.org/en/events/endfistuladay/ Kelsey Harrison published widely.

Civil policing responsibilities are shared between the state and local level: in addition to the Slovak police Force (Policajn√Ω zbor Slovenskej republiky), various municipal police forces exist. Other forces include the military police, railway police, finance police, various special forces units divided between numerous ministries and others. As of 2012, there were 21,407 state policemen serving in Slovakia, with 2,500 municipal policemen and 750 voluntary citizens, which is three times the number of policemen in the comparatively similar Finland. History In 2010, the Slovak police established for the first time plans for different criminal areas.

Armed men protecting the railways were established in 1935, their functioning was regulated by the Law No. 86/1937 Zb from the year 1937, which also established the Armed guards units of the railways (). Later, in the 1950s, Public Security at the Railways () was created. Law No. 51/1964 Zb. established the Units of Armed and Fire protection of the Railways () in 1964. In 1967, under the OPO≈Ω units, an independent investigation service was established by Law No. 46/1967 Zb. After the fall of communism in 1989, federal power ceased over the protection of the railway system in 1992. Law No. 61/1993 Z. z from the year 1993 created a separate Slovak Railway Police by transforming part of the Federal Railway Police. In 1998 the National Council of the Slovak Republic approved Law No. 57/1998 Z.z. by which the Railway Police was governed and the service employment within the Railway Police was described in Law No. 73/1998 Z.z. On 14 February 2008 the former law was amended with Law No. 86/2008 Z. z., this change established the structures of the Toll Police within the Railway Police. In 2010, the National Council of the Slovak Republic amended the Railway Police Law again by approving Law No. 60/2010 Z. z., moving the structures of the Toll Police within the Slovak Police Force. Previously administered by the Ministry of Transport, Post and Telecommunications, since 2009 the Railway Police is administered by the Ministry of Interior. Since 1 January 2011, in accordance with law approved on 10 December 2010, a new service \\"Railway Police\\" was created within the Police Force and the Railway Police was moved under the Police Force, all eligible former members becoming members of the Police Force. Some of the unique Railway Police competences were absorbed by the Police Force as well. The following competences were added to each member of the Police Force since 1 January 2011: * control over the railway traffic * investigating railway traffic threats * cooperating with others in the safe transfer of nuclear and other special materials Current uniforms and badges are valid until the end of 2015.

Vacuum tube instrument amplifiers manufactured by subcontractors such as Valco were also sold under the Electromuse brand, often as part of a package deal offered to consumers that included a lap steel guitar and matching amplifier in complementary colors. Electromuse was an early adopter of electrified musical instruments, and their patented Eye-Beam pickup was one of the first practical electromagnetic pickups on the market.

Biography Silliman was born in Fairfield, Connecticut, graduated from Yale University and practiced law and served as a crown attorney before the American Revolution. He was appointed Colonel of the Fourth Regiment, Connecticut militia, in May 1775 and became Brigadier General in 1776. He patrolled the southwestern border of Connecticut, where the loyalists of Westchester County, New York, caused constant irritation and concern for patriot towns and farms along the Connecticut coast. He also fought with the main army during the New York Campaign of 1776 and opposed the British raid on Danbury in 1777. At the beginning of Tryon's raid on Danbury, Connecticut, Silliman was at his home in Fairfield. As soon as he heard word of the British landing on the coast, he sent out expresses to alarm the nearby towns and to collect the militia. By noon the next day he arrived in Redding, Connecticut, with five hundred men and was joined by Major General David Wooster and Brigadier General Benedict Arnold in the Battle of Ridgefield. One night in May 1779, nine Tories crossed the sound in a whale boat from Lloyd's Neck. One of the Tories had been previously employed by Silliman as a carpenter, so he knew the house well. Eight of the men forced their way into the house at midnight and took the general and his adult son. They were taken to Oyster Bay, New York, and finally to Flatbush. The Americans had no prisoner of equal rank to exchange for Silliman, so they captured one. Thomas Jones, a highly reputed loyalist, was captured in November 1779 by Continental Navy Captain David Hawley and brought back to Connecticut. Silliman and Jones were exchanged in May 1780, with Silliman's son being exchanged as well. These events were accurately depicted in the 1994 TV film Mary Silliman's War by Heritage Films, based on the 1984 biography of Silliman's second wife by Joy and Richard Buel. Silliman died in July 21, 1790. Family Silliman was the son of Abigail Selleck (the daughter of Abigail Gold and Jonathan Selleck) and Ebenezer Silliman (the son of Sara Hull and Robert Silliman). His son Benjamin Silliman was born in a tavern, originally the home of Ebenezer Hawley in Trumbull, Connecticut, after Benjamin's mother, Mary Silliman, fled Fairfield ahead of a British and Loyalist raiding party. Benjamin was the first professor of science at Yale University and the first American to distill petroleum.

During his career, he became champion of both Leningrad and Moscow, and played in the Soviet Chess Championship finals nine times, with his best competitive results in the 1930s. He placed clear second in the 1933 Soviet final. He retired from most competitive play in the early 1950s, moving into roles as a chess organizer, teacher, and coach. He served as Chairman of the All-Union chess section from 1954 to 1959 and as chairman of the USSR Chess Federation from 1959 to 1961. By profession, he was a hydraulics engineer.  Early years, peaks pre-war  Vladimir Alexeyevich Alatortsev was an early Leningrad chess rival of Mikhail Botvinnik, who later became World Champion. However, Botvinnik, who was two years younger, established complete dominance over Alatortsev right from the start, and wound up with a 9-0 lifetime won-loss score with two games drawn. Alatortsev's first important high-level result was an excellent shared 3rd-6th place in the Soviet Championship, Moscow 1931 (URS-ch07), with 10/17; Botvinnik won. Alatortsev was again runner-up to Botvinnik in the 1932 Leningrad Championship with 7/11. Alatortsev made his best Soviet Championship result in 1933 at Leningrad (URS- ch08), when he placed clear second with 13/19, as Botvinnik won his second title. At Tbilisi 1933, he tied for 1st-2nd places with Viktor Goglidze at 10/14. Alatortsev shared the Leningrad title in 1933‚Äì34 with Georgy Lisitsin on 11/15. But he had a disappointing result in the 1934 Leningrad International with 4.5/11, as Botvinnik won to continue his dominance. He scored 7/13 in the Leningrad National tournament in May 1934 for 8th place, as Ilya Rabinovich won. In the 1934 Soviet Championship at Leningrad (URS-ch09), he scored 10.5/19 for a tied 5th-8th place; Grigory Levenfish and Ilya Rabinovich won. He earned a place in the 1935 Moscow International tournament, the strongest Soviet event since 1925, and finished with a very good even score of 9.5/19, as Botvinnik and Salo Flohr won. Alatortsev drew a 12-game match (+4 =4 ‚àí4) with the very strong Hungarian Andor Lilienthal in 1935. He was jointly champion of Moscow in both 1936 and 1937. Then in the 1937 Soviet Championship at Tbilisi (URS-ch10), Alatortsev made 9.5/19 to tie 10th-12th places. Alatortsev posted his second best pre-war result when he tied for 1st-2nd places with Leonid Shamaev in a strong tournament at Leningrad 1938, with 14/21, ahead of Lilienthal and Viacheslav Ragozin. Chessmetrics.com ranks this as a 2684 performance. In the Leningrad-Moscow tournament of 1939, Alatortsev tied for 9th-10th places on 9/17, as Flohr won. He had to qualify for the next Soviet final, and in the semi-final at Kiev 1940, he scored 9.5/16 to tie for 4th-7th places, but did not advance to the final, losing out on tiebreak. Chessmetrics ranks him as #21 in the world for August 1940, with a rating of 2626.  War years  With the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, organized chess was put to a stop for the next several years; but Alatortsev's solid pre-war results earned him an invitation to a strong event at Kuibyshev 1942. He made 6.5/11 for seventh place, as Isaac Boleslavsky won. He then scored 7/15 at the 1942 Moscow Championship.  Post-war form drops  With the Nazi invaders in full retreat by 1944, organized chess slowly got going again in the Soviet Union. Alatortsev struggled in the 1944 Soviet Championship at Moscow (URS-ch13) with just 5.5/16 for 16th place, as Botvinnik won. He had to return to qualifying for the next Soviet final, and made it through at Moscow in the semi-final with 10.5/15 to tie for 2nd-4th places, as David Bronstein won. In the final that same year in Moscow (URS- ch14), he scored just 7.5/17, as Botvinnik dominated the field. Alatortsev played the 1945 Latvian Championship at Riga, and won the tournament (but not the title; he was playing hors concours). He scored 8.5/15 in the 1946 Moscow Championship to tie 4th-5th places, as Bronstein won again. He was below 50 per cent for the next two Soviet finals as well; in URS-ch15 at Leningrad 1947, he made 7.5/19, as Paul Keres won, and then in URS-ch16 at Moscow 1948, he finished well down with 7.5/18, as Bronstein and Alexander Kotov won. Alatortsev qualified successfully through the semi-final at Moscow 1949 with 9.5/16, and then he played his last Soviet Championship final, URS-ch18 at Moscow 1950, scoring a good 9/17 to tie for 7th-10th places, as Keres won.  Coach, organizer, author  It was clear that the new generation of Soviet players was taking over the top places in tournaments. Players such as Alexander Kotov, Isaac Boleslavsky, David Bronstein, Efim Geller, Yuri Averbakh, Tigran Petrosian, and Mark Taimanov were all younger and had the benefits of organized Soviet training, so they surpassed the older generation in their achievements. Alatortsev moved into a training role in the late 1940s, assisting the rising star Vasily Smyslov. He also became involved in tournament organization and administration. Alatortsev was awarded the title of International Master by FIDE, the World Chess Federation, in 1950, when this title was introduced officially. Alatortsev stopped playing major tournaments in the early 1950s, but occasionally took part in lesser events. He served as head of the Soviet Chess Federation from 1954 to 1961, during a time when there were about three million registered Soviet players. From 1943 to 1974, he was the editor of a chess column in the newspaper Vechernaya Moskva. In 1960, he published the book Modern Chess Theory. His final strong tournament was Tbilisi 1965, where at age 56 he made a respectable 8/17. Alatortsev never got the opportunity to compete outside the Soviet Union. He was awarded an Honorary Emeritus Grandmaster title by FIDE in 1983. This was clearly well deserved, since his win at Leningrad 1938 and his second place in the Soviet Championship 1933 were definitely strong Grandmaster results. Alatortsev died at age 77, on January 13, 1987. There is a photo of him at chessgames.com, which also has a selection of 231 of his games. Alatortsev favoured the Closed Openings with White, and his style could be characterized as solid and positional, resorting to tactics only when necessary.

Biography Born in Recife, Augusto da Silva studied at the seminary in Olinda before being ordained to the priesthood on March 5, 1899. He then did pastoral work in Olinda, and also served as Master of Ceremonies to the cathedral. Silva was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on September 30, 1908. On May 12, 1911, Silva was appointed the first Bishop of Floresta by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 22 from Archbishop Lu√≠s da Silva Brito, with Bishops Francisco de Paula Silva, CM, and Joaquim d'Almeida serving as co-consecrators.

Its 86,000-watt, transmitter is located on Becker Road in Robin Glen-Indiantown, in Buena Vista Township, east of Saginaw. The station's signal covers a large amount of territory in eastern lower Michigan, from Farmington Hills northward to West Branch, and from the Thumb area westward to Greenville and, during some conditions, as far east as London, Ontario, and as far south as Inkster, Michigan. History From the 1970s until September 1986, WIOG operated on 106.3 MHz licensed to Saginaw. 106.3 FM signed on in 1969 as WSBM, featuring a MOR/adult contemporary music format. Later in the 1970s the calls became WIOG (the calls resembled the number \\"106,\\" as in its dial position) and the format shifted to AOR. In 1980, with the addition of some disco records to its AOR playlist, WIOG moved to a Top 40 format, eventually taking on the name \\"Hits 106\\" and becoming one of the most popular radio stations in the market. The 102.5 frequency was originally home to WNEM-FM (later WGER), a Beautiful Music station which was one of the pioneers of FM Stereo broadcasting in Michigan. With its big signal, WGER was one of the most successful easy-listening stations in Michigan; as late as 1985, when it was using TM Programming's beautiful-music package, the station was posting #1 ratings among adult listeners aged 25‚Äì49 in the Saginaw and Flint markets, according to TM promotional literature of the time (1) After the owner of WIOG bought WGER then sold the old station at 106.3, WIOG and WGER switched call signs in September 1986. WGER moved its beautiful music to the lower powered 106.3 and WIOG's CHR format was planted at 102.5. The move paid off, as WIOG quickly became a powerhouse in mid-Michigan broadcasting. In the fall of 1986, aided by its new, more powerful signal and a \\"Free Money\\" promotion where they gave away a chance for $1,000 to $10,000 every hour during an economic recession in the area, the station attained an Arbitron rating of 30.3%, becoming the highest-rated radio station in the entire country 1. WIOG got strong competition in the early 1990s from 100.5 WTCF \\"The Fox\\", which soon surpassed them as the dominant CHR station. Due to the competition and to a desire to appeal to more adult listeners, WIOG shifted to being a Hot Adult Contemporary station in May 1992. WTCF's departure from the CHR format in 1999, however, left the door open for WIOG to move back to CHR, which it did that July. Today WIOG remains one of the most popular stations in the Tri-Cities market, though its showing in the Flint market is more modest due to competition from CHR WWCK-FM, rhythmic WRCL and active rocker WWBN. Notable DJs at WIOG at the time include Dean Myers, Scott \\"Shannon\\" Seipel, Renee Andrews, Bob Hughes, Jim Alexander, Rick Donahue, Keith Michaels, Steve Kelly and Tim Murphy. Rick Belcher was the Program Director at the time of WIOG's rating's domination. Recent shows As with all of previous Citadel Broadcasting stations being bought out by Cumulus Media, WIOG has undergone some changes in the past period. Notable shows as of current are the Early Shift and the Playhouse. Recognized D.J.s of the recent time and past are Demas (WIOG's Program Director and on air DJ), who resigned due to personal reasons.

Career = As player = Osio started his playing career in the Torino youth system. In 1986, he moved at Empoli, and Parma in 1987. In his stay at Parma, he became one of the fan favourites, earning the nickname \\"Il Sindaco\\" (The Mayor) by the local supporters, and he was a key player for the team that climbed the Italian football divisions, up from Serie C1 to the top division, Serie A. During his time with the club, he enjoyed both domestic and European success, winning the Coppa Italia, and the European Cup Winners' Cup, also participating in the UEFA Cup. In 1993, after six seasons with Parma, he returned to Torino for two seasons before an unexpected move to Brazilian club Palmeiras, which makes him one of the very few Italian footballers to have ever played in the South- American country; he won the Paulista Championship with the club in 1996, despite having played only a handful of minutes for the club. After a few experiences at the Serie C level, he retired in 2001. = As coach = In 2001 Osio became assistant manager of Serie C2 club Brescello. He was successively promoted to the head coaching position in 2002.

Licensed to Lapeer, Michigan, it first began broadcasting under the WTHM call sign in 1962. Until December 2019, it broadcast a country music format using Westwood One's Real Country, which combines classic country favorites with select current titles. Prior to that, as WLSP, the station had aired satellite-fed adult standards from ABC (Timeless Classics), and, prior to that, Talk and Sports formats. WTHM first went on the air November 16, 1962, adding an FM sister station on 103.1 in 1968. The WTHM call letters are derived from THuMb indicating that the signal covers the Thumb region of Michigan. WTHM-AM/FM was a full-service station featuring MOR/adult contemporary music. Later on the call letters on both AM and FM were switched to WDEY; the music format remained AC. WDEY-AM/FM had been owned for many years by James Sommerville, who sold both to Covenant Communications in 1991. WDEY-AM switched to a country format as \\"Country Gold\\" with the WWGZ calls in the early 1990's, before adopting an all-sports format and the new call letters WLSP in 1994. Both WLSP-AM and WRXF-FM were sold in December 2001 to Regent Communications (now Townsquare Media) for $1.3 million. Both stations then moved from their longtime location at 286 West Nepessing Street in Lapeer to join their new Regent affiliate stations at G-3338 East Bristol Road in the Flint suburb of Burton. WLSP dropped sports in 2002 for a talk format featuring programming from the Michigan Talk Radio Network, before switching to adult standards as \\"Unforgettable 1530\\" (using ABC Radio's \\"Stardust\\" format) in January 2004.

It can be associated with a lesion of an optic radiation.Yale- Cranial Nerve 2, pg. 11 While quadrantanopia can be caused by lesions in the temporal and parietal lobes, it is most commonly associated with lesions in the occipital lobe.Kolb, B & Whishaw, I.Q. Human Neuropsychology, Sixth Edition, p.361; Worth Publishers (2008) Presentation An interesting aspect of quadrantanopia is that there exists a distinct and sharp border between the intact and damaged visual fields, due to an anatomical separation of the quadrants of the visual field. For example, information in the left half of visual field is processed in the right occipital lobe and information in the right half of the visual field is processed in the left occipital lobe. Example of the sharp division between the blind and intact fields (for someone with hemianopsia, rather than quadrantanopia, in this case) In a quadrantanopia that is partial, there also exists a distinct and sharp border between the intact and damaged field within the quadrant. The sufferer is able to detect light within the damaged visual field. The prospects of recovering vision in the affected field are bleak. Occasionally, patients will spontaneously recover vision in the affected field within the first three months after the brain injury; however, vision loss remaining after this period of spontaneous recovery is traditionally thought to be permanent, certain companies now claim to be able to induce recovery of vision after this three-month period.Rehabilitation for Homonymous Hemianopia and Quadrantanopia Homonymous inferior/superior quadrantanopia Homonymous denotes a condition which affects the same portion of the visual field of each eye. Homonymous inferior quadrantanopia is a loss of vision in the same lower quadrant of visual field in both eyes whereas a homonymous superior quadrantanopia is a loss of vision in the same upper quadrant of visual field in both eyes.William J. Weiner: Neurology for the Non-Neurologist, p.526; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (July 2010) A lesion affecting one side of the temporal lobe may cause damage to the inferior optic radiations (known as the temporal pathway or Meyer's loop) which can lead to superior quadrantanopia on the contralateral side of both eyes (colloquially referred to as \\"pie in the sky\\"); if the superior optic radiations (parietal pathway) are lesioned, the visual loss occurs on the inferior contralateral side of both eyes and is referred to as an inferior quadrantanopia.Central Visual Pathways Binasal/bitemporal quadrantanopia Binasal (either inferior or superior) quadrantanopia affects either the upper or lower inner visual quadrants closer to the nasal cavity in both eyes. Bitemporal (either inferior or superior) quadrantanopia affects either the upper or lower outer visual quadrants in both eyes. Compensatory behaviors Individuals with quadrantanopia often modify their behavior to compensate for the disorder, such as tilting of the head to bring the affected visual field into view.Visual Fields in Brain Injury - Hemianopsia.net Everything you need to know about Hemianopsia Drivers with quadrantanopia, who were rated as safe to drive, drive slower, utilize more shoulder movements and, generally, corner and accelerate less drastically than typical individuals or individuals with quadrantanopia who were rated as unsafe to drive. The amount of compensatory movements and the frequency with which they are employed is believed to be dependent on the cognitive demands of the task; when the task is so difficult that the subject's spatial memory is no longer sufficient to keep track of everything, patients are more likely to employ compensatory behavior of biasing their gaze to the afflicted side. Teaching individuals with quadrantanopia compensatory behaviors could potentially be used to help train patients to re-learn to drive safely.

Palazzo Davanzati is a palace in Florence, Italy. It houses the Museum of the Old Florentine House. History Palazzo Davanzati was erected in the second half of the 14th century by the Davizzi family, who were wealthy members of the wool guild. In 1516 it was sold to the Bartolini and, later that century, to the Davanzati family, also rich merchants (1578), who held it until 1838. After the suicide of Carlo Davanzati, it was split into different quarters and modified. After escaping the numerous demolitions of 19th century Florence, it was bought by Elia Volpi, an antiquarian, who restored It in (his impression of) the original style. In 1910, Volpi opened the building as a private museum (Museo Privato della Casa Fiorentina Antica). The contents of this museum kept changing as Volpi sold the furniture at auctions, including a major one in 1916 in New York. In the 1920s, Egyptian antique dealers Vitale and Leopoldo Bengujat acquired the building and its contents. In 1951 it was purchased by the Italian state and kept open as a museum. By 1995 the museum needed to be closed for major restoration to keep the building from falling down. The museum was partially reopened in 2005 with the ground and first floors; by 2012 all the floors were open to visitors. Architecture The palace consists of a facade that unifies a grouping of earlier, medieval tower homes that the owner purchased with the intent to put them together. It is constructed in sandstone, with three large portals on the horizontal axis, and three stories of mullioned windows. The topmost floor has a loggia supported by four columns and two pilasters that was added in the 16th century. The fa√ßade displays the Davanzati coats of arms and has traces of other decorations. The interior courtyard has arches, vaults, and capitals in 14th century-style. Interior The following rooms can be visited: =Ground floor: Atrium= Entered through one of three large portals. This large room was used to conduct business. Presently it used to display objects and information related to the history of the building. =Ground floor: Courtyard= All the rooms of the building communicate on to hallways that open onto the central courtyard. =First floor: Great Hall= This large room was used for conducting business. Its large windows give on to the street. There are three square holes covered by wooden covers in correspondence with the openings of the atrium below on to the street; these were used to observe who was walking in, and eventually for defense purposes. The room is now set up as a museum with a table in the center with various sixteenth century objects on display. =First floor: Sala dei Pappagalli (Room of the Parrots)= The so-called Sala dei Pappagalli has wall paintings designed to look like patchwork wall-hangings lined with miniver, with motifs of parrots painted or embroidered on the blocks. These paintings are much restored and so may not look like the original frescoes. A large fireplace dominates this room. On display is maiolica from Montelupo. =First floor: Bathroom= A small room with indoor plumbing. =First floor: Study (studiolo)= This room, which does not retain any of its original wall decoration, was probably a study. Objects on display include a forziere (locking chest), cassone, small sculptures, and paintings. =First floor: Bedroom= The Sala dei Pavoni's frescoes show instead a false geometrical tapestry and a row of coat of arms of families allied with the Davizzi. It is currently set up with a bed and cradle. There is a small ensuite bathroom. =Second floor: Bedroom= The bedroom of the second floor, is called of the Chatelain of Vergy in honor of the frescoes inspired to the medieval romance of The Ch√¢telaine de Vergy. full of love, adventure and death. In the same bedroom you can see a beautiful \\"Desco da Parto\\" painted by Scheggia, Masaccio's brother. =Upper floor= Camera delle Impannate. On the third floor are the Camera delle Impannate, another bedroom, and the Kitchen. The Impannate were cotton or linen textile, dyed in wax, put in a wood frame and inserted in the windows were in substitution of the glass, that was very expensive.

Spear was laid down as HMS Errant (BAM-22) on 28 October 1942 by Associated Shipbuilders, Seattle, Washington; renamed USS Spear and reclassified AM-322 on 23 January 1943; launched on 25 February 1943; sponsored by Miss Lois Wilcox; and commissioned on 31 December 1943, Lt. A. M. Savage, USNR, in command.  World War II Pacific operations  Following outfitting at Seattle, Washington, and shakedown off the California coast. Spear joined a convoy on 25 March 1944 and sailed from San Francisco as an escort. Five days later, she was ordered to proceed independently to Hawaii. The minesweeper conducted training exercises there until 3 May when she was assigned escort duty for convoys carrying troops and supplies to advance bases in the Marshall Islands at Majuro, Eniwetok, and Kwajalein. = Supporting the Guam assault = On 17 July, the minesweeper was attached to a convoy of LST's and preceded to a rendezvous point just south of Guam for the impending amphibious assault on that island. The minesweeper was then assigned patrol duties in the transport screen off Orote Point. On 28 July, Spear had to maneuver to avoid enemy shellfire from the beach. During the remainder of the campaign, she escorted oilers on their nightly retirement from the assault area and conducted antisubmarine searches. She then returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed escort trips to advance bases. = Okinawa campaign = Spear conducted antisubmarine patrols off Ulithi during the first three weeks of December 1944; escorted a convoy to Hollandia; and then resumed her ASW duties off Ulithi until mid-March 1945. On the 19th, she sortied with Task Group (TG) 52.14, Minesweeper Group 1 of the Amphibious Support Force, for the Okinawa assault. On the night of 26 March, Spear rescued several downed fliers. During the campaign, the minesweeper protected anchorages from enemy submarines and swept enemy mines. In 82 days of uninterrupted operations off Okinawa, Spear was under almost daily aerial attack, logging 202 attacks by enemy planes in April. Spear steamed to Guam in June for tender availability and, six weeks later, was back at Okinawa when hostilities with Japan ended. = End-of-war operations = Following the return of peace, she joined in mine-sweeping operations in the East China Sea; helped to clear the approach to and the mouth of the Yangtze River; swept mines off Chefoo, China; and participated in further sweeping operations off Jinsen, Korea, before returning to Shanghai and joining the Yangtze River Patrol Force. On 17 November, she got underway for Sasebo, Japan. Spear departed Japanese waters on 29 November 1945 en route to the United States, via Pearl Harbor.  Decommissioning  Upon returning to San Diego, California, Spear was decommissioned and, in August 1946, was placed \\"in reserve, out of commission\\", with the Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 7 February 1955, the minesweeper's designation was changed to MSF-322. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1972 and sold to the government of Mexico on 19 September.  Awards  Spear received four battle stars for her World War II service. Mexican Navy service On 19 September 1972, the former Spear was sold to the Mexican Navy which renamed her ARM Ignacio de la Llave (C76). Her pennant number was later changed to G08, and changed again in 1993 to P107. Ignacio de la Llave had been retired from service by 2004.

The internet layer derives its name from its function facilitating internetworking, which is the concept of connecting multiple networks with each other through gateways. The internet layer does not include the protocols that fulfill the purpose of maintaining link states between the local nodes and that usually use protocols that are based on the framing of packets specific to the link types. Such protocols belong to the link layer. Internet-layer protocols use IP-based packets. A common design aspect in the internet layer is the robustness principle: \\"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send\\" as a misbehaving host can deny Internet service to many other users. Purpose The internet layer has three basic functions: *For outgoing packets, select the next-hop host (gateway) and transmit the packet to this host by passing it to the appropriate link layer implementation; *For incoming packets, capture packets and pass the packet payload up to the appropriate transport layer protocol, if appropriate. *Provide error detection and diagnostic capability. In Version 4 of the Internet Protocol (IPv4), during both transmit and receive operations, IP is capable of automatic or intentional fragmentation or defragmentation of packets, based, for example, on the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of link elements. However, this feature has been dropped in IPv6, as the communications end points, the hosts, now have to perform path MTU discovery and assure that end-to-end transmissions don't exceed the maximum discovered. In its operation, the internet layer is not responsible for reliable transmission. It provides only an unreliable service, and best effort delivery. This means that the network makes no guarantees about the proper arrival of packets. This in accordance with the end-to-end principle and a change from the previous protocols used on the early ARPANET. Since packet delivery across diverse networks is an inherently unreliable and failure-prone operation, the burden of providing reliability was placed with the end points of a communication path, i.e., the hosts, rather than on the network. This is one of the reasons of the resiliency of the Internet against individual link failures and its proven scalability. The function of providing reliability of service is the duty of higher level protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the transport layer. In IPv4, a checksum is used to protect the header of each datagram. The checksum ensures that the information in a received header is accurate, however, IPv4 does not attempt to detect errors that may have occurred to the data in each packet. IPv6 does not include this header checksum, instead relying on the link layer to assure data integrity for the entire packet including the checksum. Core protocols The primary protocols in the internet layer are the Internet Protocol (IP). It is implemented in two versions, IPv4 and IPv6. The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is primarily used for error and diagnostic functions. Different implementations exist for IPv4 and IPv6. The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used by IPv4 hosts and adjacent IP multicast routers to establish multicast group memberships. Security Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a suite of protocols for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for key exchange. IPsec was originally designed as a base specification in IPv6 in 1995, and later adapted to IPv4, with which it has found widespread use in securing virtual private networks. Relation to OSI model Because the internet layer of the TCP/IP model is easily compared directly with the network layer (layer 3) in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack, the internet layer is often improperly called network layer.RFC 1123 Although they have some overlap, these two models use different classification methods.

Morphology  A lot of morphological diversity has been reported among populations of the beet leafhopper in the United States. Morphological descriptions of two different populations of beet leafhoppers from California and Mexico are presented here. The leaf hopper is described as a small insect, 3 ‚Äì 3.5 mm in length, which is often greenish yellow, tan or olive in colour. The leaf hopper may have darker markings on its wings, pronotum, abdomen and head if it has developed during colder temperatures. The general shape of the body has been described as \\"wedge shaped\\" with the body tapering off at the posterior end of the insect. The head of the insect is wider than the pronotum with distinct eyes and a curved anterior margin. The mouth parts, like that of all hemipterans, have stylets used for penetration into plants and sucking. The seta, or hair present on the body are uniceriate, meaning that they are arranged in a row are present on the hind tibia of the insect. One of the distinguishing feature of this species is also the presence of plates on males. For general information on insect anatomy see: Insect morphology.  Feeding behaviors  Beet leafhoppers are polyphagous generalists which means that they are able to feed on various different types of host (biology) plants. The fact that these insects migrate during the spring and summer time to cultivated fields also means that they show a lot of variation in their host plant choices by season: feeding on desert weeds in the winter and feeding on cultivated fields in the summer. They also show incredible variation in food choices between populations in different states, and these choices may change depending on host plant diversity, availability, defenses, etc. In one study on host plant preferences of beet leafhoppers from California and New Mexico, researchers found that beet leafhoppers from California preferred to feed on sugar beet plants while those from New Mexico preferred to feed on kochia, Russian thistle and redwood pigweed plants. The study also found differences in short term and long term feeding preferences where both kinds of leaf hoppers initially settled on beet plants (when observed over a period of 2 days) and later moved to their preferred choices (when observed over 20 days). Despite these differences, both species chose beet plants for laying eggs. Studies of insect feeding patterns can be conducted using electrical penetration graphs which allow researchers to match electrical waveforms to specific feeding behaviors in insects. Insects may choose to feed on different parts of a plant. By studying the waveforms produced for different feeding behaviors and then matching them to video images and histology of insects feeding, researchers can classify which part of a plant an insect feeds on. These waveforms may also give other valuable feeding information like the speed at which an insect feeds. For the beet leafhopper, understanding feeding is important as feeding is a mechanism through which insect borne plant diseases spread. So far, the beet leafhopper is the only known vector of the Beet curly top virus, which spreads through plant phloem tissues. Therefore, researchers conducted electrical penetration graph experiments of leaf hoppers in which they wired beet leafhoppers to an EPG machine and characterized the types of waveforms produced. The data showed that beet leafhoppers primarily ingested phloem sap along with xylem and mesophyll sap. What was surprising however was that the rate of phloem ingestion in beet leafhoppers is significantly lower than that in other sap feeding insects. This leads researchers to believe that beet leafhoppers are unable to use the natural turgor pressure of phloem sap in order to ingest fluid and may need to use muscles to actively draw sap from phloem.  Life history  = Growth and generation times = A study of beet leafhoppers in Idaho showed that they are capable of producing multiple generations within a year, with generally 3 different generations produced in Idaho in a year. The insects are active in mustard and flixweed plants over winter and females begin laying eggs in March. The adults from this generation mature by May when they may migrate to beet fields to mate and lay eggs for the second annual generation to be born. The third generation matures to adulthood by early September or October when these insects migrate back to their winter habitats. There is evidence that this migration may be related to seasonal temperatures as leafhoppers migrated to beet fields later during colder seasons. Researchers proposed that these later migrations can decrease damage to beet fields as the leafhoppers stay on the fields for shorter periods of time overall. The study showed that temperature had a significant impact on the growth rate and development of the embryo within the leafhopper egg, with higher temperatures generally being proportionally related to quicker development. The optimal range of temperatures for the development of these insects is between 65¬∞ - 95 ¬∞F. This means that development takes longer over winter for these insects as compared to spring and summer times. Since development is very closely related to temperature, researchers in the study also concluded that the number of leafhopper generations produced in a year may be related to the seasonal temperatures of their habitat. They found that under lab conditions, where the leafhoppers were raised in optimal temperatures of 95 ¬∞F, as many as 15-16 generations of leafhoppers could be produced per year. However they cited that actual numbers of generations per year may be limited to up to 8 generations in the warmer parts of the Southern United States. This may be partly because other factors like the seasonal availability of beet plants as food, may also impact the number of generations in a year. Generally beet plants are harvested in October which would limit food resources for the beet leafhopper in the fall. = Life cycle = The life cycle of the beet leafhopper consists of three stages: eggs, nymphs and adults. The insects grow through 5 different molts during development which provides 5 instars before they reach adulthood. The growth patterns in the size of the instars follow a sigmoidal curve which means that there is greatest increase in size among younger instars and the rate of growth decreases as the instars reach adulthood. = Colouration = Beet leafhoppers may show different coloration based on the time of year that they mature in. Generally, adults that mature during warmer temperatures in the spring and summer time show light green or yellowish colouration. This is different from adults that mature in the winter which generally show darker markings on their wings and pronotum. These changes in colouration may be due to changes in seasonal temperatures as sometimes leafhoppers who mature in colder spring temperatures also show darker colouration like that of winter leafhoppers. Some researchers believe that these changes in colouration occur according to the surrounding temperatures of the last leaf hopper instars as this is the stage during which wings develop. This may also be backed by the fact that adult leaf hopper do not change colour once they have matured regardless of the temperature of their environment.  Vector of disease  = Citrus stubborn disease = Several studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s have showed that the beet leafhopper is a vector (epidemiology) of the Spiroplasma citri prokaryote which is the causal agent of the Citrus Stubborn Disease.  Mode of transmission  The bacterium S. citri is initially acquired by the leaf hopper through feeding on a plant that has already been infected. Through feeding, the prokaryote enters the gut of the beet leafhopper where most of its cells are killed, but some do survive. These surviving organisms then enter the epithelial cells of the intestine and multiply. Eventually the organisms are able to make their way into the hemocoel of the insect through which they are transferred to the insect‚Äôs salivary glands. When the insect then feeds on healthy plants, the prokaryotes enter the phloem of the plant and thus infect the new plant. One study has shown that this process of transmission also has negative effects on the leaf hopper itself, where significant numbers of leaf hoppers may die after being infected with S. citri. The researchers suggest that this increased mortality may be as a result of ingesting toxins that are produced either by S. citri itself or by plants defending themselves against the pathogen. In any case, these toxins have a significant on the longevity of infected beet leafhoppers. Another study tested some of the characteristics that are important for transmission of S. citri by the beet leafhopper. Researchers tested the impacts of modes of acquisition on the latent period of S. citri within the leaf hopper and found that insects that had been injected directly with the prokaryote in their gut had the lowest latency period of 10 days followed by leaf hoppers who had ingested the pathogen from an infected plant (16 days). In testing the time taken for the insects to acquire S. citri, the acquisition access period, researchers found that a time period of at least 6 hours of feeding on S. citri cultures were required for insects to acquire the pathogen. However this study should be viewed critically as insects were membrane fed a culture of the organism to determine this time period and actual results may vary when insects feed on an infected plants. The study also found that the numbers of host plants that were infected with S. citri increased with the numbers of infected leaf hoppers that were feeding on these plants.  Movements of Spiroplasma citri inside beet leafhopper hosts  In an experiment to understand how S. citri cells move within the beet leafhopper, researchers inoculated insects with the pathogen and then observed the locations of S. citri inside the leafhoppers using electron microscopy. They observed S. citri in the gut as well as the salivary glands of the insects which further proves that the pathogen may be transmitted by the mechanisms described in the studies above. In particular, researchers observed that S. citri were often found within gut epithelial and salivary gland cells on infected hosts within small membrane bound vesicles. This led them to believe that the S. citri pathogen may be using cell mediated endocytosis as a predominant way to enter gut and salivary cells and may be travelling directly though the cells rather than travelling in the spaces between cell membranes of individual cells through a process called diacytosis. They also observed damage to muscle cells in the gut and salivary glands of insects infected with S. citri which is evidence that S. citri causes damage to the beet leafhoppers when it uses them as vectors. However the authors also noted how this damage was not as significant as seen in other insects which may suggest that the beet leafhopper may be co-evolving to reduce harm by S. citri pathogens. In a follow-up study to understand the exact mechanism of uptake of S. citri cells by beet leafhopper gut cells, researchers developed a line of beet leafhopper cells called the CT1 cell line. They used this cell line to study how leafhopper cells interacted with S. citri cells in vivo. After incubation of beet leafhopper cells with S. citri cells, researchers used an electron microscope to see how cell lines interact. They found that S. citri cells were pressed against the cell membranes of C. tenellus cells, and they also observed invaginations of the cell membrane. They concluded that these sighting were consistent with previous studies which suggested that S. citri cells are taken up by beet leafhopper cells by endocytosis. = Beet curly top virus = The beet leafhopper is the lone insect vector of the beet curly top virus (BCTV) which causes disease in many important crops like beans, sugar beet, cantaloupe, cucumber, peppers, spinach, squash, tomato, watermelon and other important plants. The beet leafhopper is also responsible for transmission of two other strains of the Beet curly top virus, which according to literature are now considered separate species. These strains are the Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV) and Beet mild curly top virus (BMCTV). So far, the methods of transmission for all three strains seem to be the same.  Transmission  In order to understand the movement of the MBCTV inside its hosts, experiments have been conducted using PCR analysis which allow for the detection and quantification of MBCTV particles inside leafhoppers. One such study measured the amounts of MBCTV found in the gut, hemocoel and salivary glands of beet leafhoppers and found that the virus was present in all those regions suggesting that the virus may use a circulative transmission mechanism inside its host. A circulative transmission mechanism refers to a transmission mechanism in which the vector ingests a pathogen during feeding from an infected host, the pathogen is absorbed in the vector‚Äôs gut and then travels through the hemocoel into the salivary glands. When the vector then bites into an uninfected host, the pathogen enters the new host. This mechanism is similar to the transmission mechanism used by \\"Spiroplasma citri\\" in transmitting the Stubborn citrus disease which also uses the beet leafhopper as a vector. In the same study, researchers were able to detect viral particles of MBCTV in beet leafhopper guts after as soon as an hour of feeding on infected plants. Furthermore, they found that insects that had fed on an infected plant for an hour were able to spread the disease to uninfected plants. These findings suggest that the insects become virulent very shortly after feeding on infected plants. The study also found that as time of feeding on infected plants increased, the numbers of viral particles in the gut, hemocoel and salivary glands of the insects also increased, even though there were individual differences in the amounts of BMCTV particles detected in the body. Another important finding of this study was showing that individual insects can maintain MBCTV in their bodies for up to a 30 days after getting infected by it, even though the amount of virus detected does not increase in this period. The authors propose that this indicates that MBCTV is unable to replicate within its vector. It was also found that the virus is not transmitted between generations of beet leafhoppers from adults to nymphs, proposing that the virus does not use transovarial transmission. In another study, waveforms from electrical penetration graphs (EPG) were used to understand which waveforms coincided with the inoculation of plants with BCTV. As insects feed on different parts of the plant, they produce different EPG waves which can be measured using probes wired to the insects. Researchers found that D waveforms were most likely to coincide with successful inoculation of the plant with BCTV. This waveform is also the same waveform which is produced during phloem ingestion by beet leafhoppers. Thus, this study further lends credibility to the transmission model that suggests that beet leafhoppers transmit the BCTV when they feed on the phloem sap of healthy plants.  Transmission to non-host plants  A previous study of oviposition in the beet leafhopper has shown that the insects prefer to lay eggs on beet plants even when they prefer different host plants for feeding. In another study, researchers tried to study which plants the insects prefer to settle and lay eggs on and which plants were good for insect survival. These studies are important as factors like host preference may impact which species of plants the BCTV is transmitted to. It is also important to understand the complex interactions that take place between the beet leafhopper and non-host plants to understand how disease may be spread. Tests of settling behaviors showed that although the insects settled similarly on all plants in the beginning, the numbers of beet leafhoppers on bean and tomato plants declined significantly after a period of four hours. Instead, the insects preferred to settle on sugar beets, radish, potato and carrot plants. These results were similar to studies of insect mortality on the same plants, which showed that the majority of insects confined to bean and tomato plants had died within a week. There were also differences noticed in mortality on plants that were preferred for settling: insects were more likely to die on carrot plants as compared to beets, potato and radish. Experiments on oviposition also showed that the insects had a preference to lay eggs on beet, potato and radish plants where nymphs hatched from eggs and continued providing generations of beet leafhoppers. Carrot, bean and tomato plants were also rejected for oviposition by the insects where no eggs were laid on these plants. Even though bean and tomato plants proved to be in-hostile hosts for the beet leafhopper, research shows that the insects still transmit the BCTV to these plants. A major implication of this study is that it shows that plants which are inappropriate hosts of the beet leafhopper insect can also be transmitted with the Beet Curly Top Virus. The authors propose that these findings may suggest that the virus can be transmitted very quickly even after only a couple of hours of exposure to the insects.

The Lancer first flew in 1961 and production began in 1963. The Lancer seats two in a tandem configuration with dual flight controls; the pilot in command or student pilot normally occupies the front seat. Design and development The Lancer achieved its goal of being the least expensive American-built twin engine airplane. Other design goals included simplicity, ease of maintenance, low operating costs, and the ability to operate from rough or unimproved strips. The high wing and high engine position give good propeller clearance in achieving that last goal. The Lancer is of metal tube construction with fiberglass covering and has fixed landing gear and propellers. The Lancer was designed specifically for flight schools seeking an inexpensive way to train students for a multi-engine rating, a role in which the craft's modest performance and payload were anticipated to matter little. To increase its appeal to flight schools, the Lancer was equipped with a mock landing gear retraction switch that operates green ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and red ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù lights in the cockpit, allowing a student pilot to feign operation of imaginary \\"retractable\\" (it was permanently fixed) landing gear on takeoff and landing during instructional flights. In a peculiar combination, the front seat was equipped with a control yoke, while the rear-seat pilot had a centre stick. Both seats were equipped with engine controls mounted overhead, with solo flight being performed from the front seat. Braking was controlled with a lever on the right-hand side of the front-seat instrument panel; differential braking was not possible, and no brake controls were provided for the rear- seat pilot. Other features included single-slotted wing flaps with 4 adjustment positions, and pilot-adjustable trim tabs for the elevator and rudder; elevator trim was adjusted using a sidewall-mounted lever. The prototype Lancer underwent development between 1961 and the start of production in 1963. The changes included relocating the engine nacelles to their final position above the wing, strengthening the wings to accommodate the engines, and redesigning the empennage to provide for twin-engine control requirements. The Federal Aviation Administration type certificate was approved on 7 March 1963. =Flight characteristics= The Lancer's performance when flying on a single engine is notably poor; in a column for AOPA Pilot, author Barry Schiff summarized the airplane's single-engine performance by writing that \\"...it doesn‚Äôt have any\\". Since the Lancer's fixed-pitch propellers cannot be feathered in flight, the failed engine's propeller generally continues to windmill, creating prodigious drag and yaw. With the other engine delivering full power, the Lancer's advertised engine- out ceiling is only at standard temperature and pressure ‚Äì an altitude below ground level in many geographical areas, particularly once adverse density altitude conditions are taken into account. An engine-out situation typically results in a descent rate of about 250 ft/min (1.3 m/s), and the Lancer's single-engine, best-rate-of-climb speed VYSE‚Äìgenerally a gauge of engine-out climb performance for other airplanes‚Äìhas been characterized as actually being a \\"single-engine, least-rate-of-coming-down-speed.\\" Flying magazine noted that the craft could generally maintain altitude at or below and was reasonably easy to fly at airfield traffic pattern altitude on a single engine, but that an engine-out go-around would be potentially risky, and that a pilot is best advised \\"...to commit [himself or herself] to land‚Äìthen land\\". Criticisms of the Lancer are not limited to its single-engine performance or lack thereof. The engine nacelle placement hampers visibility, particularly for the rear- seat pilot, and for both pilots during banked turns. Schiff compares the engine nacelles to \\"...horse blinders that [result] in disorienting tunnel vision\\". The close proximity of the engines and propellers to the front-seat pilot's head create elevated noise levels described as \\"remarkable\\" or even \\"paralyzing\\". The sidewall-mounted elevator trim lever looks very similar to the throttle lever of the single-engine Aeronca Champion, but pushing the lever forward results in nose-down trim rather than increased engine power as in most Champion types; this creates a risk that an experienced Champion pilot may confuse the two controls when piloting the Lancer, with potentially catastrophic consequences if he/she instinctively pushes the lever fully forward to arrest an unwanted rate of descent. The wide vertical center bar in the windshield impairs the pilot's view of the runway on landing. With both engines functioning, the Lancer is relatively slow in cruise and exhibits a mediocre climb rate, particularly given its twin-engine layout and resultant higher operating costs compared to a single-engine airplane. Its lackluster performance is generally attributed to abundant form drag from the wing and tailplane struts and unusually large strut-braced fixed main landing gear legs, which are about in diameter and long. In most respects, the Lancer's flight performance is equal or slightly inferior to that of the popular Cessna 150, an airplane that uses a single O-200 engine rather than two.Simpson 1991, p. 96. Operational history The Champion Lancer prototype, sitting derelict at Arlington Municipal Airport, Arlington, Washington, United States, in 2017 Some flight schools initially viewed the Lancer's marginal single-engine performance favorably, as students trained in a Lancer found other twin-engine types comparatively easy to fly. However, sales were very limited; production began in 1963 and ended later in the same year with only 25 to 36 aircraft built. As of March 2019, the highest serial number of any 402 Lancer in the FAA aircraft registry was 25. As of 2018, FAA flight test standards require a pilot to demonstrate feathering a propeller during the practical test to obtain a multiengine rating; this effectively makes it impossible to complete the test in a Lancer with its fixed-pitch props. Despite the aircraft's drawbacks, Lancer ownership has been described as potentially attractive because it is \\"...an oddity and rarity of aviation...\\" and \\"Its appearance does attract and invite attention.\\" As of March 2019, nine Lancers remain on the FAA registry, the type certificate is held by American Champion, and the Lancer's ICAO aircraft type designator is CH40. The National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Database indicates that 12 accidents and incidents involving 9 individual Champion 402 aircraft occurred between 27 May 1964 and 27 July 1993 in the United States. The only fatal Lancer accident in the database occurred on 18 January 1970 in Tarentum, Pennsylvania after a fuel system fault caused both engines to fail; the subsequent off-airport forced landing substantially damaged the aircraft and killed the pilot and sole occupant. Of the 12 reported accidents and incidents, 4 involved single- engine operations.

In 1961, she won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance in the title role of Irma La Douce. Career Elizabeth Seal made her professional debut, as a dancer, at the age of 17 in Ivor Novello's musical Gay's the Word (1951) at the Saville Theatre. She then appeared in The Glorious Days (1953) with Anna Neagle, and the revue Cockles and Champagne (1954). Seal then shot to fame as 'Gladys' in the West End transfer of The Pajama Game by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross at the London Coliseum in 1955. For her performance Seal won the award for Most Promising Newcomer by the Variety Club of Great Britain. Whilst appearing in the show she made her film debut opposite John Mills, Alec McCowen and Charles Coburn in Town on Trial (1957), playing the role of 'Fiona'. She made her debut in straight theatre when Peter Hall chose her to play the role of 'Esmeralda' in Tennessee Williams' play Camino Real, alongside Denholm Elliott, Diana Wynyard, and Harry Andrews. Seal then took over the role of Lola in Damn Yankees from Belita at the London Coliseum. This brought her another award from the Variety Club of Great Britain as Best Actress. During the run she made the film Cone of Silence (1960) with George Sanders, Bernard Lee, and Michael Craig. Having seen Seal's performance in Damn Yankees theatre impresario Hugh 'Binkie' Beaumont wanted to find a starring vehicle for Seal and found it in Marguerite Monnot's French musical Irma La Douce. The show was directed in London by Peter Brook, and Seal played the title role opposite Keith Michell at the Lyric Theatre. Seal stayed with the show for two years, during which time she was seen by David Merrick, who waited for her to become available when he produced the Broadway production of the musical in 1960. During the Broadway run, she won the 1961 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. After some further American shows including A Shot In The Dark, Exiles by James Joyce, and several cabaret appearances, Seal left the stage for a number of years to raise a family. She returned to London in 1969 to appear in Beaumont's production of Cat Among The Pigeons directed by Jacques Charron of the Comedie Francais. A revival of Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds' musical Salad Days at the Duke of York's Theatre followed, and Seal later took over the role of 'Roxie Hart' in Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville (known today as Chicago The Musical) in the original London production, alongside Jenny Logan (who played Velma Kelly) in 1979. She returned once again to the Broadway stage in 1983 opposite Cicely Tyson in the revival of The Corn Is Green directed by ex brother-in-law, Vivian Matalon. To devote more time to her private life Seal turned to teaching. She devised and choreographed shows for the Guildford School of Acting and Central School of Speech and Drama, and choreographed La Traviata for Welsh National Opera. During this time she also completed her master's degree. After the death of her husband Michael Ward she returned to the stage in Ivor Novello's Gay's the Word in its first professional revival at the Finborough Theatre, and stayed with the show for its transfer to Jermyn Street Theatre in 2013. She continues an active schedule as archivist to Michael Ward's photographic estate and library. Personal life Seal has been married three times. Her first husband was advertising copywriter Peter Townsend, and second was actor, singer, writer and director Zack Matalon, with whom she had three children. Their eldest son Adam Matalon, based in Los Angeles, is a showrunner/creator and writes, directs and produces for TV; Writer, poet and songwriter Sarah Matalon-Levy is married and lives in Paris; their youngest son, Noah Matalon, lives and works in New York as a capital projects consultant and in property development. She married photographer/former actor Michael Ward in 1976, and is stepmother to his two daughters Sam Ward and Tasha Clavel. Since Ward's death in 2011 Seal has promoted his work for exhibitions and publishing.

He created the OutWest type in 1993. His work is held in the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, the Brauer Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. He is the recipient of the 2007 AIGA Medal. He is also the recipient of the Chrysler Award in 1997. Curt Cloninger called Fella as \\"the contemporary master of hand-drawn typography.\\" He created the OutWest typeface. He designed it by hand. It has a 15-degree ellipse. His hand design style has been described as \\"American folk art typography\\". His style and work has influenced designers like Lorraine Wild, P. Scott Makela, Jeffrey Keedy, Elliott Earls and Barry Deck. Early life and education Edward Fella was born in Detroit, MI in 1938 to a middle-class family and attended Cass Technical High School, a magnet school in Detroit where he studied lettering, illustration, paste-up and other commercial-art techniques. He graduated from Cass tech in 1957 and from then he went into the commercial graphic industry.  Career  thumbEdward Fella started out his career being a commercial artist for 30 years from 1957 to 1987. Most of the works he created during this time were automotive and health care posters. According to this article, his first job right after he finished high school was as an apprentice at Phoenix studio, it was his first job in the commercial space. His day to day work during his time as a commercial artist was drawing headlines and layouts which helped refine his style and skills. His illustrations were reflective of the trends of the time, while the typography he used was ironic to commercial art deco type. Fella explored many different types of techniques that helped him through his career in design such as found typography, scribbles, brush writing, typesetting, rubdown letters, public domain clip art, stencils and much more. Fella was given the name \\"the king of zing\\" because of his whimsical illustration style he had. During the 60's and 70's Fella felt that his commercial work was not enough for him and started to become very active in Detroit's culture scene. He offered his services to some alternative art institutions. He also became the designer for the Detroit Focus gallery. While there he created dozens of event posters and directed the Detroit Focus Quarterly. These types of assignments gave Fella the push to print the kind of experimental and crazy designs that he was doing in private. Fella used a positive photostat machine and made collages with images and type that had been readily available. One of Fella's main creative outlet was his after the fact posters. These posters were made to give to those attending events, he made a small number of posters to give to people that attended the event instead of having to make a bunch of posters for only a small number of people to see and come to the event. He made these posters for lectures and for appearances he made. Since he made the posters for people that came to the event he had more creative freedom because he did not have to make it appeal to a commercial audience. The posters also helped him to continue expanding his body of work. In 1985 Fella retired from the commercial industry and decided to go back to school and enrolled in Cranbrook Academy of Art. After his time as a commercial artist he went to study at the Center for Creative Studies (now the College for Creative Studies) and graduated from there in 1985 and then after that Fella went to the Cranbrook Academy of Art and graduated from there in 1987. While in Cranbrook, Fella was able to pursue his exploration of design and helped him refine his craft and combined his new creative work with his 30 years of experience as a commercial artist. After graduating from Cranbrook, Fella was hired to teach at California institute of the Arts by Lorraine Wild in 1987. Fella gave his last lecture at CalArts on April 15, 2013. While Studying at Cranbrook, Fella had the freedom to continue and concentrate on his artistic exploration and experimental designs. Fella's work developed into a very elaborate pseudo-anarchic designs. This was very different from any thing that was being made at the time. His designs impacted and influenced a new era of designers who wanted to make a claim in the design world because of this Fella gained a huge following by the time he was fifty and became a controversial new designer. Fella was given the title of \\"Graphic godfather\\" by Emigre magazine. Style Edward Fella was known to break every rule in typography and design. He had a style that was unique to him at the time it was slightly based on the theory of deconstruction, but he took that and pushed it even further. He distorted a style of sanserif with his own hand writing with various thicknesses, curves, and tails to each character so that each one is different from the one before. Fella is one of the most extreme example of a typographer who is able to achieve the same creative freedom as the painters and sculptors he promoted in catalogs and posters. When Fella started making hand-hewn typography, he mirrored earlier \\"words in freedom\\" produced by Dadaist, Surrealist, and Futurist. Fella has created two typefaces Outwest and Fella parts these typefaces show his eccentric and creative style. These typefaces both had a huge impact for being quirky and different. Outwest type looks like cactus wearing cowboy hats and Fella parts looks like a mix of comic sans and dingbat fonts. He distributes these font through Emigre fonts and even thought these fonts are crazy and over the top they were still adapted to mainstream designs. Historical Influence Throughout his career, Fella has helped and influenced designers with his designs. He started helping designers when he would visit Cranbrook as a guest critic before he became a student and continued even after he became a student. After graduating, he joined Cal Arts where he taught design and helped influence the new generation of designers. An example of someone he influenced is Jeffery Keedy, Keedy made a typeface called keedysans and has similarity's to Fella's style with inconsistent spacing and the characters were rounded and sometimes sliced. Also Barry Deck, a graduate from cal arts, creator of the iconic typeface template gothic, which was influenced by Fella ; Deck even says that he made it intentionally imperfect to show the imperfect language of an imperfect world. Decks typeface became one of the most important typefaces of the decade. Fella made many sketch books and collages that helped inspire many Cranbook students to break the barriers of visual design like Fella did. Works Fella's work is largely an intervention in how it mixes high art and contemporary culture to produce unique art. According to Lorraine Wild, a 2006 AIGA medalist: :‚ÄúEd's work marks a sea change in graphic design,‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe introduced ambivalence and ambiguity, the multiple meanings of design as text and subtext, and that graphic designers are really artists.

The initial contract to build the satellite was signed in 2004. It became the third African geosynchronous communication satellite, when it was launched at 16:01 UTC on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by Nigerian Communications Satellite Ltd (NIGCOMSAT). On November 11, 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power due to an anomaly in its solar array. Launch The satellite, which is the third Nigerian satellite to be placed into orbit, was launched into a geosynchronous transfer orbit and subsequently it was successfully inserted into a geosynchronous orbit, positioned at 42.5oE. It had a launch mass of 5,150 kg, and had an expected service life of 15 years. Specifications It was based on the Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: *4 C band *14 *8 *2 L band Its design was to provide coverage to many parts of Africa on C-band and Ku-band, a global navigation beam on L-band and the Ka-band transponders with spot beams over Nigeria, South Africa and Europe. China's satellite export business NigcomSat-1 represented a milestone for China's satellite export business. For the first time the China Great Wall Industry Corporation provided all aspects of in-orbit delivery of a satellite to an international customer. This included satellite manufacture, launch services, ground station construction, project financing, insurance and training. Failure and replacement On 10 November 2008 (0900 UTC), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites. According to Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited, it was put into \\"emergency mode operation in order to effect mitigation and repairs\\". The satellite eventually failed after losing power on 11 November 2008. On March 24, 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, NigComSat Ltd. and CGWIC signed a further contract for the in-orbit delivery of the NigComSat-1R satellite. NigComSat-1R also uses the DFH-4 satellite platform with improvements over the previous satellite, and was delivered in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a replacement for the failed NigComSat-1.

It probably dates from 1565‚Äì6, during the reign of his employer Cosimo I de' Medici. Lost for more than 400 years, it was recently rediscovered in Paris. Most of the mass is for five separate choirs of 8 voices each, with the closing Agnus Dei being for five separate choirs of 12 voices each; all of the voice parts are fully independent. With its huge polychoral forces, climaxing on sixty fully independent parts, it is the largest known polyphonic composition from the entire era. Background Francesco I de' Medici, Striggio's correspondent regarding his Mass setting during his diplomatic journey. Portrait by Agnolo Bronzino.The court of the Medici was long known for its patronage of the arts, including music, and the Medici rulers, from Lorenzo the Magnificent to Cosimo I de' Medici, were particularly noted for their love of music. Keenly aware that their status depended on not only employing the most talented artists and musicians, but having them create spectacular works and having them disseminated, they encouraged composers to write music which exceeded that of their contemporaries in size and scope.Moroney, pp. 4-5 During the 1530s and 1540s, Francesco Corteccia, who was the principal composer for the first part of Cosimo's reign, wrote series of elaborate intermedii‚Äîgroups of madrigals designed to be performed between the acts of plays, sung by actors in costume and accompanied by instruments. This musical form was one of the predecessors of opera.Nutter, Grove online In the realm of sacred music, the desire of the Medici for opulence was no less. Instead of decorating plays with madrigals interspersed between the acts, however, the Medici's court composer ‚Äì who was Striggio by the 1560s ‚Äì chose to create works for larger groups of voices than had been attempted before, and to accompany these already massive vocal forces with instruments.Fenlon, Grove online His first attempt was apparently the Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno, and some time later he followed this with a 40-voice motet setting, Ecce beatam lucem, a piece which has long been known. Some other gigantic polychoral works from the same time include Thomas Tallis's famous and often-performed Spem in alium nunquam habui, for 40 voices, which may have been a response to hearing either the motet or the Mass in 1567; Stefano Rossetto's 50-voice motet Consolamini popule meus; and Cristofano Malvezzi's 30-voice intermedio for another Medici marriage, O fortunato giorno. Both Rossetto and Malvezzi were associated with the Medici court. Preceding these works was a 40-voice motet produced in Munich in 1564 by Orlande de Lassus, which has been lost.Moroney, p. 53 When Striggio completed the enormous mass setting, he carried it with him during a diplomatic trip across Europe to strengthen the dynastic relation brought on by the recent marriage of Francesco de' Medici to Johanna of Austria, who was a Habsburg. His trip consisted of a series of visits to new Medici in-laws, including Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. It was necessary to give them something splendid, and this was likely a performance of the colossal 40 and 60 voice mass, along with a copy for their archives. Leaving Florence in December 1566, he visited Mantua, and then made the difficult winter trek over the Brenner Pass, visiting Vienna, Brno, Munich, and Paris. In June 1567 he made his way to London with the specific purpose of meeting \\"the virtuosos in the profession of music that were there\\" (as he wrote in a letter to Francesco I de' Medici, dated 18 May 1567). While in England, he almost certainly met Thomas Tallis, and it is now considered likely that the Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno was performed in a private residence ‚Äì likely the London seat of the Earl of Arundel, Arundel House ‚Äì in order not to offend the authorities (since performance of the Roman Catholic Mass was at that time prohibited in Protestant England).Moroney, pp. 17‚Äì19, p. 30-33 =Loss and recovery= After Striggio's exhausting 1567 European tour with his work, it disappeared for more than four centuries. While he left copies of it at several locations he visited ‚Äì the court of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, the court of Albrecht V in Munich, the court of Charles IX of France ‚Äì all copies had been lost. However, a copy of the mass was made in the early 17th century in France, presumably from the copy Striggio left in Paris for Charles IX. Because of several corruptions and copyist errors both on the manuscript and in the card catalogue, when the enormous document, which had been transferred to Louis XV in 1726, from the library of composer S√©bastien de Brossard, and then passed to the Paris Biblioth√®que nationale, the mass was attributed to an \\"Alessandro Strusco\\" and the \\"40 voices\\" had been amended to \\"4 voices\\" (presumably the copyist thought the \\"40\\" was in error, and removed the extra zero).Moroney, p. 55-62 Davitt Moroney claims that it was only in July 2005 that he recovered and identified the work.Moroney, p. 3 What was subsequently publicised as its first performance in modern times was on 17 July 2007 at a Proms concert in Royal Albert Hall in London, where it was sung by the BBC Singers and Tallis Scholars, with His Majestys Sagbutts & Cornetts, conducted by Moroney. However, the website of the Spanish record company Glossa states that their recording of the work uses an edition made in 1978 by French counter-tenor Dominique Visse. It is not stated there whether Visse identified the piece as being by Striggio, or whether he performed it, at that time. In 2011 what was claimed as the \\"World premiere recording\\" of the Mass had been issued by Decca; it is performed by I Fagiolini under the direction of Robert Hollingworth. A third CD recording, by Moroney himself, has not yet been issued. Music Unlike the massive polychoral compositions of the Venetian School, in which performance groupings were positioned in lofts across from each other in a large space, the choirs in Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno were probably not meant to be significantly spatially separated. Although Striggio left no performance directions, the most likely arrangement was for the singers to be positioned in a large semicircle, with the instrumentalists in its center, in view of the singers.Moroney, p. 42-3 The exact instruments used, and their number, is not known, but probably varied from performance to performance. An unusual feature of the mass is the existence of two partbooks for a Bassus ad organum, a part which doubles the composite bass line of the entire composition. Presumably Striggio used this as a compositional tool, to keep track of the harmonies as he wrote forty to sixty voice parts above it; it also foreshadowed the development of the basso continuo in the 17th century.Moroney, p. 52-53 The Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno is probably a parody mass, i.e. one based on a pre-existing polyphonic work, in this case named \\"Ecco s√¨ beato giorno\\". However, no song of this name has yet been found: it may be a lost work of Striggio himself, or may even be a reference to his similarly titled 40-voice motet Ecce beatam lucem. The repetition of musical phrases at certain key points in the Mass suggests use of the parody technique, but it has also been suggested that parts of the mass are contrafacta ‚Äì music originally written with different words.Moroney, p. 33-38 Like most settings of the Ordinary of the Mass, the work is in five major divisions: # Kyrie # Gloria # Credo # Sanctus ‚Äì Benedictus # Agnus Dei Striggio saves the full complement of 40 and 60 voices for climactic sections. The opening \\"Kyrie Eleison\\" begins with only one choir of eight voices; the \\"Christe Eleison\\" uses two choirs, totalling 16 voices; and the return of the \\"Kyrie\\" brings in yet another choir, totalling 24. The full 40 voices sing together for the first time in the \\"Gloria\\", at the words Glorificamus te (we glorify Thee), presenting the work's first climax.Moroney, p. 33-34 Textural contrasts abound. The \\"Credo\\", typically the longest section of any mass setting, uses 40 voices in many places, but intersperses many passages for smaller units. Sections of the mass which normally have a fuller, more exuberant musical setting, such as the \\"Et Resurrexit\\" (and He was resurrected) have all 40 voices, while those which more sedate or sorrowful, for example the \\"Crucifixus\\", have the smallest groupings (in this case, only eight voices of one choir sing).Moroney, p. 40 The closing \\"Agnus Dei\\", with 60 voices in five groups of 12, has more independent parts than any other polyphonic composition of the Renaissance. It begins with all sixty voices entering, one after another, in imitation; once they have all entered, they all sing until the end of the piece, forming a climax to the entire work.Moroney, p. 45 Influence The enormous work impressed many of its listeners, beginning in Munich, where Orlande de Lassus was in attendance; the event was similar to one a year later, described by Massimo Troiano, in which another Striggio piece for 40 voices was heard. After Munich, the piece was performed in Paris, at the house of Luigi Ludovico Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers, and then it was performed in England, where it was heard by English composer Thomas Tallis. Only Tallis, however, seems to have been inspired to match or out-do it, with his 40-voice Spem in alium. In this motet, the singers were probably arranged in a full circle around the listeners. The imitation pattern that begins Spem in alium is the same as that which begins this closing Agnus Dei in the Striggio mass, which has been seen as evidence that it was indeed this piece which Tallis heard in London in 1567.Moroney, p. 28-33 Recordings A commercial recording featuring voices and period instruments was released by the British ensemble I Fagiolini in March 2011.

In the 1980s, Dr. Blaisdell discovered the term Kanaka Maoli, in Historical Text. He was the first to ask the questions: if one compares original historic descriptions of Hawaiians (robust health) with current statistics (ill health), what is it about western contact other than the obvious that explains near extinction of a race? More importantly, what can be done? After this, he began to pioneer serious study of Kanaka Maoli Health Research as a medical field. Na 'Oiwi O Hawaii. In 1984, Blaisdell helped to found Na 'Oiwi O Hawai'i with the goal of promoting Kanaka Maoli Independence. Na 'Oiwi O Hawai'i sponsored the first Native Hawaiian Sovereignty Conference at The Kamehameha Schools. As a major speaker, Blaisdell emphasized that the health of Kanaka Maoli is connected to the 'ƒÅina, and to preservation of cultural traditions and knowledge of one's own history and way of life. (This later became the basis for an M. Oneha dissertation, which Blaisdell nurtured and supported.)3,5 NƒÅ Pu'uwai. In 1986, Blaisdell joined the board of Na Pu'uwai, a Native Hawaiian Health Care organization of the island of Moloka'i, with Emmett Aluli and Helen O'Connor. Na Pu'uwai became the Moloka'i-Lana'i Native Health Care System and conducted a study that demonstrated that the traditional Kanaka Maoli diet lowered blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, thereby reducing risk for heart disease. (This later became the basis for the Waianae diet, popularized by T Shintani.) This study intensified interest in growing and eating traditional foods throughout the islands and invigorated the organization of health fairs in Kanaka Maoli communities to revitalize preparation and propagation of foods and other traditional medicines and healing practices. It was also one of the first studies on Kanaka Maoli health conducted largely by Kanaka Maoli themselves.3 Director, Center for Hawaiian Studies, University of Hawai'i at Manoa. Blaisdell served as Interim Director from 1987-1988. Blaisdell served on the Dissertation committees for nearly a dozen Native Hawaiian PhD candidates, including Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa and Kamana'opono Crabbe. He has helped numerous candidates write PhD papers, including Malcolm Chun.1,2,5 ''' E Ola Mau and Papa Ola Lokahi. Blaisdell was a pioneer in advocating for accessible and culturally appropriate healthcare for Native Hawaiians. He provided dramatic documentation of worsening Kanaka Maoli health conditions. After authoring the critical health report for the United States Congress Native Hawaiians Study Commission in 1983, he researched and wrote a compelling report identifying the health needs of Native Hawaiians entitled \\"E Ola Mau.\\" The report was funded by the US Public Health Services and presented at the East-West Center in December 1985. The following year, E Ola Mau became an organization of Native Hawaiian Health professionals formed to implement the recommendations of the report. Blaisdell was among members of E Ola Mau who testified for the Native Hawaiian Health Bill before the US Congress in 1986, 1987 and 1988. The bill was passed in October 1988 with final language provided by members of EOM to establish five Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems on five islands. The bill specified that traditional practices be integrated with services offering western health practices. The organization Papa Ola Lokahi (POL) was formed to provide coordination and oversight. Sovereignty Movement. Blaisdell credits Puhipau Ahmad and Soli Niheu for inviting him to help start the Sovereignty Movement in the 1960s. Ahmad (Na Maka O Ka Aina) became the \\"eyes\\" of the movement, documenting evictions of Native Hawaiians from their homes at Sand Island and elsewhere. Niheu was the \\"heart\\" of the movement, participating in demonstrations, and Blaisdell became the \\"brains,\\" researching and writing. It was Blaisdell who, with his own computer, copying machine, and checkbook, created the Native Hawaiian Tribunal, in which Blaisdell gathered an international panel of judges, flew the judges from island to island and asked Native Hawaiians on each island to testify as to how they had been affected by the overthrow of the monarchy, by annexation, and by statehood. Disposition of the tribunal documents are now under dispute. Blaisdell has specified to his attorney specifically where he would like them to reside.

He is considered one of the most important Angolan poets of his time. He wrote poems in Portuguese and Angolan languages. He took part in the fight to free Angola from Portuguese rule. Political work Cruz was educated in Luanda, the capital of Angola, which was then ruled by Portugal. Between 1948 and 1952, Viriato da Cruz involved himself in Luanda's political and literary spheres, becoming part of the Association of the Native Sons of Angola. In 1948, he helped found the Movement of the New Intellectuals of Angola. On September 30, 1957, Viriato da Cruz left for Lisbon, with the hopes of recruiting advice and support from the Partido Comunista Portugu√©s (PCP). His call for help went unanswered by the PCP. He was, however, successful in encouraging opposition to the colonial system among Angolans living in Lisbon. Afterwards, Viriato da Cruz went to Paris to link up with other Angolan and African immigrants. Among them was M√°rio Pinto de Andrade, another Angolan poet and politician, who helped with his political ideas. An important result of this meeting was the creation of the Anticolonial Movement, a unitarian and anticolonial collective consisting of all of the African nationalists in Europe, and the first of its kind. In 1956, Viriato da Cruz, as well as de Andrarde helped create the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA‚Äîfrom the Portuguese name Movimento Popular de Liberta√ß√£o de Angola). The MPLA was not in Angola at this time, but was first in Conakry (the capital of Guinea) and then later in Leopoldville, Congo (now Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC). Cruz became secretary-general of the MPLA. After some time he and others did not agree with the party leadership, in particular with president Agostinho Neto, and this led to fighting in the streets of Leopoldville. Exiled in China In the 1960s, following the fighting in the MPLA, Viriato da Cruz went to Beijing, China, where he was well known as having helped create the MPLA. At first, the Chinese government welcomed him, since he wanted to help them bring Maoist- inspired revolution to Africa. Cruz's ideas about Soviet social-imperialism were the same as those of the Maoists: he believed in the Maoist tenet that stronger countries could not impose a socialist revolution on other places ‚Äî as opposed to the pro-Soviet MPLA under Agostinho Neto ‚Äî and he would not change his ideas. Cruz wanted to leave China and return to Africa, but the Chinese government would not allow him to go, since his life was at risk as he would be subjected to persecution by the Pro-Soviet government in Angola. Last years The last years of his life were unhappy and difficult. Cruz was weak and without much food, and he died on 13 June 1973. His body was taken away in a military vehicle and was buried without ceremony. Poetry work In 1961, Casa dos Estudantes do Imp√©rio published all of Viriato da Cruz's poetic writings in the collection Poemas. Among these poems, \\"Namoro\\" (Courtship), \\"S√¥ Santo\\" (Holy One) and \\"Mak√©zu\\" (Kola Nut) are well-known. In poems such as \\"Mam√£e negra (Canto de esperan√ßa)\\", Viriato da Cruz explore themes of black African identity, and the symbol of \\"Mother Africa\\".

Kai Johansen began his football career in the small club of Korsl√∏kke before moving to Boldklubben 1909 in Odense as a striker. However, he was not successful, and moved to another of the major clubs in the city, Odense Boldklub. Here he found his natural place as a right full back and soon attracted attention from the Danish national manager. Johansen made his debut as a member of the Danish national football team on 11 June 1962 against Hungary. The following year and a half he played 20 national matches. After attracting international interest, Johansen was the first of a number of Scandinavian players signed by Greenock Morton in 1964. The following year, Johansen signed for Rangers on 24 June 1965 for ¬£20,000 after impressing manager Scot Symon with his performance for a European Select side against a UK Select in Stanley Matthews' testimonial. Johansen is best remembered for his goal in the 1966 Scottish Cup final. After a 0‚Äì0 draw against rivals Celtic, he scored a 25‚Äìyard goal to seal a 1‚Äì0 win for Rangers. He was the first ever foreign player to score in a Scottish Cup final. This cup victory earned Rangers qualification to the following season's Cup Winner's Cup and they reached the final for the second time in their history, only to lose against Bayern Munich. Johansen featured throughout the run to the final, including scoring a goal in the 2‚Äì1 first leg win against Borussia Dortmund, the holders, who Rangers knocked out of the tournament. Becoming a professional footballer excluded Johansen from the national team, which at the time entirely consisted of amateurs. He undoubtedly would have had many more caps without this rule. He retired in 1970 and returned to a career as a store owner. Before his career in Scotland, he had established a men's wear store in Odense. He also ran pubs in Glasgow and on the Costa del Sol, before becoming a player's agent. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and died on 13 May 2007. His death was marked with a minute's silence before Rangers' match against Kilmarnock that day.

Dannhauer began his education in the gymnasium at Strasburg and was the master of a thorough philosophical training before he commenced his theological work in 1624. He continued his studies at Marburg, Altorf, and Jena, lecturing at the same time on philosophy and linguistics and winning recognition at Jena by his exegesis of the Epistle to the Ephesians. Returning to Strasburg in 1628, he entered upon an active career as administrator, teacher, and theologian. Made seminary inspector in 1628, he became in the following year professor of oratory, and in 1633 professor of theology, pastor of the cathedral, and president of the ecclesiastical assembly. Although the judgment of his contemporaries, Bebel, Spener, and others, placed him in the front rank of the theologians of the time, Dannhauer has received scant justice at the hands of posterity. The influence exerted upon Spener by his teacher must not be underestimated because of the formal tone of the poem dedicated by the founder of the Pietists to his teacher's memory. Their relations were certainly not characterized by the warmth of personal friendship, but were rather in the nature of an intercourse based on common interests. Dannhauer ordained Spener, and in all probability secured for him the post of private tutor at the court of the elector palatine. Spener, in return, seems to have been connected with the preparation of the second edition of the Hodosophia for the press and to have acted as critic of another work of Dannhauer's which has not yet been identified. The estrangement between the two was apparently caused by Dannhauer's nephew, Balthasar Bebel, who was in control of the theological faculty at Strasburg at the time of the publication of Spener's Pia desideria. Dannhauer was a prolific writer, his principal works being as follows: Hodosophia christiana sine theologia positiva (1649); Katechismusmilch oder Erkl√§rung des kirchlichen Katechismus (1657‚Äì78) and Liber conscientiae apertus sive theologia conscientiaria (1662‚Äì67).

History A parish of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, the American branch of the Ruthenian Catholic Church, Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church was founded by Rusyn immigrants on Pentecost Sunday, May 18, 1902. The Rev. John Korotnoki, who came to the United States from the Eparchy of Presov, Austria-Hungary (now in eastern Slovakia) was its first pastor. Originally located on Doerr Street in Woods Run, new property was acquired in 1921 for relocation. However, in 1925 the interior of that church was damaged by fire, prompting the current church to be built on Superior Avenue in 1927. It was dedicated in 1928. A Social Center/Educational building was built nearby in 1971. In 1975 Holy Ghost became the mother church of St. Andrew the Apostle Byzantine Catholic Church in the north suburb of Gibsonia.

The resulting T40 combined two Allison T38-A-1 power sections side-by- side with a common reduction gearbox powering contra-rotating propellers. Similar in layout to the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba, the T40 differed in that each engine drove both the forward and the rear propellers, unlike the Double Mamba, where each Mamba power section drove either the front or the rear propeller separately. The T38-A-1 power sections each contained 17-stage compressors giving a pressure ratio of 6.3:1, eight combustion chambers, and four-stage turbines. A combining reduction gearbox was driven via extension shafts from the power sections. Each transmission shaft incorporated a clutch to allow the power sections to be run independently. XP5Y-1 prototype in 1950 Accessories included a Master Control Unit, mounted above the compressors, and an air driven starter on the gearbox. The compound reduction gear had an overall reduction ratio of 15.75:1 and incorporated an airscrew brake to prevent windmilling when the engine was stopped. Anti-icing for the air intakes was supplied by compressor bleed air. The contra-rotating propeller consisted of two three-bladed Aeroproducts propellers fitted to concentric shafts. Testing of the XT40 began on 4 June 1948, revealing some major vibration problems from the reduction gearbox due to mis-matched noise frequencies caused by poorly designed gear teeth. The de-coupling system, designed to disconnect a power section in the event of failure worked successfully. During a run in a test cell one power section developed a major oil leak and an attempt to shut it down failed because the engine carried on running on the leaking oil. After many attempts to shut it down the offending power section could only be shut down by destroying the compressor with buckets of nuts and bolts thrown down the intake, proving the de-coupling system. First flight test of the T40 was in the Convair XP5Y flying boat on 18 April 1950 fitted with four T40-A-4 developing . Service use of the T40 revealed problems with integrity of the propellers and gearboxes with at least one instance each of a propeller breaking free and a gearbox separation. One unusual problem was discovered during ground running of the Republic XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop powered fighter; the special transonic 3-bladed single propeller set up harmonics that proved to be harmful to humans within a certain distance from the aircraft. The major problems of the T40 were its fragile gearbox, and the propeller control system which used 25 vacuum tubes, and was far from reliable. As the individual power plants were clutched into the gearbox, it was intended in most instances that the aircraft could cruise on one half of the engine and only engage the second power-section when there was need. In practice the system did not work well. Failure to recognize that one of the T38s had failed, and its compressor was devouring power produced by the other section, led to the loss of the first prototype Douglas XA2D-1 and its pilot on 14 December 1950. Operational history The first aircraft to fly with the T40 was the Convair XP5Y-1 patrol aircraft prototype. As flying boat patrol aircraft became redundant, the US Navy changed the role of the aircraft from Anti-Submarine Warfare to Transport. Modifications to the XP5Y-1 (such as provision of air conditioning and pressurisation) produced the Convair R3Y Tradewind, which was to become the only aircraft using the T40 to actually enter service. These large four-engined flying boats served primarily between NAS Alameda and Hawaii during the mid-1950s, (replacing the Martin Mars flying boats). There were numerous problems with the T40s. One resulted in near disaster in 1956, when an R3Y managed to land with a runaway engine, resulting in a collision with a seawall. This event gave the US Navy one more reason to ground the R3Y, which it did soon after. The only other aircraft to be produced in any quantity to be powered by the T40 was the Douglas A2D-1 Skyshark. Of the sixteen examples built, the twelve used for evaluation suffered similar problems to the R3Y. Propeller control problems and gearbox failures were among the more common problems. The T40 was also fitted to the North American A2J-1 Super Savage but the poor performance of the aircraft and continuing difficulties with the engines forced cancellation in favour of the Douglas A3D Skywarrior. The most notable successes of the T40 were in the field of vertical take-off aircraft, being used to power three different types, the Convair XFY-1 Pogo, Lockheed XFV-1 and the Hiller X-18 tilt-wing research aircraft. Fitted with the more powerful 7,100shp YT40-A-6 the XFY-1 flew the first full flight from vertical take-off to horizontal flight and back to vertical flight for landing, of a fixed wing aircraft, in November 1954. Continuing concerns over propellers and the poor payload and performance precluded further development. Some flying was carried out with the Hiller X-18 but most research was carried out with the aircraft attached firmly to a force measuring platform, that could be raised hydraulically, to gather data on ground cushion effects. Limited flying was carried out by the two Republic XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop fighter aircraft, but the continuing difficulties with the T40 engine, supersonic propeller, not to mention performance completely overshadowed by contemporary rivals led to cancellation of production plans.

At the end of the operation Iran had captured a small amount of territory from the Iraqis. Units of Iraq's 1st Corps spent two months in their trenches waiting for the Iranians to attack. The offensive began on the 19 October 1983 and the Iranians and Peshmerga guerrillas of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan conquered about of territory. This included exerted a significant amount of pressure on Penjwen. Saddam Hussein responded with a counterattack, using the Iraqi Republican Guard and poison gas. However, they failed to dislodge the Iranians, who were dug-in and reinforced by Kurdish fighters. The battle The focus of the fourth Dawn operation in October 1983 was the northern sector in Iranian Kurdistan. Three Iranian regular divisions, the Revolutionary Guard, and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) elements amassed in Marivan and Sardasht in a move to threaten the major Iraqi city Suleimaniyah. Iran's strategy was to press Kurdish tribes to occupy the Banjuin Valley, which was within 45 km (28 mi) of Suleimaniyah and 140 km (87 mi) from the oilfields of Kirkuk. To stem the tide, Iraq deployed Mi-8 helicopters equipped with chemical weapons and executed 120 sorties against the Iranian force, which stopped them 15 km (9.3 mi) into Iraqi territory. 5,000 Iranians and 18,000 Iraqis were killed & wounded. Iran gained 110 km¬≤ (42 sq mi) of its territory back in the north, gained 15 km¬≤ (5.8 sq mi) of Iraqi land, and captured 785 Iraqi prisoners while Iraq abandoned large quantities of valuable weapons and war materiel in the field. Iraq responded to these losses by firing a series of SCUD-B missiles into the cities of Dezful, Masjid Suleiman, and Behbehan, while the Iraqi naval aircraft mined the port of Bandar Khomeini. Iran's use of artillery against Basra while the battles in the north raged created multiple fronts, which effectively confused and wore down Iraq. Aftermath The attack was successful but the Iranians suffered high casualties due to Iraqi gas attacks. Unlike other operations and battles of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, environmental conditions and operative restrictions were of high significance for this operation. Also the military medicine organization of the Pasdaran was important in this battle; they used special methods to save the wounded and carried out rescue operations. However, in response to this victory, the Iraqis launched the first Scud missiles into Iran, hitting six cities.

Early life Pond was born on January 19, 1873, in East Saugus, Massachusetts, to Abbott Sequard Pond and Ellen (Stocker) Pond. He was named after his uncle, Dr. Erasmus Arlington Pond. By the time he was in grammar school his family had moved to Rutland, Vermont, where his father sold surgical equipment for the Pond Sphygmograph Company. College On September 13, 1888, Pond entered Norwich University. He pitched for and captained the school's baseball team. He was also a musician in the Corps of Cadets. In 1890 he transferred to the University of Vermont. There, Pond, in addition to playing baseball, was a member of the glee and banjo clubs. During his senior year, he also played varsity football. During his first year on the Vermont baseball team, Pond played center field. The team finished the season with a record of 19-6, which was the best in the school's history. The following year Pond alternated at pitcher with Bert Abbey. In a game against Yale, Pond pitched a no-hitter. In 1893 Vermont was invited by Amos Alonzo Stagg to play in an eight-team double-elimination college baseball tournament at the Chicago World's Fair. Although Vermont did not win the tournament, the small school was the only team to defeat the eventual champion, Yale. Pond graduated from the University of Vermont in 1893, but enrolled in the school's College of Medicine, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team for one more season. Baseball career After he graduated from the University of Vermont College of Medicine in 1895, Pond enrolled in a post-graduate surgical course at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Baltimore. Baltimore Orioles manager Ned Hanlon convinced Pond to spend his summers with the team. He signed his first major league contract on June 23, 1895, and made his major league debut on July 4, 1895. Although he pitched only in six games that season, the 23-year-old rookie found other ways to make himself useful, including serving as team doctor. After one game, The Baltimore Sun reported \\"Dr. Pond is suffering from a small abscess in his left hand, which he lanced himself.\\" In 1896, Pond started 26 games, in which he compiled a 16-8 with a 3.49 ERA. The Orioles finished the season with the best record in the National League and swept the Cleveland Spiders to win the Temple Cup (Pond did not pitch in the series). In 1897, Hanlon became the first manager to use a four-man starting rotation, which consisted of Pond, Bill Hoffer, Joe Corbett, and Jerry Nops. Pond started 28 games and finished with a career-best record of 18-9 and a 3.52 ERA. During the 1898 season, Pond pitched sparingly. Poor attendance in Baltimore meant that team had to reduce expenses. As a result, Pond was released on June 13, 1898. He was later re- signed by the Orioles and pitched a five-hit shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies. However, Pond could not remain with the team because on July 5, 1898, he had received an appointment as acting assistant surgeon of the United States Army and was ordered to report to Fort Myer the following Saturday. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Pond wanted to return to baseball. In February 1900, he wrote a letter to his old teammate John McGraw, who had taken over as manager of the Orioles, expressing his desire to return to the game. However, Pond would never appear in another major league game. In 1902, while in stationed in Malabon, Pond served as manager of the all-black 25th Infantry Regiment's baseball team. Medical career While in Baltimore, Pond took post-graduate courses at Johns Hopkins University, performed his residency at St. Joseph's Hospital and interned at Baltimore City Hospital. On July 5, 1898, Pond was appointed an acting assistant surgeon of the United States Army. He was sent to the Philippines with the 10th Pennsylvania Regiment. The United States Senate's decision to keep the Philippines as an American colony resulted in a guerilla war with the Filipino nationalists who had been fighting the Spaniards. When his regiment returned to the United States, Pond was ordered to stay in the Philippines with a regiment from Colorado. Pond was later assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. On July 2, 1900, Pond married Elizabeth Gambrill in Rutland. By 1902, the United States had suppressed the efforts of the Filipino nationalists. The United States Government in the Philippines, led by Governor-General William Howard Taft, then began working on to stop the spread of disease on the islands, including bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, and leprosy. Pond and his wife remained in the Philippines to assist in this effort. On August 11, 1902, Pond was detailed from the Army to the Philippine Board of Health for cholera duty. In July 1903 he accepted a permanent position as medical inspector, where he helped in the cleanup of Manila City and the collection and segregation of lepers. In 1906 he was appointed first chief of the Southern Islands Hospital, 400 miles south of Manila on the island of Cebu. In Cebu, Pond also founded a hospital for lepers and vaccinated the island's entire population. He also became a social leader of Cebu's American community and helped popularize baseball on the island. When World War I broke out, Pond received a commission as a major in the Army Medical Corps and assigned to the Medical Officers' Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison. He was preparing to go to France in July 1917 when Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison, asked that Pond be allowed return to the Philippines. Pond was moved to Camp Stotsenburg, where he was assigned to the 9th Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Philippine Artillery Regiment. In August 1918 he was named post surgeon of the Cuartel de Espana and placed in charge of the dispensary at Fort Santiago in Manilla. On October 28, 1918, Pond reported for duty on the USS Warren, a transport bound for Vladivostock. The Warren arrived in Vladivostock on November 11. That same day the Armistice ending World War I was signed and the transport immediately returned home. Pond received his discharge on January 15, 1919. By that time he had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war, Pond entered private practice in Cebu. He also engaged in several business ventures, including a coconut plantation, a cattle ranch on the island of Mindanao, and a navigation company, and as a result he became a millionaire. Death On September 10, 1930, Pond underwent surgery for appendicitis in Cebu. The operation appeared to be a success; however, peritonitis set in. A wire was sent to the governor general requesting that an Army surgeon be sent from Manila, but an amphibious aircraft could not be found. After showing signs of improvement, Pond suffered a relapse and died at 9 a.m. on September 19, 1930, at the age 58. On the day of Pond's funeral, flags were flown at half-mast and all businesses and banks were closed. Services were held at the Manila Lodge of Elks No. 761. Several prominent people attended the service, including Senator Sergio Osme√±a. Pond's body was cremated at the army morgue. Pond Parkway, a downtown thoroughfare in Cebu City, was named in his honor.

She was the first female team executive in National Hockey League (NHL) history. Early life and education Norris was born to James E. Norris in 1927 and was the sister of Bruce and James D. Norris. As the youngest sibling of four, she was often made the goaltender for her brothers to practice. Norris was educated at Smith College and worked for West Farm Management and Dun & Bradstreet. Hockey career Norris became president of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL) after her father James E. Norris died in 1952, making her the first female chief executive in the history of the league. General Manager Jack Adams announced that Norris was selected by her father prior to his death to succeed him as president. In her first meeting with the press, she was surrounded by hockey reporters, fashion reporters, and photographers. Prior to Norris' first game with the Red Wings against the Montreal Canadiens, Maurice Richard made an exception to his usual rule of \\"fraternizing with the enemy\\" to present her with flowers. It was later reported this angered him so much he took six minor penalties in the first period. Shortly after her takeover, reports emerged that the arena was cleaner, freshly painted, and a wire screen was in place to protect fans from flying pucks. Norris also advocated for arenas to be more female fan friendly and for all farm teams to be equally treated across the system. During her tenure with the Red Wings, she saw the team win the Stanley Cup in both the 1954 and 1955 seasons, making her the first woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup. However, despite her success, she still experienced discrimination based on her gender. Conn Smythe forbade Norris from sitting on the Board of Governors although she secretly voted through Jack Adams using hand gestures. She also butted heads with Adams who insisted on referring to her as \\"dearie.\\" After the championship 1955 season, Norris was succeeded as president by her brother Bruce and became the teams Vice President. She stepped down as president to focus on her business in New York City. As Vice President, the Norris siblings donated $300, 000 to fund the James Norris Physical Education Center at Lake Superior State University. Despite her short tenure, she was inducted into the Red Wings Hall of Fame in 1976 alongside Jimmy Skinner and Tommy Ivan. Personal life Norris married her husband John J. Riker on October 26, 1960 in New York. Together, they had four children; two daughters and two sons. Norris and Riker co-owned The Westenhook Farm in Southbury, Connecticut. She died in 1994 at age 67 at her home in Southbury, Connecticut due to heart failure.

Damage to the ozone layer has resulted in much higher levels of UV light and so sunburn and skin cancer are serious issues ‚Äì most people do not venture outside unless entirely necessary, and carry high factor suncream and anti-cancer kits. Most of the world's population were wiped out in \\"God's flood\\"; the survivors live in collections of floating oil-platform-like city structures, known as parishes. The story takes place around the seas and drylands that were once Scotland ‚Äì initially Port, a collection of parishes (named after towns around Scotland) attached to what was once Greenock by underwater cables. The Population of Port are watched constantly by a totalitarian government; there are class divides in the parishes (there is an underclass of Danish refugees living in many of the lower levels); the climate of Earth is now inhospitable. In addition to these problems, Senga, a new strain of HIV infects much of the population. There is no cure, and the entire population is infected with the Mowdy virus (similar to HIV) and are dependent on government issued medication to suppress Senga. Senga also becomes active if individuals engage in sex ‚Äì reproduction is performed using laboratory techniques, and only virtual sex is possible. Anyone who develops Senga is put into isolation for the virus to run its course ‚Äì these people are kistit ‚Äì entombed in capsules in huge hospitals. Victim's thoughts are visualised by thochtscreens on each kist. Critical reception The book has received a fair amount of attention, as much for its inventive use of Scots as for its plot. The following illustrate: \\"Fitt creates a prose that crackles with energy and invention ... But n Ben A-Go-Go shows us that the Scots language can describe worlds as various and exotic as the imaginations of those who use it.\\" Niall O'Gallagher, The List, 100 Best Scottish Books of all Time, 2005 \\"The plot has much of the imaginative power of Iain M Banks.\\" Douglas Gifford, The Scotsman, November 2000 \\"While But n Ben A-Go-Go does have comic moments, the novel is far from a joke ... confronting relevant issues such as global warming, epidemics, and social division.\\" Stephen Naysmith, Sunday Herald, August 2000 \\"Matthew Fitt has nearly accomplished something splendid: a novel composed in tough, readable Scots; more, a science fiction novel which projects this perennially 'dying' language into a future it is not supposed to possess.\\" WN Herbert, Scotland on Sunday, October 2000 =Other settlements= * Other floating settlements like Port are mentioned: Europort and Berlinhaven are mentioned directly; there are references to habitation in South America and \\"New Appalachia\\" in North America.

The riots started as an Abkhaz protest against opening of a branch of Tbilisi State University in Sukhumi, and concluded with looting of the Georgian school which was expected to house the new university on 16 July 1989. The ensuing violence quickly degenerated into a large-scale inter-ethnic confrontation. By the time when the Soviet army managed to temporarily bring the situation under control, the riots had produced at least 18 dead and 448 injured, mostly Georgians. The first case of inter-ethnic violence in Georgia, it effectively marked the start of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.  Background  From 1921 until 1931 Abkhazia was a quasi-independent Soviet republic, the Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia (SSR Abkhazia), united with the Georgian SSR in a special treaty status but not fully subservient. This arraignment ended when the SSR Abkhazia was downgraded into the Abkhaz ASSR and fully under the control of the Georgian SSR, a move not popular amongst the Abkhaz. Protests were held opposing this move, and repeated again in 1957, 1967, and in 1978. Only in 1978 were there any concessions from either the Georgian or Soviet government, including the upgrading of the Sukhum Pedagogical Institute into a full university, Abkhaz State University. It was with the onset of perestroika within the Soviet Union that gave renewed hope to the Abkhaz in their desire to leave the Georgian SSR. On 17 June 1988, an 87-page document, known as the 'Abkhazian Letter', was sent to Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership. Signed by 60 leading Abkhazians, it outlined the grievances the Abkhaz felt, and argued that despite the concessions of 1978, autonomy had largely been ignored in the region. It concluded by asking for Abkhazia to be removed from the Georgian SSR, and it to be restored as a full Soviet republic, akin to the SSR Abkhazia. Though the letter failed to gain the attention of the Soviet authorities, it raised concern amongst the Georgian leadership, who implemented a policy calling for increased instruction of the Georgian language in schools; this faced opposition in Abkhazia, where most ethnic Abkhaz did not speak Georgian but instead used up to three other languages (Abkhaz, Mingrelian, and Russian). Further issues occurred on 18 March 1989. Around 37,000 people met at the village of Lykhny, a traditional meeting spot for the Abkhaz, and signed what became known as the Lykhny Declaration. It once again called for Abkhazia to become a separate republic like it was between 1921 and 1931. The Declaration, which unlike the prior 'Abkhazian Letter' was made public immediately saw mass opposition demonstrations from the Georgian community in Abkhazia. The protests climaxed in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and evolved into a major anti-Soviet and pro-independence rally on 9 April 1989, which was violently dispersed by Soviet Interior Ministry troops, resulting in the deaths of at least nineteen, mostly young women, and the injury of hundreds of demonstrators.Sources differ on the number of dead: Stephen Jones, a historian of the Caucasus, states 19 (), while the BBC and Eurasianet, a news website focusing on the Caucasus, both claim 20 (; ); Donald Rayfield, a professor of Russian and Georgian literature and history, has written that 21 died () At a plenum of the Georgian central committee the following day the Communist party first secretary, Jumber Patiashvili, resigned and was replaced by the former head of the Georgian KGB, Givi Gumbaridze. The 9 April tragedy removed the last vestiges of credibility from the Soviet regime in Georgia and pushed many Georgians into radical opposition to the Soviet Union, and exacerbated ethnic tensions between Georgians and other groups, in particular the Abkhaz and Ossetians.  The university controversy  The status of Abkhazian State University, pictured here in 2013, was the source of the riots. The issue of a university had always been very sensitive in Abkhazia. Sukhumi State University was established in 1978 as a part of the concessions towards the Abkhaz secessionist demands, which in its turn was triggered by the Georgian national mobilization in defense of their language and culture. The university had three sectors: Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian. However, Georgian students repeatedly complained of discrimination at the hands of their Abkhaz and Russian lectors and administration. In the aftermath of the 9 April events, Georgian students at Sukhumi State University started a hunger strike, calling for the Georgian sector of the university to be transformed into a branch of Tbilisi State University, and in effect controlled by Georgians and not Abkhaz. Joined by students and faculty from the Subtropical Institute, this was part of a campaign started by ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia for greater cultural separation, and more clear division between the two ethnic groups. Aware it would cause unrest in Abkhazia, the authorities approved the measure on 14 May. In response Abkhaz organized a sit-in. The Supreme Soviet in Moscow also launched a commission, which ruled that the Georgians had no authority to establish the university, as that was solely under its purview. They concluded that a region the size of Abkhazia had no need for two universities. It also found that despite Georgian claims they were discriminated against under the language system in place, they had a higher percent of applications than the Abkhaz sector (33.5% for the Georgian compared to 24% for Abkhaz; the Russian, which would have had applicants from all three groups, saw 42.5% of all applications.  The riots  Despite the ruling against the legality of the university, entrance exams were scheduled for 15 July. Attempts by Abkhaz to photograph the crowds of Georgians congregated in the city is said to have started the violence. By 7:00pm the university was under attack. Late on 16 July, a crowd of five thousand Abkhaz, many of whom were armed, surged into the building. Several members of the Georgian exam commission were beaten up, and the school was looted. This set off a chain of events that produced further casualties and destruction as the both sides engaged in armed fighting for several days to come. That evening, Abkhaz and Georgians began mobilizing all over Abkhazia and western Georgia. Svans, an ethnic Georgian subgroup from northeastern Abkhazia, and Abkhaz from the town of Tkvarcheli in Abkhazia clashed in a shootout that lasted all night and intermittently for several days afterward. Meanwhile, up to 25,000 Georgians from western Georgia, and the predominantly Georgian Gali district in southern Abkhazia, gathered near Ochamchire. Soviet Interior Ministry troops were sent in to restore order, and by 17 July the violence had largely dissipated. Aftermath The July events in Abkhazia left at least 18 dead and 448 injured, of whom, according to official accounts, 302 were Georgians.: \\"Citation 111, which references Elizabeth Fuller, \\"The South Ossetian Campaign or Unification,\\" p. 18 Report on the USSR, 1, No. 30 (July 28, 1989).\\" It also marked the first case of inter-ethnic violence in Georgia; while previous protests and demonstrations had occurred in Abkhazia, none had seen any casualties. Although a continuous presence of the Interior Ministry troops maintained a precarious peace in the region, outbursts of violence did occur, and the Soviet government made no progress toward solving any of the inter-ethnic problems. The Georgians suspected the attack on their university was intentionally staged by the Abkhaz secessionists in order to provoke a large-scale violence that would prompt Moscow to declare a martial law in the region, thus depriving the government in Tbilisi of any control over the autonomous structures in Abkhazia. At the same time, they accused the Soviet government of manipulating ethnic issues to curb Georgia's otherwise irrepressible independence movement. On the other hand, the Abkhaz claimed that the new university was an instrument in the hands of Georgians to reinforce their cultural dominance in the region, and continued to demand that the investigation of the July events be turned over to Moscow and that no branch of Tbilisi State University be opened in Sukhumi. Tensions remained high in Abkhazia, and saw the Abkhaz totally disregard Georgian authority in the region. This was confirmed on 25 August 1990, when the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet passed a declaration, \\"On Abkhazia's State Sovereignty,\\" which gave supremacy to Abkhaz laws over Georgian ones. The same day the Supreme Soviet also declared Abkhazia to be a full union republic within the Soviet Union. This was countered by accusations from Georgians that the Abkhaz were not the original inhabitants of the region, a claim first promoted by Georgian scholars in the 1950s but without any serious academic or historic basis. The victory of a nationalist coalition in October 1990 only further led to increased issues, as the newly-elected Chairman of the Georgian Supreme Soviet, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was outspoken in his desire to reduce the autonomy of the non-Georgian population in the country. By this point, however, Georgian authority had effectively ceased in Abkhazia: Abkhazia took part in the Soviet referendum on 17 March 1991, which the rest of Georgia boycotted, while the non-Georgian population of region (along with South Ossetia, another autonomous region of Georgia), in turn boycotted the referendum on independence on 9 April 1991. A power-sharing deal was agreed upon in August 1991, dividing electoral districts by ethnicity, with the 1991 elections held under this format, though it did not last. However with the breakdown of the Gamsakhurida government in Georgia, and efforts by Eduard Shevardnadze to delegitimize Gamsakhurdia by failing to honour agreements he signed, and Abkhaz desires to utilize the ongoing Georgian Civil War, it fell apart. Thus on 23 July 1992, the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet re-instated the 1925 constitution, which had called Abkhazia a sovereign state, albeit one in treaty union with Georgia. Georgia responded militarily on 14 August, starting an offensive. The ensuing war would last until September 1993, and lead to the ongoing Abkhaz‚ÄìGeorgian conflict. In the aftermath of the 1992‚Äì1993 war, the Sukhumi branch of Tbilisi State University, which had remained open, was relocated to Tbilisi as the city fell out of Georgian control. It was re-established in Tbilisi in December 1993, and remains there.

Hargreaves machines, called the spinning jenny, were the first wholly successful improvement on the traditional spinning wheel. Its advantage was to multiply many times the amount of yarn that could be spun by a single operator. This development and others such as weavers being able to rely on uninterrupted supplies of yarn led to spinning being concentrated in factories. Powerloom weaving In 1789, Radcliffe opened a large cotton weaving factory at Mellor, in Derbyshire. He streamlined the process by inventing a machine to improve the quality of cloth. In 1804 he invented a ratchet wheel that moved the cloth forward automatically. Radcliffe also contributed to the debate amongst entrepreneurs on what constituted profits in a capitalist system. In a letter dated 1 May 1804, which was never sent but later published in an 1811 book called Letters on the Evils of the Exportation of Cotton Yarns, Radcliffe said he regarded profit as being made up of two parts: interest on money and a sort of entrepreneurial wage. In 1828, he wrote the essay Origin of the New System of Manufacture, Commonly Called Power loom Weaving, later reprinted in J. F. C. Harrison's Society and Politics in England, 1780-1960 (New York: Harper & Row, 1965).

Each episode is divided into different segments concerning a different \\"lost\\" item or artifact from history. Most of the time, the segments do not relate. Each segment runs around 7 minutes and in this time we learn the history, of several famous lost artifacts such as the flags from the Battle of Iwo Jima, and other not so famous artifacts like the first TV Dinner tray. Each segment ends with information on where this item is located. Some segments were reused in other episodes. Episodes of the show were released on VHS in 2001 and the first episode has been released on DVD. 2000 was the big year for the series as most of the episodes were created and aired during that year, but a few new episodes aired in 2004 and 2005.

High school years In high school, at Gage Park in Chicago, Vaughn played football, basketball and baseball. He was All-State honorable mention and a three-year football letterman starting on both sides of the ball as a running back and a linebacker. College career Vaughn played college football at Northern Illinois University where he won his 4-year football scholarship. He played linebacker for the Huskies and led the team in tackles with 92 tackles his senior year. In 1983, he was a linebacker on the California Bowl III championship team where they beat Fresno State. Vaughn played under three head coaches at Northern Illinois University, Bill Mallory, Lee Corso and Jerry Pettibone. In 1995, he was inducted into the NIU Hall of Fame for the 1983 football team.\\"NIU Hall of Fame\\" , NIUhuskies.com He received his B.A. Degree in Criminal Justice and minored in Business Administration. Professional career Vaughn was drafted in the eighth round (219th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. In his first NFL start against the St. Louis Cardinals, he had 13 solo tackles. Later that year, in a post-season game against the Minnesota Vikings, Vaughn made a critical play where he sacked Vikings quarterback Wade Wilson. They then went on to win Super Bowl XXII against the Denver Broncos. He won his second Super Bowl in 1992 against the Buffalo Bills, Super Bowl XXVI. Vaughn was the first NIU player to play in a Super Bowl, and is still the only NIU player to win two Super Bowls.Vaughn \\"NIU 50 Greatest Players\\" , NIUhuskies.com After football Vaughn currently runs a youth and young adult football training camp called Get NFL Ready and was Assistant Coach at Loudoun Valley High School in 2015.

He was governor of the Courland Governorate from 1868 till 1885. During that time, he developed his Thoughts on the Social Science of the Future, first in Russian as –ú—ã—Å–ª–∏ –æ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –Ω–∞—É–∫–µ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–≥–æ (Mysli o sotsial'noi naukie budushchego; 1872), and then in German as Gedanken √ºber die Socialwissenschaft der Zukunft (1873‚Äì1881). Lilienfeld's thoughts, which he later articulated in compressed form in both French and Italian, laid out his organic theory of societies, also known as the social organism theory, organicist sociology, or simply organicism. He later became a senator in the Russian parliament, as well as vice-president (1896), then president (1897), of the Institut International de Sociologie (International Institute of Sociology) in Paris. Political career Capozzi (2004: 92) describes Lilienfeld as \\"a Russian functionary who occupied himself with sociology as a form of intellectual diversion,\\"Capozzi (2004: 92): \\"un funzionario russo che si occupa di sociologia come svago intellettuale.\\" while Ward (1897: 260, 264) refers to him as \\"Senator Lilienfeld,\\" and Worms (1897: 657) qualifies him as a s√©nateur de l‚ÄôEmpire russe. Gerschenkron (1974: 435, footnote 24) calls him \\"a Balto-Russian,\\" while Barberis (2003: 69) says he \\"descended from Swedish nobility, held important Russian judicial posts, was governor of Kurland for 17 years and ultimately became a senator of the Russian Empire.\\" Lilienfeld, in fact, was governor of the Courland Governorate from 1868 till 1885, and in the same year in which he put out Social Physiology (1879), his brother, Baron Otto Friedrich von Lilienfeld, on either the 16th or the 22nd of May, founded a seaside town along the banks of the Saka River on Courland‚Äôs far western Baltic coast, naming it PƒÅvilosta (Paulshafen) after his sociologist sibling.Pavilosta Regional Studies Museum; PƒÅvilosta - PƒÅvilostas Novadpƒìtniecƒ´bas muzejs; PƒÅvilosta ‚Äì Vikipƒìdija Lilienfeld, who had studied at the Lyc√©e Alexandre in Saint Petersburg,–õ–∏–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ñ–µ–ª—å–¥-–¢–æ–∞–ª—å, –ü–∞–≤–µ–ª –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á - –í–∏–∫–∏–ø–µ–¥–∏—è was awarded many honors in recognition for the services he performed for the empire; it would seem, however, that the aspect of his political career for which he felt most proud was his collaboration in the emancipation of Russia‚Äôs serfs (Worms 1903: 265).\\"M. Paul de Lilienfeld-Toal √©tait issu d‚Äôune famille de vieille noblesse su√©doise depuis longtemps au service de la Russie. Lui-m√™me entra dans l‚Äôadministration de cet empire et y fit une brillante carri√®re. Il fut gouverneur de la province de Courlande pendant dix- sept ans, puis se vit appel√© au S√©nat imp√©rial, o√π il si√©gea durant de longues ann√©es et jusqu‚Äô√† sa mort. Dans ces postes √©lev√©s, il sut concilier, avec son attachement √† la dynastie, une honorable ind√©pendance. Titulaire des distinctions les plus envi√©es de son pays, il pr√©f√©rait, aux grands cordons de ses multiples ordres, la simple m√©daille qu‚Äôil avait re√ßue, il y a bien longtemps, comme collaborateur de l‚Äô√©mancipation des serfs\\" (Worms 1903: 265). Scientific career In parallel with his administrative duties, Lilienfeld was \\"a tireless worker, always able to find room for scientific research\\" (Worms 1903: 265). Lilienfeld‚Äôs research leaned towards social philosophy in general, and to speculations about the organic theory of society in particular (Worms 1903: 265), the first outlines of which he began to sketch, in Russian, in his Elements of political economy of 1860 and his Mysli of 1872, and to develop more fully in German as his Gedanken of 1873‚Äì1881 (Lilienfeld 1894: 825; Lilienfeld 1896b: xiii‚Äìxiv). Lilienfeld later served as both vice- president (1896) and president (1897) of the Institut International de Sociologie, which had been founded by Ren√© Worms in 1893 (Worms 1895: 881; Worms 1897: 657; Barberis 2003: 54‚Äì55).At the Second Congress of the International Institute of Sociology, which took place in Paris from 30 September to 3 October 1895, Lilienfeld, who did not attend the congress in person, was one of four vice-presidents elected to the Institute for the year 1896 (Worms 1895: 876, 879, 881). The other three vice-presidents were Gumersindo de Azc√°rate, deputy of the Spanish Cortes Generales and professor at the University of Madrid; Sir Leonard Courtney, member of the English House of Commons; and Carl Menger, professor at the University of Vienna (Worms 1895: 881). Furthermore, Worms (1895: 881) seems to contradict the statement by Barberis (2003: 55) that Lilienfeld served as vice-president of the Institute for the year(s) 1893‚Äì94. In addition, although Lilienfeld‚Äôs first publication in the Institute‚Äôs Revue appeared in the volume for 1894, his name did not appear among the list of the journal‚Äôs collaborators until 1895 (see covers for Revue 1894, 1895). =The organic theory of societies= Lilienfeld‚Äôs main work, Gedanken √ºber die Socialwissenschaft der Zukunft (Thoughts on the Social Science of the Future), was issued in five volumes over eight years: I, Die menschliche Gesellschaft als realer Organismus [Human society as real organism] (1873); II, Die socialen Gesetze [The laws of society] (1875); III, Die sociale Psychophysik [Social psychophysics] (1877); IV, Die sociale Physiologie [Social physiology] (1879); and V, Die Religion, betrachtet vom Standpunkte der realgenetischen Socialwissenschaft, oder versuch einer nat√ºrlichen Theologie [Religion considered from the viewpoint of the real genetic social science, or attempt at a natural theology] (1881). An anonymous reviewer in Mind noted that the first three volumes > start with the conception of Society as a real organism, and attempt to work > out this point of view upon the methods proper to the Natural Sciences. The > treatise commences with a demonstration that Society consists of individuals > in the same manner as the physical organism is made up of cells, and that > the one is real in the same sense as the other. With this idea the author > seeks to exhibit a thorough-going identity between the laws of Nature as > they exist in the case of its highest development, Society, and in its lower > stages, including the individual human being.... The first three parts are > worked out with great minuteness, the connecting thread being the conception > of a real analogy between the individual and the social group as the > essential foundation of the Social Science of the future (Anonymous 1878: > 152). Lilienfeld's fourth volume dealt with \\"the establishment and elucidation of the Laws of Development of the Social Organism from the physiological point of view\\" (Anonymous 1880: 298). What precisely Lilienfeld meant by his term \\"real analogy\\" puzzled more than one other social scientist, including Lester F. Ward, writing in the pages of the American Journal of Sociology: > What is an analogy? In biology, which is the standpoint of [Lilienfeld] and > of all defenders of the social organism theory in whatever form, this word > has a very definite meaning ‚Äî a technical usage ‚Äî viz., physiological > without anatomical similarity. It is contrasted with homology, which is > anatomical similarity irrespective of function. If this is all [Lilienfeld] > mean[s] by the analogy between society and an organism, there seems to be no > objection to pursuing it to its utmost extent and determining how far social > functions resemble organic functions, recognizing all the time that there is > no real morphological or structural resemblance any more than there is > between the wing of a bat and that of a bird. What, then, does Senator > Lilienfeld mean by his oft-repeated expression, \\"real analogy\\"? Does he mean > that here are homologies? It seems difficult to interpret him otherwise. > Ward 1897: 260). In 1896, Lilienfeld published summaries of his ideas in both Italian and French. Reviewing Lilienfeld's version of the social organism theory as well as the concurrent articulation of it by Ren√© Worms, Ward wrote: > Not only in the present treatise, but throughout his great five-volume work, > and, later than either, in a pamphlet recently issued, he denies that > society can properly be called a superorganism, as Mr. Spencer proposes, and > insists that it is in very truth an organism. But what manner of organism > does he make it out to be? An organism consisting entirely of a \\"social > nervous system\\" and \\"social intercellular structure.\\" Is there any such > animal or plant as that? How much of the body of an animal consists of > \\"intercellular structure\\"? Is not this expression to the biologist a > contradiction of terms? What is \\"structure\\" in biology? Is it not wholly > cellular (or vascular, in which the most highly developed cells are > differentiated into vessels)? It is true, there are fluids of various kinds > flowing through the animal body in various physiological capacities, but the > blood is full of corpuscles, i. e., cells, and the lymphatics and secretions > are not \\"structures.\\" There are also some structures in the animal body that > for physiological reasons are devoid of sensitive nerves, but they are all > made up of cells. Lilienfeld and Worms both agree that individual men > constitute the cells of the social organism, and both take this in a literal > biological sense, that they represent the \\"real\\" cells as made known by > Schleiden and Schwann. But the first of these authors maintains that the > individual men in society taken together only constitute the nervous system > of society, and that society is devoid of all the other systems of the > animal body. In their stead we have the intercellular structure, which, as > he says, is produced by the nervous system, or, as the biologists would say, > secreted by it. And what is this intercellular structure of society? As I > understand him it consists chiefly of the material (and perhaps spiritual) > capital of society, the product of human labor and thought. Sometimes he > seems to give it somewhat the scope that Mr. Spencer gives to society > itself, as including the soil, water, air, flora, and fauna, in short, the > environment of society. But if this is all intercellular structure and is > only the product of the nervous system and not part of that system itself, > where is the consistency in speaking, as both our authors do, of telegraph > lines as analogues of nerves? (Ward 1897: 260-261). In July 1897, the Third Congress of the International Institute of Sociology at the Sorbonne in Paris erupted with debate over the organic theory of societies. In the capacity of the Institute's president, Lilienfeld, then a senator in the Russian parliament, traveled from Saint Petersburg and delivered the opening address on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 21. Remarks and the reading of two papers followed. The next day, Thursday, July 22, a paper by Lester F. Ward (not able to attend the conference) on \\"Pain and Pleasure Economy\\" was read in the morning, along with another paper by Italian sociologist Achille Loria. It was only after the break for lunch that the debate over the organic theory began. Jacques Novicow started by reading a paper in support of the theory. He was followed by Lilienfeld. Next, Gabriel Tarde heavily critiqued Lilienfeld and Novicow, \\"and presented in opposition to the organic theory a psychological theory of social life\\" (Worms 1898: 110). The session adjourned for the evening, and discussion resumed the next afternoon, Friday, July 23. Casimir de Kelles-Krauz opened the offensive against the organic theory with a salvo of economic materialism. Ludwig Stein then backed up Tarde and Kelles-Krauz with \\"the principles of the historical and psychogenetic method of research\\" (Worms 1898: 111). The founder and general secretary of the Institute, Ren√© Worms, next \\"tried to show something of the exactness and utility of the analogy between organisms and society\\" (Worms 1898: 111). Worms's attempt, however, was rebuffed by S. R. Steinmetz. Furthermore, though Raphael Garofalo, Charles Limousin, and C. N. Starcke accepted the organic theory, they did so with reservations. The most withering attack on the organic theory seemed to come from Nikolai Kar√©iev, who \\"showed that this theory shared, together with Darwin's social theory, economic materialism and social psychic theories, the fate of all exclusive theories\\" (Worms 1898: 111). Alfred Espinas then tried to salvage the theory by maintaining that societies must \\"constitute organisms,\\" or else one would have \\"to abandon altogether the idea of social life and social laws\\" (Worms 1898: 111). Novicow closed the section by reaffirming his faith in the organic theory, and Worms in his report stated that, by and large, the congress had \\"been productive of the most happy results\\" (Worms 1898: 109).In addition to Worms (1898), other sources consulted are Anonymous (1897: 289); Barberis (2003): 54‚Äì55; Geiger (1981: 358‚Äì359); and Small (1898: 412). Though these debates in Paris were characterized as \\"more animated\\" than usual (Small 1898: 412), a reviewer across the Atlantic seemed to take them lightly: > It would hardly be possible to arouse American sociologists to very lively > controversy over what remains in dispute. The men among us who make most use > of the organic concept are satisfied that their opponents disagree with them > only verbally, so far as the essential idea is concerned. Beyond that there > remain merely differences of judgement about details in employing the > concept. Since these differences relate to details and not to essentials, > even the most zealous friends of the organic concept are satisfied that it > can now take care of itself. They are content to assume that it is taken for > granted, and their interest is transferred to other fields (Small 1898: > 412). A couple of years earlier, the same reviewer, Albion W. Small, had also expressed an optimistic outlook for organicism. Discussing both Lilienfeld‚Äôs and Sch√§ffle‚Äôs uses of society‚Äìorganism analogies, Small wrote > the tracing of these analogies is not the essence of sociology, but merely > the most vivid method of presenting the phenomena of society in such form > that the actual problems of sociology will appear. The analogies and terms > suggested by them are tools of research and report, not solutions of > problems‚Ä¶. The metaphors emphasize obvious analogies between social > relations and physiological relations. They are used as spurs to scientific > curiosity, so as to facilitate discovery of the limits of analogy, and thus > of the distinctively social phenomena (Small 1896: 311). An earlier critic, however, was not so sanguine. √âmile Durkheim rejected Lilienfeld‚Äôs ideas on both ideological and methodological grounds. Ideologically, Durkheim objected that one could find in Lilienfeld‚Äôs Gedanken, \\"the transformationist [evolutionary] hypothesis reconciled with the dogma of the Holy Trinity\\" (Durkheim 1887a: 21 [online version])\\"Dans le livre de Lilienfeld [‚Ä¶] on trouvera l‚Äôhypoth√®se transformiste r√©concili√©e avec le dogme de la Sainte Trinit√©\\" (Durkheim 1887a: 21 [version num√©rique]). Methodologically, Durkheim stated that \\"the sole object of Lilienfeld‚Äôs work is to show the analogies between societies and organisms,\\" thus missing the point of seeing \\"in moral phenomena sui generis facts necessitating study in themselves, for themselves, by a special method\\" (Durkheim 1887b: 16 [online version], note 17)\\"Tous les moralistes dont nous parlons ici voient dans les ph√©nom√®nes moraux des faits sui generis qu‚Äôil faut √©tudier en eux-m√™mes, pour eux-m√™mes, par une m√©thode sp√©ciale. Au contraire, l‚Äôunique objet de Lilienfeld est de montrer les analogies des soci√©t√©s et des organismes. Si les conclusions peuvent parfois co√Øncider, le but et l‚Äôesprit sont donc tout autres (Durkheim 1887b: 16 [version num√©rique], note 17). Reviewing Lilienfeld‚Äôs main French exposition of his ideas, La Pathologie Sociale, Franklin H. Giddings a few years later echoed Durkheim‚Äôs criticism: > In the work of Dr. von Lilienfeld we have the first opportunity to judge > whether the biological conception of society can throw any new light on > practical social questions. That \\"the body politic\\" is subject to \\"disease\\" > is a very ancient notion. But is anything gained by taking a figure of > speech literally and converting analogy into identity? Dr. von Lilienfeld‚Äôs > pages are rich in learning and in wisdom. He has investigated thoroughly and > thought deeply; and no one can dip into his chapters without being impressed > with the value of his reflections on the economic inequalities, the > political corruption, the moral degeneration, the educational imbecilities, > the religious indifference of the present day. A thousand hints are thrown > out by the way on which statesmen and reformers might well reflect. But > there is nothing in the entire book that could not have been better said in > a simpler language than that of an ingeniously elaborated \\"social > pathology.\\" To describe fads and crazes, degeneracy, outbreaks of insanity, > crime and lubricity, as \\"anomalies of the social nervous system,\\" is only > calculated to hasten the wear and tear of the nervous systems of > individuals; and to argue that wealth is a \\"social intercellular substance,\\" > is simply to set up a doctrine of sociological transubtantiation (Giddings > 1896: 348). =Social Darwinist?= In addition to being labelled an organicist sociologist, or simply organicist, Lilienfeld has also been classified as \\"a systematic Social Darwinist and laissez-faire advocate\\" (Weikart 1993: 479), who \\"considered war a natural phenomenon necessitated by Malthusian population pressure and the resultant struggle for existence\\" (Weikart 1993: 481‚Äì482). Lilienfeld did not, however, deny \\"the propriety of laws ensuring honesty in business competition\\" (Weikart 1993: 479).For Lilienfeld‚Äôs advocacy of fair business practices, Weikart refers to the Gedanken, volume II (Die socialen Gesetze), page 271, and volume IV (Die sociale Physiologie), pages 190 and 238. For Lilienfeld‚Äôs understanding of war as a natural phenomenon caused by population pressures and conflict over resources, Weikart refers to the Gedanken, volume II (Die socialen Gesetze), pages 260‚Äì261. Lilienfeld's advocacy of fair business practices is not anomalous, given his thoughts concerning the importance of society on forming the individual: > If man, from the physical point of view, is first of all a product of > nature, he is, from the point of view of intelligence, above all a product > of society. The most important organs of the nervous system form, develop, > differentiate, and integrate under the influence of the social milieu, just > as the purely physical part of man is formed and developed under the > influence of the physical milieu by the natural differentiation and > integration of forces. The economic activity of society, work, customs, > habits, laws, political liberty, authority, religion, science, art, in > short, all of social life, forms and educates man, gives to his efforts, to > his intellectual, moral and aesthetic needs, this or that direction, pushing > in this or that sense the complete development of the superior organs of the > nervous system (Lilienfeld 1873; cited in Schmoller 1902: 169, note 81).\\"Si > l‚Äôhomme, au point de vue physique, est tout d‚Äôabord un produit de la nature, > il est au point de vue de l‚Äôintelligence, avant tout un produit de la > soci√©t√©. Les organes nerveux les plus importants se forment, se d√©veloppent, > se diff√©rencient, s‚Äôint√®grent sous l‚Äôinfluence du milieu social, comme la > partie purement physique de l‚Äôhomme s‚Äôest form√©e et d√©velopp√©e sous > l‚Äôinfluence du milieu physique par la naturelle diff√©renciation et > int√©gration des forces. L‚Äôactivit√© √©conomique de la soci√©t√©, le travail, les > coutumes, les habitudes, les lois, la libert√© politique, l‚Äôautorit√©, la > religion, la science, l‚Äôart, bref toute la vie sociale, forme et √©duque > l‚Äôhomme, donne √† ses efforts, √† ses besoins intellectuels, moraux et > esth√©tiques, telle ou telle direction, en poussant dans tel ou tel sens le > complet d√©veloppement des organes nerveux sup√©rieurs\\" (Lilienfeld 1873; > cited in Schmoller 1902: 169, note 81). Indeed, the organic theory of society of Lilienfeld and Worms would seem to be an antidote to rampant laissez-faire competition, as Barberis (2003) noted: > Organicism also reacted to a widely held political idea of the time: that > individualism had been taken to extremes in modern society and that it was > necessary to bring balance through an opposite emphasis. Against the self- > sufficient individual of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the > organicists claimed to bring the support of science to the primacy of the > social bond. For these authors, the natural human state was that of > association. As Worms put it in a critique of the contract theory: \\"Men did > not need to associate themselves, they were born associated, and they > remained so.\\"Barberis refers to Worms (1896: 256). Psychological and moral > capacities developed through this association; in other words, humans owed > their consciousness and their capacity for relative autonomy to society. > Individuality as it was known and prized in modern society was a product of > society. Lilienfeld stated this as a simple fact: \\"The intellectual and > moral faculties of man are exclusively the product of social life.\\"Barberis > refers to Lilienfeld (1898a): 196). The organicists believed this should > settle the conflict between individual liberty and social solidarity; humans > would come to realize their strict dependence on the collective (Barberis > 2003: 62). Lilienfeld did, however, have a progressivist understanding of evolutionary complexity similar to Spencer's: > The direction of progress is indicated by Lilienfeld's hierarchical > potentiation of forces, which in the order of their natural succession in > the advancement of society represent the following order: mechanical, > chemical, organic, emotional, intellectual, and social. Each of these is > based upon and is the outgrowth of the preceding (Meyer 1900: 25). Human society represented the highest level of Lilienfeld's hierarchy, the highest level of organic life, such that only in human societies does nature display full autonomy: an autonomy both of wholes and of parts (Lilienfeld 1896b: 88; cited in Capozzi 2004: 93).Capozzi (2004: 93): \\"solo nella societ√† umana la natura realizza in tutta la sua pienezza il massimo grado della vita organica: l‚Äôautonomia dello stesso organismo individuale nelle parti e nel tutto.\\" See also * List of Baltic German scientists Notes and references =Notes= =References= *[Anonymous.] (1878).

Biography Ann Haymond Zwinger was born March 12, 1925, in Muncie, Indiana, the daughter of William and Ann Haymond. While young, she lived along the White River. She studied art history and was awarded two degrees, an A.B. in Arts in 1946 by Wellesley College with the designation \\"Wellesley College Scholar,\\" now considered roughly equivalent to \\"cum laude,\\" and an A.M. in Fine Arts by Indiana University in 1950. She married Herman H. Zwinger, a pilot, in 1952. In 1960, Zwinger moved to Colorado Springs with her husband and began to study Western ecology. In 1970, her first book was published, Beyond the Aspen Grove. She and co-author Beatrice Willard were finalists for the 1973 National Book Award in science for Land Above the Trees. Run, River, Run was another distinguished book published in 1975. It received glowing reviews by The New York Times, the John Burroughs Memorial Association Gold Medal for a distinguished contribution in natural history, and the Friends of American Writers Award for non-fiction. Her more than 20 books on natural history often featured her own illustrations. She taught Southwest Studies and English at Colorado College. Swinger died in Portland, Oregon on August 30, 2014.
