Seidel was the first researcher to incorporate vegetation into wastewater treatment wetlands, beginning in the 1950s. She was nicknamed \\"Bulrush Kate\\" (\\"Die Binzen Kaethe\\") for her use of the common bulrush, Schoenoplectus lacustris. For many years, she led the Limnological Station of the Lower Rhine (Limnologische Station Niederrhein) based in the city of Krefeld. Focusing on studies of the Lower Rhine, the Limnological Station was associated with various institutions that became part of the Max Planck Society. The approach to constructed wetlands that Seidel originated is variously referred to as the Seidel system, the Krefeld system, and the Max Planck Institute process (MPIP). Her work is the earliest example of vertical flow constructed wetlands, now used widely in Europe and elsewhere. Seidel was also the first to propose horizontal sub-surface flow systems, an area of research that was further explored by her student Reinhold Kickuth. She has been called the \\"Mother of constructed wetlands‚Äù. Education K√§the Seidel was born in 1907 in Frankenstein, Saxony, Germany (now part of the town of Oederan) where she attended school. She trained as a gardener at the agricultural college in Halle, Germany, the Landwirtschaftlichen Hochschule, qualifying at the master's level in 1934. Next, she trained as a horticultural teacher at a college of teacher education in Leipzig, becoming qualified to teach biology, horticulture and plant education. In 1939 she began studying at the University of Greifswald, taking classes in art history and natural sciences. Her studies there were interrupted by World War II, but she had already written extensively, publishing 22 works between 1922 and 1945. In 1947, Seidel continued her studies at Kiel. At the age of 47, on February 26, 1951, Seidel received her doctorate for the dissertation Die Flechtbinse, a study of the plant Scirpus lacustris which lives in riparian zones with slow flowing water. Career For many years, Seidel led the Limnological Station of the Lower Rhine (Limnologische Station Niederrhein), based in Krefeld. The Limnological Station was founded in 1928 to study the waters of the Lower Rhine. The Limnological Station became associated with the Kaiser Wilhelm Society as of 1937, earning the name of \\"Limnologische Station der Kaiser Wilhelm-Gesellschaft\\". Following World War II, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society was replaced by the Max Planck Society. Max Planck Gesellschaft was founded in the British zone as of September 11, 1946, and again for the British and American occupation zones as of February 26, 1948. In 1953 the Limnological Station in Krefeld became a field station of the Hydrobiological Institute of the Max Planck Society in Pl√∂n (Hydrobiologischen Anstalt der Max-Planck- Gesellschaft). The Hydrobiological Institute in Pl√∂n was directed from 1917 to 1957 by August Thienemann. Thienemann considered Seidel to have made significant contributions to the Hydrobiological Institute, through the vitality and energy she brought to her long-term position at the field station in Krefeld. In 1957 August Thienemann was succeeded as director of the Hydrobiological Institute by . In 1966, the Hydrobiological Institute became the Max Planck Institute for Limnology (MPIL) at Pl√∂n. In November 1968, the Max Planck Society closed the limnological station in Krefeld, but allowed Seidel to continue working there until she officially retired in 1976. She then established her own \\"Stiftung Limnologische Arbeitsgruppe Dr. Seidel e.V.\\", and continued to work for another 14 years. She died in 1990. In 2007, the Max Planck Institute for Limnology became the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. Research K√§the Seidel was the first researcher to incorporate vegetation into wastewater treatment wetlands. Beginning in the 1950s, Seidel conducted experiments into the use of marsh vegetation to improve water quality. In 1957, she demonstrated the effectiveness of her approach near Krefeld, Germany. Having observed the luxuriant growth of bulrushes in polluted water, she created an artificial bulrush marsh. She pumped heavily polluted water from the Rhine River into the test marsh, and measured the effluent that emerged. After a week or two in the marsh, the water that emerged was substantially lower in phosphorus and nitrogen content, and showed increases in oxygen. This filtration method was both energy efficient and inexpensive, costing about 1/3 of the cost of a conventional system at that time. Seidel's work directly challenged the received wisdom of the time, which was that higher plants could only grow in unpolluted waters. She demonstrated that the plants adapted themselves to extreme water conditions and helped to improve the quality of the water. Over the course of her career, Seidel published many studies about the treatment of wastewater using wetland plants. In 1966, she examined ten plants for potential use in the passive water treatment of contaminated water in mines, and reported that Schoenoplectus lacustris, which supplied the water with oxygen, was the only effective candidate. This led to the construction of a treatment plant in Liebenburg‚ÄìOthfresen, Germany in 1974, and the adoption of the approach in a number of other countries. She was successful in demonstrating the removal of phenols from wastewater, and the treatment of dairy wastewater using Scirpus lacustris. Today, it is recognized that Seidel's plant water treatment plants, which use rushes and other macrophytes such as Iris, Phragmites, and Arundo, are very useful. They are particularly effective where there is ample space, in areas of low population density, and in developing countries. If heavy metals are involved, it is possible to remove them from wastewater using plants, but the plants themselves then need to be treated as special waste, and cannot be used for food or forage. Although it took time for Seidel's work to be appreciated, she inspired many people in the field of ecological design, including biologist John Todd and artist and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser. Recognition In 1977 K√§the Seidel received the Environmental Medal of the Federal Republic of Germany, and in 1982 the Cross of Merit. Seidel died in 1990. In 2003, 13 years after her death, the institute organized a workshop in her honor as a pioneer in sewage purification by plants.

Born in Askham-in-Furness, Lawley received an elementary education before becoming a miner. Keen to further himself, he studied mining at evening classes and worked at a wide variety of mines in the UK and also in the United States. He also became an advocate of socialism and an active trade unionist. In 1912, Lawley moved to Hedley, British Columbia, where he again worked as a miner. In December 1913, he was blinded by a dynamite explosion, and subsequently returned to the UK. Becoming an advocate of the rights of blind people, he joined the National League of the Blind (NLB), and soon became the full-time North West District Organiser for the union. From 1920 to 1922, he served as the union's general president. Lawley was also active in the Independent Labour Party, serving on the executive of his local branch and speaking on its behalf. At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, the NLB sponsored him as a Labour Party candidate in Sunderland. He took fourth place, with only 12.2% of the vote, and was not elected, and dropped to fifth place and 11.6% when he stood again in 1923. He stood instead in Shrewsbury at the 1924 United Kingdom general election, managing only 6.8% of the votes cast. By 1932, Lawley had moved to Ontario, where he began working for the CNIB. He was very active in organising local districts and representing them at the provincial level, and in 1936 the post of Ontario Field Service Department supervisor was created for him. He became the organisation's national field service consultant in 1946, and in 1947 and 1948 worked on secondment to the Trinidad and Tobago Blind Welfare Association. Returning to Canada, he became acting superintendent of the CNIB's Ontario division, retiring in 1956.

The store specialized in LGBT literature and feminist literature, stocking titles in both English and French. By 1976 the store was entirely operated by a group of volunteers none of whom owned it or received any compensation. While the composition of the group was in constant flux, a core group of five or six individuals kept it open.

It has a broad egg-shaped to round leaf and a dark reddish purple to crimson flower with translucent patches. It is similar to C. hispidus but its labellum lacks a creamy-white centre and is not covered with bristly hairs.  Description  Corybas fimbriatus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single broad egg-shaped to round leaf long and wide. The leaf is dark green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. There is a single dark reddish purple to crimson flower with translucent patches. The dorsal sepal is long and wide and concave, partly forming a hood over the labellum. The lateral sepals are linear, about long and usually joined to each other. The petals are linear and about long. The labellum is about long with a transparent central mound and has many long, narrow teeth on the edges. Flowering occurs from May to August.  Taxonomy  The fringed helmet orchid was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and given the name Corysanthes fimbriatus. The description was published in Brown's book Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 1871 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach changed the name to Corybas fimbriatus. The specific epithet (fimbriatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"fringed\\" or \\"fibrous\\". Distribution and habitat Corybas fimbriatus is widespread and common, growing in heath and moist forest. It occurs in Queensland south from Gympie, on the coast and ranges of New South Wales, in south-east Victoria and in Tasmania. There is also an isolated population on the Atherton Tableland. Use in horticulture Although usually only cultivated by orchid enthusiasts, C. fimbriatus is more easily grown than other orchids in the same genus. It is grown in a free draining, sandy mix and requires good air circulation with 50% sun.

It has an egg-shaped to heart-shaped leaf and a reddish to reddish purple flower which leans forward. It is similar to C. unguiculatis which does not grow in swamps and has a different labellum.  Description  Corybas fordhamii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single egg- shaped to heart-shaped leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on the upper surface and bluish green on the lower side. There is a single reddish to reddish purple flower long which leans forward on a stalk long. The dorsal sepal is spoon-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are narrow triangular, white and about long. The petals are similar to the lateral sepals but only half as long. The labellum is about long, slightly shorter than the dorsal sepal and has red and white streaks. It has many short red bristles around its edge. Flowering occurs from July to October.  Taxonomy  The banded helmet orchid was first formally described in 1941 by Herman Rupp who gave it the name Corysanthes fordhamii and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. The type specimen was collected at Brunswick Heads. In 1942 Rupp changed the name to Corybas fordhamii. The specific epithet (fimbriatus) honours \\"Mr. F. [Fred] Fordham, of Brunswick Heads on the North Coast of N.S.W. who has done much valuable work in collecting and bringing into notice orchids of the Brunswick River district\\". Distribution and habitat Corybas fordhamii grows in dense, shrubby heath and swamps, often with Melaleuca squarrosa and is not often collected. It occurs along the coast of New South Wales, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia and on Flinders Island. It was formerly found at Burleigh Heads in Queensland but is now extinct there. Conservation This helmet orchid is listed as \\"endnagered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The main threats to the species are clearing of habitat, inappropriate fire regimes, soil erosion and weed invasion.

Gameplay Rugby World Cup '95 is a rugby game. The game was EA's first attempt at a rugby union simulation. The game uses the same engine as FIFA International Soccer, adapted by Electronic Arts's Slough development team to resemble the rules of rugby union instead of association football. Like FIFA, the game utilises an isometric viewpoint. The player controls one of the fifteen rugby players on their time at a time, with the ability to switch players on command. The game allows up to four human players at the same time, each controlling a different rugby player. The human players can choose to control a rugby player on the same team or on opposing teams. The remaining rugby players are controlled by the computer. Four modes of play ‚Äî Friendly, World Cup, World Cup 95 and League ‚Äî are available. Friendly engages the player in a single match between two teams of the player's choice. World Cup mode resembles the format of the Rugby World Cup, with the player controlling a team of their choice through a series of matches, starting with ? group matches with the possibility of progressing to ? further matches in a knockout format. World Cup 95 mode features the same format, but with the teams taking part and the order of the matches at the group stage being the same as the 1995 edition of the tournament. League consists of eight teams who contest a double round-robin tournament. The game features all twenty national teams that participated in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, a further ten countries that participated in the qualifying stages, plus two fictional teams - the EA Barbarians and EA Maulers. The players on each of the teams have fictional names. Playable nations There are 30 national teams in the game                Reception Next Generation reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Rugby World Cup '95 is a quality sports game serving as a great welcome to the sport of rugby, oh, and not to mention the game is damn fun.\\" Mean Machines magazine rated the Genesis version 90% and described it as \\"a spot-on conversion\\" of the sport. They described the player animation as \\"superb\\", noted that there was no evident slowdown when all thirty players appeared on screen at once, and noted that \\"absolute control is offered over the players\\" Stuart Campbell reviewed the DOS version in PC Gamer, criticising the isometric perspective by stating it was difficult to work out where on the pitch the action was taking place from the markings and where other players on the team were located. He also noted that possession of the ball after a tackle appears to be decided at random, and the kicking controls take too long for the player to carry out and usually get interrupted by a tackle as a result. Awarding the game a score of 52%, Campbell's overall verdict was that it \\"concentrates on realism at the expense of gameplay, but doesn't make a very good job of either\\".

It is a counterpart to GM's Le Sabre, with which it shares many common mechanical components, including its supercharged V8 engine, which could run on either gasoline or methanol. Representative of GM's \\"long and low\\" design philosophy in the 1950s, the XP-300 measures over in total length but is only in height. It includes numerous features ranging from push-button power windows and seats to hydraulic jacks and de Dion axles. Claimed to have attained a top speed of during testing, the XP-300 was displayed at auto shows across the United States, including the Chicago Auto Show in February 1951 and GM's 1953 Motorama tour. Together with the Le Sabre, the XP-300 pioneered the wraparound windshield, although it ultimately had much less influence on future car design than its counterpart. In 1966, the XP-300 was refurbished and donated to the Alfred P. Sloan Museum in Flint, Michigan, where it remains as of 2018.  Background  The XP-300, which was initially designated the XP-9, was designed by General Motors (GM) vice president of engineering Charles Chayne, along with Ned F. Nickles. Chayne had previously assisted Harley Earl in designing the 1938-39 Buick Y-Job, often regarded as the first concept car. In May 1951, Chayne granted approval for construction of the XP-300 along with a counterpart GM concept car, the Le Sabre.  Design  The XP-300 features a wraparound windshield, three tailfins, and a grille that resembles an electric razor. It also includes push-button power windows and seats. Although somewhat similar in appearance to the Le Sabre, the XP-300's styling was noticeably cleaner than the more futuristic, rocket-inspired lines of its counterpart. Furthermore, while the Le Sabre generally reflected Earl's design philosophy, the XP-300 was more in line with Chayne's conception of the future of Buick production cars, and its front end design ultimately foreshadowed the 1954 Buick line. The car's name reflects the fact that it produced over and was an experimental (XP) vehicle in nature.  Body  Buick XP-300 interior The XP-300's body and frame were welded together into a single unit. It shares many common mechanical components with the Le Sabre. Representative of GM's \\"long and low\\" design philosophy in the 1950s, the XP-300 measures over in total length and has a wheelbase with just of ground clearance. The car is only in height and in width. Weighing in at , the total weight of the car was reduced by its use of heat-treated, aluminum body panels. The car also features relatively heavy and wide drum brakes that necessitated two sets of brake shoes for each wheel. In addition, it boasts hydraulic steel bars that made it more rigid while being driven, helping form a framework somewhat similar to a roll cage; similarly, four hydraulic jacks that could raise either the driver or passenger side of the car facilitated easier tire changes. The XP-300 also has de Dion axles based on a Daimler-Benz design used for Grand Prix race cars. It additionally features four coil springs and a hydraulic system more complex than that of the Le Sabre, which operates the car's cowl vents, door-locking devices, hood, jacks, seats, and windows. The car was painted \\"Venus White\\". It has functional chrome louvers running down its rocker panels; the forward-mounted louvers served to vent heat from the engine, while the aft ones allowed air to enter the passenger compartment. Similarly, a chrome fin runs through the center of the car's trunk, hiding hinges for the twin deck lids, while a floodlight-style, sealed-beam backup lamp was mounted in the central fixture, which imitates the exhaust of a jet engine. The car was originally built with both a folding convertible top and a hardtop that were interchangeable, although the hardware to mount the latter has been removed and the hardtop can no longer be used. The interior of the XP-300 features pleated blue-leather bucket seats with adjustable inflatable air bladders and a center console. The car also has a telescoping steering wheel and an instrument panel displaying a prominently mounted combined speedometer/tachometer as well as a fuel gauge. It also boasted numerous technologies considered safety features in 1951, including its dual brakes, adjustable seats, and adjustable steering wheel in addition to seat belts.  Engine  The XP-300 was powered by a supercharged V8 engine made of aluminum that weighed just yet produced . This engine is lighter than the engine used in the contemporary production Buick Roadmaster, but is twice as powerful. The XP-300's engine could run on either gasoline or methanol, and the car featured two separate fuel fillers and fuel tanks, one for each fuel. The engine was fitted with a Bendix-Eclipse two-barrel carburetor, with one using gasoline and the other methanol. The methanol carburetor automatically cut in once the gasoline carburetor reached 40% throttle, in order to prevent engine knocking during rapid acceleration. With a displacement of just , the engine, which also powered the Le Sabre, had an impressive power-to-size ratio for the era. It also boasted a chain-driven camshaft and hemispherical combustion chambers, the latter of which allowed it to achieve an air-to-fuel-mixture ratio of 10.0:1, also considerable for 1951. The engine features rocker arms that were mounted transversely on its intake valves but in a fore/aft position for the exhaust valves, which made it more compact and allowed easier installation into the car. It is mated to a custom Dynaflow automatic transmission.  Testing and touring  During testing, Chayne claimed that the XP-300 achieved a top speed of in the hands of Buick general manager Ivan Wiles. Chayne also used the car personally, and reached at least in it himself. The XP-300 was displayed at auto shows across the United States, where it became a popular fixture with attendees as well as the press. It was displayed at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1951, despite not yet being completely finished. Later that year, it was displayed at the GM Proving Grounds alongside the Le Sabre. The two cars were then displayed together during GM's 1953 Motorama tour. During its unveiling in Santa Ana, California, Chayne called the car \\"undoubtedly the safest, most comfortable, high-performance car on the road today\\". The XP-300 accumulated nearly of driving, although it did not drive as far as the more publicized Le Sabre. The XP-300 was also insured for $1 million.  Legacy  Together with the Le Sabre, the XP-300 pioneered the wraparound windshield. While the XP-300 inspired the design of the front and upper quarter panels of 1953 and 1954 Buicks, and the headlight styling, wraparound windshield, and adjustable front seats of the 1954 Buick line, it ultimately had much less influence on future car design than the Le Sabre. The Le Sabre, on the other hand, inspired the tailfins on 1953 and 1954 Pontiacs as well as 1957 Cadillacs, the gull-wing bumpers on various Cadillacs, and even European designs such as the Spohn- bodied Veritas and the ZIS-112. In 1966, the XP-300 was refurbished and donated to the Alfred P. Sloan Museum in Flint, Michigan. In 1985, it was at the Sloan Museum alongside the 1956 Buick Centurion, Buick Wildcat II, Buick Y-Job, Cadillac Cyclone, and General Motors Le Sabre. In 1991, it was exhibited at the Museum of Transportation in Brookline, Massachusetts, along with four other GM cars. As of 2018, it is still at the Sloan Museum, where it is one of five Buick concept cars on display.

It is known as the world's largest amateur motocross race. It is the final stop for amateurs before they join the professional ranks. Suggested in the early 1980s by race promoter Dave Coombs as a national amateur race held away from the contestants \\"Home Ground\\", the first race was held in 1982. Loretta and her husband embraced the idea and today it's the premier race of the amateur Motocross world. The track is constructed annually at their 6,000 acres horse ranch and has room for 300 camp sites. It is an ideal spot to hold a family oriented Motocross racing event. Contestants must qualify through a series of events organized specifically for competing in one of the Amateur National Championship's 37 racing classes. Only the best 42 riders in each class get an invitation to compete. By design the six-day event is held the first week of August so that winners can try their hand at one of the 3 or 4 remaining events of the AMA outdoor Motocross season. The list of winners reads like the who's who of American motocross talent since the mid 1990s. Ricky Carmichael went pro in 1996 weeks after winning his final Loretta's title. James Stewart Jr. won seven amateur titles from 1998-01. Mike Alessi was the 2004 star. Ryan Villopoto won at Loretta's and turned pro in 2005. Ryan Dungey (2006), Jason Anderson, Cooper Webb and Adam Cianciarulo were all Loretta's champions. Past Loretta Lynn's champions include Jeremy McGrath, Travis Pastrana and Kevin Windham. In 2020, because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the event will be the undercard to Rounds 1 and 2 of the AMA Motocross Championship round to be held the next two weeks.

Taxonomy  This species was first described by George Howes in 1911 using specimens collected at Mr O'Connors house at Titahi Bay, Porirua and given the name Eucymatoge arenosus. George Vernon Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1928 publication. Hudson changed its epithet to arenosa. In 1988 John S. Dugdale discussed this change and assigned the species to a new genus Austrocidaria. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Howes described the adult moths of the species as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. As well as the type locality of Titahi Bay, A. arenosa has also been recorded as occurring at Moeraki near Oamaru, at Paekakariki, and near Cass.  Biology and life cycle  This species is attracted to blossoms, sugar and light. Adult moths are on the wing between November and March.

He also top-scored in Wellington's match against New South Wales in 1893-94, scoring 65 and adding 117 for the third wicket (out of an eventual team total of 180) with Alfred Holdship. He captained Wellington several times in the 1890s, and was a member of New Zealand's first victorious side when they beat New South Wales in 1895-96. He worked for the Government Insurance Department in Wellington. He had been ill for some time before his early death, and had had to miss the 1896-97 season for that reason.

The estimated cost of the design, site investigation, and construction of the TM‚ÄìCLKL (including associated works, like land reclamation) is about HK$46.71 billion. The project is expected to be fully commissioned by the end of 2020; the Southern Connection mainline opened on 24 October 2018 to tie in with HZMB's commissioning. History The contract to construct the Northern Connection tunnel (No. HY/2012/08) was awarded to the Dragages-Bouygues Joint Venture on 26 July 2013. It commenced on 5 August 2013. The contract to construct the southern section was awarded to Gammon Construction in June 2013. Design The tunnel portion will be approximately five kilometres in length. It will carry a two-lane dual carriageway. Construction The dual sub-sea tunnels are being bored up to 55 metres below sea level using the Tuen Mun - Chek Lap Kok TBM, the world's largest tunnel boring machine. Originally scheduled for opening in 2018, completion of the link has been delayed at least two years. It is now expected to open in the end of 2020.

Jadad Bechara (born August 9, 1963) is a Canadian-Colombian physician, philosopher, teacher, innovator and entrepreneur whose mission is to invite people - either as individuals or groups - to imagine and to create better ways of living as part of a flourishing planet. His work focuses on the creation of a pandemic of health and well-being through an approach known as radical 'glocal' innovation. He is also known as the researcher responsible for the development of the Jadad Scale, the first validated tool to assess the methodological quality of clinical trials. Jadad is the founder of the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation at the University Health Network, and Professor and Director of the Institute for Global Health Innovation and Equity in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and a Senior Fellow of Massey College, both in the University of Toronto, Canada.  Early years  Jadad was born in Medell√≠n, and grew up in Monter√≠a, Colombia. When he was a medical student, he conducted the first studies on the jargon, the chemical composition and the clinical implications of a drug called 'basuco' in Colombia, which soon became known worldwide as \\"crack\\" cocaine. He obtained his medical degree in 1986 at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, where he also became a specialist in anesthesiology and intensive care. In 1989, he received a grant from the British Council, and became Clinical Research Fellow at the Oxford Pain Relief Pain Unit, University of Oxford, where he trained in pain management and end of life care, and conducted research that demonstrated that neuropathic pain (\\"pain in numb areas due to nerve damage\\") could be relieved by opioids. This work led to the 1992 Overseas Research Student Award from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom, and his enrolment as a doctoral student in Balliol College, the oldest school in the University of Oxford, where he received in 1994 the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) in Clinical Medicine. His doctoral thesis, entitled \\"Meta-analysis of Controlled Trials on Pain Relief\\",Jadad AR- Bechara. Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials in Pain Relief. DPhil thesis, Balliol College, University of Oxford, 1994 https://books.google.com/books?id=3OXXSgAACAAJ was published and widely disseminated by the British National Health Service (NHS). It guided the development of new tools to identify and distill health-related information, methods to handle big data to support health-related decisions, and the validation of the Jadad scale.  The Jadad Scale  This was the first validated tool to assess the methodological quality of clinical trials in the world. As of 2019, it had been cited more than 15,000 times in the biomedical literature, being used to identify systematic differences among studies of the same healthcare interventions in more than 5,000 reviews of research in virtually all areas in the healthcare sector.https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=12978060954018601874&as;_sdt=2005&sciodt;=0,5&hl;=en The scale includes three components which are directly related to the reduction of bias: randomization, blinding, and the description of dropouts and withdrawals. These are presented as 'yes' or 'no' questions and produces scores that range from 0 to 5. Studies that receive a score of 2 points or less has been shown to exaggerate the produce treatment effects that are 35% larger on average than those produced by the trials with 3 or more points.  Life in Canada  In 1995, Jadad joined McMaster University in Canada, where he stayed until 1999. During this period, he was Director of the Health Information Research Unit;http://hiru.mcmaster.ca/hiru/ Health Information Research Unit Co-director of the Canadian Cochrane Centre and Network,http://ccnc.cochrane.org/ Canadian Cochrane Network and Center Associate Medical Director of the Program in Evidence-based on Cancer Care Ontario, Program in Evidence-Based Care (PEBC) (Program in Evidence-based Care of Cancer Care Ontario) and the Founding Director of the McMaster Evidence- based Practice Center http://www.fhs.mcmaster.ca/ceb/acts/epc.htm McMaster Evidence-based Practice Center (the first of its kind funded by the US government overseas), and Professor in the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics.http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/ceb/ Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics In 2000, Jadad moved to Toronto as the Inaugural Rose Family Chair in Supportive Care (a post he held until 2010), which enabled work on the reconceptualization of terms such as 'health' or a 'good death', as a means to guide the design, development, implementation and evaluation of innovations aimed at allowing people, even those living with complex chronic conditions or even terminal illnesses, to consider themselves to be healthy until the end. Simultaneously, he became the Founding Director of the Program in eHealth Innovation and Professor in the Department of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (now Institute),http : //ihpme.utoronto.ca/ and Professor in the Department of Anesthesia in the Faculty of Medicine, and in the Institute for Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. In this capacity, he led the creation of the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation, a simulator of the future, to study and optimize the use of the information and communication technologies (ICTs) before their introduction into the health system. The construction of the centre was supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the University Health Network, the largest hospital in Canada, where it is located. During this time, he also led the development of virtual clinical tools to transform the encounter between patients and health professionals, and new ways of using ICTs to respond to major threats to public health (e.g., obesity, complex chronic diseases and challenges at the end of life) and to allow the public (especially young people) to guide the creation of the future of the health system. To support this work, in 2002, Jadad was awarded the Canada Research Chair in eHealth Innovation (Tier 1), which he held until 2015. In 2016, he was appointed as Director of the Institute for Global Health Innovation and Equity, University of Toronto, an organization devoted to enabling collaborative efforts to tackle some of the biggest challenges to health in the 21st century.  Global activities  In 1992, Jadad became the inaugural President of the Colombian Science and Technology Network in the UK,http://opencharities.org/charities/1047026 Colombian Science and Technology Network which was part of the Caldas Network, supported by Colciencias, in order to connect the country's scientific diaspora, worldwide.Granes J, Morales a, JB Meyer. \\"Potentialities and Limitations of the Caldas Network of Colombian Researchers Abroad: Case Studies of Joint International Projects International Scientific Migrations 1996; 1-9 http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/. divers4 / 010022327-33.pdf In 1998, he authored the book with which the British Medical Journal celebrated the 50th anniversary of modern clinical trials. A new edition, co-written with Murray Enkin, was published in 2007. In 2008, Jadad led a global conversation about the meaning of health, supported by the British Medical Journal. In 2010, he was the Editor-in-Chief of \\"When people live with multiple chronic diseases: A collaborative approach to an emerging global challenge, one of the first books in medicine co-created globally using digital technologies. The same year, he chaired and convened the Global People-Centered eHealth Innovation Forum in the European Ministerial Conference; the First International Youth-Led Innovation Forum to promote entrepreneurship among millennials and centennials http://www.extremaduraeuropa.org/descarga.php?tipo_descarga=novedades&file;=1731 Youth-led Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Brussels and Extremadura; and the First International Summit on Family-Centered Health, supported by the government of China http://coinfo.istic.ac.cn/heh2010/index_1.html Summit on Human-centered and family-focused eHealth In 2011, the global conversation on the meaning of health generated a new conceptualization of the term as 'the ability to adapt and manage' the physical, mental or social challenges faced by individuals or communities throughout life. This approach is guiding collaborative efforts to identify what causes health, and innovative ways to make a pandemic of health possible. In 2018, such efforts led to the description of an integrated network of services that enabled 88.6% and 93.1% of its users to experience positive levels of self-reported health and well- being, while ranking first when compared with the performance of the health systems of the 36 countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Trust among payers, service-providing institutions, professionals and users of health services was the key to achieving these results with only 25% of the average expenditure across the OECD (US$500 per person annually. This is equivalent to US$860 when adjusted for purchasing power parity). In 2020, building on the experience with this integrated healthcare service network, an ecosystem for sustainable well-being was incubated in collaboration with a non-profit entity serving over four million people affiliated with 95,000 organizations. This enabled more than 12,000 employees to transform their workplace into an incubator of massively personalized well-being prescriptions, √† la carte, for themselves and their loved ones, which could then be offered to the organizations they serve. Lastly, it was possible to transform a large housing project for 100,000 members of low-income families into a leading-edge community-based living laboratory in which to nurture collaborative projects and scalable social enterprises that could contribute to the emergence of cities of well- being.Espinosa N, Anez M, Serra M, Espinal S, Rodriguez D, Jadad AR (Editor- in-Chief).

She was winner of the 2003 National Photography Award of Venezuela, editor of numerous publications and director of her own photographic studio. Through her photographic work she covered aspects such as ethnographic registry, rural culture, religious architecture, portraits and institutional photography.  Education  Thea Segall had two sisters, Miora and Natasa. Her parents were Andr√©s Segall and Golda Rubin. Between 1936 and 1947 she started her primary education, entering the Notre Dame de Sion school of nuns at the age of ten and then moving to a private French school where she ended her education. She lived through difficult moments during World War II, and her life was restricted between Burdujeni and Bucharest. At the end of this stage she aspired to study architecture, but at that time the students had to wait for a long time to enter university. When she was finally admitted for the School of Architecture she was already a photographer. In 1947 Segall started self-education in photographic theory to teach and take a course at the Photography Center of the School of Journalism with Austrian photographer and teacher Otto Grossar, with whom she later worked as his assistant.  Career  She same year her parents migrated to Israel with her younger sister Natasa. Between 1948 and 1957 she served as a photojournalist for the International News Agency AgerPress, founded by Grosar, in Bucharest. In 1957 she abandoned Bucharest with her sister Mioara due to the situation of the communist regime, traveling without passport with health problems to Denmark and later to Paris. In 1958 she arrived in Venezuela with a passport of the Red Cross during the government junta presided over by Wolfgang Larraz√°bal, shortly after the dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. Between 1958 and 1960 she started working for the Creole Petroleum Corporation and published her pictures in El Farol magazine. She understood authorial and research work, both social and photographic, in fishing areas of the Anzo√°tegui State coasts.

The movement advocates the acceptance of all bodies regardless of physical ability, size, gender, race, or appearance.  Viewpoints  Body- positive activists believe that size is just one of the many ways that our bodies are placed in a power and desirability hierarchy and are working alongside all social justice movements to bring attention to the intersectional problems across race, gender, sexuality, and physical capability. The goal of the movement is to address unrealistic beauty standards and to build the confidence of oneself and others. The movement sets forth the notion that beauty is a construct of society and poses that this construct should not infringe upon one's ability to feel confidence or self- worth. The idea surrounding the body positivity movement is centered around the notion that people need to love themselves to the fullest while accepting their physical traits. Body positivity has roots in the fat acceptance movement as well as the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. Body positivity differs from fat acceptance in that it is all encompassing and inclusive of all body types, whereas fat acceptance only advocates for individuals considered to be obese or overweight. The movement argues that neither fat-shaming nor skinny-shaming is acceptable, and that all body types can and should be celebrated. Although body positivity is perceived as the celebration as one's physical appearance as it is, women are highly motivated to advocate the normalization of body hair, bodily fluids, menstruation, and to challenge preconceived ideas regarding a woman's appearance.  History  = Victorian Dress Reform = As part of the first wave of feminism from the 1850s-1890s, there was a movement called the Victorian Dress Reform Movement that aimed to put an end to the trend of women having to modify their bodies through use of corsets and tightlacing in order to fit the societal standard of tiny waistlines. A minority of women participated in this tradition of conformity, but often ended up facing ridicule whether or not they were successful at shrinking their waistline. The practice of tight-lacing proved to have many negative health risks, and was also extremely uncomfortable for women who partook. Women were mocked for their egotism if they were not able to shrink their waistline, and they were criticized for too small a waistline if they were successful. This instilled a feeling of defeat in women during these times, as nothing they did seemed to satisfy their male counterparts. As part of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, women also fought for their right to dress in pants. Acceptance of all body types ‚Äì regardless of waist measurements ‚Äì was the major theme of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, and this was the first movement of its kind. =First wave= In 1967, New York radio host Steve Post held a \\"fat-in\\" in Central Park. He described the purpose of the event \\"was to protest discrimination against the fat.\\" Five Months after the \\"fat-in\\", Lew Louderback composed an essay entitled \\"More People Should be Fat!\\" as a result of him witnessing the discrimination his wife experienced as a result of her size. The piece initiated a new movement with goals of correcting fat-shaming, and the belief that being fat is always indicative of being unhealthy. The essay shed light on the discrimination fat people experience in America, and the culture surrounding fat-shaming. Louderback's contribution inspired the creation of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance in 1969 by Bill Fabrey, with the mission of ending discrimination based on body weight. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) was also dedicated to changing the dialogue surrounding obesity and health, and spread awareness of the distinction between being fat and being unhealthily obese. Health at Every Size (HAES) is an initiative that resulted from the creation of NAAFA, and set forth the concept that health is better determined by medical testing (e. g. heart rate and blood pressure) rather than empirical observation of one's weight. =Second wave (1990s)= The second wave of body positivity prioritized giving people of all sizes a place where they could comfortably come together and exercise. There were programs being made specifically for overweight people. A popular program at the time was \\"Making Waves\\" which was a weekly fat swim. Home exercise programs like Genia Pauli Haddon and Linda DeMarco's home exercise video series \\"Yoga For Round Bodies\\" were also made for those who were not comfortable joining a wellness community. =Third wave (2000s)= Since 2012, and the popularity launch of social media platforms, there has been a heightened presence of the movement. The movement challenged the unrealistic standards of feminine beauty like smooth skin, body size, and avoidance of any imperfections. Model and feminist Tess Holliday founded '@EffYourBeautyStandards', which brought an outpour of support to the body positive movement. After founding the movement, Holliday was signed to Milk Management, a large model agency in Europe as their first model over a size 20; she is a size 26. Instagram has been utilized as an advertising platform for the movement since. Pioneers connect with brands and advertisers to promote the movement. In 2016 Mattel released a new line of Barbie dolls under the name \\"Fashionistas\\" with three different body shapes, seven skin colors, twenty-two eye colors and twenty-four hairstyles to be more inclusive. Body artists have also helped promote and spread education about body postivity in the USA and UK, producing a number of notable outdoor nude painting displays for plus sized men and women.  Psychology  The Body Positivity Movement has been groundbreaking because of the effect it has on the psychology of a person. The movement encourages the partakers view self-acceptance and self- love as traits that dignify the person. The movement is based on the image basing their sense of self-worth heavily on their physical appearance, and how good they perceive themselves to look. This is referred to in the field of psychology as appearance-contingent self-worth, and can be highly detrimental to an individual's body image. The degree to which one feels proud of their physical appearance is referred to as appearance self-esteem. People who fall under the appearance-contingent self-worth umbrella put great effort into looking their best so that they feel their best. This is only good when an individual feels that they look good, but is extremely negative and anxiety- inducing when they do not. The psychology of the movement goes beyond feeling good. The movement is also recognized as an important part of physical and mental well being as it has been found that having a negative body image or otherwise known as body dissatisfaction has been linked to a range of physical and mental health problems like disordered eating, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, and more. The movement started spreading to create awareness around the difficult illnesses that some suffer like Anorexia and Bulimia; the movement is shedding light on subjects that brands and bigger companies refused to talk about. Big retailers like Aerie are acknowledging the power of influence they have on behavioral advertising and the positive impact this could have for a new generation.  Inclusion  The body positivity movement focuses largely on women, recognizing that societal beauty standards are more prevalent to women than they are to men. Men do, however often face similar societal pressures as women to fit a mold of a certain prototype of the \\"ideal\\" masculine man. Qualities that fit that mold are height, Rectus abdominis muscle or ‚Äúsix pack abs, a broad upper body, muscular arms, shoulders, pectoral muscles, etc. Men may face anxieties similar to women, and feel pressure to maintain or shape their bodies a certain way to fit the mold, and can certainly struggle with body image. Men and boys struggle with body dysmorphia and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa as well, though this is often less publicized. Body positivity remains largely concerned and discussed with regard to female populations, but still applies to people of all genders, ages, ethnicities, sexual preferences, religions, and sexes.  Brand influence and social media  The movement for body positivity has played a role in influencing marketing campaigns for major corporations. In 2004, Dove launched their \\"Real Beauty.\\" campaign, which commercials and advertisements depicted women of varying body types and skin tones in a manner that portrayed acceptance and positivity towards their bodies. On their website, Dove presents its _Dove Self-Esteem Project_ as a mission for \\"helping young people reach their full potential by delivering quality body confidence and self-esteem education\\". The company also partners with and raises money for eating disorder organizations. In 2017, the American women's underwear company Aerie launched a campaign called \\"AerieReal\\", in which the company promised to not retouch or photoshop their models, encouraging body positivity and body-acceptance despite features such as cellulite, stretch marks, or fat rolls. Aerie has begun featuring body positive influencers in their photo shoots and advertising campaigns, as well as plus sized models. To accommodate the last, the brand has launched a plus size clothing line. In 2019, Decathlon joined the efforts of other companies with their _#LeggingsForEverybody_ campaign, stating their mission as \\"to boost body confidence and support you in your fitness journey\\". Recently, paradigms on social media have been changing from pushing feminine beauty ideals to challenging those ideals through image related empowerment and inspiration. Several influencers such as AerieReal model Iskra Lawrence have been preaching body positivity, creating hashtags such as _#IWokeUpLikeThis_ , _#EffYourBeautyStandards_ , _#HonorMyCurves_ , _#CelebrateMySize_ , _#GoldenConfidence_ , and _#ImNoModelEither_. Although studies about social media and body image are still in their early stages, there seems to be a correlation between social media use and body image concerns. Body image tends to be positively or negatively affected by the content to which people are exposed on social media. The action of people uploading pictures of themselves appears to effectuate a negative body image. Criticism The body-positive movement was created to be inclusive of all body types. However, some feminists have critiqued that the movement has only worked to emphasize patriarchal beliefs rather than promote beliefs of true feminism. The idea of posting an unedited photo of your body to embrace it is what Gender scholar Amber E Kinser determined as \\"false feminism\\". Kinser critiqued that these acts of resistance do not challenge patriarchy and these kinds of campaigns do not deteriorate the validity of the argument of women's worth being directly correlated to their physical appearance. Additional criticism denounces that while the body-positivity movement changed what is currently acceptable, it does not dive into the reasons why people have such relationships with their bodies and put the responsibility of feeling better with the body on the person within it. Others criticize the movement for refusing to acknowledge the fact that there is not just one approach that is right for everyone. Others criticize it because in their eyes one can not be \\"healthy at any size\\" like the movement suggests. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are in the top 7 reasons why people die in the United States and all are related to obesity, they thus think that telling people that they should just accept their body for how it is, is detrimental to their well-being. This does not mean that people with weight issues are bad, but that the movement which encourages those who do have weight issues to simply accept their bodies for how they are when they are clearly not healthy is literally encouraging early death.

(From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates and were often distributed out of numerical order. Omeroviƒá did not automatically receive a mandate by virtue of his position on the list, but he was included in the DOS's assembly delegation all the same.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84). See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via LegislationOnline, accessed 28 February 2017.

In April 2002, Omeroviƒá's wing of Social Democracy merged into a new group called the Social Democratic Party (not to be confused with another party of the same name founded in 2014). Social Democratic Party (2002‚Äì07) In May 2002, Omeroviƒá represented the Social Democratic Party in talks between the DOS and the Kosovo Serb Return Coalition on the latter's future in Kosovo politics.\\"Serbian ruling bloc, Kosovo Serb coalition agree on coalition's organization,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European - Political, 16 May 2002 (Source: Tanjug news agency, Belgrade, in English 0743 gmt 16 May 02).

Omeroviƒá chaired the Serbian assembly's committee for inter-ethnic relations in 2003. In August of that year, he stated that Albanian terrorist groups in Kosovo were undertaking ethnic cleansing against Serbs and other non-Albanians and urged the United Nations Security Council to take meaningful action to ensure \\"the disarmament of all those who have weapons and unlawfully carry them, as well as the undertaking of measures to protect all ethnic communities, especially the Serbs.\\"\\"Serbian official urges UN to re-examine results so far in Kosovo,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 18 August 2003 (Source: FoNet news agency, Belgrade, in Serbian 1018 gmt 18 Aug 03).

The majority of the resettlements were done with careful planning by the government in order to strengthen the empire. For example, a population might be moved around to spread agricultural techniques or develop new lands. It could also be done as punishment for political enemies, as an alternative to execution. In other cases, the selected elites of a conquered territory were moved to the Assyrian empire, to enrich and increase knowledge in the empire's centre. Oded Bustenay in 1979 estimated that about 4.4 million people (¬± 900,000) were relocated over a 250-year period. One instance, the relocation of the Israelites in late eighth century BCE was described in Biblical passages and came to be known as the Assyrian captivity.  Types  Forced deportation and subsequent resettlement were used as tools of political domination and subjugation to maintain control over conquered people groups. Large population groups were systematically transferred between different regions within the empire to strengthen their political unity or put down possible rebellions. Imperial administrators planned the population transfers, taking into account political, economic, and cultural considerations. For example, people might be moved to develop new lands or introduce agricultural techniques in other provinces, to rebuild cities destroyed during siege and conquest, or to improve upon existing cities within the Assyrian heartland. This type of planned resettlements began during the 9th century BCE and became widespread by the late 8th century BCE, continuing for the next several centuries. Resettlement could also be done as punishment for political enemies. For example, in 720 BCE Sargon II resettled 6,300 Assyrians who were involved in a power struggle against him from the heartland of the empire to the newly conquered city of Hamat (modern Hama, Syria). By ordering resettlement instead of execution of his enemies, the king displayed his mercy, political threats were removed from the empire's center, and the deportees were also beneficial in the reconstruction of the war-torn city. In other cases, Assyria also relocated people from newly conquered territories to its heartland. Typically, the elite section of the population was selected in a careful process. This group included highly skilled people: craftsmen, scholars and cultural elites, whose resettlement in the empire's heartland would bring knowledge and wealth. The empire's capitals, Nineveh, Kalhu and Assur were well-populated with people from throughout the empire, who were instrumental in the building of Assyria's lasting monuments, including the famous Royal Library of Ashurbanipal.  Logistics  The Assyrian state supervised and planned the move to be as efficient as possible. The deportees were meant to arrive intact, ready to be placed work and resettle in their new environment. Some surviving Assyrian art depicts deportees traveling with their family and possessions with beasts of burden in tow, while other pieces depict the displaced peoples marching while shackled or tied up, or while being pulled along with hooks placed in their cheeks or noses. Ride animals were used, as well as boxes and vessels to carry supplies needed for resettlement. State officials were directly involved, for example a letter from an official to Tiglath-pileser III showed that the official provided the \\"food supplies, clothes, a waterskin, [...] shoes and oil\\" and was waiting for donkeys to be available before sending a convoy of deportees.  Magnitude  A 1979 estimate by Bustenay Oded‚Äîextrapolating based on written documents‚Äîestimated that 4.4 million people, plus or minus 900,000, were relocated over a 250-year period. 85% of them were resettled in the Assyrian heartland.  Status of deportees  Surviving documents do not talk directly about the social and legal status of deportees, but historians attempted to infer them indirectly, especially from documents mentioning people with non-Assyrian names in Assyrian heartlands‚Äîpresumably many of such people were deportees. The treatment of the deportees varied from case to case and it is hard to generalize, often those who were untrained were enslaved and put to work on massive building projects, while those who worked in various professions were placed to work according to their training. Those who worked in agriculture were assigned lands to work on, with a similar status to that of others within the empire. Many worked in high-skilled jobs, including as craftsmen, scholars, and merchants. The most educated and trained deportees were placed in royal service, and those willing to adopt the Assyrian identity and gods were able to join the Assyrian military. The state encouraged the mixing of deportees and native inhabitants where they lived in order to abolish their previous ethnic and religious identity in favor of a new shared \\"Assyrian\\" identity.  Biblical reference  The resettlement of Israelites conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire were mentioned in the Old Testament, which came to be called the \\"Assyrian captivity\\". The first occurred in 734 BCE and is related in . The Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser III defeated an alliance which included King Pekah of Israel, occupied Northern Palestine and then ordered a large number of Israelites to relocate to Assyria proper. The second deportation started after 722 BCE and related in . Pekah's successor King Hoshea rebelled against Assyria in 724 BCE. King Shalmaneser V (Tiglath- Pileser's successor) besieged Samaria, which was finally captured in 722 BCE by Shalmaneser's successor Sargon II. After the fall of Samaria, 27,280 people (according to Assyrian records) were deported to various places throughout the empire, mainly to Guzana in the Assyrian heartland, as well as to the cities of the Medes in the eastern part of the empire (modern-day Iran). The cities of Medes were only conquered by Assyria in 716 BCE, six years after the fall of Samaria, suggesting that the relocation took years to plan before it was implemented. At the same time, people from other parts of the empire were resettled in the depopulated region.

Humans apply logical intuition in proving mathematical theorems, validating logical arguments, developing algorithms and heuristics, and in related contexts where mathematical challenges are involved. The ability to recognize logical or mathematical truth and identify viable methods may vary from person to person, and may even be a result of knowledge and experience which are subject to cultivation. The ability may not be realizable in a computer program by means other than genetic programming or evolutionary programming., section 330 \\"Artificial Intelligence via Evolutionary Processes\\"  History  Plato and Aristotle considered intuition a means for perceiving ideas, significant enough that for Aristotle, intuition comprised the only means of knowing principles that are not subject to argument. Henri Poincar√© distinguished logical intuition from other forms of intuition. In his book The Value of Science, he points out that: The passage goes on to assign two roles to logical intuition: to permit one to choose which route to follow in search of scientific truth, and to allow one to comprehend logical developments. Bertrand Russell, though critical of intuitive mysticism, pointed out that the degree to which a truth is self-evident according to logical intuition can vary, from one situation to another, and stated that some self-evident truths are practically infallible: Kurt G√∂del demonstrated based on his incompleteness theorems that intuition- based propositional calculus cannot be finitely valued. G√∂del also likened logical intuition to sense perception, and considered the mathematical constructs that humans perceive to have an independent existence of their own. Under this line of reasoning, the human mind's ability to sense such abstract constructs may not be finitely implementable.  Discussion  Dissent regarding the value of intuition in a logical or mathematical context may often hinge on the breadth of the definition of intuition and the psychological underpinning of the word. Dissent regarding the implications of logical intuition in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing may similarly hinge on definitions. However, similarity between the potentially infinite nature of logical intuition posited by G√∂del and the hard problem of consciousness posited by David Chalmers suggest that the realms of intuitive knowledge and experiential consciousness may both have aspects that are not reducible to classical physics concepts.

Long considered a luxury, the cuisine is especially prevalent in Beijing. The main ingredients are pork, pork lung, pork intestines, pork liver, tofu, and some may add fermented bean curd or chives sauce. It is served with bing bread.  Origin and history  The origins of luzhu huoshao can be traced back to the Qing dynasty as a palace food in Peking. According to legends, \\"su zao rou\\" () was a dish invented by Zhang Dongguan as a tribute for Qianlong Emperor during one of Qianlong' inspection to Suzhou around 1970 and it was the origin of luzhu huoshao . Unlike other cook Zhang Dongguan usually combines different types of herbs and spices in cooking, and his technique impressed Qianlong emperor, so Zhang eventually became the lead cook in the palace. As time goes by, the recipe of \\"su zao rou\\" spread to the out side of palace as well, and many people tried to imitate the cooking style and eat like an emperor. However the key ingredient, which is pork belly, was not very affordable for many people at that time. Therefore, pork lung, intestines and many other type of pork offal were used as a substitute for pork belly, in order to make the most people able to afford this dish. Hence, luzhu huoshao was formed over generations, and since then, it has become one of the most well-known Beijing street food, and still in fashion nowadays.  Popularity  Much like Stinky tofu, luzhu huoshao also has a very strong odor, and it could be a challenge for people who haven't ever tried before. However, it is still one of the most famous Beijing traditional street foods, and a \\"must try\\" for local Beijing people. Cui Daiyuan (Â¥îÂ≤±Ëøú) is a contemporary writer from Beijing, and in his book \\"The flavor of Beijing\\" (‰∫¨Âë≥ÂÑø), Cui has described luzhu huoshao as \\"a food that allows the poor people to experience the superior life\\" (Á©∑‰∫∫Ëß£È¶ãÁöÑÁé©ÊÑè) in the chapter for luzhu huoshao. In his opinion, Beijing's street foods such as luzhu huoshao provides a chance for the poor people to experience how the foods in palace taste like. Luzhu huoshao was originated from palace food, hence the ingredients were costly for many families in the olden days. Nevertheless, many people also wanted to know how does the food for the emperor tastes like, so they replaced the expensive ingredients such as pork belly with cheap ingredients such as pork lung and intestines, and created their own version of \\"palace food\\". Nowadays, eating luzhu huoshao is more like a custom that Beijing people feels attached with. Not everyone would accept the strong odor, but people who likes it certainly feels attached to it and the traditional Beijing culture. Therefore, you can still find many restaurants that sells luzhu huoshao in Beijing, or even overseas.  Characteristics  There are certain characteristics that are expected from a well made luzhu huoshao, which also make it a unique Beijing street food. Similar to baodu, the meat in a well made luzhu huoshao is supposed to be reasonably chewy, neither too tough nor falling apart. It might have an unappetizing appearance, but the taste should be rather complex and salty, with a sense of herb and soy sauce. The huo shao (Bing (bread)) is soaked in the soup to flavor it, and it should be juicy rather than sticky. Pork offal would have a strong odor due to its property, but it should still be fresh made, without any tacky taste or smell.

However, people who know the \\"Godadi\\" word will always picture embroidered cloth that is used as a blanket. History In 19s, there were no factories or production outlets for woollen or cotton blankets at villages of Gujarat. In the beginning, unused pieces of cloths like a piece of a shirt, sari and other clothes, were collected over time and with a design in mind to make a good blanket, girls from the Bhuj, Gujarat used to sew these pieces of cloth together, after cutting them into different shapes. Over time, pieces of cotton became available in the market which helped girls and housewives to make a well designed blanket by embedding them with different designs. The tradition of making handmade blankets has continued into the 21st century. Many village people from Kutch, Gujarat export their blankets to different states of India. Due to consideration of heritage designs, this types of blankets are still popular and used by many people in India. Availability of handmade Godadi Till date, there are many places and stores in Kutch where handmade Godadis are sold.

The raw water is primarily treated in the coarse screen building by using 7Nos 3000-micron automatic self-cleaning filters. Water transmitted from the raw water tank is treated at the highest level within 20 seconds passing through 200 micron filters firstly and then 0.02 micron filter modules. The treatment of the water is carried out in 5280 membrane filters. This process is performed mechanically closed environment by application of automation controls without implementing any chemical treatment and natural mineral content of the water is fully preserved. Water produced in the pants meets the standards accepted by the World Health Organization as well as other international organizations. Some quality indicators of water processed in the filters (chlorine residue, cloudiness, pH, TOC) are controlled online. More parameters of raw and treated water are studied and quality indicators are fully controlled in the laboratory of the complex. The volume, pressure of the water transmitted to the plant, each stage of process of water, storing, and transportation processes are fully automated. All technological processes are managed in the SCADA control center.

It was vetted and accorded utility model protection by the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) under the Harare protocol and registered by the Uganda Registration Services Bureau in 2017. The instrument has been a major instrument in all Janzi Band and Ssewa's performances since its inception, as well as being adopted by other musicians. History Ssewa Ssewa wanted to create something which was new and specially created by himself. He had the idea of removing and replacing the nails on the adungu with a more acceptable material in 2014, after one of the members of his band was not allowed to transport this instrument through Copenhagen Airport because it had metal nails as pegs, these being considered a security threat. He later said that he was spurred into action after his adungu broke. The first janzi was created in 2015 and it was recognized as an instrument and patented by ARIPO and registered by the Ugandan government in 2017. The name originates from the name of the band, which in turn was named after the local name of a grasshopper, because they wanted their music to fly around the world. Apart from Sswewa Ssewa and the Janzi Band, the instrument has been used by other folk and world musicians, featuring in live performances by Feridah Rose in Denmark and Giovanni Kiyingi. Ssewa Ssewa has taken the janzi to universities and music schools in Germany and Sweden, and in May 2019 will be conducting workshops in Switzerland and Germany on the janzi as well as Uganda's traditional instruments. =Official launch in Uganda= On 13 April 2019, Ssewa Ssewa held the official Ugandan launch for the janzi, at Katonga Hall in Kampala. At the launch, Lt.-Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba urged Ugandan musicians not to abandon their cultural roots, and looked forward to the janzi being adopted by other musicians around the world. Haka Mukiga, Price and Keneth Mugabi played at the event. Ssewa Ssewa started his performance with Bob Marley‚Äôs No Woman, No Cry. He then told a variation on the story of the instrument's conception, saying that it was after his adungu was broken and he was waiting for the carpenter to come and fix it that he thought of a way to modernise the instrument and developed the janzi. The whole band then played a selection of songs from their album Eka. Structure and tuning The janzi has two long wooden necks, with a narrow space in between. It is made up of 22 strings, 11 strings on either side, which are attached to the sound box with plastic strings. The janzi is amplified and can be connected on any sound systems. The inventor used guitar pegs instead of nails as used in the traditional stringed instrument of northwestern Uganda, the adungu. \\"I had to think of how better and modern I wanted it to look like, so I decided to use wood entirely which would give me a distinctive sound that is quite different from the usual Adungu\\" (Ssewa). It is tuned in two scales, the diatonic and pentatonic scales. The 11 strings on the left are tuned in the diatonic scale and the 11 strings on the right in the pentatonic scale.

Genjer grows abundantly in Java and is known as a food that peasants can rely on in times of hardship. The song was first recorded during the Japanese Occupation in 1942 by Muhammad Arief, arranged for angklung; the Japanese Military Occupation Government used the song as propaganda to encourage Indonesians to live austerely during wartime as crops were diverted to feed soldiers on the frontlines, leading to widespread famine and starvation. Hersri Setiawan, Aku Eks-Tapol The propaganda campaign introduced Indonesians throughout Java to the song. In the late 1950s and early 60s, Genjer-genjer gained popularity throughout Indonesia, and the country‚Äôs political left began to take interest in the song. The song‚Äôs themes of peasant hardship and perseverance resonated with the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) in particular. In the 60s, the song gained more familiarity and popularity with Indonesians as it had air time on television through TVRI (Televisi Republik Indonesia) and radio through RRI (Radio Republik Indonesia). Well-known musicians also came to record Genjer- genjer, most notably Bing Slamet and Lilis Suryani. Hersri Setiawan, Aku Eks- Tapol In 1965, Genjer-genjer became entangled in the New Order‚Äôs mythology of the September 30th Movement, an abortive left-wing coup that took place on October 1st, 1965 that Suharto used as a pretext to launch a counter-coup and bring his own authoritarian government to power, which he called the New Order. During the coup, seven generals were abducted by the September 30th movement and then killed at a site called Lubang Buaya. In order to bolster its own legitimacy and further discredit the Indonesian Left, the New Order fabricated a story about how during the killings members of the PKI youth organization and Gerwani (The PKI women‚Äôs organization - Gerakan Wanita Indonesia) danced and took part in orgies as they mutilated the generals while singing songs, including Genjer-genjer. John Roosa, Pretext for Mass Murder Shadow Play The only evidence that the New Order presented for the song‚Äôs use during the killings is unreliable and fabricated, however, stemming from confessions extracted through torture and a book of Indonesian folk songs that included lyrics for Genjer-genjer found left behind at Halim Airforce Base (the coup headquarters). Hersri Setiawan, Aku Eks-Tapol Shadow Play Given Genjer-genjer‚Äôs connection to the politics and culture of the left and its alleged connection to the September 30th Movement, the New Order quickly banned the song. The ban on the song ended in 1998 with Suharto‚Äôs resignation and the end of the New Order. Since 1998, more and more Indonesian musicians have begun to perform the song, though the stigma that became attached to it during the days of the New Order has not yet dissipated fully from Indonesian society. The American rock band Dengue Fever also recorded a version of Genjer-genjer in 2016, though with lyrics in Khmer.

Read is known as a theatre theorist and cultural activist, with scholarly interests in ethics and the everyday, performed communities, event architecture, and subjectivities of capitalism. Read's work stands as a critique of modernist theatrical orthodoxy critically contesting Peter Brook's idealism of the ‚Äòempty space' awaiting its theatre, a tabula rasa for professionals to enter and exit at will. Read counter intuitively perceives theatre to have been superseded in that populated place by the quotidian performances of everyday life, those that remain for good and ill. Read took up this provocative critique on the National Theatre stage in London in 1994 in public dialogue with Brook's space-designer Jean-Guy Lecat, and joins others in his scepticism of the colonial fantasy of theatre's ‚Äòempty space', including most assertively Rustom Bharucha in Theatre & The World (1993).  Life  Born in Southend-on-Sea, the posthumous child of William Alan Read, and Veronica Read, he was educated at Westcliff High School. He obtained his bachelor's degree from University of Exeter in 1979. He took his PhD at the University of Washington, Seattle between 1979 and 1981, and was awarded his doctorate in 1989, following a decade working at the Rotherhithe Theatre Workshop in the Docklands area of South East London. Read is the partner of the artist Beryl Robinson. They live in West London and the Commune of Truinas. They have two daughters Florence who is a writer, and Hermione a fashion designer.  Career  Read is the author of Theatre & Everyday Life: An Ethics of Performance (1993), Theatre, Intimacy & Engagement: The Last Human Venue (2008), Theatre in the Expanded Field: Seven Approaches to Performance (2014), and Theatre & Law (2016). During a period of directing the Talks programme at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London at the ‚Äòheight of the theory' in the 1990s, Read edited two volumes: The Fact of Blackness: Frantz Fanon and Visual Representation, with original artwork by Steve McQueen (1996), and Architecturally Speaking: Practices of Art, Architecture and the Everyday (2000). Read taught at Dartington College of Arts in the 1980s, coordinating the Council of Europe Workshop on Theatre and Communities with Colette King and Peter Hulton in 1981‚Äì1983, and working at the Rotherhithe Theatre Workshop with David Slater through the rest of the decade. In the early 1990s he moved to Barcelona writing on street ceremony, gegants, castells and corre foc (human-dragon fire runners), completing the monograph Theatre & Everyday Life (1993) documenting these ethnographies of the everyday and their relations to risk and safety. In 1993 Read curated the London International Festival of Theatre Daily Dialogues, a sequence of 21 daily public seminars with artists, theorists and theatre companies engaged in the LIFT programme. Read reprised the work biennially for successive LIFT festivals over the next decade, concluding notably with the day-long symposium ‚ÄòVoice Ruin Play' (2001) that brought together for the first time Romeo Castellucci and Societas Raffaello Sanzio with key figures in the UK theatre community. Read was appointed Director of Talks at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in the mid 1990s working alongside Helena Reckitt. Together they were responsible for curating and chairing more than 500 public talks over four years, with key figures in the cultural field, including philosophers Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, Judith Butler, Alphonso Lingis, race theorists Homi Bhabha, bell hooks, Paul Gilroy, musicians Laurie Anderson, Mark E Smith, Patti Smith, novelists Bret Easton Ellis, Nadine Gordimer, SE Hinton, Laurie Moore, Tahar Ben Jelloun, film directors Alejandro Jodorowsky, Raul Ruiz, Wong Kar-wai, artists Mary Kelly, Vija Celmins, John Currin, Orlan, cultural theorists Beatriz Colomina, John Berger, Sander Gilman, and space makers Doreen Massey, Richard Sennett and Edward Soja. Talks series such as Spaced Out (Architecture), Addressing Dressing (Fashion), Uncanny Encounters (Psychoanalytic theory), The Scapegoat (Cultural theory), Incarcerated with Artaud and Genet (Theatrical archaeology), Working With Fanon (Race and radical psychiatry), influenced the way cultural theory was publicly addressed through the 1990s and the ‚Äòtalks' industry that was to follow at Tate Modern, The Institute of Ideas, The School of Life, TED and Intelligence Squared. In 1997 Read was appointed the first Professor of Theatre at Roehampton Institute (subsequently Roehampton University) and then in 2006 the first Professor of Theatre in the 180-year history of King's College London. At King's College, Read established the Performance Foundation, conceived and built the Anatomy Theatre & Museum in collaboration with the Centre for e Research (2010), planned and built the Inigo Rooms in the East Wing of Somerset House with the support of King's Business (2012), and initiated King's Cultural Partners, latterly Kings Cultural Institute under the directorship of Deborah Bull (2012). Read was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by Dartington College of Arts in 2003, an Arts and Humanities Research Board five-year Major Award (2000‚Äì2005), a Leverhulme Major Award (2010‚Äì2013), mentored the last of the AHRC Creative Fellowships with Greg Whelan of Lone Twin (2011‚Äì2016), and secured an EPSRC three-year Bridging the Gaps Award with Mark Miodownik and the King's Material Library, (2011‚Äì2014). Read is Faculty Professor of the University of California Berkeley, for whom he established the annual London Theatre Capital Programme, and since 1991 has been an affiliated Professor of Boston University teaching theatre students from coast to coast US campuses.  Artistic collaborations  Read's collaborations with the theatre companies Het Werkteater, Societas Raffaello Sanzio Forced Entertainment, Goat Island, Battersea Arts Centre, Forster & Heighes, the curatorial producers Artangel, and the artist-activists Platform, have been long-term relations that took the form of advocacy, infrastructural support, advisory roles, talks-curation and engagement between theatre makers, the academy and the public realm. Read has performed with William Pope. L as part of ‚ÄòThe Frequently Asked' curated by Tim Etchells and Adrian Heathfield at Tanzquartier Vienna in 2007, designed sound work for Massimo Bartolini's ‚ÄòThe Human Voices', a site specific work in a disused 1939 ENAL pool in Vercelli, Italy, as part of PSi ‚ÄòAffective Archives', 2010, created lecture performances such as ‚ÄòThe Poor Law' to mark the centenary of Daniel Paul Schreber's death, at Castle Sonnenstein on the River Elbe 2011, read his novel The White Estuary: Man with the Reason of History Missing over three six-hour sessions as part of PSi 18 Leeds (2012), participated in Tuija Kokkonen's all- night performance ‚ÄòChronopolitics with Dogs and Trees' at Stanford University (2013), occupied Tate Modern with his performance teach-in ‚ÄòThe English Garden Effect' as part of the climate crisis Deadline Festival 2015, exchanged public correspondence with the philosopher Cecilia Sjoholm for the TOPublic Festival (2016) , and turned the institution of the lecture inside out for Justyna Scheuring's performance ‚ÄòThe Past Is Ahead of Us' at King's College London in 2016. Read is an essayist and reader for radio broadcast including for BBC Radio 4, Plato's Cave (2012), Dreadful Trade (2014), and Soul Estuary (2016), produced by Sarah Blunt with sound by Chris Watson.  Influence  In support of radical inclusion in the field Read's work simultaneously engages theoretical study, performance practices and pedagogic commitments. Steve Tompkins of the architectural practice Haworth Tompkins, has recognised the significance of Read's concepts of the everyday, cultural accretion, and event ghosting in their winning submissions for the Royal Court Theatre and Young Vic Theatre in London. Tompkins has written: ‚ÄúRead has been an excellent sounding board, a provocative collaborator, an encouraging enthusiast and a constructive critic for my work.‚Äù Indeed, what Susannah Clapp of The Observer has described as ‚ÄòTompkinsesque' characteristics of theatrical design, could be said to share significant features with Read's long running concerns for archaeologies of site and the theatre as memory machine. The Homo Novus Festival in Riga took up Read's concept of ‚ÄòThe Last Human Venue' as an overarching curatorial umbrella for their 2013 international festival with artists including Monika Pormale, Nomadi and Valters Sillis responding to Read's idea of performance at the end of its ecological tether measuring the humans' distance from their inevitable extinction. The Chicago-based Every House Has A Door adopted Read's concept of Abandoned Practices, itself following the work of Isabelle Stengers on eliminativism in an annual summer school in Prague/Chicago and a project web site www.abandonedpractices.org. The Artist/Activist group Platform, and filmmakers Desperate Optimists, have both responded to Read's conception of ‚Äòcivility' and the problematic question of the ‚Äòcivic centre' with work in a variety of media including peripatetic performance and film. Read's work is anthologised and widely referenced including Lizbeth Goodman's featuring of Theatre & Everyday Life in The Routledge Reader in Politics and Performance (2000), with subsequent work on definitions of performance in Adrian Heathfield's Live: Art and Performance (2004), the miniature and the infra-thin in Richard Gough's A Performance Cosmology (2006), friendship in Lone Twin's Good Luck Everybody (2013), vegetal life in Patricia Vieira's The Green Thread (2015), repetition in Eirini Kartsaki's On Repetition (2016), and the financialisation of childhood in Performance Research ‚ÄòOn Childhood' (2017). Read's work is frequently cited with key figures in the field both critiquing and referencing his ideas: Shannon Jackson singling out Read's concepts of ‚Äòre-association and reassembly' (after Bruno Latour) in Social Works (2011), Nigel Thrift adopting Read's origination of ‚Äòshowciology' in ‚ÄòThe Transformation of Contemporary Capitalism' (2009), Joe Kelleher's consideration of Read's conception of politics in Theatre & Politics (2009), Hansen and Kozel on Read's figuring of ethics in ‚ÄòEmbodied Imagination' (2007), and Nicholas Ridout's reflections on Read's theory of theatrical failure in Stage Fright, Animals and Other Theatrical Problems (2006).  Recent work  Read's more recent work on theatrical ‚Äòimmunity', reversing the communitarian presumption of performance, might be considered a logical inversion of the tenets of Theatre & Everyday Life rather than a negation of them. In this work Read has challenged those with investments in terminologies of social theatre, community theatre and political theatre to act upon more nuanced distinctions between aesthetic, cultural and political priorities. Read figures the ‚Äòemaciated spectator', in critical relation to Jacques Ranciere's voluntaristic ‚Äòemancipated spectator', measuring their distance from others in the audience and gauging their relations with the immersive event that seeks their submission to its spectacle. This agency of measurement is always operable in relation to an ending, aesthetic (the show always ends), and ecological (human extinction is inevitable), that invites Read to name the theatre ‚Äòthe last human venue'. Read's gently cynical tone, especially in his widespread reviewing of the work of leading figures in the disciplinary field, such as Richard Schechner and Peggy Phelan, Tracy Davies and Susan Bennett, Ric Knowles, and monumental productions such as The Sultan's Elephant by Royal de Luxe, has teased and challenged those with cultural capital, seeking the funny bone of a discipline that has made so much currency from others' labours. The same reviews encourage the writer Caridad Svich to describe Read as ‚Äòinimitable'. Read has attracted less benign responses for his longstanding polemical critique of identity politics that fall short of intersectional ambitions, Read maintaining that ‚Äòradical particularity' inadvertently obscures the politically inclusive urgency of a ‚Äògeneral theory' of class disempowerment. Equally his work on ‚Äòpseudo action', the deceptive, voluntaristic vocabulary of a theatre wish-fulfilling its social and political purpose in the place of a slower but more honest political agency, has been forcefully countered by a number of commentators, the most prominent of whom has been Janelle Reinelt in her valedictory lecture to the field at Warwick University in 2015, ‚ÄòWhat I Came to Say' (2015). Read in turn responds to these claims of political retreat in his keynote to the Performance Philosophy Convention at the Prague Academy in 2017, ‚ÄòThe Dark Theatre: Ethnographies of the Capitalocene' in which he retraces his steps over three decades of political and theatrical commitment to the neighbourhood and dockland warehouse in which his thinking about everyday life and theatre were grounded.

He turned pro as a snooker player aged 27 and was active as a professional From 1982 to 1996. Early life Cripsey came from a family of showmen who have been running a ‚ÄòWall of death‚Äô since the 1920s, a round wall for motorcycle tricks in their hometown of Skegness. At age 12, he himself became banked driver. He lost a thumb in a riding accident. Snooker career Cripsey was the first player to be coached by Derek Hill - known as Big Del. Hill discovered Ronnie O'Sullivan in the early 1990s and was the coached many top players, such as Graeme Dott. Cripsey began his career at the professional tournaments in the 1982‚Äì83 season and reached the 1983 World Snooker Championship following a win over Dennis Hughes during the round of the last 48. In 1984-85 he reached the second round at the International Open and the UK Championship . He was then ranked 89th in the world rankings. In the 1985‚Äì86 season he twice reached the last 32, in the Classic and in the UK Championship, in Cliff Wilson and John Spencer he beat two players from the top 24 in the world rankings. In 1987, Bill Werbeniuk was defeated at the British Open in the last 32. By this point his ranking had risen to 48th place. In the season 1987-88 the Englishman achieved his biggest ranking success: There was also another round of the last 32 at the British Open. Although he still ranked 46th in the ranking, he had shown victories over Barry West and Eugene Hughes that he could compete with top 32 players. The 1988-89 started badly but The Classic stood out again, after a victory over Steve Longworth , he was once again in the last 32. Cripsey was no longer in the top 64 world rankings by 1990. In a tournament with a special format, the snooker shoot-out in which a single frame was played he achieved his best professional result. He reached the quarter-finals and then lost just with 62:66 against Alan McManus he also slipped out of the top 100. In 1991 the professional tour was opened for everyone. Although he was able to remain professional, but had to play preliminary rounds, before the last 128. Overall he won only 4 games in the year. At the Asian Open he played against Sean Storey . Although his opponent conceded 13 consecutive Cripsey lost the frame 92‚Äì93. With 185 points scored in a frame, they set a new record. Cripsey lost the match 1‚Äì5. The following year, Cripsey managed only one victory in a minor-ranking tournament, where there were hardly any ranking points, and so he fell from the top 128. In 1993/94 he therefore had to play more pre- qualifying rounds. He did not come reach the last 128 once. The following year he played only two tournaments and in 1995-96 only the pre-qualification of the World Snooker Championship. After that, he gave up the professional tournaments at the age of 41 years. Later career During his snooker career, he gave up the family business, but by the mid-90s he had returned to it. In 2004 he gave up the steep wall for reasons of age and lack of successors.

It is located in the Sindkheda taluka of the Dhule district on the Maharashtra State Highway 6 (MH SH 6) Etymology This village is more commonly referred to as \\"Zirve- Dhawade\\" to specify its location. Geography Dhawade has a total village area of 180,316.72 m¬≤ ha. Out of that, 2,700 ha of land is under cultivation, of which 900 ha is irrigated and 1,800 ha is rain fed. Of the remaining, 285.82 ha is under forest, 53 ha under village habitation, 0.2 ha. is burial ground, and the balance is under roads, path, streams, and rocky outcrops. The topography of the land within the village boundary varies from hilly to plains. The forest areas are hilly with plateau at the top. They are cris- crossed with enumerable streams. The areas under the cultivation is generally flat especially where it is irrigated. The flood irrigation is practiced which necessitates level field. The land under rain fed cultivation is somewhat undulating . The soil type varies from black cotton to murrumy. Soil is generally black cotton in flatter area. It is reddish to buff in coloured along gentle slopes. The soils tend to be reddish with high proportion of murum in areas which are exposed. In highly eroded areas and steep slopes in hilly area the underlying rock is seen exposed. The depth of the soil varies from few centimeters to 20 meters within the village limits. There is small river the Iraas (Hiraasan as per the state records) on the bank of which this village is located. The other two small streams are Waghad and Bhalkhai. There are three water bodies all within the village limits. The first one the minor irrigation tank on the Iraas river, the second, percolation tank on Waghad stream and the third, percolation tank on Bhalkhai stream. The stored resource is small in extent and quantity but suffice to meet the village needs of water for drinking and other domestic use. All these water bodies have been boon to the village as they have been recharging ground water in their downstream where in the agricultural land is laying and farmers have dug up well for irrigation. The total forest area is 739.144 ha, out of which 285.79 ha is assigned to the Joint Forest Management Committee of Dhawade. The forest area is identified by the compartment numbers in forest records like the survey numbers in land records. The entire forest area is vested in the state government of Maharashtra. Wild animals like black buck, fox, hare, hyena, wolf, and wild boar are reported in this forest, but the population is very small. During recent times (2013‚Äì14),panther (Panthera pardus) is reported to be seen in the forests of Dhawade. This big cat is also reported to be preying on cattle of the villagers who are staying in their farm houses located along the forest boundary. Killing of big sized domestic animals like bulls, buffaloes and lifting off their young ones is reported to on increase since last year.

Economy Dhawade has a farming economy, traditional crops include millet, coconut, cotton, bhuimug (ground nut), jowar, onion and wheat. Farmers rely on rain water as well as water from rivers for farming needs. As there is limited scope for irrigation water availability from state managed irrigation facilities numbering three ; first the minor irrigation tank on Iraas river (Hiraasan as per the state records ), the second, percolation tank on Waghhad stream and the third, percolation tank on Bhalkhai stream all within the village limits; the villagers have invested their own money in creating water availability for irrigation by way of digging up wells wherever underground water is available and pumping the water up to their farms. At times the water is available at distance of 4 to 6 kilometers away. Farmers from Dhawade on their own; not with any support from the government funding, have taken up land development works to bring more fallow land under cultivation over period of last two decades. This activity is still going on during 2010. These land developmental works include leveling, terracing, bunding, nalla (small streams) training etc. Advanced farming techniques like improved seeds, drip irrigation, chemical and organic fertilizers are used. In the last few years, horticulture has been used more often for growing sitafal, dalimb and papaya. Such entrepreneurship have led to increase in the all round agricultural products output. And also one can see cultivation of crops of commercial nature like floriculture, and horticulture. During last 5 years there is shortage of farm laborers in the village as the demand has gone up steadily, due to increase in area under irrigation. This has led to increase in wage rates and laborers from other adjoining villages viz. Padalde, Ajnale,and Mehergaon, are being called to overcome the labor shortage. There is also spurt in demand for farm yard manure as many farmers practice organic farming to a great extent. Dhawade is an example in Dhule Taluka to showcase the incremental benefits of irrigation. Dairying is another major economic activity of the village. Traditionally it was the profession of Gawali community over decades. But other communities have also taken up to dairying. Buffaloes are reared for milk . The milk is mostly sold to traders from Dhule city, who also finance for buying the buffaloes. =Village cottage industries= Historically, in Maharashtra, certain professions or village level services at village level were community assigned over the centuries. Proprietary of the professions or village level services particularly at village level, have always remained with particular community and enabled to gain skills and expertise in that particular profession. There are 12 such professions assigned to the various 12 communities. These professions are called 12 balute and these communities are called 12 Balutedars - village level services providers/workers. As per this system, the balutedar has to provide for his services of routine nature to the farmers throughout the year. Under the balute system, in-exchange of services provided, farmers had to make payment in kind; mostly in the form fixed volume of grains and other agriculture produce of food value, every year after the harvest. This system had long been a part of the village societal arrangement since times immemorial. However, there may be variations seen in the 21st century with spread of education, and economic development. Besides there are other village industries in which all communities can engage themselves. Tailoring has been the traditional occupation of the Shimpi community in Dhawade. However, with the passage of time and changes in the socio-economic conditions and availability of professional training in tailoring to all from government at various places, a number of persons from other communities have taken to this occupation. The numbers of females of other communities also do tailoring and have specialisation in women garments. Carpentry is important village cottage industry in Dhawade, as the majority of farmers regularly require their services for manufacturing of new agricultural implements and for repairs to them. Broom making is the hereditary and traditional occupation of the Mang community in Dhawade. Culture and tourism Dhawade has no recreational facilities like cinemas or video halls. Dhawade has no cultural facilities like sports-clubs, stadium or auditorium. The village has a tradition of conducting Helyachi Takkar (Male Bull's Head on fight) on the occasion of the Diwali festival, outside the village. The villagers gather in large numbers to watch the fight on the river bankside where this fight is conducted. As milk production is also a major profession for this village, the farmers specially rear the male buffaloes for this fight. Dhawade population consists of various communities - Kunabi, Mali, Gawali, Bhil, Koli, Sutar, Shimpi, Harijan. There are separate temples of their faith or deity, constructed by each community in and around the village site Gaothan, where the cultural programmes take place. These programmes are sponsored by individual communities and take place almost every year; however these programmes are attended by almost all other communities. At times adjoining villages also participate on invitation. These programmes include Bhajan (Devotional songs), Kirtan (Saint lead religious discourse), Bhandara (Community sponsored lunch) etc. The duration of these programmes ranges from a day to week. Dhawade has an annual fair in the month of Chaitra (March/April) of the Hindu calendar in reverence to the goddess Bhavani maata. In this fair the Tagatrao the country-made chariot is pulled by the pair of bulls from the village to the temple of the goddess about two km away. The pulling of the Tagatrao is not an easy job as it is both heavier and larger than a regular cart. It is also an honor for any villager to engage his bulls for pulling Tagatrao up to the temple. It is a two-day celebration when the wrestling competitions are conducted by the village elders. In this wrestling competition rewards consisting of utensils and cash are paid to the winners. Wrestlers from the adjoining villages and taluka participate in this competition. A large crowd gathers to see and cheer the participants. This event has been going for time unknown. The second day of the village fair is celebrated by the villagers when the Tamasha - a local countryside performance of folk dance and drama - is performed in the village. The Tamasha party is invited well in advance and their show is generally booked. Another but waning annual cultural programme that used to take place is of drama performance. Everything from directors, musicians, singers, dancers, makeup men etc., all are the villagers themselves. The spirit behind these all cultural activities is clearly seen from the fact that, the villagers contribute in cash as per their capacities for the expenses. Needless to say Dhawade is typical example of showcase of vibrant and traditional rural life in Dhule district. =Dress= In Dhawade like elsewhere in Maharashtra; the dress of men as well as women, consists of two pieces, the one covering upper part above waist and the other covering lower part below waist. The dress pattern and the styles differ slightly in men from community to community and the change is more apparent in women. And even in the same community it varies with sex and age. Moreover, attire patterns are different in elderly and young generations. The men wear kurta or sadra or angee that covers the upper part above waist. The elderly men across all the communities wear Dhotar (commonly called Dhoti in Hindi ). Dhotar is white long cloth of generally 4 meters length and 1.2 m. width and worn below waist. Dhotar is typical attire that is wound and tied around the waist with knot of its corner; which certainly requires initial practice. Among the younger generation however, the dhotar is getting rarer. However the educated younger generation no more wears Dhotar. It has taken up to shirts, trouser and paijama or pants. The shirt is locally called kurta or sadra or angee has undergone changes due to changing fashions or styles over the years; so also the material has changed from coarse cotton to synthetics and all sorts of blended fabrics over the time. The shirt is generally half open on the front side from neck to chest having buttons and may be with half or full sleeved. Elderly men can be seen wearing full sleeved shirt called Nehru shirt. In addition above the elderly men wear cap called Gandhi cap. Women across all castes invariably wear saadi (commonly called Sari in Hindi) and Choli- the country blouse. Again there are two types of saadis, the one with 9 yard length and the other with 6 yards length. The elderly women of old generation prefer 9 yard saadis; whereas the younger generation prefers 6 yard saadis with a parkar (petticoat) underside. The manner of wearing saadi varies considerably from caste to caste. The young and kids wear other Indian and western style attire. Boys wear half or full pant and shirt with or without under wears. Girls wear north Indian style dress, the salwar and kamiz or western style skirt and blouse or shirt. =Ornaments= In Dhawade, glass beads and glass bangles are profusely worn as the part of ornamental wear, by women of all communities. Ornaments of gold and silver are most commonly worn by women. Women‚Äôs ornaments of silver are heavy and rather with rough workmanship. These are generally crafted by the village goldsmith. But now the preferences are seen to be changing and villagers go to city of Dhule where well crafted ornaments available in variety of designs . Gold ornaments are seen only in very rich families ; generally the ones having irrigated agriculture land. Gold ornaments are considered as prestige to a family, and are insurance in emergencies and wealth assets. Ornaments of pearls and precious stones are not seen. The false jewellery with bright and sparkling beads and ear-rings available at cheap prices are worn by poor girls and women to satisfy their liking. Ornaments of men Men wear gold or silver rings of different styles and designs at times embedded with semiprecious stones. Some men also wear gold chains called sonsakhali around the necks, which are generally taken as indicator of well off financial position. Another ornament worn with kurta or sadra is buttons woven in chain. Now few among the young generation kids and youths wear Kade ‚Äì an armlet made of copper or brass. Few men wear bhikabali - an ear ring; generally on the right ear . It is notable ornament for the reason that it is worn as accomplishment of Navas ‚Äì a promise to the almighty for fulfillment of some prayer made to Him. This ornament is made not out of one's own money; but from the money collected from others as donations or gifts. There is similar ornament worn by few men around ankle and is called Bedi. An ornament of bygone years called Kargota is now seen very rarely in this village. Kargota is mostly made of silver and worn round the waist only by men. It is work of fine silver weaving . Ornaments of women Among the women, the craze for ornaments of gold is seen increasing with improved incomes since the year 2000. Like other villages in Dhule district, the women of Dhawade can be seen wearing a number of ornaments. For every part of the body from head to toes, there is at least one ornament seen to be worn. Some of the ornaments worn are linked to the marriage status of woman among the Hindus. For the head and hair, there are hair pins and clips with floral or some other designs. They are mostly of steel or plastic these days. But there were the days when they used to be of silver. For nose, there is nose ring for girls and nath, nathani and fuli for the adult or married women. Nose rings are simple rings of gold or silver and at times may have a single glass bead. Nath is large sized decorative nose ring with typical shape. It is decorated with pearls on the outer side. The nathani is miniature of form of nath. In the earlier days, especially the elder women used to wear nath on permanent basis. However this tradition of wearing nath is now getting vanished. Nath is now occasionally worn on ceremonial times like marriages and festivals. The communities that wear nath are Hatkar Patil or Kunabi, Mali, Sutar and Nhavi. Fuli is spike like ornament with top studded with sparkling stone. The communities that wear fuli are Gawali, Lohar, Koli, Mahar, Mang, Chambhar and Bhil. All the above nasal ornaments are worn on the left side nostril to which a fine hole is pearsed. Nostril pearsing is generally done in young age below ten years. For ears, there are varieties of earrings to be seen. Almost every woman and girl wears some kind of earring. The earrings come with or without black and red glass beads. So also, the earrings with real or artificial stones are fashion to wear among the teens. The economic condition and the cultural following of the family as well as the liking and attitude towards the fashionable living dictate the choice. The ornaments worn on ear by women vary according to age group, community and traditions. Older the age, more will be the traditional and ornament of bygone years generally not available in the shops for sale. Such traditional ornaments are got specially prepared. The older women are seen wearing the traditional ornaments locally called as Bugadi, Killu, Dharani, Khutaalaa, Karnful and Hujur. Younger women go for modern day ornaments like ordinary or bead laced ear rings, Dools, Taps, and Tongal. Teenagers wear ordinary rings called Balyaa.

The Landeskirchliche Kredit-Genossenschaft Sachsen LKG (today branch of the KD- Bank in Dresden) was founded in 1925 as the first Protestant bank in Germany. In 1927 Protestant loan cooperatives were initiated in Magdeburg and M√ºnster. In 1953 the Rhineland followed. Capacity building, Support of members and a share for members in economic success were the ideas which motivated the founders. In 1927 the capacity building institution Darlehensgenossenschaft der Westf√§lischen Inneren Mission eGmbH was founded by Martin Niem√∂ller. Victor Rohdich, who since the fall of 1926 served as administrative director of the Inner mission, was also majorly involved in the founding. At the same time a church bank was founded in the province of Saxony under the name of Provinzialkirche Spar- und Darlehensgenossenschaft f√ºr die Provinz in Sachsen eGmbH. In Rheinland before World War II people also thought about a church loan fund. But only in June 1953 the Darlehensgenossenschaft der Evangelischen Kirchengemeinde und -Verb√§nde und der kirchlichen Werke im Rheinland eGmbH was founded by Otto Vetter. With the German reunification new business emerged in the new German states which was managed from Berlin and Magdeburg. In two steps a merger with the Prosparda, which was located in Magdeburg, was completed. In 2003 the DGM and the BKD merged and became KD-Bank eG ‚Äì die Bank f√ºr Kirche und Diakonie. Part of the fusion agreement was a new headquarters in the geographical middle of Duisburg and M√ºnster. The winner was Dortmund. Since February 28, 2006 the building in Dortmund is the banks headquarter. On June 9, 2010 the general assembly of the KD-Bank voted for a fusion with the Landeskirchlichen Kredit-Genossenschaft Sachsen eG (LKG) which is headquartered in Dresden. The fusion became retroactive on January 1, 2010. At the same time the general assembly decided on renaming the bank Bank f√ºr Kirche und Diakonie eG ‚Äì KD-BANK. This slight modification of the name is meant to draw the attention of the public to what the bank stands for. Sustainability filter As first Protestant church bank and one of only a few banks in Germany the KD-Bank, since January 1, 2008, supports a sustainability filter for financial investments in securities. The sustainability filter is guided by three goals of the conciliar process: peace, justice and the preservation of creation.

It is located at 2 Dixton Road in Observatory, Cape Town. Currently, it houses the Centre for Conflict Resolution.  History  In 1657 and 1658, Jan van Riebeeck gave land to 14 Vryburgers on the western bank of the Liesbeek to farm with wheat. To protect their harvest from raids by the Khoikhoi, a row of forts and sheds were built along the river. In September 1657 the sheds were completed at Coornhoop. Should an attack be threatened, the women and children of the nearby fields had to hide in it. After 4 years, the buildings at Coornhoop expired. A whole series of owners then subdivided the ground and sometimes consolidated pieces and cultivated the shrubs to the house. It has evolved into one of Cape Peninsula's most beautiful developments. In the 19th and 20th centuries the buildings decayed and were demolished.  Architecture  In 1961, the Simon van der Stel Foundation bought the buildings and rebuilt in 1964. The endwalls of the remaining shells are of the hollow ball type and date from 1797.  Dovecot Behind two rows of each of the three arches stands a unique double-storey dovecot. It connects two of the original sheds. The front view is a feature of the Cape architecture. In 1966 only this dovecot was declared a memorial. In the William Fehr Collection there is a sketch from 1896 by A.F. Truter of the dovecot.

After the new degree in philosophy was approved by the administration in 1960, Houlgate was the first student to graduate from CSULA with a B.A. in Philosophy. His mentor was Henry Alexander. On his recommendation, Laurence enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He later transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles to study under H.L.A. Hart (who was there as a Visiting Professor) and Herbert Morris, one of Hart's students at Oxford and a recent appointee at UCLA. Houlgate received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Philosophy from UCLA in 1967, having written his dissertation under the direction of Professor Herbert Morris. Houlgate's first full-time appointment was as a lecturer in philosophy at California State University, Fullerton. After two years, he accepted a position at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1966. Despite having published nine peer-reviewed journal articles during the period 1962‚Äì1972, Houlgate was not offered a tenured position at UCSB (he later referred to this unfortunate outcome as a rare instance of \\"publish and perish\\"). Houlgate accepted a visiting professorship for one year at Reed College (1972-1973), went on to George Mason University for six years (1973-1979) and in 1979, accepted a permanent position at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, where he was appointed Professor of Philosophy (1980) and served as department chair from 1990 to 1995. He retired from CSUSLO as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy in 2002. Professor Houlgate's first published works were in the area of philosophy of law. He wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the general topic of excuses in criminal law, with a special emphasis on the excuses of mistake and ignorance of fact. He later published several articles in philosophical journals based on chapters in the dissertation. In the next stage of his career, Houlgate spent one academic year as a fellow at the University of Virginia School of Law. He did research on the legal rights of children and later published one of the first philosophical books on this topic (The Child and the State). In subsequent years, he turned to the study of the philosophical foundations of family law and the ethics of family relationships. This research led to a monograph on the philosophy of family law (Family and State), a reader on family ethics (Morals, Marriage and Parenthood), and a collection of his previously published articles (Children's Rights, State Intervention, Custody And Divorce: Contradictions in Ethics And Family Law). In his post-retirement years, Houlgate twice ran for and won elections to be the Democratic Party candidate for the California State Assembly. He later twice lost the general election to the incumbent, as had every Democratic candidate during the previous 50 years. In 2016, Professor Houlgate decided to keep a promise to his former students to write a series of study guides on the classical philosophers. There are now six of these philosophy guides, published as a series under the title The Smart Student's Guides to Philosophical Classics. He also kept a promise to his colleagues who teach courses in the philosophy of law to write a textbook based exclusively on family law cases. That book was published in 2016 under the title Philosophy, Law and Family: A New Introduction to the Philosophy of Law. The book is published by Springer International.

It was the second by-election held during the 57th UK Parliament, which was elected in June 2017. The election was won by Janet Daby of the Labour Party with 50.2% of the vote and a significantly reduced majority.  Background  On 8 May 2018, the incumbent Labour MP Heidi Alexander announced her appointment as London Deputy Mayor for Transport, a role that required her to stand down from the House of Commons. On 9 May she was appointed Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, an office of profit under the Crown, which legally formalised her resignation from Parliament. She served as the MP for Lewisham East for eight years, having first been elected at the 2010 general election. She served in Labour's Shadow Cabinet until 2016, and was an active campaigner for the United Kingdom to remain in the single market after Brexit. She had been critical of Labour's leadership, describing it as \\"dysfunctional\\". The Lewisham East constituency had been represented by MPs from the Labour Party since 1992, and was considered a safe seat for the party. The constituency was within the London Borough of Lewisham, in which the Labour Party won every single seat at the local elections in 2018. The seat had an active branch of Momentum, a left-wing pressure group dedicated to supporting the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Lewisham London Borough Council administered the by-election. In the 2016 referendum, the Borough of Lewisham, of which the constituency is a part, voted to remain in the European Union. Through demographic modelling, the Remain vote in the Lewisham East constituency was estimated as 66% by Number Cruncher Politics and as 65% by Chris Hanretty at Royal Holloway. Candidates The Labour Party selected Lewisham deputy mayor nominee Janet Daby as its candidate. She had a background in social care and managed a food poverty charity. The Conservative Party selected Ross Archer, who contested the borough mayoralty in May 2018. His campaign was focused on housing, education, policing and the zoning of Grove Park railway station. The Liberal Democrats announced their candidate as Lucy Salek, a humanitarian worker and consultant who had stood in Lewisham Council elections, and contested Southend West in the 2017 general election. They intended to use the by-election to \\"send a message to the Labour leadership about Brexit\\", with party leader Vince Cable aiming to \\"cut the majority substantially\\". The Green Party's candidate was secondary school teacher and clean air campaigner Rosamund Adoo- Kissi-Debrah. She stood on a platform of reducing air pollution, improving local schools and for British people to \\"have a final say on Europe\\". UKIP announced on 14 May that London Assembly Member David Kurten would stand as its candidate. He pledged to campaign for \\"full Brexit\\" and for a \\"tough stance on policing and crime\\". For Britain announced on 12 May that party leader Anne Marie Waters would stand. In the 2015 general election Waters stood as the UKIP candidate for Lewisham East and polled in third place. The Women's Equality Party announced on 17 May its intention to stand Mandu Reid, a Lewisham resident and founder of The Cup Effect, a women's menstrual health NGO. Democrats and Veterans announced that Massimo DiMambro, who was the UKIP candidate in Lewisham Deptford in the 2015 general election, would be their candidate. The Official Monster Raving Loony Party announced that its leader, Howling Laud Hope, would be its candidate. = Labour Party selection process = The Labour selection was reported in the media as revealing splits in the Labour Party. This was the first by-election contested by the party since Jennie Formby took over as general secretary, which led to speculation that centrist candidates might be excluded. The Lewisham East Labour Left caucus group called for a socialist MP who would \\"campaign for...a left-wing government with Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister\\". On 10 May 2018 Ian McKenzie, chair of the Constituency Labour Party (CLP), emailed members concerned that the National Executive Committee (NEC) was rushing the selection to prevent them having their say. Potential left-wing candidates included Sakina Sheikh, GMB trade union organiser Nadine Houghton, and NEC member Claudia Webbe. Other potential candidates were Joe Dromey (son of Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey), and Kevin Bonavia. UK Black Pride founder Phyll Opoku-Gyimah was also considered a potential candidate, especially in the event of an all-woman and entirely black and minority ethnic shortlist, but ruled herself out on 13 May, citing an \\"unexpected situation\\" in her family. Members who declared that they would stand included Sheikh, Bonavia, and Brenda Dacres. On 14 May the NEC announced a shortlist of Webbe, Dacres, Daby and Sheikh, all women from ethnic minorities. McKenzie was said to be delighted by the inclusion of Dacres and Daby. Sheikh received the endorsement of Momentum, whilst Webbe was endorsed by the trade unions Unite and the Communication Workers Union. Daby received the support of Unison. Dacres withdrew on 18 May and endorsed Daby, citing \\"recently diagnosed health reasons\\". The remaining candidates expressed differing views over Brexit, with Daby pledging to fight for the UK to remain in the customs union and the single market, whilst Sheikh and Webbe expressed their opposition to a second referendum or continued membership of the single market. Sheikh was temporarily withdrawn from the ballot prior to the selection meeting, following accusations that she had supported a rival political organisation, but was reinstated minutes later. Daby went on to be selected by local members on 19 May, receiving 63% of the vote in the first round, with Sheikh receiving 29% and Webbe 8%. Campaign On 22 May, McKenzie, credited with having secured the Labour candidature for Daby which he claimed had \\"humiliated\\" Momentum and Unite, was suspended as chair of the CLP and is facing possible disciplinary action over tweets from 2015 and 2016 about Emily Thornberry and ISIS. These were uncovered by left-wing writer Owen Jones, who McKenzie had suggested should keep away from the constituency. The Liberal Democrats announced their opposition to plans by Lewisham Council to seize the land of Millwall FC's youth academy for redevelopment. Party leader Vince Cable visited the academy in late May; the party's candidate, Lucy Salek, announced that the land should be used for social housing if the redevelopment plans went ahead. A UKIP leaflet titled 'Stop the Khanage', which blamed the high levels of knife crime in London on the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was criticised by Vicky Foxcroft, the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Lewisham Deptford, and Mandu Reid, the WEP candidate in the by-election. On 11 June 2018, three days before the by- election, a vote estimate by the Liberal Democrats on the basis of canvassing data suggested that the party would finish second with 25% of the vote, with Labour on 49% and the Conservatives on 16%. On 12 June 2018, police shut down a by-election hustings in Catford, leading to one arrest, after it was disrupted by anti-racism protesters led by Stand Up to Racism and Lewisham Anti-Racist Action Group. The protesters intended to target Anne Marie Waters, who did not attend the event on police advice. Daby and Archer were also absent from the hustings, citing other engagements; Daby had previously refused to share a platform with Waters. The protest was criticised by Salek and Reid. Prior to the event, Foxcroft and Damien Egan, the Mayor of Lewisham, had called for Waters to be No Platformed at the hustings.  Result  The result was the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats since 2004. The Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: \\"This result sends a message to the Labour leadership that it cannot take pro-European voters for granted.\\" The Guardian and Evening Standard reported the result as a \\"surge\\" for the Liberal Democrats, which was widely reported as being related to the party's opposition to Brexit. After being elected, Daby reaffirmed her opposition to a \\"hard\\" Brexit. Previous result Heidi Alexander was re-elected to a third term of office in 2017, with an increased majority of 21,123 (44.8%) over the Conservative candidate.

Conviction On the evening of March 31, 1988, 9-1-1 operators received a call from Dan Montecalvo, an ex-convict in Burbank, California, claiming that he and his wife, Carol, were shot by unknown burglars in their home. Soon after, police arrived; Carol was found dead as result of two gunshot wounds to the neck; Montecalvo was shot once in the lower back. Initially, the authorities believed Montecalvo's story, however, they would later suspect him of being involved due to gambling debts and $600,000 of life insurance he had on his wife. Although there were no eyewitnesses, and no murder weapon, police brought charges against Montecalvo in March 1990 for first-degree murder. The authorities believed that he shot himself so it would corroborate his story. In November 1990, Montecalvo was convicted of the murder, and was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison. In 1991, a neighbor named Suzan Brown confessed to burglarizing the home that resulted in the murder of Carol Montecalvo. According to Brown, she and several of her friends spent all of their money on speed and decided to burglarize the Montecalvo residence, assuming that they had gone to a vacation that was planned. However, her confession did not result in any further developments. Death On September 25, 2013, Montecalvo died at California Medical Facility due to sepsis. Coverage This case was the subject of a book in 1992, entitled Final Vows: Murder, Madness and Twisted Justice in California by author Karen Kingsbury. In 2013, it was re-released. In 2016, television series The Perfect Murder on Investigation Discovery featured this case, which was entitled \\"Murder by the Book\\".

C., & Kennedy, W. J. (1977). Cretaceous faunas from Zululand, South Africa, and southern Mozambique. The Aptian Ancyloceratidae (Ammonoidea). Annals of the South African Museum, 73(9), 215-359. It contains four formations that range in age from late Early Jurassic and late Early Cretaceous in age (~183 - 100 Ma).  Geographic extent  In the onshore part of the southern Cape, deposits of the Uitenhage Group occur predominantly in the Algoa and Gamtoos Basins, which are situated north/north-west of Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Smaller deposits also occur in the Baviaanskloof, Georginda, Vlakteplaas, Oudtshoorn, Plettenberg Bay, Knysna, Herbertsdale-Mossel Bay, Heidelberg-Riversdale, Swellendam, and Worcester-Robertson Basins. These are grabens and half-grabens (rift basins) that opened up due to mainly normal faulting processes during the break-up of Gondwana.  Stratigraphic units  Stratigraphic units in this group include (from oldest to youngest): * Enon Formation: Contains subordinate sandstones and different types of thickly-bedded conglomerates, which consist mainly of quartzite and sometimes slate, shale, and charcoal. The clasts are poorly-sorted, sub-rounded to rounded pebbles and cobbles. Deposition occurred mainly in high-energy alluvial environments (e.g., alluvial fans, low sinuosity rivers). * Kirkwood Formation: Contains mainly medium-grained sandstone that is locally charcoal-rich, sporadic conglomerates, and variegated mudstone. Out of the three formations of the Uitenhage Group, the Kirkwood is the most well-studied, and is extremely fossil-rich. Deposition occurred under mainly fluvial conditions at or near sea level. * Sundays River Formation: Contains fine- to medium-grained grey sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones. The sandstone layers are frequently cemented with calcite and contain shell fragments. The Sundays River is also highly fossiliferous. Deposition occurred under shallow marine and estuarine conditions. * Buffelskloof Formation: Deposited in a high energy braided river system with conglomerate deposits, similar to that of the Enon Formation. Some fossil material such as petrified wood and scant remains of fossil dinosaur teeth and claws have been recovered. In the Herbertsdale/Mossel Bay Basin this formation, with the overlying Hartenbos Formation, forms the lateral equivalent of the Sundays River Formation.http://www.phsconsulting.co.za/uploads/7648806Annex%20D%20-%20PIA%20Brief%20Maandagskop.pdf  Paleontology  Fossils are especially common in the Kirkwood and Sundays River Formations, although regarding the Sundays River Formation the most common fossils are of invertebrates. Past expeditions within the Kirkwood Formation have uncovered several dis-articulated remains of theropod, sauropod, and ornithopod dinosaurs, and a plesiosaur fossil is known from the Sundays River Formation. Fossil remains of amphibians, lizards, fishes, and small mammals have also been recovered. A variety of bivalve, gastropod, ammonites, and ostracods are likewise known from these deposits. The fossil flora is equally diverse and silicified tree trunks - some with evidence of being charred by fire  have also been found.

The Commission was established in 1975 under an amendment to the South Australian Constitution to carry out periodic redistributions of the electoral boundaries of the State‚Äôs lower house, the House of Assembly in the Parliament of South Australia. When making a redistribution, the Commission is required to ensure that the number of electors in each electoral district does not vary from the electoral quota by more than a permissible tolerance of 10 per cent.Constitution Act 1934 (SA), section 77 The electoral quota is determined by dividing the total number of electors as at the relevant date by the number of electoral districts into which the State is divided.

The Commission must also have regard to matters which are outlined in section 83(2) of the Constitution Act 1934 (SA), being: * The desirability of making the electoral redistribution so as to reflect communities of interest of an economic, social, regional or other kind * The population of each proposed electoral district * The topography of areas within which new electoral boundaries will be drawn * The feasibility of communication between electors affected by the redistribution and their parliamentary representative in the House of Assembly * The nature of substantial demographic changes that the EDBC considers likely to take place in proposed electoral districts between the conclusion of its present proceedings and the next State election * Any other matter the EDBC thinks relevant.Constitution Act 1934 (SA), section 83(2) Frollowing a referendum, between 1991 and 2016 the Boundaries Commission was also required to have ensured, as far as practicable, that the redistribution was fair to prospective candidates and groups of candidates, so that if candidates of a particular group attracted more than 50 per cent of the popular vote, including preferences, they would be elected in sufficient numbers to enable a government to be formed.

He was born in Iran from which he fled and emigrated to the United States and later moved to Israel. Albert began his charity work officially in 2005, and today helped over a thousand special needs children.  Early life  Albert was born, the fourth of five children, at the Dr Sapir Hospital in Tehran. He studied in Ozar HaTorah, a traditional Jewish primary school. Albert's father, Abraham Shaltiel, earned his living in textiles and also invested in real estate. They were affluent and lived comfortably. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1978 and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, life in Iran changed. It became more difficult to be openly Jewish and Albert's high school, Alliance, lost its Jewish character. At the age of 16, Albert was forced to take part in paramilitary exercises in order to take part in the war.  Escape from Iran  Following his forced conscription, Albert decided to flee. With the help of smugglers, he planned his escape route through Afghanistan and Pakistan, via Zahedan in southeastern Iran. During his escape he was arrested, brutally tortured and imprisoned. Albert was restrained in a jail cell with 20 Baluchi tribesmen. Fortunately for him, while being transported back to Tehran, his van crashed and he was sent to a field hospital from where he would later on be rescued by Balochi tribesmen. He stayed with the Baloch for a month before moving to America. Escape From Iran, Deborah Danan, MAY 8, 2019, Humans of Israel After months of clandestine and arduous travel, Albert arrived in Vienna in 1988, where he awaited his visa for a year. In Vienna, he was helped by HIAS, an American non-profit organisation that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees. Eventually, he joined his brother in Los Angeles, where he became an entrepreneur and an active member of the Iranian-American Jewish community. He arrived in Israel in 2000. He met and married Yael, his wife, shortly afterward, and today they are parents to three children.  Charity and philanthropy  Albert Shaltiel in the office of ILAI Fund After years of unsuccessful fertility treatments, the Shaltiel couple considered adoption. They visited a facility for disabled orphans in Haifa. Deciding that the ‚Äúneeds of the many‚Äù outweighed the needs of the few, they started raising and distributing money for medical equipment and therapy for sick children. In 2005, the family was blessed with a natural pregnancy and their healthy son, Ilai, was born. That same year, Albert and Yael decided to establish the ILAI Fund in their firstborn's name, and continue their fundraising and charitable work officially. As of early 2019, the ILAI Fund has assisted and continues to assist close to 1000 children with special needs and their families from low- income backgrounds, with special focus on single mother households. Albert decided to dedicate the work of the ILAI Fund to those who suffer from physical, emotional and mental disabilities. The ILAI Fund assists those whose financial situation prevents them from receiving the proper care to meet their children's needs. Albert and his son Ilai at the Wreath-Laying Ceremony at Yad Vashem.  Holocaust remembrance  As a representative of the ILAI Fund, Albert attends the annual Wreath-Laying Ceremony on Holocaust Remembrance Day at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem. In 2018, Albert and his son, Ilai, 13, laid a wreath in memory of the approximately 300,000 disabled and special needs victims of the Nazi regime, persecuted and murdered as a part of a program the Nazis dubbed ‚ÄúT-4‚Äù.  Political stance  Albert Shaltiel is a supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel. He emigrated to Israel inspired by Netanyahu's leadership. Shaltiel is also a yearly attendant of the AIPAC conference. Shatliel related that his life experience in Iran prompted him to do everything in his power in order to commemorate the Holocaust: ‚ÄúWhen we say never again, we mean it. Yet another Holocaust could happen in a few years. When Iran says that they want to wipe us out, they also mean it. We have to take this message seriously. It‚Äôs not just a curse. It‚Äôs an ambition that they long for.‚Äù Shatliel noted that Iran is fulling such ambitions via their proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza: ‚ÄúIran has tentacles everywhere.‚Äù The Iranian who remembered the Nazis‚Äô disabled victims May 7, 2019, JNS  See also  * Iranian Jews * Iranian Jews in Israel *ILAI Fund  References  Category:Jewish philanthropists Category:Israeli philanthropists Category:Iranian Jews Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tehran Category:Iranian emigrants to the United States Category:Iranian emigrants to Israel Category:Israeli people of Iranian-Jewish descent ","title":"Albert Elay Shaltiel"},{"id":"57365989","text":"Huang Yong-chun (ÈªÉÊ¶ÆÊ§ø, Pinyin: Hu√°ng R√≥ng-ch≈´n; born 1 September 1935) is a Taiwanese judoka.

A schoolteacher, Babak joined the Red Army before Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began, and completed pilot training in 1942, after which he flew the Yakovlev Yak-1 and later the Bell P-39 Airacobra. He distinguished himself in the air battles over the Kuban bridgehead in April 1943 and was credited with eighteen aerial victories when he received the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 1 November, after spending the northern hemisphere summer in the hospital due to malaria. Babak briefly returned to combat but was again sidelined by a recurrence of malaria, going back into combat in mid-1944. In mid-March 1945 Babak took command of the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment but was downed by anti-aircraft fire and captured days later. He survived captivity and was released at the end of the war, but as a result of being captured, he was not awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title a second time. Credited with 37 aerial victories in official Soviet accounts, Babak commanded a regiment postwar and retired in 1949, after which he returned to teaching.  Early life  Babak was born on 26 July 1919 to a peasant family in the village of Oleksiyivka, Yekaterinoslav Governorate (now in Nikopol Raion, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast), then controlled by the Ukrainian National Republic, though it was under Soviet control by the end of the year. A graduate of the Zaporizhia Pedagogical Institute and a flying club, he taught chemistry and biology at the Partizanskoy Secondary School in Prymorsk Raion of Zaporizhia Oblast, before being drafted into the Red Army in October 1940.  World War II  Upon his April 1942 graduation from the Stalingrad Military Aviation School as a sergeant, Babak joined the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 216th Mixed Aviation Division on the Crimean and North Caucasian Fronts as a Yakovlev Yak-1 pilot in May. His performance was considered unsatisfactory by regimental commander Ibrahim Dzusov, who intended to transfer him, but flying ace Dmitry Kalarash tutored Babak, after which Dmitry Glinka selected him as his wingman. After he claimed his first aerial victory over Mozdok in September, the regiment was sent to Adzhikabul in Azerbaijan for rest and retraining on the United States-supplied Bell P-39 Airacobra fighter, which Babak flew for the remainder of the war.

Located north of Squamish and west of Whistler, the massif resides on the edge of the Powder Mountain Icefield. It consists of an eroded but potentially active stratovolcano that towers over the Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys. All major summits have elevations greater than , Mount Cayley being the highest at . The surrounding area has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for more than 7,000 years while geothermal exploration has taken place there for the last four decades. Part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, the Mount Cayley massif was formed by subduction zone volcanism along the western margin of North America. Eruptive activity began about 4,000,000 years ago and has since undergone three stages of growth, the first two of which built most of the massif. The latest eruptive period occurred sometime in the last 400,000 years with lesser activity continuing into the present day. Future eruptions are likely to threaten neighbouring communities with pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides and debris flows) and floods. To monitor this threat, the volcano and its surroundings are monitored by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). Eruption impact would be largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in nearby valleys. Geography and geology The massif resides in the middle of a north‚Äìsouth trending zone of volcanism called the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It consists predominantly of volcanoes that formed subglacially during the Late Pleistocene age, such as Pali Dome, Slag Hill, Ring Mountain and Ember Ridge, but activity continued at Pali Dome and Slag Hill into the Holocene epoch. The Mount Cayley volcanic field is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, which in turn represents a northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc.Kelman, M. C., Russell, J. K., Hickson, C. J. (2001). \\"Preliminary petrography and chemistry of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, British Columbia\\", Current Research Part A, Geological Survey of Canada Paper 2001-A11, pp. 1, 2, 4, 5. Volcanism of the Cascade Arc is largely a result of the Juan de Fuca Plate sliding under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. Three main summits comprise the Mount Cayley massif. The highest and northernmost is Mount Cayley with an elevation of . Its northeastern flank abuts the southern end of the Powder Mountain Icefield. This is a long and wide irregularly-shaped glacier that trends slightly to the northwest. Just southwest of Mount Cayley lies Pyroclastic Peak, in elevation. It contains a jagged summit ridge of many slender rock pinnacles, the largest of which is known as the Vulcan's Thumb. Wizard Peak with an elevation of is east of Pyroclastic Peak and is the lowest of the three main summits. As a stratovolcano, the Mount Cayley massif is built up of solidified lava and ash from successive volcanic eruptions. It is predominantly dacitic in composition, although rhyodacite is also common. Its original and current volumes remain uncertain. It may have had a volume as large as , but erosion has since reduced it to glacially eroded crags. The modern volcano has an estimated volume of and is only a modest fraction of its total output of silicic eruptive products. It has a proximal relief of and a draping relief of , with a nearly vertical cliff more than high immediately above the Turbid Creek valley. Turbid Creek, Dusty Creek, Avalanche Creek and Shovelnose Creek flow from the slopes of the Mount Cayley massif. Deep seismic profiling below the massif has identified a large bright spot, a reflector interpreted to be a mid-crustal magma chamber or body of very hot rock. Similar mid-crustal reflectors have been identified under subduction zone volcanoes in Japan. Volcanic history The Mount Cayley massif has experienced volcanic eruptions sporadically for the last 4,000,000 years, making it one of the most persistent eruptive centres in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. Three primary eruptive stages in the history of the massif have been identified. The Mount Cayley and Vulcan's Thumb stages occurred between 4,000,000 and 600,000 years ago with the construction of the stratovolcano and plug domes. A 300,000-year-long period of quiescence followed, during which prolonged erosion destroyed much of the original volcanic structure. This was followed by the third and final Shovelnose stage about 300,000 to 200,000 years ago with the emplacement of parasitic lava domes and flows. Although one of the Shovelnose domes has been potassium-argon dated at 310,000 years old, this date may be in error from excess argon. The Shovelnose stage rocks could be much younger, perhaps less than 15,000 years old. Eruptions during the three stages produced volcanic rocks of felsic and intermediate compositions, including andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. The lack of evidence for volcano- ice interactions at the Mount Cayley massif implies that all eruptive stages most likely took place prior to glacial periods. This contrasts with many neighbouring volcanoes, which contain abundant volcanic glass and fine-scale columnar jointing from contact with ice during eruptions. Initial volcanic activity of the Mount Cayley massif 4,000,000 years ago corresponded with changes to the regional plate tectonics. This involved the separation of the Explorer and Juan de Fuca plates off the British Columbia Coast, which had some significant ramifications for regional geologic evolution. After this reorganization ceased, volcanism shifted westward from the Pemberton Volcanic Belt to establish the younger and currently active Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The westward shift in volcanism may have been related to steepening of the Juan de Fuca slab after the formation of the Explorer Plate. =Mount Cayley stage= Mount Cayley viewed from southeast showing light coloured breccia cut by a central spine of dacite which forms the summit ridge. The early Mount Cayley stage was characterized by the eruption of felsic lava flows and pyroclastic rocks onto a crystalline basement. Initial volcanism formed a southwesterly-dipping prism of dacite flows and tephra cut by several dikes and sills. These rocks have been hydrothermally altered to varying degrees and are light yellow or red in colour. They are well exposed in the prominent southwestern cliffs of the massif. Subsequent activity deposited a series of massive dacite flows up to thick, which form the summit and northern slope of Wizard Peak. The Mount Cayley stage culminated with the emplacement of a central plug dome that forms the narrow jagged summit ridge of Mount Cayley. This edifice consists of similar intrusive dacite. =Vulcan's Thumb stage= The next eruptive period, the Vulcan's Thumb stage, built an edifice that grew upon the southwestern slope of the ancestral Mount Cayley stratovolcano. This began with the eruption of massive dacite flows and blocky agglutinated breccias onto basement and older volcanic rocks of the Mount Cayley stage. These rocks partially form a ridge south of Wizard Peak and comprise the prominent summit ridge pinnacles of Pyroclastic Peak, including the Vulcan's Thumb. Later activity produced an overlying wide and long southwest-trending lobe of unconsolidated or poorly consolidated tephra. The tephra consists of ash and lapilli-sized fragments that have been heavily eroded to form vertical cliffs and ridges. Volcanism also deposited a thick sequence of blocky dacitic tuff breccia between Wizard Peak and Mount Cayley. =Shovelnose stage= Volcanic activity of the final Shovelnose stage involved the eruption of two lava domes at the east and southeast margins of the Mount Cayley massif in the upper Shovelnose Creek valley. The southeast dacite dome forms high cliffs of small diameter columnar joints. It was the source of a long dacite flow that extends down the Shovelnose and Turbid creek valleys to near the Squamish River. The east lava dome was built upon blocky bedded tephra overlying basement rocks and consists of a steep-sided columnar jointed mass of dacite. =Recent activity= Although the Mount Cayley massif is not known to have had historical volcanic eruptions, low-level activity has continued into recorded history. Shallow earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity since 1985 and the Shovelnose and Turbid creek valleys contain two and three hot springs, respectively. The GSC therefore considers the massif a potentially active volcano. Temperatures ranging from have been measured from the hot springs. The existence of hot springs indicate that magmatic heat is still present. Extensive tufa and sinter deposits inhabit the main hot springs while bright red ferruginous ochre precipitates from several cold seeps in the vicinity. The springs are confined around dacite cupolas and dikes that were emplaced during the Vulcan's Thumb stage. Panoramic view of the Mount Cayley massif with Pyroclastic Peak on the left and Mount Cayley in the middle. View is westward from Whistler Mountain. Landslide history Because the Mount Cayley massif is rich in coarse proximal pyroclastic deposits, some of them hydrothermally altered, it is especially prone to slope failure and debris avalanches. At least three major debris avalanches have occurred from the western slope in the last 10,000 years, all of which blocked the Squamish River and formed temporary lakes upstream. The first and largest event about 4,800 years ago produced a debris fan exposed along the Squamish River. A thick sequence of silts, sands and pebbles interbedded in the debris fan suggests that it may be the product of two major, closely spaced, debris avalanches rather than a single event. Another large debris avalanche about 1,100 years ago deposited material immediately upstream of the mouth of Turbid Creek. The third event followed about 500 years ago with the deposition of two diamicton units along Turbid Creek and was the smallest of the three major prehistoric debris avalanches. A lack of organic and paleosol horizons between the two units implies that they most likely represent separate surges within the same debris avalanche event. At least three smaller scale debris avalanches have occurred in historic time. A landslide occurred in 1963 with the failure of a large volcanic block consisting of poorly consolidated tuff breccia and columnar-jointed dacite. The mass slid into Dusty Creek where it quickly fragmented into an aggregate then travelled roughly downstream where it entered the broader flatter valley of Turbid Creek for an additional . Both creeks were blocked by the event, resulting in the creation of lakes that eventually overtopped and breached the landslide dam to produce floods and possibly debris flows which in turn swept down Turbid Creek far beyond the landslide terminus. In June 1984, a major rockslide and debris flow resulted from a collapse at the head of Avalanche Creek. The debris flow reached the mouth of Turbid Creek where it destroyed a logging road bridge and blocked the Squamish River, introducing massive quantities of sediment. The third event took place along Turbid Creek in June 2014 and involved a debris flow that removed part of the Squamish River Forest Service Road. Human history The area has been inhabited by First Nations for thousands of years. Both the Mount Cayley massif and The Black Tusk on the opposite side of the Cheakamus River valley are called ta _k_ 'ta _k_ mu'yin tl'a in7in'axa7en by the Squamish people. In their language it means \\"Landing Place of the Thunderbird\\". The Thunderbird is a legendary creature in North American indigenous peoples' history and culture. When the bird flaps its wings, thunder is created, and lightning originates from its eyes. The Mount Cayley massif and The Black Tusk are considered sacred to the Squamish people as they have played an important part of their history. Mountain bilberries, Canadian blueberries and oval-leaved blueberries, being a favored food of the Squamish people, were gathered in large berry fields on and near the massif. Glassy rhyodacite collected from small outcrops on the slopes have been found in goat hunting sites and the Elaho rockshelter which have been collectively dated around 8,000 to 100 years old. Cayley rhyodacite has only been found in the northern parts of the Squamish Nation territory. The Mount Cayley massif as seen from the east There had been no first ascent of the massif until July 1928 when an Alpine Club of Canada party, consisting of mountaineers R. E. Knight, W. G. Wheatley, E. C. Brooks, T. Fyles and B. Clegg, climbed Mount Cayley. Fyles submitted the mountain name to the Government of British Columbia in September 1928 for Beverley Cochrane Cayley, a mountaineer and friend of those in the climbing expedition who had died in June that year. The name became official on April 2, 1929, and photographs of the peak were published with Fyles' description of first ascent in the 1931 Canadian Alpine Journal Vol XX. The Mount Cayley massif has been investigated as a potential geothermal energy resource since at least the late 1970s. Geothermal exploration by Energy, Mines and Resources Canada commenced in 1977 with the drilling of two shallow boreholes on the west side of the massif for temperature observation. High geothermal gradients of 51 and 65 millikelvin per metre were obtained from this work. Further drilling on the east and west sides of the massif in 1980‚Äì1982 by Nevin Sadlier-Brown Goodbrand Limited on behalf of the GSC showed geothermal gradients ranging from 45 to 95 millikelvin per metre. In 2002, BC Hydro published a report identifying 16 prospective geothermal sites throughout British Columbia. They named the Mount Cayley massif as one of the six sites with the highest potential for commercial development. There is \\"promising\\" potential for a 100 megawatt geothermal power station at the volcano but the severe terrain makes development difficult and expensive. The heat source has also yet to be confirmed through deep drilling. Volcanic hazards Though the Mount Cayley massif is currently quiet, it still poses potential hazards to nearby towns as well as logging and recreational areas. GSC seismic data suggest that the volcano still contains magma, indicating possible future eruptive activity and associated volcanic hazards such as landslides. An eruption scenario for the volcano was organized by GSC scientists in 2000 to show how Western Canada is vulnerable to such an event. They based the scenario on past activity in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and involved both explosive and effusive activity. The scenario was published in 2003 as an article for Natural Hazards, a Springer journal devoting on all aspects of natural hazards including risk management and the forecasting of catastrophic events. If eruptive activity were to resume, scientists would likely be able to detect increased seismicity as magma makes its way through the crust. The abundance of seismic activity and the sensitivity of the existing Canadian National Seismograph Network in this area would alert the GSC and possibly trigger an expanded monitoring effort. As the magma nears the surface, the volcano would likely swell and the surface fracture, causing greatly increased vigour in the hot springs and the creation of new springs or fumaroles. Minor and possibly large landslides could occur and might temporarily block the Squamish River, as has happened in the past without earthquake shaking and intrusion-related deformation. Eventually the near-surface magma may cause phreatic explosions and debris flows. By this time Highway 99 would be closed, Squamish would be evacuated and Whistler would be at least considered for evacuation. NASA World Wind imagery showing the Cheakamus valley on the right and the Squamish valley on the left upstream. The Mount Cayley massif is on the upper left slope of the mountain ridge between the two valleys. Squamish is in the bottom right corner of image. In the event of an explosive eruption, an ash plume could reach in height and may be maintained for 12 hours. Air traffic would be diverted from the area and all airports covered by the plume would be closed, notably those in Vancouver, Victoria, Kamloops, Prince George and Seattle. Above the vent area, material from the eruption plume would collapse to form pyroclastic flows and would flow east and west into the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. These would rapidly melt snow and ice in the summit area, generating debris flows that could reach Squamish and Daisy Lake, damaging much infrastructure. Heavy ash falls would occur in the Vancouver area, the Fraser Valley, Bellingham, Kamloops, Whistler and Pemberton. The ash would damage power and communication lines and satellite dishes, as well as computer and other electrical equipment. Telephone, radio, cell phone and satellite communications would be cut off. Weak structures could collapse under the weight of the ash. The eruption plume would then spread to envelop most of the west coast from Seattle to Anchorage, causing all enclosed airports to be closed and all relevant flights to be diverted or cancelled. Eastward migration of the plume would disrupt air traffic across Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador. Ash from further, minor explosive activity could continue to fall lightly but persistently in the Whistler‚ÄìPemberton area, followed by weeks of viscous lava dome growth punctuated by small explosions. The explosions would generate short-lived high plumes, small pyroclastic flows to the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys and ash plumes to the north and east. Explosions might cease and be replaced by slow, continuous growth of a lava dome in the new crater. Rain and seasonal snow melt would regularly remobilize the tephra into lahars and these would continue to threaten the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. The solidifying, spreading lava could then generate rockfalls and form a voluminous talus apron into the Squamish valley. As the lava dome spreads, it would periodically undergo gravitational collapse to generate dense pyroclastic flows into the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. Ash elutriated from the pyroclastic flows would form plumes up to high, again dropping ash onto Pemberton and Whistler and causing disruptions to local air traffic. Infrequently, the lava dome might produce small explosions, ash plumes and pyroclastic flows. Squamish would remain evacuated, Highway 99 would remain closed and unrepairable and travel between Whistler/Pemberton and Vancouver would be forced to go via a much longer route to the east. Eruptive activity itself could go on for years, followed by years of declining secondary activity. The cooling lava would intermittently spall sections to produce pyroclastic flows. The fragmental material on the slopes and in valleys would be periodically remobilized into debris flows. Significant structural mitigation would have to be built to reclaim use of the Highway 99 corridor and Squamish area.

Life He was born in 1808 the son of William Mills, a successful merchant trading between American and Britain (with bases in Liverpool and Greenock, who was later Lord Provost of Glasgow. He studied at Glasgow University, but did not graduate, instead becoming a Manager of the Leith branch of his father's shipping company in 1827 (aged only 19). He organised steam packets between Leith and London from an office at Newhaven harbour.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1830. In 1833/34 Mills went into independent business with a partner, Charles Wood, creating \\"Wood & Mills\\", based at Littlemills in Bowling west of Glasgow.https://www.west- dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and- galleries/collections/shipbuilding/shipbuilding-bowling/ Here they made iron- hull steamers and canal boats. Charles Wood dissolved the partnership around 1840 to set up alone, and Mills himself abandoned shipbuilding in 1844 due to a downturn in the market. In 1845 he began working both as a stockbroker and as Manager of the Bowling and Balloch Railway Company and the Loch Lomond Steamship Company (based at Balloch). In 1857 he branched out into journalism, creating the Glasgow Advertiser and Shipping Gazette. Around 1860 Mills went into some degree of partnership with the Clyde shipbuilders Tod & Macgregor who built a ship to Mills' design. This was one of the first ever double- hulled ship and was named the SS Alliance. The ship was used as a blockade runner in the American Civil War and was lost in 1867. From 1866 Mills ran the Milton Chemical Works. In 1869 he set up a newspaper The Northern Star in Aberdeen (not to be confused with its Liverpool predecessor). From 1871 he was a literary critic for the Glasgow Mail.

Line S2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn has operated to Dietzenbach station since then. The Offenbach-Bieber‚ÄìDietzenbach railway was opened as a branch of the Rodgau Railway on 1 December 1898. Trains ran on this line between Dietzenbach (Hess) station and Offenbach Hauptbahnhof.

As part of the expansion to the S-Bahn, the station was rebuilt on the existing line. The station is especially popular for commuters from the district of Offenbach, as it is located near the administration of Offenbach district and at a large bus interchange.

He competed in college basketball for Missouri and Canisius. Early life Robertson is the son of Shannon Robertson and grew up in Toronto. He played baseball and soccer growing up but decided to focus on basketball in eighth grade. He attended Vaughan Secondary School, where he was a bench player on a team led by Andrew Wiggins. Robertson followed his AAU coach Shane James to Thornlea Secondary School to try to get more playing time. As a senior, he posted 22 points, five assists and two steals per game. Even so, he was lightly recruited, and only received his lone Division I offer from Canisius after assistant coach Mike Mennenga came to scout a different player. Other college coaches liked his shooting but thought he was skinny and frail. College career Robertson redshirted his freshman season at Canisius, hitting the weight room and staying in the gym late. Campus police sometimes told Robertson to leave the gym. In his redshirt freshman year, Robertson scored 6.8 points per game and was named to the MAAC All-Rookie Team. Throughout his Canisius career, he developed into a productive 3-point shooter and potent scorer. He averaged 14.1 points per game as a sophomore in 2015-16. He scored 16 points in a 93-69 loss to Kentucky on November 13, 2016. As a redshirt junior, Robertson averaged 16.1 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. He was named to the Second Team All-MAAC. After his junior season, he opted to transfer to Missouri, choosing the Tigers over Georgia Tech because he liked Cuonzo Martin‚Äôs coaching philosophy. Robertson expected to be a three-point specialist playing alongside Michael Porter Jr., however his role expanded when Porter was injured in the first game. Robertson scored 23 points in a win against Wagner on November 13, 2017, shooting 5 for 8 on three-pointers. In a victory over St. John's on November 24, he posted 17 points and five assists.

Missouri rebounded to record a five game winning streak, during which time Robertson scored 20.6 points per game. Over this stretch he won two SEC Player of the Week awards. As a graduate transfer at Missouri, Robertson led the Tigers in scoring with 16.6 points per game while shooting 43 percent from behind the arc. At the conclusion of the regular season he was named to the First Team All-SEC. Robertson competed in a 3-on-3 tournament after the season alongside other SEC players.

He specialises as a compere and a warm-up act for television shows. Early life Olver was born in 1975 in Bristol, where he grew up in the Brislington area. His father John was a policeman and his mother Philomena worked at a cinema in Bristol. After graduating from university in 1996, he worked as a careers adviser in prisons and young offenders' institutes. Career Olver started doing stand-up in the late 1990s and quickly expanded to compering. He won the Leicester Comedy Festival Best New Show award in 2011. He was nominated for Best Compere at the 2015 Chortle Awards. Olver performed in the live final of the BBC Radio New Comedy Award 2016 in Edinburgh. He ran Olver's Student Comedy Night at Jester's Comedy Club in Bristol for several years. While compering a gig there in 2003, Olver slipped and fell on stage, dislocating his knee and breaking his ankle. Lying on the floor, he went on compering until the paramedics arrived and carried him off the stage. In 2004, Olver had his first job as a warm-up comedian for the show Kings of Comedy, presented by Russell Brand. Since then, he has been providing warm-up for numerous television shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, Pointless, Deal or No Deal, Thronecast, The Last Leg, Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled and the chat shows hosted by Jonathan Ross and Alan Carr. Between 2005 and 2016, he did warm-up on about 3,000 episodes of the game show Deal or No Deal which was filmed in Bristol. Olver has worked teaching comedy to young offenders. In December 2017, he came up with the idea for the Belly Laughs series of gigs when he realised that local restaurants were having trouble getting enough guests in the month of January. January is also a slow month for comedians, so he thought of a way of combining the two as well as raising money for charity, by organising pop-up comedy gigs in restaurants each January since 2018. Guests pay an extra ¬£10 that go directly to The Julian Trust, a Bristol charity that runs an emergency night shelter for homeless people and rough sleepers. In 2019, the event was expanded to Wales, Bath and Devon. Belly Laughs got together with the food charity Fareshare in November 2019 for two fundraising gigs at their warehouse in St Philip's, with Olver compering and Angela Barnes and Jon Richardson headlining. The two events raised more than ¬£5000. Personal life Olver has previously shared houses with fellow comedians Russell Howard, John Robins, Jon Richardson and Wil Hodgson. In 2019, he was living in the Brislington area of Bristol, sharing a house with comedian Mat Ewins.

It is regarded as the first humorous novel in Gujarati literature and as the first Gujarati novel written in the first person narrative. Ramanbhai used the novel to illustrate the ridiculousness of a highly orthodox view of Gujurati society and as a vehicle for social reform. Although criticised for a lack of character development and a repetitiveness of situations, the novel has remained popular to this day. It has been republished numerous times and is currently in print in several languages. It is still common to nickname highly orthodox Sanskrit-accented Gujaratis after the eponymous protagonist. Overview left Bhadrambhadra is a 1900 Gujarati language satirical novel by Ramanbhai Neelkanth. It is regarded as the first humorous novel in Gujarati literature. The novel is influenced by The Pickwick Papers and Don Quixote. Ramanlal had a long running controversy with Manilal Dwivedi on numerous topics related to religion, philosophy, social reform, education and literature. Ramanlal was a liberal who was open to western influences while Manilal was an orthodox who opposed the western influences. Ramanbhai showed up the rigidity, pettiness, vanity and hypocrisy of these opponents of social reform in the book. Ramanbhai Neelkanth's enthusiasm for social reform was strongly influenced by his father, Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth, an educationist and social reformer. Bhadrambhadra was serialized from 1892 to 1900 in Jnanasudha, the organ of Ahmedabad Prarthana Samaj edited by Ramanbhai himself, and then published as a book in 1900 with further amendments. Ramanbhai wanted to publish the first edition with paintings but was unable to. In 1918 the third edition of the novel was published with illustrations by Ravishankar Raval. The 7th edition, published in 1953 with a preface by Jyotindra Dave, did not have illustrations; only photographs of Ramanbhai and Ambalal, the publisher, were included in it. Further editions were published without illustrations or photographs. Synopsis Performance of Bhadrambhadra at H. K Arts College, Ahmedabad; 1 September 2018 The novel is named after its protagonist, Bhadrambhadra. It is narrated in the first person by Ambaram Kevalram Modakiya, a pupil of Bhadrambhadra. It is the first Gujarati novel to be written in the first person narrative. Bhadrambhadra is an orthodox Hindu Brahmin and an idiosyncratic person, who is opposed to anything that is non-traditional, non-Hindu, non-Sanskrit, non-Aryan or that is different from his traditional way of life or pattern of thoughts. Because of this, he changed his name from Daulat Shankar to Bhadrambhadra (lit. Good Good), as the word Daulat is non-Sanskrit, non-Indian and so, he felt, irreligious in origin. In the novel Bhadrambhadra speaks highly Sanskritised Gujarati and therefore is not able to make himself understood, which creates humorous situations. Reception and criticism Bhadrambhadra is considered a classic of Gujarati literature and it was received well by readers and a number of critics. However, the Encyclopedia of Indian Literature states that there is no development of character, and because of a lack of variety of situations and of behavior by the protagonist, the humour is not sustained throughout and the latter half of the book becomes uninteresting. K. M. Munshi gave a mixed review. He noted in Gujarat and Its Literature: > The story is poorly told in places and lacks organic unity. The work is > rendered enjoyable by absurd situations and still funnier Samskritised > Gujarati. Bhadrambhadra, the pretentious fool with his holy enthusiasm to > secure the ever-rising glorious triumph of eternal Arya Dharma, is an > immortal figure in Gujarati fiction. Anandshankar Dhruv strongly criticized the novel and called it 'a barrier in social reform activities'. Legacy During Ramanbhai's life, the character Bhadrambhadra became very popular and anybody who spoke Sanskritised Gujarati was nicknamed Bhadrambhadra. It is still a common nickname for any highly orthodox person. In 1994, Gujarati humourist Ratilal Borisagar published a novel Sambhavami Yuge Yuge in which he represented Bhadrambahdra in contemporary milieu with light criticism of Sardar Sarovar Dam project. In 2014, he published another humourous novel Bhadrambhadra Amar Chhe focusing on gender equality. Gujarati writer Viththal Pandya wrote a short story \\"Bhadrambhadra Ane Hu\\" which brings Bhadrambhadra with him in contemporary milieu of 20th century in which they visit cinema and hotels in new sociopolitical climate. Gujarati columnist Urvish Kothari wrote a short novel titled \\"Bhadrambhadra\\" which is based on Bhadrambhadra's adventures in the Patidar reservation agitation of 2015.

To address this, the program provides \\"financing to grocers or real estate developers seeking to open or expand stores in areas without adequate access to affordable, nutritious foods.\\" the program has awarded $220 million in grants and assistance, leveraged approximately $1 billion through private investment and other sources, and supported approximately 1,000 businesses in 35 states.

She was also a spiritist and a believer in the Black Mass, a stock exchange gambler, a plotter for the restoration of the royalist r√©gime in France, as well as an advisor of other women in matrimony and affairs of the heart. Mirtel was famous for the murder of her second husband, Georges Bessarabo, whose body was sent in a \\"bloody trunk\\" \\"from Paris to Nancy, by rail. Brilliantly defended by Vincent de Moro-Giafferi, she was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. She was suspected of having murdered her first husband as well. Early years Marie-Louise Victorine Grou√®s was born in Lyon on October 24, 1868. She was the aunt of Abb√© Pierre. Career Known by her pen name, H√©ra Mirtel, she wrote novels, poems, plays, and many articles, including columns for Le Sillon de Bordeau x, magazine exclusively written by women; Le Soleil, daily; La Renaissance Contemporaine, literary review; and Le Divan. She was the founder of the newspaper L'Entente, and secretary general of the editorial staff of La Renaissance contemporain. In addition, Mirtel worked in advertising, and lectured at Universit√© Populaire de Montmartre. Mirtel advocated a matriarchal feminism inspired by the theses of Johann Jakob Bachofen.H√©ra Mirtel, preface in the brochure of Cleyre Yvelin, \\"√âtude sur le f√©minisme dans l'antiquit√©\\", a series of articles in Petit Var of Toulon (1905-1906), Paris, V. Giard & E. Bri√®re, 1908 In 1897, in Saltillo, Mexico, she married Pierre Paul Antoine Jacques, a trader of the Ubaye valley. After becoming financially enriched in Mexico, she became a widow in March 1914, with two daughters, Paule (1898) and Louise (1900). In 1915, in Mexico, she married Ishmael Jacob Providence Weissmann, a commissioner born in Romania, who called himself Georges Bessarabo. Mirtel murdered Bessarabo in Square La Bruy√®re, Paris, on July 31, 1920. On August 4, 1920, his corpse, shot dead by a revolver, was discovered at the bottom of a trunk in the Nancy rail station, having been sent by train from the Gare de l'Est. On June 21, 1922, Mirtel, defended by Vincent de Moro-Giafferi, was sentenced to twenty years of forced labor. During the investigation, suspicions weighed on the death of his first husband, who feared that his wife would poison him, and who committed suicide with a revolver in March 1914. But the investigation confirmed the suicide. His daughter, Paule, present at the scene of the crime and judged for complicity, was acquitted. Many dailies followed the trial, rich in theatrics: Le Petit Parisien (17 issues), Le Temps (12 January 1922), Le Matin (22 June 1922), Le Figaro (29 April 1921), Le petit journal illustr√© (June 18, 1922), L'Ouest-√âclair (June 9, 1922) and Le Gaulois (April 29, 1921). Arthur Bern√®de recounted the lawsuit in the Bessarabo case (Tallandier, 1931). In 1929, after recognizing that Paule had lied, there was a request for the revision of the trial.

This makes these sockets especially affordable and avoids running costs compared to conventional charging infrastructure, such as costs for maintenance or meter point operation. As a result, precise metering, secure data transmission and efficient billing fulfill all preconditions for a comprehensive and future- proof charging and billing solution for electric mobility.  Development  The mobile meter was developed in the projects ‚ÄûOn Board Metering I & II‚Äú, that kicked off in March 2003, sponsored by the German ministry for economic affairs and technology. Participants of the project were: *ITF-EDF Fr√∂schl Ltd. (Specialist for control centers) *PTB, The National Metrology Institute of Germany *VOLTARIS Ltd. (Specialists for metering and energy services) *ubitricity Gesellschaft f√ºr verteilte Energiesysteme mbH (Mobile electricity provider / project leader)  Aims of the project  The project's approach to electric mobility was not tackling it as a singular challenge. The aim was rather to make a significant contribution to the energy transition by taking electric mobility one step further. For this to happen, the EV was to become a system-relevant factor as an energy storage device. The goal was to create as much power grid connection points as possible while at the same time safeguarding exact metering and billing of electricity. This way, the vehicle could gain access to the grid anytime it is parked (ratio of EVs to grid connection points greater than 1). Up to that date, charging infrastructure for electric cars was thought of as stationary, similar to conventional gas stations for combustion cars. For this, a shift of technology from the infrastructure to the vehicle side (or the cable, respectively) was needed. Such a network of ubiquitous charging spots was only to be realized with charging infrastructure that would cause comparably low costs over longer periods of time.  Potentials of the model  The disruptive approach of mobile metering has by now opened up new possibilities and business models for electric mobility. *Contribution to grid stability. Electric cars can be integrated into the grid as intelligent storage devices. This makes it easier to incorporate the fluctuating electricity production from renewable resources into the overall grid architecture. *The technology shift from the infrastructure to the vehicle/cable reduces the cost of charging spots. A ubiquitous roll-out of charging infrastructure can be executed with much lower capital investments. *Free choice of electricity provider and exact billing. The electricity contract can be closed for the vehicle or cable thanks to the mobile meter, while the choice of the respective provider is free.

He came to international attention in August 2014 when he broke the athlete Kilian Jornet's record for a speed ascent of Kilimanjaro, climbing up and down in 6 hours 42 minutes. In February 2015 he also broke Jornet's record on Aconcagua, climbing up and down in 11 hours 52 minutes. In June 2019 he broke Kilian Jornet's speed record on Denali by a single minute, climbing up and down in 11 hours 44 minutes. A notable feature of this ascent is that while Jornet used skis for his descent, therefore descending much more quickly, Egloff ran and climbed back down again. Early life and education Born and raised in Ecuador to a Swiss father and Ecuadorian mother, he climbed mountains from an early age, assisting his father with his mountain guiding business from the age of 15. When he was 17 he moved to Zurich, Switzerland to study for a degree in business administration. While in Switzerland he served in the Swiss Army and tried unsuccessfully to train as a professional footballer. At the age of 25 he returned to Ecuador and established his own mountain guiding business. He took up mountain biking and raced with the Ecuador national team for two years.

[1993] EWCA Civ 16, [1993] 4 All ER 975, also shortened to Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers by legal analysts, is a 1993 English defamation court case. The case was brought by the television presenter Esther Rantzen against Mirror Group Newspapers, publisher of The People which had alleged that Rantzen had protected a child abuser after he had given information about child abuse in a school. The jury in the case at the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales found for Rantzen and awarded her ¬£250,000 in damages. The defendants appealed the award to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales where the award was reduced to ¬£110,000 as the court ruled that the damages awarded by the jury had been disproportionate.  Background  Rantzen had helped to set up ChildLine with the BBC and ran it as the chairwoman. On 3 February 1991, The People newspaper published four articles alleging that Rantzen had used her position as chair of ChildLine to protect a teacher accused of child abuse as he had helped her earlier. The teacher in question had told Rantzen about abuse at Crookham Court school and resigned from teaching there as a result, which prompted Rantzen to take her That's Life! TV programme to the school to investigate, during which they had found evidence of abuse. Child pornography was found at the school after which was later attributed to having been created by the teacher, who had taken a new teaching job in Kent. The newspaper articles alleged that Rantzen had covered up the teacher's past and failed to inform the new school of this fact. The articles also claimed that Rantzen had lied to the newspaper by asking them not to publish them on the grounds that if the articles were published, then it would hamper the police investigation.  High Court trial  Rantzen sued Mirror Group Newspapers for libelling her. She claimed that they had made implications that she had covered up child abuse allegations as a reward to the teacher for helping her and abandoned her own morality, had taken no action despite her position in ChildLine, made insincere and hypocritical statements and had lied to protect herself and the teacher. Mirror Group Newspapers put in a plea of justification and argued with a defence of fair comment. They argued against the plaintiff's claim that the article had implied that a cover up was a reward for assistance; the Judge allowed for this interpretation to be left up to the jury as well as directing them to consider the value of any award. The jury found that the articles were defamatory and awarded Rantzen ¬£250,000 in damages.  Appeal  Mirror Group Newspapers appealed to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that the judge had misdirected the jury by allowing them to consider the value of the award and downplaying mitigating factors in justification and requested a new trial. The Court dismissed this, as they felt that the judge had not misdirected the jury as he had been reasonable when balancing the decision. The defendants also argued that the award by the jury was excessive in relation to the damage that the articles had caused. As a result, they requested a new trial under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. The Court considered this as the Act allowed for the Court either to order a new trial or to substitute the award for a figure that they deem appropriate. This power was introduced by the Lord Chancellor during the drafting of the bill so that disproportionately large awards by juries, once called \\"Mickey Mouse money\\" by members of the judiciary as juries tended to award amounts for libel that were larger than those for personal injury claims, could be substituted by the courts. The Court considered this alongside the applicability of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They ruled that the Act which allowed for a new trial to be ordered if the award was disproportionate allowed for them to substitute the award in lieu of ordering a new trial and stated that juries should be instructed to consider purchasing power and proportionality of any award. As a result, the Court of Appeal quashed the ¬£250,000 award and substituted it with an award of ¬£110,000 and Rantzen was granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords.

It first aired on May 7, 2018 on Cartoon Network as the second half of a two-part special with the preceding episode \\"Can't Go Back\\". It was directed by Kat Morris and Liz Artinian and written and storyboarded by Danny Cragg and Hilary Florido from a story by Matt Burnett, Ben Levin, Kat Morris, Joe Johnston, and series creator Rebecca Sugar. Sugar described it and \\"Can't Go Back\\" as \\"huge episodes that we‚Äôve been building to for a very long time\\" that would have major implications for the rest of the series, and change viewers' interpretations of the events of previous episodes. The episode focuses on Steven Universe confronting Pearl with questions about the supposed assassination of Pink Diamond millennia ago, and builds to a major plot twist for the series: the revelation that Steven's mother Rose Quartz was actually Pink Diamond herself, who faked her death with Pearl's assistance. This episode received critical acclaim for Deedee Magno Hall's performance as Pearl, the quality of the artwork, and the structure of the episode's story, as well the significance of the plot twist for the broader narrative of the series. Plot Steven (Zach Callison) is contemplating the conflicting information he has received about Pink Diamond's shattering, and anxiously waits while Amethyst (Michaela Dietz) teaches Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) how to use her new cell phone. After Amethyst leaves, Steven confronts Pearl and asks her if she was the one who shattered Pink Diamond. Pearl doesn't answer, seemingly shocked. When Amethyst returns, Pearl immediately changes the subject and stores her phone in her gem, leaving Steven confused. Later, Steven receives a text message from Pearl: \\"I want to tell you but I can't.üôä\\" Steven returns home and confronts her about it, but Pearl says she hasn't used her phone since that morning. As she tries and fails to retrieve her phone from her gem, Steven receives another text‚Äîa üå∫ emoji. She tells him to enter her gem and get it himself, hinting that he will find the answers to his questions there. Inside Pearl's gem, Steven meets a personification of Pearl's ability to compartmentalize. She can't find the phone stored with Pearl's other belongings and sends Steven deeper into Pearl's mind to look for it. He visits her traumatic memories of Rose Quartz's pregnancy and the aftermath of the Gem War. He eventually arrives at the moment after Pink Diamond's shattering. He sees gem shards on the ground and Rose holding her sword. When he steps closer, he realizes that it is not Rose but Pearl, shape-shifted into Rose's form. She reveals Pink Diamond's undamaged gemstone in her hand and sends Steven further back through her memories. Steven ends up inside Pink Diamond's palanquin hearing a conversation between Rose (Susan Egan) and Pearl. While Pearl is hesitant to do what Rose is asking, Rose insists, and tells her that they'll be free afterward. Pearl finally agrees to Rose's plan and, to Steven's shock, Rose reverts into her natural form: Pink Diamond. She creates some fake diamond shards and swallows them, and gives one last command to Pearl as a Diamond: to never again speak of what really happened. As Pink Diamond leaves the palanquin, Pearl turns to Steven and gives him the missing cell phone. She assumes the form of Rose Quartz and heads out to fake the shattering. Steven texts Pearl back in the real world and is pulled out of her mind. Steven somberly states what he has learned: his mother was actually Pink Diamond. Behind him, Amethyst and Garnet gasp in shock. Production This episode was written and storyboarded by Danny Cragg and Hilary Florido. The episode was directed by Liz Artinian (art director) and Kat Morris (supervising director). Broadcast and reception The broadcast of both \\"Can't Go Back\\" and \\"A Single Pale Rose\\" was viewed by 0.74 million viewers. The episode has received acclaim for its resolution of one of the show's biggest mysteries and its compelling narrative. Eric Thurm of The A.V.

The production and distribution of the crops, fibers, and garments used in fashion all contribute to differing forms of environmental pollution, including water, air, and soil pollution. The textile industry is the second greatest polluter of local freshwater in the world, and is culpable for roughly one-fifth of all industrial water pollution. Some of the main factors that contribute to this industrial caused pollution are the vast overproduction of fashion itemsFashion Data: Calculating the Cost of the Fashion Machine, the use of synthetic fibers, and the agriculture pollution of fashion crops.  Fast fashion  The amount of new garments bought by Americans has tripled since the 1960s. This exponential increase causes the need for more resources, and the need for a speedier process from which clothes are produced. One of the main contributors to the rapid production of pollution is the rapid production of clothes due to the rapid consumption of customers. Every year the world as a whole consumes more than 80 billion items of clothing. Those clothes contribute to resource pollution and waste pollution, due to the fact that most of these items will one day be thrown out. People are consuming more and they want it for cheaper prices. And the companies producing these cheap items who are making a profit want the clothes as fast as possible, this creates a trend called fast fashion. Fast fashion is \\"an approach to the design, creation, and marketing of clothing fashions that emphasizes making fashion trends quickly and cheaply available to consumers.\\" The idea is that speedy mass production combined with cheap labor will make clothes cheaper for those buying them, thus allowing these fast fashion trends to maintain economic success. The main concern with fast fashion is the clothes waste it produces. According to the Environmental Protection Agency 15.1 million tons of textile clothing waste was produced in 2013 alone. When textile clothing ends up in landfills the chemicals on the clothes, such as the dye, can cause environmental damage by leaching the chemicals into the ground. The excess waste also contributes to the issue of using so many sites just to store waste and garbage. When unsold clothes are burnedDestroying unsold cloths is fashion's dirty secret, and we're complicit, it releases CO2 into the atmosphere. As per a World Resources Institute report, 1.2 billion tons of CO2 is released in the atmosphere per year by fast fashion industry. In 2019, it was announced that France was making an effort to prevent companies from this practice of burning unsold fashion items.Macron hires Kering CEO to improve sustainability of luxury fashionFrance clamps down on fashion brands that destroy unsold goods so that they won't be found in discount bins  Synthetic fibers and natural fibers  Now that there is continuous increase in the amount of clothing that is consumed, another issue that arises is that the clothing is no longer made from natural materials/crops. Clothing used to be produced by mainly \\"natural fibers\\" such as wool, cotton or silk. Now there is a switch from natural fibers to inexpensive synthetic textile fibers such as polyester or nylon. Polyester is one of the most popular fibers used in fashion today, it is found in about 60% of garments in retail stores, that is about 21.3 million tons of polyester. The popularity of polyester keep increasing as well, seeing as there was a 157 percent increase of polyester clothing consumption from 2000 to 2015. Synthetic polyester is made from a chemical reaction of coal, petroleum, air and water two of which are fossil fuels. When coal is burned it creates heavy amounts of air pollution containing carbon dioxide. When petroleum is used it creates several air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfur dioxide. The creation of polyester creates pollution, as well as its finished project. Polyester is \\"non-biodegradable\\" meaning it can never be converted to a state that is naturally found in the natural world. Due to all of the time and resources it takes to make polyester and it never being able to revert to a state that can contribute to any natural nutrient cycles polyester can be considered energy intensive with no net gain. When polyester clothing is washed micro plastics are shedding and entering the water system which is leading to micro pollution in water ways, including oceans. Due to the micro pollutants small size it is easy for fish within waterways to absorb them in their body fat. The fish can then be consumed by humans, and these humans will also absorb the polyester micro pollutants in the fish in a process called biomagnification. While it has been stated that synthetic fibers are having a negative impact on the environment, natural fibers also contribute to pollution through agricultural pollution. Cotton production requires a large amount of pesticides and water use. Cotton is considered the world's dirtiest crop because it uses 16% of the world's pesticides. Two of the main ingredients in pesticides are nitrates and phosphates. When the pesticides leak into stream systems surrounding the cropland the nitrates and phosphates contribute to water eutrophication. Water eutrophication is an environmental phenomenon that causes a depletion of oxygen when the nutrient overload from pesticides causes a boom in plant growth and death. Wool is made from the fur of sheep and sheep are ruminants hence producing methane (a very potent greenhouse gas). The same problem exists for leather as cattle are ruminants too. For temperate zones, linen (which is made from flax) is considered a better alternative.Is linen the new cotton? Also, hemp also seem a good choice.Ecological Footprint of Cotton Hemp and Polyester Textile made from seaweed is also on the horizon. As an alternative to leather, biofabricated leather would be a good choice. See also * Sustainable fashion * Milkweed * Stinging nettle  References  Further reading *Ross, Robert J. S.

She came into British hands c.1807 after having been seized for attempting to evade the British East India Company's monopoly on British trade with India. She then initially traded with Charleston until 1811 when she went whaling in the Gal√°pagos Islands. There the Americans captured her in 1813. Her captors sailed her to Valparaiso where the Spanish colonial government seized her. Montezuma became Moctezuma and served as a sloop of the First Chilean Navy Squadron. The Chilean Navy sold her in 1828 and she returned to mercantile service. American East Indiaman John Ashmead sailed Montezuma from Philadelphia on 9 April 1804, bound for Bengal. She arrived at Calcutta on 8 August. She left Calcutta on 2 December and arrived back in Philadelphia on 8 April 1804. On 21 May 1805 Montezuma, John Anley, master, sailed to Batavia. Her voyage netted a profit of $9475.75. She then made a voyage too the Cape of Good Hope on behalf of the British Government. At the start of her journey a gale blew her out of the Delaware and she had to put into New York for $2000 in repairs and refitting before she could resume her voyage. Captain Anley delivered bread and wheat. British career The British seized Montezuma for violating the EIC's monopoly on trading between England and India, and she was condemned at London.

Montezuma had already gathered 1400 barrels of sperm oil when taken. That same day Essex captured the British whalers and Policy. American prize The next day Captain David Porter, of Essex put a prize crew of 10 men under the command of Midshipman William H. Odenheimer aboard Montezuma. Porter sent seven of his prizes ( (ex-Atlantic), Barclay, , , Montezuma, and ) into Valparaiso. They arrived on 12 August. Two days later a storm drove Policy and Montezuma into each other with some damage to Montezuma. The Americans were unable to sell their prizes. Following Porter's instructions, Policy sailed for the United States. Essex Junior then sailed to rendezvous with Porter, leaving the remaining prizes at Valparaiso. Montezuma remained moored at Valparaiso at least through spring 1814. The Chilean government refused British and American claims to her. Eventually it seized and sold her, retaining the proceeds. It is currently unclear who she was sold to and what flag she sailed under. Moctezuma Moctezuma re- appeared during the first blockade of Callao by the Chilean Squadron 1819. On 24 March 1819,Eccheveria, Gerrado Principales naves de guerra a vela hispanoamericanas ‚Äì retrieved 11 January 2011 the warships under the command of Thomas Cochrane captured Moctezuma, as she, with a US-flag, tried to break the blockade and deliver weapons to the royalists. Moctezuma participated in the Capture of Valdivia and in the Freedom Expedition of Per√∫ as a dispatch boat. She was left in Callao, but when Cochrane arrived (1822) there he found Moctezuma under the flag of the new Peruvian Navy. He seized her again and put her officers ashore. He was unaware that during his absence Bernardo O'Higgins had given the sloop to San Martin as a personal present. Later she was commissioned under Lieutenant John Pascoe Grenfell for Cochrane's use as a flag ship. On 18 January 1823 Cochrane's flag as Vice Admiral of Chile was lowered for the last time from Moctezumas main mast. He then sailed to Brazil where he assumed command of the Brazilian Navy. In late 1823‚Äìearly 1824 the Chilean Navy mounted an ultimately unsuccessful expedition to Peru.

George Law saw the chance to provide competition and had the Oregon (a \\"floating palace\\") built in 1845. History This was then the fastest steamboat in the country. She was installed on the Stonington run with tickets sold at competitive prices. Consequently Drew was to lose trade. Cornelius Vanderbilt a business partner and friend of Drew made a challenge to race her against his own ship Traveler, which was serving the New Haven to New York route. Traveler was half the size of the Oregon. The boats raced in 1845 a twenty mile course with no clear winner. River race A frustrated Vanderbilt was to commission a new contender the C. Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt weighed 1000 tons and could reach 25 miles per hour. Vanderbilt made a wager of $1000. A race was agreed for 1 June 1847; the route was agreed as a round trip on the Hudson River from the Battery to Ossining and back. 70 miles in total. Both departed the Battery at 11 AM going north with the tide against them, for 30 miles they were neck and neck. However as the vessels turned a stake boat at Ossining the Oregon pulled half a length ahead. Cornelius Vanderbilt, who had taken the wheel, took the turn too quickly and over shot resulting in a small collision, which severely damaged the Oregons wheelhouse.

He served the First French Empire during the French Revolutionary Wars under Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt and later in the Italian Peninsula. Although born in France, the conquests of the War of the Second Coalition brought him to the Italian Peninsula where his chief legacy was the founding of the masonic Rite of Misraim in 1813. Biography =Background= B√©darride came from a Sephardic Jewish family from Provence; the family took their name from B√©darrides where the family had lived for some time and had been familiar with Kabbalistic currents in Judaism there through the D√∂nmeh movement. Mardoch√©e \\"Marc\\" B√©darride was born at Cavaillon, then part of Comtat Venaissin, Papal States on 4 February 1776 to Gad B√©darride (1740‚Äî25 December 1800) and Gentille Milhaud (1747‚Äî6 September 1831). He had two brothers; Jossuda \\"Joseph\\" B√©darride (1787‚Äî1840) and Michel B√©darride (29 August 1778‚Äî9 February 1856). Their father, Gad, became a freemason at Avignon in 1771. =Military= He served as part of Napoleon Bonaparte's Army as an officer during the French campaign in Egypt alongside Jean Poussielgue, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, Bernardino Drovetti and Jean Baptiste Henraux. After returning to Europe from the Egypt campaign he arrived at Livorno in the Italian Peninsula. On 14 January 1799 he was appointed Captain of Staff of the Army of the Parthenopean Republic under the command of General Jean √âtienne Championnet. He was commander of the 18th \\"Les Emules de Mars\\" Line Battalion at the Battle of Marengo. =Freemasonry= While serving in the French military, B√©darride became involved in Freemasonry. He was a scholar of Egyptology (something then very popular in France) and an honorary member of the Bonapartist Lodge of the Philosophical Scottish Rite \\"Saint Napoleon\\" of Palazzo Cocchi-Serristori in Florence. In 1801, he organized a meeting in Pisa of the most important Masonic lodges of the Kingdom of Etruria, together with Jacob B√©darride, Mathieu de Lesseps, the Consul General of France in Florence (and father of Ferdinand de Lesseps) and \\"Philalete Abraham\\" (perhaps Giulio Cesare Tassoni, Napoleonic diplomat). In 1813 he founded in Naples the lodge \\"La Figlia della Sapienza\\" then directed in 1814 by the Grand Cofto General Lorenzo Montemayor (1768-1841) and historically linked to the lodge \\"I Figli della Libert√†\\" which had been underground since 1799. He is remembered for having founded the Masonic \\"Rito Egizio di Misraim\\" in 1813 and, together with Jacob and Joseph, constituted the first Egyptian Rite of Paris on 19 May 1815, called Arc en Ciel (Arcobaleno), closely associated with the Italian and French circles of Filippo Buonarroti. The definitive structure of the Egyptian Rite of Misraim dates back to 1818, while in Brussels in 1819 it regulated the \\"Tegolatura Suprema Scala di Napoli\\", better known as \\"Arcana Arcanorum.\\" Legacy After his death, B√©darride's Rite of Misraim merged with the Rite of Memphis in 1880 under Giuseppe Garibaldi to become the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misra√Øm. The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia (1877) by Kenneth R. H.

Stanford set the traditional liturgical texts in English in 1879 when he was the organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. They were published by Novello in 1902. Stanford orchestrated the work in 1903, with additional organ.  History  In 1877, Charles Villiers Stanford, returning from extended studies in Leipzig and Berlin, was appointed organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. He had to conduct two weekly rehearsals, training the boys for six hours per week during term time, and four hours during vacation. Choral services were held on Saturdays and Sundays, also on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, on the Feast of the Circumcision (1 January) and Epiphany (6 January). Stanford composed the service in B major, as the first of several, for mixed choir and organ in 1879. He set the traditional liturgical Anglican texts in English, as part of his efforts to improve singing at the College Chapel. The Jubilate Deo (Psalm 100) and Te Deum in B were first performed during Matins (Morning service) on 25 May 1879. On 24 August that year, during vacation, the Te Deum was repeated with the first performance of the Benedictus, while the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis were first performed in the evening service. The Service in B was a significant development in Stanford's setting of the morning and evening canticles.  Structure and music  The work is structured in the ten traditional sections of the Anglican service: * Morning Service  Te Deum  Jubilate  Benedictus * Communion Service  Kyrie (10-fold)  Credo  Sursum corda  Sanctus  Gloria in excelsis * Evening Service  Magnificat  Nunc dimittis A reviewer summarised: \\"The service is a major milestone in the development of Anglican church music, representing the harnessing of Brahmsian symphonic technique to the needs of the Anglican liturgy.\\"  Recordings  A 2010 recording The Feast of Saint Peter the Apostle at Westminster Abbey, celebrating the patron saint of Westminster Abbey, contains four of the ten parts, performed by the Choir of Westminster Abbey and organist Robert Quinney, conducted by James O'Donnell.

He was the son of John V of Brittany and Joan of France, and the younger brother of the dukes Francis I and Peter II.  Biography  Gilles was born in 1420 to the incumbent duke, John V of Brittany and his wife, Joan of France, the daughter of the French king, Charles VI. He received a small appanage. Upon his accession in 1442, his brother Francis I sent him to the embassy to Henry VI of England, where he was granted a pension. In 1444, after returning to Brittany, Gilles kidnapped and married the eight-year-old Fran√ßoise de Dinan, a rich heiress. He thus obtained the barony of Ch√¢teaubriant, and many other places in Brittany including the Guildo Castle situated in Crehen in the department C√¥tes-d'Armor. Gilles's growing power led him to demand a larger portion of his father's inheritance from his brother. Faced with his brother's refusal, he approached the King of England and offered his services. A letter from 5 July 1445 was intercepted by agents of the Duke, who refused to pardon his younger brother until the intervention of his uncle, the conn√©table de Richemont. The arrival of English archers from Normandy at Guildo Castle caused the \\"French Party\\" led by Arthur de Montauban at the court of his brother the Duke, to arrange Gilles's arrest by Prigent de Co√´tivy on 26 June 1446 by orders of the King of France. He was taken to Dinan, then Rennes where his brother refused to see him and then finally Ch√¢teaubriant. His property and that of his wife, Fran√ßoise de Dinan, which kept near the Duchess of Brittany, was confiscated. Despite intervention by his uncle, the conn√©table de Richemont, the trial for treason and l√®se- majest√©, overseen by the Attorney General Olivier du Breil, began in Redon on 31 July 1446 in front of the Estates of Brittany. They refused to judge Gilles, who stayed in prison on the orders of his brother. In 1447, Olivier du Breil refused to hear another trial, while Henry VI of England threatened to intervene militarily to free him. Gilles was transferred to Moncontour Castle in October 1448, under the guard of Olivier de M√©el. Poorly treated, he wrote in December to Charles VII of France, who sent the Admiral Prigent de Co√´tivy to the Duke of Brittany to demand his release. Co√´tivy arrived in Vannes in May 1449 and obtained the release of Gilles, when the Duke received a faked letter from the King of England, written by Pierre La Rose, asking him to release Gilles. Gilles' release was subsequently suspended by the Duke, enraged by the fake letter. Gilles was then transferred to Touffou, then to Hardouinaye Castle. His jailers Olivier de M√©el, Jean Rageart, Roussel Malestouche, Jean de la Ch√®ze and Oreille-Pelue attempted to starve him to death but he received help from a poor woman.

Biography  Lan Mu's parents died in his early years and he went to be a craftsman's apprentice to raise himself and his younger brother Lan He (). Based on his hard work and talent, he became a good wood carving master in Chaozhou. In 1916, (Taish≈ç 5th year), Lan Mu left his hometown and moved to Penghu with his brother. In 1923, (Taish≈ç 11th year), when Lan Mu was 40 years old (as the East Asian age reckoning), he was surprisingly assigned to be the chief architect of Penghu Mazu Temple repair work in a young age. Three years later, Lan Mu and other craftsmen successfully finished the repair. Penghu Mazu Temple was the most important work in Lan Mu's career. In addition to Mazu Temple, Lan Mu took part in other repair works, such as Beiji Temple and Beichen Temple, both located at Magong City. Beiji Temple was destroyed by the America Air Force during World War II and Beichen Temple was dismantled and rebuilt in 1981. Lan Mu also had a printing factory in Penghu. His descendants took it over until the present.  Gallery  Lee Chien-Lang (Êùé‰πæÊúó in Chinese), a Taiwaness traditional architecture investigator, speaks very highly of Lan Mu's works.

Users can then step forward in time, stepping into or over statements and proceeding in a forward direction.

This was a significant event for the history of Russia. Peter brought many reforms in order to open the window to Europe. Economic reforms played an important role in the transformation of the whole country. As a result, Russia was able to achieve a good standing among the European countries in areas such as manufacturing, trade, and military. This was not the case before his rule.  Before Peter the Great  Russia was the largest state of the Old World at the beginning of the 17th century. With the population of only 13 million people, its territory spanned from the Arctic ocean to the Caspian sea. The majority of the population was located in the center and on the North of the European part. At the end of the 17th century Russia became a multinational state. It was due to Ukraine and the whole Siberia becoming a part of its already large area. It was populated by people of many cultures and religions. Orthodox Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and Pagans all lived on the large Asian lands of Russia. = Economic development = The multicultural presence became noticeable, not only because of Asia but also because of Europe. At that time, Russia was trying to become closer with Europe, but it also had interests in the East. That resulted in the duality of Russian economic and political development. Many western European countries such as the Netherlands, England and France made a significant progress in the area of a market economy. For Russia, it was important to overcome slow social development as compared to Europe. The Russian economy was quite weak, with poorly developed industry. One of the major weaknesses was the national economy management system. When speaking about Russia's development, it is important to mention serfdom. Europe was in the process of stopping serfdom, and some countries managed to stop it completely. On the other hand, serfdom was only growing in Russia. As a result, Russia was falling behind in many areas of social life. Another big factor of Russia's poor economic development was the education system. It was at the very early stages. At schools, only grammar and Holy writings were taught. So there were no specializations in engineering, manufacturing, medicine, and many other important fields that play a crucial role in countries economic development. It is said that Russia's education system was behind for approximately 5 centuries. It is also important to note that the printed materials were mostly of spiritual content. Due to the poor education system, it was hard to train specialists. For, example there were no Russian doctors in the country. There were only foreign doctors, and they mostly served the members of the royal families. There was a strong necessity to solve numerous problems with the economy, army, education, and culture, as Russia has exhausted all of the possibilities to develop separately, outside of the European civilization. Moreover, in the middle of the 17th century, there were civilian uproars in several major cities such as Moscow and Novgorod. In the years 1670-1671 there was a peasant war. The war spread across significant territories in the south of Russia. As a result, the unity of the society was weakened. Russia was in need of radical changes.  The reforms  In the year 1682, Peter the Great became the new Tsar of Russia. His name is tightly associated with the beginning of the fundamental reforms in the country. For eighteen months Peter the Great traveled throughout Europe with the goal of studying the economic and political structures of the countries he visited. Moreover, Peter the Great personally studied several professions related to the shipbuilding in the Netherlands and England. The knowledge he obtained during those years would later assist him with the upcoming reforms in Russia. Starting from January 1, 1700, Russia made a switch to a new calendar. That switch symbolized the beginning of the reforms throughout the whole country. Almost the entire period under the rule of Peter the Great consisted of military campaigns and conquests. His military activity was a big part of the reforms. In fact, the first reforms were the military reforms, which were very significant for Russia. The fundamental reorganization of the country's armed forces led to the establishment of the new army, and a powerful fleet. This led to the expansion and strengthening of the country. As a result, Russia won the Great Northern War against Sweden, and acquired the path to the Baltic Sea and returned its land. The Russian economy also needed some innovative solutions. When Peter the Great became the Tsar, the state treasury was in a bad condition. Peter the Great needed more money in order to realize his personal projects. Therefore, the first major task for the state was to find new sources of income. Peter knew that in order to improve the financial condition of the country, there was a necessity to improve the national economy. The economic policy was directed towards the development of the industries and trade. Peter supported the development in those areas in many ways. The first 10 years of the 18th century can be seen as the period of active state involvement in supporting private enterprises and the economy as a whole. The practice of transferring of state enterprises to private owners, foreigners or industrial companies became widespread. The state also sponsored the training of the workforce, transport of the equipment to the factories, and hiring of the specialists. For some very important industries, more privileges were provided. For example, those industries would get free land for building their factories. From the start of the 18th century, began the manufacturing period in the national economy. The manufacturing system became more prominent than the handcrafted production. In the first quarter of the 18th century, there was a significant growth in manufacturing in the country. For example, at the end of 17th century there were around 20 fabrics, and in the years 1720-1725 there were 205 fabrics, from which 90 belonged to the treasury and 115 to the private equity. There were around 69 metallurgical enterprises. There were also enterprises specializing in wood work, gunpowder, leather, glass production, paper, porcelain and other areas. The mining industry was also under active development. Many expeditions were made in the search of natural resources. When silver was found, a new silver melting factory was built. Overall there was a great success in the metallurgical industry. Between the years 1700 - 1725 the amount of cast iron produced increased by 5 times, and by the year 1750 it reached 2 million pounds. Half of that amount was exported. The import of weapons stopped in the year 1712 since the quality of the produced weapons within the country was the same as abroad. The fast growth of the metallurgical industry allowed for the production of several thousands of cannons. The quality of metallurgical products became high, and it became used for export extensively. Eventually, Russia became the first in producing Cast Iron in Europe. Apart from extensive manufacturing in Russian economy, there was also a large artisan sector in the cities, and home craft in villages. They mostly produced fabrics, leather, shoes, pottery, saddles and other products. There was also growth in production of sails and clothes, that were used for the fleet and the army. Sugar factories were built for the first time. Foreign technicians were given special rights, and Russian citizens were sent to Europe in order to improve their skills. Russian entrepreneurs were also given more rights, such as using peasants as a workforce, and owning land. Having granted entrepreneurs with benefits, Peter the Great established strict control over them. He was aware of all industrial affairs, and personally overlooked their quality and performance. Peter the Great was aiming to perform the internal reforms in Russia, in order to bring it to the European level. Apart from military and diplomatic problems, he was also concerned with the management structure of the state. Between the years 1700-1725, he confirmed around 3 thousand laws, related to economics, civil life, and management structure of the state. Only in the last 7 years under the rule of Peter the Great, did the various institutions achieve the normative. Radical management reforms were made in order to strengthen the absolute monarchy. The goal was to create the vertical administrative structure, completely ruled by the supreme power. = The ranking system = Peter's reforms were undoubtedly directed against the old Boyar aristocracy. There was no wish to change and to strengthen the centralized power. Peter relied on the local nobility, which supported the strengthening of the absolute monarchy. In the year 1714, Peter issued a decree of unified heritage, by which there was a final merger of two forms of feudal land ownership in the uniform legal concept known as the \\"immovable property\\". Both types were made equal in all aspects. Estates were inherited by only one of the sons, usually the eldest. The rest of the children would inherit money and other property. They were also obliged to enter the military or civilian service. The introduction of rankings in 1722 was closely connected to the new decree. All positions of the state and military services were divided into 14 ranks, where 14 was the lowest rank, and 1 was the highest rank. People had to go up the ranks in order to get promoted. Nobles were most interested in the introduction of this order since they got the ability to reach the highest state ranks and join the authorities. = Internal and external trade = In order to maintain and improve the internal market, the commerce collegium was created in the year 1719. Trade and entrepreneurship is the major pillars supporting the economy of a country. Peter the Great tried to protect the Russian economy in any way. He aimed that the amount of exported goods would overcome the amount of imported goods from the abroad. At the end of his rule, he achieved that goal. The amount of exported goods was double the amount of imported goods. The import rate was maintained smaller by introducing higher customs prices. There were also special conditions for the internal trade. The traders were encouraged to unite in the western manner. In order to expand the trade borders of Russia, Peter the Great created the trade fleet. In order to improve the trading routes, the state, for the first time in history, began the building of channels. The land roads were very bad, and it slowed down the development of the regular trade connections. In the year 1704, Peter the Great initiated the monetary reform. The silver rubles, also referred to just rubles, were produced. Before Peter the Great rubles were used as a counting unit. There were significant changes in the structure of the external trade. In the beginning of the 18th century, it was common to export agricultural products and raw materials. In the year 1725 it was much more common to export manufactured products such as iron, linen canvas, and sails. As for the import, it was mostly luxury items for the rich families, and also colonial products such as tea, coffee, sugar, and wine. Starting from the year 1712, Russia completely stopped buying weapons from Europe. The development of the internal trade was largely slowed down by the lack of metals necessary to produce coins. The majority of money turnover consisted of small copper coins. The silver coins were quite large and were often cut into several parts, each part having its own turnover. As part of the monetary reform in the year 1704, a new, simple decimal system was introduced. Instead of the weight, each coin was valued by its decimal number. Eventually, Europe also started using this system, but it was much later. Minting of coins became the unconditional monopoly of the state. There were also gold coins, but they were mostly used for ceremonial purposes, as a reward to the soldiers. The ban on export of precious metals was introduced. It became more common to search for the precious metals such as silver within the country. The monetary system was further strengthened by the increase in export, and a positive balance in the internal trade. In the first ten years of the 18th century, there was a geographical change in trade centers. In the 17th century Arkhangelsk played the major role in the trade with the west. Later it was replaced by St. Petersburg, and then by Riga. The trading routes with Persia and India were carried through the Volga river, Astrakhan and the Caspian Sea. = Agriculture = The agriculture during Peter the Great did not face any major reforms. In the year 1721, there was a new decree that forbid the use of sickle during the harvest period. Instead, the braids and rake had to be used. This switch resulted in an improved efficiency during the field works. The harvesting periods became shorter, and the losses during collection were minimized. Mulberry and fruit trees made an appearance in Russian agriculture for the first time. Medical plants, grapes, and tobacco also started to be grown. New types of cattle were also introduced. = Change in financial system = Due to the war with Sweden, building the fleet, factories, channels, and cities, there was a large spending. The Russian budget was at a critical stage. There was a task to find all possible revenue from the taxes. Special groups of people, known as the tax collectors, were formed. Their goal was to find the new objects of taxation. Starting from the year 1704 there was a great amount of new taxes introduced. Taxes for the mills, bees, pipes, making of hats and shoes, and many others. Those were so-called small taxes. There were monopolies on several goods such as resin, rhubarb, glue, salt, tobacco, chalk, and fish fat. Those monopolies also had to pay taxes. After the rule of Peter the Great, a lot of those small taxes were eventually canceled.  The outcome  As a result of the reforms under Peter the Great, Russia managed to take a good standing among the European states. It became a powerful nation with an effective economy, strong fleet and army, and well developed science and culture. Unfortunately, all of the reforms occurred through violence, through suffering of people, through breaking the traditions, through extremism, and intolerance. In an attempt to bring Russia closer to the European civilization, Peter started to forget about the identity of the country, about its Eurasian roots. He believed that the reason why Russia fell behind was because of its Asian roots. When converging to Europe, Peter often considered only external forms of progressive ideas, ignoring the internal essence of centuries-old traditions. When making the reforms, Peter tried to make an ideal state, that is the one based on just and rational laws, but it didn't turn out that way. In practice, a police state was established, without any social control institutions. Taking the inspiration from the western advanced technology, science and military, Peter did not notice the ideas of humanism.

For nearly a decade she worked as a contemporary artist before founding the design studio Bosch & Fjord in 2001 and her current design practice Rosan Bosch Studio in 2010, based in Copenhagen. = Design of learning environments = Rosan Bosch‚Äôs work is characterized by an untraditional approach to the design of schools. Based on six principles, the learning spaces support different ways of learning, working and communicating in an open and shared school space. The sculptural design installations help to direct the interaction and concentration of the students for teamwork, presentations, individual work, creative hands-on tasks or informal learning in the student community. The approach is giving priority to the students‚Äô learning needs when planning the physical spaces of schools. By mixing art, design thinking, architecture and play, the learning environments stimulate innovative thinking and student-centered learning, supporting the pedagogical efforts and the development of 21st Century Skills. The design of the Swedish Vittra schools is internationally known as an alternative to conventional school spaces. Instead of classrooms, large toy-like furnishings act as spatial divisions that support flexibility in learning and creative student activities. = Public speaker and advisor = Promoting educational change through the designs of schools, Bosch is a public speaker and visiting lecturer at educational forums such as UNESCO forum on education in Mexico, Harvard Graduate School of Education, TEDxIndianapolis and Aprendemos Juntos by El Pais.

The JCPOA is an agreement on Iran's nuclear program reached in July 2015 by Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council‚ÄîChina, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States‚Äîplus Germany)Keating, Joshua \\"You say P5+1, I say E3+3\\" , Foreign Policy (September 30, 2009).Lewis, Jeffrey \\"E3/EU+3 or P5+1\\" , Arms Control Wonk (July 13, 2015). also called E3/EU+3. In a joint statement responding to the U.S. withdrawal, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom stated that United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal remained the \\"binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute\\". Various countries, international organizations, and U.S. scholars have expressed regret or criticized the withdrawal, while U.S. conservatives, Israel, Saudi Arabia and allies have supported it. The withdrawal caused concerns in Iran due to its impact on the economy. On 17 May 2018 the European Commission announced its intention to implement the blocking statute of 1996 to declare U.S. sanctions against Iran illegal in Europe and ban European citizens and companies from complying with them. The commission also instructed the European Investment Bank to facilitate European companies' investment in Iran.  Background  In July 2015, an agreement was concluded with Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. It provided that Iran's nuclear activities would be limited in exchange for reduced sanctions. According to the JCPOA, every 90 days the President of the United States would certify, among other things, that Iran was adhering to the terms of the agreement. Leading up to the United States' withdrawal, the IAEA asserted that its inspectors had verified that Iran had implemented its nuclear-related commitments since the agreement.Amano, Yukia (5 March 2018). \\"IAWA director general: Introductory remarks at press conference\\" . International Atomic Energy Agency. Describing the view of the U.S. State Department, assistant secretary for legislative affairs Julia Frifield wrote, \\"The JCPOA is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document. The JCPOA reflects political commitments between Iran, the P5+1, and the EU.\\" With the conclusion of the agreement, then-candidate Donald Trump made the renegotiation of the JCPOA one of his main foreign affairs campaign promises, saying at a campaign rally that \\"this deal, if I win, will be a totally different deal.\\" Trump described the Iran deal as a \\"disaster\\", \\"the worst deal ever\\", and so \\"terrible\\" that could lead to \\"a nuclear holocaust\\". The Trump administration certified in April 2017 and in July 2017 that Iran was complying with the deal. On October 13, 2017, Trump announced that the United States would not make the certification provided for under U.S. domestic law, on the basis that the suspension of sanctions was not \\"proportionate and appropriate,\\" but stopped short of terminating the deal. =International context= The JCPOA ended some of the sanctions on Iran while suspending others, subject to waivers. These include waivers of oil sanctions implemented in January 2012, which require periodic re-certification. Throughout 2017 Trump contemplated not re-certifying, and thus effectively pulling out of the deal. According to Jarrett Blanc of the Obama administration, since the JCPOA is not a treaty but an agreement between several countries, it has no formal provisions for withdrawal, but a member of the deal could stop complying with its obligations. Following Trump's denial of the deal, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the JCPOA was a firm decision and that no single country could break it. She proposed a \\"collective process\\" to preserve the deal, saying, \\"This deal is not a bilateral agreement ... The international community, and the European Union with it, has clearly indicated that the deal is, and will, continue to be in place.\\" French President Emmanuel Macron warned Trump not to withdraw from the deal, and told German magazine Der Spiegel that doing so \\"would open the Pandora‚Äôs box. There could be war.\\" The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper, wrote that America's reputation as a major power would be undermined in the eyes of the world if it reneged on a deal simply because of a transition in government. =Political influences and decisions= Some reports suggest that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's \\"Iran Lied\\" presentation influenced the withdrawal. A little more than a week after Netanyahu's presentation, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the deal. He announced the withdrawal during a speech at the White House on May 8, 2018, saying, \\"the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction: that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.\\" Trump added that there was \\"definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents ‚Äî long concealed by Iran ‚Äî conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons.\\" According to Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the agency tasked with verifying and monitoring Iran's compliance with the JCPOA, Iran has been in compliance with the JCPOA and there is no evidence otherwise. According to David Makovsky, a Middle East scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Iran was not in compliance, because under the deal's terms Iran was supposed to reveal all of its research into nuclear weapons, and that based on Netanyahu's evidence, ‚Äúit seems clear that they did not.‚Äù  Role of George Nader  In March 2018, The New York Times reported that George Nader, a lobbyist for the United Arab Emirates, turned Trump's major fundraiser Elliott Broidy \\"into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates...High on the agenda of the two men...was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\\", a top defender of the Iran deal in the Trump administration, and \\"backing confrontational approaches to Iran and Qatar\\".\\"How 2 Gulf Monarchies Sought to Influence the White House \\". The New York Times. 21 March 2018. Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) was critical of the deal, though he later said he wanted to \\"save\\" it. A \\"trove of hacked emails\\" show that FDD was also funded by George Nader through Elliott Broidy. Role of John Bolton Unlike FDD and Trump officials such as National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former UN ambassador (and later National Security Advisor) John Bolton campaigned for a complete withdrawal from the JCPOA and rejected the idea that it could be fixed. Unable at the time to present his position to Trump directly, Bolton published his proposal for how to withdraw from the deal in an August 28, 2017, National Review article. After he was named to succeed McMaster as National Security Adviser in April 2018, Bolton pressed Trump to withdraw from the JCPOA, which Trump did a month later. Resignation of the special representative On August 6, 2020, the State Department's special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, announced his resignation. Many viewed this as a tacit admission that the so-called maximum pressure policy toward Iran had failed. Hook resigned just before a U.S.-led U.N. Security Council vote on whether to prolong an embargo on the sale of weapons to Iran set to expire in October. Most experts believed that Russia and China would veto the extension, allowing Iran to start buying arms again from whomever it likes. The UN security council overwhelmingly rejected the US resolution to extend the embargo, with only two votes in favor and 11 abstentions. Trump said at a news conference, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be doing a snapback. You‚Äôll be watching it next week‚Äù. This referred to the legal claim that the US remains a participant in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal despite having withdrawn from it, a claim Washington's European allies reject. Announcement Trump announces United States withdrawal from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018. At 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He called the agreement \\"a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made\\" and added, \\"[i]t didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.\\"  Reactions  = Support = *:  The Republican Party (GOP) supported Trump's decision to withdraw.

Former national security advisor Susan Rice said it was a \\"foolish decision\\".  Former secretary of energy Ernest Moniz said the withdrawal was a \\"major strategic mistake\\".  Former deputy secretary of energy Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall said the decision was \\"a reckless strategic mistake of immense consequence\\".  Former ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns said the disavowal was \\"reckless and one of the most serious mistakes of his presidency\\".  Former NSA director, former CIA director, retired USAF four-star general Michael Hayden said that \\"Iran is further away from a weapon with this deal than they would be without it\\".  Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders criticized the decision: \\"Trump's speech today was the latest in a series of reckless decisions that move our country closer to conflict.\\"  Harvard political scientist Gary Samore said that if \\"President Trump thinks he can crash the nuclear deal, reimpose international economic sanctions, and force Iran to negotiate a better deal, he is mistaken\\".  Harvard political scientist Graham T. Allison said that it was \\"a bad choice for the U.S. and bad choice for our ally Israel\\".  Harvard political scientist Matthew Bunn said that Trump had freed Iran to build up its ability to make nuclear bomb material.  Harvard political scientist Stephen Walt said it was Trump's \\"most consequential foreign-policy blunder\\".

The French minister of foreign affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, expressed concern about the political stability of the region, but reaffirmed that the deal was not dead despite the American withdrawal.

Aside from at least 10 obvious lies, this person [Donald Trump] threatened the nation of Iran and the Islamic Republic, which I, on behalf of the nation of Iran, respond with: Like hell you will!... The persistent enmity of the US is with the nature of the [Islamic] system and the nuclear energy is nothing more than an excuse. If we go along with their wishes today, tomorrow they will bring more excuses.... Our officials and authorities tell me that they want to continue the JCPOA with these three European countries [France, Germany and the United Kingdom]. I don't trust these three countries either.\\" President Hassan Rouhani said: \\"The US has announced that it doesn't respect its commitments.\\" He stated Iran's intention of continuing the nuclear deal, but ultimately doing what's best for the country, \\"I have directed the Atomic Energy Agency to prepare for the next steps, if necessary, to begin our own industrial enrichment without restriction,\\" Rouhani said in a statement just minutes after Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal. \\"We will wait several weeks before acting on this decision. We will be consulting with friends, our allies and members who have signed on to the agreement. Everything depends on our national interests. If our nation's interests are attained in the end, we will continue the process.\\" He stated that the nuclear deal would continue if Iran was able to meet the demands of the Iranian people with the cooperation of five countries in a short period. * top diplomat Federica Mogherini said the EU was \\"determined to preserve the deal\\". The EU Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, understand that the US does not want anymore to co-operate with other countries.

Euronews. 14 May 2018. *'s foreign ministry reiterated that all sides should continue to uphold their end of the agreement and that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said many times that Iran is in compliance with the agreement. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, said that \\"[a]ll sides need to continue upholding the pact.\\"  Middle East  *'s foreign minister Ayman Safadi warned of \\"dangerous repercussions\\" and a possible arms race in the Middle East unless a political solution was found to free the region of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. * \\"strongly\\" condemned Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement.  G20 states  *'s prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said that he regrets the decision. *'s prime minister Paolo Gentiloni said the Iran nuclear agreement must be preserved. *'s foreign ministry said Japan continues to support the deal and that it \\"hopes for a continued constructive response from the nations involved\\". *'s presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the decision by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal will cause instability and new conflicts.

The foreign ministry was measured in its response: \\"All parties should engage constructively to address and resolve issues that have arisen with respect to the JCPOA,\\" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Public opinion in the United States A majority of Americans said the United States should remain in the JCPOA. According to the CNN poll conducted between May 2, 2018, and May 5, 2018, the strongest proponents of withdrawing from the deal were Republicans at 51%. According to the Pew Research Center, 53% of the American public and 94% of U.S. scholars in international relations disapproved of Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear weapons agreement.  Aftermath  former U.S. embassy in Tehran, 8 May 2018 According to Tony Blinken, a former Obama deputy secretary of state who took part in the negotiation of the original deal, the JCPOA's future depends on Iran's willingness to abide by it, and so on the economic benefit the deal will give Iran. The Israeli military put their forces on alert. Israeli citizens living in the Golan Heights were told to prepare bomb shelters. Former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said the U.S. Department of Defense opposed withdrawal from the JCPOA, because although it wasn't perfect, it was the best they could expect. He said the U.S. should have kept the agreement on nuclear activity and came up with another agreement on malign activity. =Trade= Trump also wants to sanction European companies that trade with Tehran. After the JCPOA was announced, in December 2016, Boeing signed a $17 billion deal with Iran and Airbus signed a $19 billion one. These deals were subsequently canceled. China is involved in a $1.5 billion deal for infrastructure, and its CITIC bank provides $10 billion lines of credit to Iranian banks. Using euros and the yuan, this bank should not be subject to US sanctions against companies that use US dollars. The French company Total S.A. won a project in the South Pars gas field that could be hit by US sanctions. In anticipation of a possible pull-out by Total, Chinese company CNPC signed a $1 billion deal giving it the option to take over Total's commitments. *Oil prices became unstable amid uncertainty of how President Trump's sanctions might affect the flow of crude oil out of Iran. According to some experts, oil supplies may be affected if Iran reduces its export. *In a phone interview with MSNBC, Former Secretary of State John Kerry said, \\"[Trump] has taken a situation where there was no crisis, and created crisis.\\" \\"We [the United States] are in breach of the agreement,\\" Kerry warned. *On Wednesday, May 9, 2018, on the floor of the Iranian Parliament, Majlis, conservative MPs, set fire to a copy of the JCPOA amid chants of \\"death to America.\\" They also set fire to a United States flag. Meanwhile, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has attempted to moderate Iran's response. Rouhani promised to abide by the agreement for the time being and directed his diplomats to negotiate with the deal's remaining participants, saying the agreement could survive without the United States. * John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at FireEye, a Milpitas, California cybersecurity company, said that Iran might attempt cyberattacks on American infrastructure: \\"They were in some very sensitive areas of airport networks where they could conceivably cause serious disruption ...but the malicious code was identified and the hackers were booted off\\". He declined to identify which U.S. airports were affected, saying only that there were multiple targets. *Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said, \\"Trump's decision will not have any impact on our oil export\\". *Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said, \\"The holy system of the Islamic Republic will step up its missile capabilities day by day so that Israel, this occupying regime, will become sleepless and the nightmare will constantly haunt it that if it does anything foolish, we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground\\". * Iran announced its readiness to enrich uranium on an \\"industrial scale\\" starting in 2025. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization said in a statement, \\"The President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran has been tasked with taking all necessary steps in preparation for Iran to pursue industrial-scale enrichment without any restrictions, using the results of the latest research and development of Iran's brave nuclear scientists\\".

Early life J. W. Ylvisaker was born on April 18, 1900 to Johannes Ylvisaker in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. He attended Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, graduating in 1921. Ylvisaker then studied at Luther Theological Seminary, and graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1926 with a Master of Theology degree. After graduating, Ylvisaker served as pastor in Northwood, Iowa and at Our Saviour's Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. President of Luther College In 1948, Ylvisaker was elected as the fifth president of Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. Under Ylvisaker's presidency, Luther College grew. Several building projects were undertaken, including Brandt Hall, the rebuilding of Main, Olson Hall, Valders Hall of Science, and the Dahl Centennial Union. Enrollment continued to grow, peaking at 1,357 students in 1961, compared to 910 in 1948 when Ylvisaker assumed the presidency. Ylvisaker also oversaw the transition from the 10-member Board of Trustees to the 21-member Board of Regents in 1958, and the centennial celebrations of the college in 1961. During Ylvisaker's final year, shortly after the homecoming celebrations, Preus Gymnasium burned. It was a devastating blow to the college, since the gymnasium and its classrooms were the home of several departments on campus. Ylvisaker retired at the end of the 1961-1962 academic year. During his presidency, Ylvisaker also served as president of the Association of Iowa College Presidents, president of the Iowa College Foundation 1953-55, and president of the National Lutheran Educational Conference in 1959. Personal life Ylvisaker married Lucille Torgerson in 1930. They had two children. Ylvisaker died in 1981. Legacy In 1964, a new residence hall was built, named Ylvisaker Hall in honor of J. W.

The airport has no IATA or ICAO designation. The airport is used solely for general aviation purposes, but has a history as an auto racing venue. History The airfield built during World War II as an auxiliary training field for the United States Army Air Forces. After the end of the war, the airfield was transferred to the city of Caddo Mills for civil use. After the transfer of ownership, few aircraft used the airfield, and its disused runways became a popular site for races held by Dallas-area auto clubs. In 1951, drag races hosted at the airport by the Chaparral Roadster Club were drawing thousands of spectators. Soon afterwards, several other Dallas-area car clubs collaborated to form the North Texas Timing Association, which subsequently became affiliated with the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA), and the airfield became the first NHRA-sanctioned dragstrip in the region. In July 1952, the Sports Car Club of America scheduled two road races at the airfield, and the NHRA held its regional drag championships at the site in June 1956. The North Texas Timing Association continued to host NHRA drag races at the site through at least 1960 but the organization eventually vacated the site in favor of permanent dedicated dragstrips. By 1997, the airfield was home to 7 hangers and 100 aircraft, but the two remaining runways had never been rehabilitated and had fallen into disrepair. That year, the city received an $843,000 grant to resurface the runways and add runway lighting, and gyroplane maker Air Command International announced that they would relocate all operations to the airport. In 2000, Armadillo Aerospace used the airport as a testing base for their experimental reusable rocket-powered lunar landing module. The airport's simultaneous remote location and close proximity to the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex were major factors in the company's decision to conduct experiments there. In 2010, auto racing returned to the airport when an organization known as the Texas Speed Syndicate used a temporarily closed runway to host the Texas Invitational, a racing event styled after a street race over a course with a rolling start. The event was last held in October 2017.  Facilities  Caddo Mills Municipal Airport covers at an elevation of 541.6 ft (165.1 m) above mean sea level and has two runways: * Runway 13/31: 4,000 x 150 ft. (1,219 x 46 m), Surface: Concrete * Runway 18/36: 4,000 x 75 ft. (1,219 x 23 m), Surface: Concrete For the year ending 31 December 2015, the airport had 14,000 aircraft operations, averaging 38 per day: 100% general aviation. 17 aircraft were then based at the airport: 100% single-engine. The Aviation Unmanned Vehicle Museum is located at the airport. The organization bills itself as the only museum dedicated to military drones.  Accidents and incidents  * 5 February 1967: A Carrollton, Texas man was killed when his homebuilt gyroplane overturned on landing at the airfield and was destroyed. * 28 December 1985: A Cessna 172B, registration number N6876X, and a Pitts S-2B, registration number N5305A, collided in mid-air in the airfield traffic pattern. The Pitts pilot regained control and landed without injuries to himself or his passenger, but the Cessna crashed in a nearby field, killing both occupants. The accident occurred late in the afternoon when there was considerable sun glare in the traffic pattern; investigators found that the position of the sun made it difficult for occupants on the Cessna to see the Pitts, while \\"restricted visibility\\" made it difficult for the pilot of the Pitts to see the Cessna. The accident was attributed to the failure of both pilots to maintain visual separation from other aircraft. Contributing factors were sun glare, the failure of the Cessna pilot to correctly follow visual flight rules, and restricted visibility in the Pitts. * 15 July 1998: While maneuvering over a runway during a test flight, the rotor blades of an Air Command Commander 147A gyroplane, registration number N147GY, struck the tail boom; the aircraft struck the ground in a nose-low attitude and was consumed in a post-crash fire, killing the pilot and sole occupant. The accident was attributed to \\"The pilot's failure to maintain rotor rpm while maneuvering, which resulted in the main rotor blades contacting the tail section of the gyroplane.\\"  References   External links  * at Texas DOT Airport Directory Category:Airports in Texas Category:Airports in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex Category:Motorsport venues in Texas Category:Transportation in Hunt County, Texas ","title":"Caddo Mills Municipal Airport"},{"id":"57368647","text":"thumb Charles Kellogg Field (1873 ‚Äì 1948) was an American journalist and poet.

The company operates an 800 route mile fiber optic network in the New York City metropolitan area that connects mobile phone macrosites, small cells and Wi-Fi nodes to carriers and other core network facilities. History ZenFi was founded in 2014 in New York City. The company's goal was to help connect fiber networks to wireless distributed antenna systems (DAS), which provide Internet access inside properties, in order to extend mobile phone networks. In May 2015, ZenFi established a connection at 325 Hudson, a well known data center in Manhattan. In May 2016, the company expanded its network to The Bronx, New York City's northernmost borough. In January 2017, the company partnered with NY Metro service provider Cross River Fiber to launch a portal to streamline the dark and lit fiber ordering process for data center interconnection (DCI). In May 2017, the company completed fiber build- outs at carrier hotel (colocation facility) operator ColoGuard‚Äôs CGNY1 Brooklyn data center, and at 32 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, also known as the AT&T; Building. The company also announced that its network at the time included 200 route miles of fiber in the five boroughs and New Jersey. By Spring 2018, the company was reportedly operating over 300 route miles of fiber. In April 2018, ZenFi announced it was merging with fellow fiber network provider Cross River Fiber, and that the new combined company's fiber network would be 700 route miles long. Network The company's 800 route mile metro fiber optic network connects to twenty major carrier hotels in New York City, and 25 data centers in New Jersey. The company splits its network into two parts that it calls the Access and Express Networks. The Express Network is the company's core network, which links data centers, carrier hotels and businesses to ZenFi's Access Network. The Access Network supports wireless interconnections and collocations for bandwidth-intensive applications such as Internet of things (IoT) and 5th generational wireless systems 5G.

She set a record at the University of Southern California Law for the highest academic scores at that date. At the time she became an attorney in Hawaii, women were not allowed to serve on a jury, and women lawyers could not use the abbreviation \\"Esq.\\" after their names. Background She was born November 11, 1904, in Texarkana, Texas, to attorney Horace Worth Vaughan and Pearl Lockett Vaughan, joining older sister Aileen and brother Robert Louis. After her birth, her father was elected to the Texas State Senate, and subsequently to the United States House of Representatives. In 1914, her brother graduated from the United States Naval Academy, and was assigned to the USS California. Sister Aileen married in Texas. When her father was appointed assistant district attorney for the US District Court for Hawaii in 1915, Jean was the only child still living in their home. Maternal grandmother Ellen Rand Lockett also moved to the territory with them. Within a few months, her father was elevated to District Attorney for the court. When Sanford B. Dole retired as judge of the federal court in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Vaughan to fill the position. In March 1920, US Navy Lt. Vaughan died in an airplane crash in Panama. Judge Vaughan brought his son's widow and children to live in Hawaii. When his judicial term expired May 2, 1922, he still had not emotionally recovered from the loss of his son. His health had been in a steadily weakening state, resulting in a stroke. On November 10, he committed suicide.;; ; After his death, the family was financially dependent on renting out rooms in their private home. Education and early career Jean attended the University of Texas, followed by the University of Southern California Law, graduating Cum Laude Order of California in 1930, while setting a record for the highest academic scores. Following her passing of the California bar exam, she was admitted to practice before the U. S. District Court in Hawaii. After she passed the Hawaii exam, she was admitted to the Hawaii Bar on April 8, 1931. At that time, the \\"Esq.\\" commonly used as a title for male lawyers, was not allowed to be used by women lawyers in Hawaii, and women were not allowed to serve on jury duty in the territory. She was not the first woman admitted to the bar in Hawaii, but the media noted that she was the \\"first blonde woman\\" to do so, and was a cook who \\"knows her pots and pans\\".; She set up practice as a member of the law firm of Kemp and Stainbeck. When partner Ingram Stainback was named U. S. Attorney in 1934, he brought her on board as his assistant attorney. Together, they acted as counsel for the government in matters of water and land rights.; : Marriage and return to Hawaii Her career was put on hold for several years after her October 7, 1935, marriage to US Navy captain Melbourne Newcomb Gilbert, who was stationed in Vallejo, California. Upon the couple's 1940 return to Hawaii, she was once again appointed Assistant U. S. District Attorney, this time by acting U. S. District Attorney Angus M. Taylor.; After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the territory was placed under martial law by territorial governor Joseph Poindexter, approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The writ of habeas corpus was suspended. One of the cases she worked on was that of Honolulu doctor of naturopathy Hans Zimmerman, who challenged his arrest and detention with no charges filed against him. Her former boss Ingram Stainback was appointed territorial governor on August 24, 1942, and Jean was appointed City-County Deputy Attorney by City-County Attorney Cable A. Wirtz. In 1944, Wirtz became Circuit Judge, and with unanimous approval from the county board of supervisors, Honolulu mayor Lester Petrie appointed Jean the City-County Attorney, the first woman to hold that position.; She was a steadfast advocate for the city and county. One of her last cases put her at odds with the supervisors, who had followed territorial legislation and allocated funds for back pay to litigant county employee Llewelyn H. L. Hart, covering the period he had been suspended pending the outcome of legal action. She argued in 1946 that the county was not obligated to compensate for the withheld wages, and should not reimburse Hart. The backlash to her legal opinion was so intense that supervisor Nicholas T. Teves threatened to introduce a motion to have her fired. She held firm to her position, and eventually took a sabbatical to California.; ; ; ; ; When Petrie's term ended January 2, 1947, she and others in his cabinet resigned. Later life and legacy  After resigning her position with the city and county, she went into private practice, and until 1967 contracted her services to the Honolulu Board of Water Supply. Although physically impaired for the last 15 years of her life, she continued to be active. She died December 2, 1975, and was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Her husband survived her. She played a key role in the legal career of Thomas Shoichi Ogata who went on to become a justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. Previously denied admittance to the Hawaii Bar in 1942, for a cheating incident during the bar exam, he nevertheless became her law clerk. Based on her personal recommendation, he was admitted to the Hawaii Bar in 1945, and she appointed him as Deputy City- County Attorney.; References Sources * External links * Category:1901 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Hawaii lawyers Category:People of the Territory of Hawaii Category:USC Gould School of Law alumni Category:University of Texas alumni Category:20th-century American women lawyers ","title":"Jean Vaughan Gilbert"},{"id":"57369099","text":"Jos√© Mar√≠a Venegas better known as El Chema is a fictional character on the Telemundo television series El Se√±or de los Cielos, created by Luis Zelkowicz.

The most recent English translation, by Margaret Jull Costa, was first published in 1994, together with an Introduction by the translator.  Background  E√ßa de Queir√≥s began work on The Relic in 1880.The book, containing many sacrilegious passages, with wry, ironic humour, was first published in 1887 in serial form in the Gazeta de Not√≠cias of Rio de Janeiro and in book form shortly thereafter. The epigraph to the novel reads ‚ÄúSobre a nudez da Verdade o manto di√°fano da Fantasia‚Äù (Over the sturdy nakedness of truth, the diaphanous cloak of fantasy). These were the words engraved on the author‚Äôs statue erected in Lisbon in 1903. The statue shows the author embracing ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù, a naked woman partly covered by a diaphanous cloth.  The novel  The Relic is narrated in the first person by the central character, Teodorico Raposo, an orphan at the age of seven, who is entrusted to the care of his aunt, Dona Patroc√≠nia das Neves, who is very wealthy but obsessively devout. She expects Teodorico to live up to her pious and conservative standards. Teodorico realises that it's a good idea to stay in his aunt's good books with the hope of eventually inheriting her fortune, which she has planned to leave to the Church. As he gets older he becomes adept at organizing a double life; appearing obsessively devout to his aunt while leading a debauched life of drinking and meeting with Lisbon‚Äôs prostitutes when out of her sight. Having learnt of the libertinism of Paris from a friend he has a great urge to travel there, but his aunt does not approve. Instead she agrees to send him to the Holy Land. All she asks is that he brings back a relic and he believes that if he accomplishes this then he'll be made her heir. Early on in the trip he finds a German travelling companion, the pedantic and parsimonious German academic Dr. Topsius, and in Alexandria has an entanglement with a British prostitute, who gives him her nightgown as a keepsake. A long, sudden and unexplained section in the middle of the novel is in the form of an apparent dream in which Teodorico is transported back to the time of Jesus‚Äôs arrest, trial and execution, where he and Topsius become witnesses to history. This section has been criticised by some reviewers as fantastic rather than realistic, as very flat with a different tone from the rest of the book, as not really fitting in with or contributing to the rest of the story and as being written in the language of the author rather than that displayed by Teodorico in the rest of the novel. Having been unable to find a really convincing relic, Teodorico had decided to fake one. He has made for him a crown of thorns, planning to offer it to his aunt as the crown that Jesus wore. Unfortunately a mix-up results in the aunt receiving something entirely unwelcome and she evicts him, penniless, from her home. The mix-up is never satisfactorily explained in the novel and could be the result of a simple accident, a deliberate act or God's punishment for Teodorico's hypocrisy. He eventually renounces hypocrisy in favour of complete honesty, and as a consequence ends up living a comfortable life, although the novel ends with his conclusion that things could have turned out even better if he had been quick enough to think of a convincing lie to explain the mix-up to his aunt. In her Introduction to the novel, its translator argues that this conclusion gives relevance to the earlier dream sequence, in which Teodorico discovers that the Resurrection of Jesus was a lie that created the foundations of Christianity. It was the book's rejection of any moral focus and the \\"rewriting of Christianity as a myth based on a well-intentioned lie\\" that inevitably led to criticism in Portugal when it was first published. After being thrown out by his aunt, Teodorico survives for a few months by the selling of the other fake relics he had brought home, such as cigar-holders made out of a piece of wood from Noah's ark; straw from the crib of Jesus; a piece of wood planed by Saint Joseph; a fragment of the water jug with which the Virgin used to go to the fountain; a shoe from the donkey on which the Holy Family had fled into Egypt; and a rusty nail from Noah‚Äôs Ark. Working through a priest as a middleman, Teodorico ends up selling as many as fourteen authenticated horseshoes and seventy-five nails.  Modern criticism  Teodorico is an entertaining figure, who for much of the novel tries to outdo his aunt in her piety in the hope of a large inheritance. The aunt is a not entirely unbelievable caricature, which produces some fine comic moments, although ultimately the novel as a whole is not one of the author‚Äôs best. Even so, The Relic has been described as ‚Äúa provocative, critical account of the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church of Queir√≥s‚Äô time.‚Äù It portrays ‚Äúreligious fervour, contrasting the gentleness of Jesus against the ruthless of the Church‚Äôs God‚Äù. Another reviewer notes that it shares with other novels by E√ßa ‚Äúsharp satire and criticism of the backwardness and hypocrisy that pervaded Portuguese society‚Äù of the time.

At a time of unavoidable transplant rejection, he was involved in two particularly historic transplant operations. The first was a human-to-human extraperitoneal kidney transplant procedure in 1951 and later a pig-to-human kidney transplant in 1966, both of which ended in abrupt rejection. He later introduced kidney transplantation schedules involving at first irradiation, later immunosuppressants, living-related and unrelated donors and later organs from deceased donors. K√ºss established several urology departments at the Paris hospitals, became General Secretary and between 1952 and 1985 took up presidency for the Soci√©t√© Internationale d'Urologie. In 1971, he founded the first scientific society devoted to transplantation medicine in Europe, La Soci√©t√© Francaise de Transplantation. Although they worked separately, the simultaneous efforts of K√ºss and nephrologist Jean Hamburger are felt by transplant peers including Nobel prize winner Joseph Murray, to have \\"largely been forgotten\\", and that they have not been given \\"full credit for their work internationally\\". Early life and education K√ºss was born on 3 May 1913 into a Protestant family from Alsace and grew up with firm morals and responsibilities, being the son of a distinguished and wealthy surgeon who was at one time president of the French Academy of Surgery. K√ºss's grandfather was √âmile K√ºss, a physician at the University of Strasbourg and the last mayor of Strasbourg prior to its annexation by Germany. His father headed the general surgical department at Paris's H√¥pital de la Charit√©, later known as the Hopital Broussais. K√ºss recalled first attending an operating theatre with his father at the age of seven. He had two brothers and two sisters and his family spent time travelling between their homes by the seaside, on the mountains and in Paris, in pursuit of sports and arts. He was educated at the University of Paris School of Medicine and held an appointment as a surgical resident at the H√¥pital Broca, Paris, under the chief of service, Robert Proust, the brother of the author Marcel Proust. Second World War K√ºss left his early medical training at the age of 26 to enlist in the French army during the Second World War, and subsequently became physician to the French navy. He survived the attack on Mers-el-K√©bir as physician-in-chief on the destroyer Mogador, which was bombed and eventually sunk off the coast of North Africa in the Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon. On one occasion, he jumped overboard into the \\"oil-slick-covered sea to rescue crewmen\\". He received the War Cross with Palm for his war efforts. He headed General George Patton's 3rd American army's surgical team across France and into Germany and by \\"alternately manipulating scalpels and grenades\\", contributed to the efforts of the French resistance to liberate Paris. The whole time, he operated on both American and German injured soldiers. Surgical career After the war, K√ºss made innovations in urology at the Cochin Hospital, in particular in urinary drainage and vascular reconstructions in transplant cases. This came at a time when urology and vascular surgery were expanding as specialities with new diagnostics, particularly the introduction of intravenous pyelography in 1937 and David Hume's vascular developments on joining arteries. He developed the Boari-K√ºss method for elongating the ureter and contributed to the elaboration of placing a donor kidney into the extraperitoneal space or iliac fossa, a technique that has continued into the 21st century. Two operations are particularly considered \\"historic\\" by contemporaries. K√ºss, together with Charles Dubost and Marceau Servelle, was involved in the first human-to-human extraperitoneal kidney transplant procedure on 12 January 1951. Another two surgeons, Oeconomos and Rougeulle, had previously assisted K√ºss with the laboratory experiments and were also present to assist. The procedure became known as the \\"K√ºss operation\\" owing to his chief role in it. Organs from four guillotined prisoners were used in four of the five kidney transplants. One kidney came from a living donor undergoing a kidney removal in a Matson procedure for hydrocephalus, where a kidney would otherwise be discarded. All the grafts were rejected. At the time, it was not unusual to carry out the donor operation on the prison floor or in the autopsy room. In one interview, K√ºss \\"admitted that sometimes the surgeons had to wait ‚Äòlike vultures‚Äô for the patient (donor) to die\\" and that even \\"one of the donor kidneys was procured from a living patient\\". Lack of immunosuppressants, poorly preserved donor kidneys, suboptimal state of recipients and lack of post-operative intensive care, all contributed to poor initial results. By 1952, he was led to believe that America would have the best chance of success by performing the transplants on identical twins, which in 1954, they did. The second historic operation took place in 1966, by which time irradiation as an immunosuppressive and some basic immunosuppressants, 6-mercaptopurine and cortisone, had been introduced. After reading results of experimental studies by Roy Calne, K√ºss had already administered 6-mercaptopurine six years earlier. K√ºss, along with assistant surgeon Jacque Poisson, performed a cross- species procedure, transplanting two pig kidneys into one patient. The graft was unsuccessful instantly and the patient shortly died. K√ºss later described this as a painful experience. Transplant surgeon and friend of K√ºss, Thomas Starzl recalled that K√ºss \\"was left with a lifetime xenophobia for xenografts\\" following this experience. Results remained poor and by 1967, the failure rate amongst the 101 transplants he performed was around 50%. K√ºss established several urology departments at the Paris hospitals, became General Secretary and in 1952 took up presidency for the Soci√©t√© Internationale d'Urologie, where he remained so until 1985. In order to advance the urology clinic at the University Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, in 1972, he resigned from private practice. He simultaneously established the La Soci√©t√© Francaise de Transplantation. Retiring from clinical duties in 1985, he later, in the 1990s, served as President of the French National Academy of Medicine. He was awarded Commander of the French Legion of Honor and in 2002 became a Medawar Laureate of the Transplantation Society.  Personal  Among K√ºss's girlfriends was a showgirl from the well known Le Lido. He eventually married in his mid-forties, at the request of his father, and went on to have four children. K√ºss was a racecar driver and competed in the Monte Carlo Rally. There was one incident in 1954 when he lay comatose for some days following an accident during a race at the Tour de France Automobile. He was brought up with a deep interest in art and acquainted with eminent Parisian artists of the time including Raoul Dufy. He added to his father's antique and contemporary art collections, subsequently exhibiting them near his second home at the seaside village of Honfleur. His art collection was auctioned at Christie's in Paris in 2006, following his death. One part of his collection that including work by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet, sold for more than four million Euros. Death and legacy K√ºss died in 2006. An engraved memorial marble lies at the hospital of Piti√©‚ÄêSalp√™tri√®re where he established a school of urology. In 2014, The Board of the European Association Urology (EAU) Section of Transplantation Urology (ESTU) awarded the first Ren√© K√ºss Prize for original work on renal transplantation. It was presented by K√ºss's daughter, Ms. Sophie Morello-K√ºss. Although they worked separately, the simultaneous efforts of K√ºss and nephrologist Jean Hamburger are felt by transplant peers including Nobel Prize winner Joseph Murray, to have \\"largely been forgotten\\", and they not to have been given \\"full credit for their work internationally\\".

Invasive species are only considered invasive if they are able to survive and sustain themselves in their new environment. A habitat and the environment around it has natural flaws that make them vulnerable to invasive species. The level of vulnerability a habitat is to invasions from outside species is defined as its invasibility. One must be careful not to get this confused with invasiveness, which relates to the species itself and its ability to invade an ecosystem.Alpert, P., Bone, E., & Holzapfel, C. (2000). Invasiveness, invasibility and the role of environmental stress in the spread of non-native plants. Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, 3(1), 52-66. doi:10.1078/1433-8319-00004 There are many factors, abiotic and biotic, that can raise or lower a habitat's invasibility, such as stress, disturbance, nutrient levels, climate, and pre-existing native species. Typically invasive species favor areas that are nutrient-rich, have few environmental stresses, and high levels of disturbances. This explains why areas in the United States such as Hawaii, Florida, and California are infested with invasive species. These invasions are one of the biggest and most consistent threats to biodiversity across the globe. Antarctica is the only natural reserve on Earth that is without invasive species, due to its environmental factors.  Ecological factors  = Abiotic factors = Abiotic factors serve as the first filter of invasive species within a respective habitat. Invasive species are typically limited to habitats that are ecologically similar to their native habitats. The relative efficiency of invasibility is dependent on the abiotic niche being conserved over time or if the invader is able to adapt rapidly to their newly invaded abiotic niche. For example, the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) has almost identical abiotic niches in its native and invaded habitat but the European Green Crab (Carcinus maenas) has the ability to adapt its abiotic niche as it can survive in a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. Some invasions are only dependent on abiotic factors and not biotic factors. For example, the invasion of cordgrass (Spartina anglica) in salt marshes was highly dependent on salinity and sediment type and no biotic factors. Propagule pressure is a composite measure of the number of individuals of a species released into a region to which they are not native. It has been found that species with weak dispersal agents create increased invasibility, especially near stream sides. The absence of habitat fragmentation allows for greater dispersal and high invasibility at edges of habitat boundaries. Propagule pressure is the main reason why the density of some invasive species is higher near the site of introduction. Disturbance is another abiotic factor that can affect invasibility. Disturbance is defined as a punctuated event that kills organisms or removes part of their biomass. Both increasing and suppressing disturbances can increase invisibility. For example, in the North American grasslands fire was found to decrease invasion but increased grazing increased invasion. Fires increase the invasibility of some species of pine trees but decreases the invasibility of other pine species. It has been proposed that disturbances increase invasibility to the degree that they cause the natural habitat to deviate from its original state. Stresses such as nutrient availability, water availability, light availability and extreme conditions affect invasibility. Low stress environments increase invasibility because the invaders are more likely to be able to take advantage of the increased resources. Addition of nutrients has been found to enhance the invasibility of an area. For example, when nutrients were added to an aquatic plankton environment it resulted in increased bacteria growth which facilitated the invasion of ciliates since the competition for resources was decreased. Also, nutrient addition to grasslands can have a variety of effects as it can shift species composition towards or away from a smaller number of relatively fast growing species, woody species such as annual herbs, perennial herbs, grasses or shrubs. Nutrient addition to a nutrient poor environment can not only promote invasions but can prompt the eventual dominance of non-native species within the habitat. Large scale nutrient addition can have a significant positive impact on invasibility. For example, large scale nutrient run-off in the New England area has caused the invasion of Phragmites australis an exotic vascular plant. Limiting nutrient resources has a negative impact on invasibility as resources will be limited increasing the competition between invasive and native species. For example, there is decreased water flow inside eelgrass habitats thus eelgrass limits the growth and survival of the invasive mussel (Musculista senhousia) This reduces the extent of its invasion compared to areas where eelgrass meadows are fragmented or absent. Stresses that limit metabolism or resource acquisition - such as extreme temperature and toxins - has the ability to both increase or decrease invasibility; this is dependent on the invader's characteristics. If the invader can live in a wider temperature range than the native species it will have a greater success rate. For example, an invasive C4 plant would have a better chance of surviving than a native C3 plant during a drought. = Biotic factors = Asian shore crap (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) invades shorelines around the world, especially in the New England area. There are variety of biotic factors that influence invasibility such as competition, diversity, predation and disease. One of the main biotic factors that impact invasibility is interspecific competition. Since an invader will require certain limiting resources it will be more likely to be successful in habitat where competition for these resources is low. If the invader has optimum performance at a resource level that only slightly overlaps with a native species than it will have a greater chance invasion. For example, another reason the Asian shore crap (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) is such a successful invader in the New England area is because there are few ecological equivalents - that is to say, other grapsid crabs in the area. However, determining the success of a non-native species in its invaded habitat is not always easy because their resource requirements may differ from their native habitat. When the characteristics of a non-native species and native species are significantly similar a single native species can go a long way to prevent the invasion of a non-native species. A habitat with high species diversity results in lower total resource availability thus decreasing the success of an invader. Diverse habitats also maintain stronger indirect interactions between species thus causing exclusion of non-native species that could out-compete a native species on a one-to-one level. A notable exception is diverse habitats with many pollinators. Pollinators significantly increase the invasion success of invasive plants thus habitats with a diverse set of pollinators have a greater chance of being invaded.  Habitats with high invasibility  Certain habitats are naturally more susceptible to alien plant invasions. Invasive plants tend to thrive in nutrient-rich and man-made habitats.Chytr√Ω, Maskell M, and Pino J L.C. .\\"Which habitats are most at risk from invasive species?\\" Science for Environmental Policy, 20 June 2008, doi:10.18411/d-2016-154. Http://Ljournal.ru/Wp-Content/Uploads/2016/08/d-2016-154.Pdf The most commonly invaded types of habitats include those that are man made, such as gardens, farmlands, urban landscapes, ecosystems with nutrient rich fertile soil, such as forestry plantations and forest clearings, or areas of high levels of disturbance, such as coastal and riparian habitats.Olyarnik, S. V., Bracken, M. E., Byrnes, J. E., Hughes, A. R., Hultgren, K. M., & Stachowicz, J. J. (n.d.). Ecological Factors Affecting Community Invasibility. Biological Invasions in Marine Ecosystems Ecological Studies,215-238. doi:10.1007/978-3-540-79236-9_12 Habitats with high levels of disturbance are much more likely to be invaded by a non-native species. In order for successful invasion of a natural community to occur, it requires dispersal, establishment, and survival.Davis, M. A., Thompson, K., & Grime, J. P. (2005). Invasibility: The local mechanism driving community assembly and species diversity. Ecography,28(5), 696-704. doi:10.1111/j.2005.0906-7590.04205.x Central Californian Coastline, Big Sur, May 2013 The specific ecosystems in the United States that are among the most heavily invaded are located in Hawaii, Florida, and California. Specifically, the grasslands and valleys of California have been so heavily invaded by non-native species, that this habitat has been completely altered, and the original habitat composition and structure are not known because of how different it is now. In this same region, the southwest pi√±on-juniper woodlands have only experienced light habitat invasion from non-natives. It was also found that large oceanic bays such as the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia and Maryland and the San Francisco bay in California now contain more non-native species than native species that the habitat originated with. However, the worst of all in the United States is Hawaii. The island state is the most heavily invaded region in the country. Over the years, over 38 land birds, 18 exotic mammals, 17 exotic reptiles, 38 exotic land mollusks, and 19 exotic freshwater fish have all been successfully introduced to Hawaii, increasing the number; 4,598 exotic species established in the wild. For a small area of a few islands, these are huge numbers, which have very significantly affected the overall ecosystem on the island.  Habitats with Low Invasibility  Levels of species invasion are low in harsh climates and habitats with poor nutrients. These habitats include mountains, cliffs, bogs, dry grasslands and coniferous woodlands, deserts, and savannas. Non-native plants and animals do not tend to thrive in these types of habitats due to the lack of nutrient availability, harsh climatic conditions, or other unfavorable conditions that diminish the quality of life of a foreign species. A good example of an area that expresses low invasibility would be the Mojave Desert located in Southern California. The climate here is classified as an arid desert with low soil nutrients and low diversity of species, because the typical resources that common species need in order to stay alive are not readily available in desert habitat conditions. It is extremely hard for any new non-native species to invade this area and live to reproduce. (However, on the other hand \\"Because overall levels of soil nutrients in the Mojave Desert are low relative to other ecosystems, the high nutrient concentrations that produce high cover of competitive natives that hinders the establishment and growth of aliens may never be found in this region.\\") New species are less likely to be able to establish themselves in harsh climate areas, or communities that are abiotically stressful.

It occurs in 30%-70% of the patients suffering from TBI. TBI can be distinguished into two categories, primary and secondary damage. Primary damage includes injuries of white matter, focal contusion, cerebral edema and hematomas, mostly occurring at the moment of the trauma. Secondary damage involves the damage of neurotransmitter release, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunctions and gene activation, occurring minutes to days following the trauma. Patients with sleeping disorders following TBI suffer specifically from insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder and hypersomnia. Furthermore, circadian sleep-wake disorders can occur after TBI. Presentation = Consequences = Increased level of anxiety and depression is associated with higher levels of sleep disturbances in TBI patients. If depression or anxiety are not treated in these patients, successful treatment of sleep may be prevented. TBI patients suffering from sleepiness show impaired cognitive function and vigilance performance which impairs daily functioning. Sleep is known for its neuroprotective role by elimination of neurotoxic waste products, the neural growth and plasticity, but furthermore, for a specific neuroplastic recovery effect from post mild TBI symptoms. Therefore, sleep disturbance may have a negative effect on injury recovery, rehabilitation and outcomes, leading to long term disabilities. This may be related to less non-REM sleep due to a higher amount of stage 1 sleep. TBI patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea show reduced cardiac function and hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea is also associated with structural changes in the brain. Indirect consequences of sleep disorders after TBI can be the exacerbation of the many complications and comorbidities of TBI. These include fatigue, post-traumatic stress symptoms or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Animal studies with rodents showed that sleep deprivation after traumatic brain injury has been associated with multiple, potentially negative effects on brain homeostasis, including changes in glutamate concentration and energy consumption as well as in brain temperature. In summary, sleep disorders occurring in TBI patients are associated with a low health-related quality of life and a shorter survival status.  Causes  There are different kinds of TBI that cause different brain dysfunctions. Research suggests that TBI results in damage to sleep-regulation centers including the reticular activation system, specifically damage to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) which leads to disturbances in the circadian rhythm. Considering hypersomnia, mostly areas involving the maintenance of wakefulness are damaged, such as the rostral pons, caudal midbrain and thalamus. Sleep disorders are more frequently reported when patients suffer from mild TBI (mTBI). Reasons for that could be the increased awareness of postinjury changes in mild TBI patients because they may be more determined to return to their preinjury life situation. All age groups can be affected from sleep disorders after TBI, including children and adolescents. There are several risk factors that are associated with occurring sleep disorders, such as lower years of education, severity of head injury and occurrence of residuals symptoms, for example headache or dizziness. Further neurodegeneration such as impaired neurotransmitter function, cerebrovascular autoregulatory dysfunction, neuroinflammation and dysregulation of circardian hormones such as melatonin and adenosine can also be a consequence leading to sleep disturbances.  Treatment  In order to make a diagnosis, a subjective evaluation and objective sleep tests are assessed. Subjective evaluations include self-report questionnaires and sleep diaries to assess the sleep pattern from the patient's perspective. Objective sleep tests include mental and physical examinations and laboratory tests to test the medical background, such as Polysomnography (PSG) and Actigraphy. It is typically not possible to assess these tests prior to an injury. Therefore, it is often not clear whether the sleeping disorder is a result of pre-existing disorders. Careful assessment of patients and determining the nature of their sleeping disorder is essential for finding the most effective treatment. There is no explicit treatment for sleep disorders following TBI. Several interventions for general sleep disturbance have been tested in patients with TBI. In order to provide the proper treatment, it is best to divide the injury and its recovery in stages, given that the treatments differs in the different stages. It has been seen how a deterioration of sleep quality during the subacute phase of mTBI has been linked with the worsening of behavioural, neuropsychiatric and somatic outcomes. In general, treatment of sleep disorders following TBI can be distinguished in pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. = Pharmacological treatments = Phototherapy Pharmacological treatments have to be administered carefully. Some medication is highly addictive and the resulting withdrawal syndromes cause even more sleep disturbances, e.g. Insomnia. Possible medications are Zopiclone and lorazepam, which have been proven effective in people with TBI. Also Benzodiazepine hypnotics, Benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists, antidepressants, psychostimulants can be administered, especially in patients with insomnia. Some studies have shown negative effects of hypnotics, such as an increased risk of dementia. In patients with hypersomnia, Modafinil, Armodafinil, Methylphenidate and amphetamines are often used as a treatment for day time sleepiness. Medication should always be prescribed by an expert to make sure that the correct medicament is taken in an appropriate dose. = Nonpharmacological treatments = Nonpharmacological treatments involve different interventions, starting with sleep hygiene, which includes sleep promoting activities such as maintaining a regular and strict sleep schedule and avoiding heavy meals before bedtime in order to restore the natural sleep-wake cycle. Further treatments options are phototherapy and infrared light therapy, which both, aim to treat circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder. Especially in patients with hypersomnia, bright light therapy in the morning has been proven to be effective. A prolongation of slow-wave sleep increases glymphatic clearance of metabolic waste products, which can lead to improvements of sleep disorders. Furthermore, studies showed ameliorated sleep pattern due to acupuncture of patients with TBI. Sleep apnea due to TBI can be treated through positive airway pressure, which helps with the development of a regular breathing pattern during sleep and prevents waking up. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia also have been shown to effectively improve sleep in TBI patients. It aims to improve sleep habits and behaviors by identifying and changing the thoughts and the behaviors that affect the ability of a person to sleep or sleep well. The improvement of the quality of sleep and the decrease of depressive severity is associated with he use of near-infrared light for intracellular healing. = Animal studies = Animals studies showed that sleep deprivation prior to a brain injury might have healthy effects. Five days of complete sleep deprivation in rats before the traumatic brain injury, acted as protection against ischemic injury and a habitual deceased in total amount of sleep time before TBI reduced the severity. There are several theories on the protectional effects of sleep disturbances before an injury in rats. Firstly, it may alter the pattern of gene activation and deactivation. This could lead to a higher degree of neuroprotection. Lack of sleep might increase the levels of extracellular adenosine, which is also mostly neuroprotective against the TBI sequelae. Furthermore, sleep deprivation might lead to a form of ‚Äúischemic precondition‚Äù which habituates the brain to the byproducts of a cellular injury. Studies have been run to assess the role of caffeine in rats with sleeping disorders. While results regarding rats studies have come out positive, in humans caffeine is believed to worsen sleep fragmentation and insomnia. Lastly insufficient quantity and quality of sleep may cause a rebound sleep post injury and increase the sleep enhanced regeneration and recovery. More research is needed to investigate how these findings can be transferred to the treatment of humans suffering from TBI.

Jackson is an American physicist and program manager at the National Science Foundation. She was the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D in Physics from Stanford University. She is an expert on \\"electromagnetic phenomena\\" with a research and development career that spans the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum from materials studies using hard x-ray wavelengths, to nonlinear optics and spectroscopy in the near- infrared, to the fielding of radio frequency instrumentation on deep space missions such as Cassini and Mars Observer.  Early life and education  Jackson was born in Topeka, Kansas to a military family. She attended 13 different schools, earning her high school diploma at an international school in Brunssum, Netherlands. She graduated with a Bachelor's in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1974, and was the first member of her family to study science. Her role models were Prof. Margaret MacVicar and Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson. She worked summer jobs at Bell Labs, Argonne National Laboratory and as a tutor for Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was admitted to graduate school at Cornell University, Stanford University and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, but chose Stanford University because of the atmosphere - it had the largest number of African-American graduate students in physics at that time. She received a Ford Foundation Fellowship and Bell Labs Cooperative Fellowship. She earned her PhD at Stanford University in 1980, working on high resolution spectroscopy using lasers.  Research and career  Jackson was a researcher at IBM Watson Research Center. At IBM she demonstrated that multi-photon ionization is coherently linked with nth order parameter processes. In 1981 she joined the Hughes Research Laboratories, developing optical devices that could be used in military applications. She specialized on Nonlinear optics and diagnostic detection techniques across that across the full electromagnetic spectrum. At HRL Laboratories she pioneered the integration of electronic components (including lasers and photodetectors) on very high speed integrated circuits. She suffered from a car accident in 1988, and her recovery took 13 years. She joined the Defense Policy and Analysis group at the RAND Corporation, where she reviewed new technology in photonics between 1988 and 1992. While at RAND, she evolved a methodology for developing photonic processors. In 1992 she joined Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where she was initially based in the Spacecraft Telecommunications group. She contributed to the Mars Global Surveyor Ultra Stable Oscillator and the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens Ultra Stable Oscillator. These oscillators were like onboard clocks, and allowed the spacecraft to synchronize their communication frequencies with earth through the use of vibrating crystals. She attended the launch of Cassini‚ÄìHuygens at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . Eventually, she joined JPL's Quantum Technologies Group to work on quantum networks and learn about quantum computing. She worked on single photon detectors for use in cryptography. In 1994 she was appointed to the National Research Council committee on women in science and engineering. She joined the National Science Foundation in 2006. As a Program Director in the Engineering Research Center (ERC) Program Office, she leads the Microelectronics, Sensors, and Information Technologies Cluster.

She received a Barclays Woman of the Year Award in 2014. She was also named one of the BBC 100 Women in 2014. Life Nammi was born in Iran. Her father was a progressive thinker, who inspired her later activist work. Nammi was thrown out of school in Sanandaj at 14 for throwing food at a belligerent teacher who had accused her of being promiscuous. She went on to organize protests in favor of \\"secularism, equality and human rights\\" during the 1979 Revolution. Nammi was nearly arrested as a teenager for speaking up for the rights of women. She went on to join up and fight for 12 years as a Peshmerga freedom fighter in Kurdistan, often as a front-line fighter. She continued to speak out for women's rights. She became pregnant in 1991, and fled to Iraq, Turkey, and finally to the United Kingdom in 1996 to raise her child in safety after a chemical bomb attack killed 35 people near the radio station where she worked. Nammi was granted asylum in the UK. Activism Nammi founded the Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights Organization (IKWRO) in her home in 2002. She founded the organization when the translator who helped Nammi and her daughter settle in the United Kingdom was killed. The translator was killed by her own husband, and the police did not wish to call it an \\"honor crime\\" as they believed it was an issue of culture. Nammi was outraged, and founded the organization to argue against \\"us[ing] culture to justify murdering women.\\" IWKRO strove to provide counseling and advice for women that were from the Middle East, North Africa, or Afghanistan or raised in their communities. As of 2014, the organization had 16 paid staff and has helped over 780 women in- person. Nammi has been an outspoken advocate against honor killings, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and the rights of women to divorce in religious marriages. The IKWRO works to provide women with legal access and safe places for women to go for refuge. The organization also works to bring issues of honor attacks and honor killings to the attention of the larger public. In 2013, Nammi joined The National Commission on Forced Marriage to help eliminate practices of forced marriage in the United Kingdom. Nammi and her organization were central in getting two of the killers of Banaz Mahmod, who was killed in an honor killing, extradited to the United Kingdom for prosecution. This was the first ever extradition of its kind. Nammi organized a campaign, entitled \\"Justice for Banaz,\\" that called for the extradition. The men were later convicted. Nammi considers this extradition her chief success. Nammi also played a central role in changing law in the UK to ban forced marriage. Nammi continually advocates for schools, police, and other sources of services to the public to be educated on how to help victims of forced marriage or honor violence. Honors In 2012, Nammi was named one of the 150 Women Who Shake The World by Newsweek and The Daily Beast. Nammi received a Barclays Woman of the Year Award in 2014. Nammi also received a Women on the Move Award from UNHCR in 2014. Also in 2014, she was named one of the BBC's 100 Women. She received a Voices of Courage Award from the Women's Refugee Commission in 2015. Also in 2015, in recognition of her contributions to legal issues, she was named a part of the Inspired by Law gallery by students at London South Bank University. In same year, she was named one of the Women of the Year by the magazine Red. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Essex. She speaks in publicly regularly to defend the rights of women. Her TEDx speech has been viewed thousands of times of YouTube.

The album was released on March 16, 2018 through Metal Blade Records and was the band's first effort to chart on the Billboard 200, debuting at number 61 and selling 2,750 copies in its first week. Information In a May 2018 Reddit AMA, Utley and Biggs stated the following regarding the album's concept and lyrical content: > Owls is essentially the story of the last man on earth.

Uttley met Strouse several years before the release of Owls while recording Strouse's local metal band. While tracking Strouse's guitar, Uttley learned that Strouse was a performance major on saxophone and attending school for saxophone. Uttley was impressed by Strouse's performance at a local university soon thereafter. The two remained close and Strouse agreed to track saxophone for what would become \\"Owls\\", first recording for \\"The Silent Life\\" at Uttley's home, to rave reviews from the other band members. As a result, Strouse provided 3 solos for the album and atmospheric work on two other songs. Uttley pointed out when interviewed that the band didn't want to be known as \\"the sax band\\" and that they were rather simply incorporating new elements into their sound. Uttley also noted that Strouse himself is a death metal fan, and that he was wearing an Origin shirt while recording his solos. The song \\"Old Nothing\\" features a guest solo by former The Faceless guitarist and founding member of The Zenith Passage Justin McKinney. Album artwork was provided by Dan Seagrave, who provided artwork for the bands' two prior releases.http://www.danseagrave.com/detail/monarchy/http://www.danseagrave.com/detail/the- conscious-seed-of-light/ Andy Thomas of Black Crown Initiate provides additional vocals on the title track \\"Where Owls Know My Name\\".

Background and promotion The band announced they had returned to Atrium Audio, where they had recorded their Sophomore effort Monarchy in September 2017, via their Facebook page. The band once again worked with Grammy-nominated producers Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland, who had produced both their debut EP Hirearchy and their second studio album Monarchy. In promotion of the album the band released three singles: \\"The Silent Life\\", \\"A Home\\", and the title track. The album was made available for streaming in its entirety on March 12 via WSOU.

Early life John Staniforth was the son of Charles Staniforth, a merchant of both the Broad Street Buildings, London and Kingston-Upon-Hull, and his wife Ann Green. His uncles John Staniforth (1725-1798) and Philip Green and Joseph Green were notable Hull shipowners and his uncle Joseph Green was based in K√∂nigsberg. On his father's death in 1797, John went into partnership with John Blunt, and carried on his father's London business. Parliamentary career His uncle Philip Green brought him to Hull and persuaded him to stand for election to Parliament. Philip Green used his own popularity, gained through his shipping interests which brought money into the town, to ensure that John was elected in 1802 to represent Hull, a seat he would hold until 1818. Philip Green died in 1803 and Staniforth increased his interest in Hull by setting up his own shipping business. He participated in attracting the East India Company to the Hull ports and in 1804 he procured naval contracts with the Hull naval yard. He was a Director of the Bank of England from 1807 to 1819. John Staniforth was recorded on a list of 'staunch friends' of the abolition of the Slave Trade, but did not support Richard Bland's motion on 9 April 1807. In 1810 he was listed as 'Government' on the Whigs list. In 1818 Staniforth was criticised for participation in the profits of the East India Company monopoly amongst other things. Now facing financial difficulty, he announced his retirement from Parliament before the parliamentary election of that year. He was however nominated by a committee of friends but in the event was narrowly defeated at the polls. Staniforth died in 1830. He had married in 1793 Maria Pitts of Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire and had a total of five children, of which four survived.

Hill was the first woman to hold a captain's license on the Columbia River. She commanded her own vessels and traded along the river during her career.  Biography  Minnie Hill was born on July 20, 1863 in Albany, Oregon where she spent her early life. Her father, Isaac Mossman, had been an agent of the Pony Express and her mother, Nellie, an early pioneer of Oregon. Minnie married Charles Hill, captain of the steamship Joseph Kellogg, in 1883. They lived together on the ship for three years, where Minnie Hill helped Charles with his work and the couple saved $1,000. While on the ship, she learned detailed skills relating to fixing and maintaining boats, navigation and piloting skills. With the saved money, they bought their own ship, a schooner. Governor Newell\\" in 1900 Hill earned her master's and pilot's license on November 20, 1887. Her testing to earn her license was very difficult because \\"the examiners wanted to refuse her a license without justification\\". After earning her license, she became the new commander of the steamer Minnie Hill. She also became the first licensed woman to run a steamer on the Columbia River. Later, Hill and her husband bought the Clatsop Chief and the Governor Newell. She ran this ship as the captain for 14 years while Charles worked as the engineer and piloted up and down the Columbia River. She also was instrumental in doing business with the Chinookan people along the river. Hill was invited by the Chicago World's Fair to be the guest at the Women's Building exhibition in 1893, though she turned the invitation down. During her time as a captain, she had two children, but only one lived. Her son, Herbert Wells Hill, was born on September 1894 and lived on boats until he was old enough to start school. Around the 1900s, she retired and went on to become a member of the Veteran Steamboatmen's Association. She also went on to \\"devote herself to raising her son\\". Her husband died in Portland in 1942. Hill died in San Francisco on January 9, 1946 from a \\"heart ailment\\". She was inducted into the National Rivers Hall of Fame in 2017.

Life =Education= He was the son of George Hughes (died in November 1719), minister at Canterbury, and was born in 1695. His father was grandson of George Hughes, and son of Obadiah Hughes (died 24 January 1704, aged 64), who was ejected in 1662 from a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, before taking his degree, received presbyterian ordination on 9 March 1670 at Plymouth, and ministered from April 1674 in London, and afterwards at Enfield. Obadiah Hughes the younger was educated by his father, by the dissenting tutor John Jennings at Kibworth, and then at Aberdeen. In 1728 Kings College, Aberdeen, sent him the diploma of D.D. Having acted for some time as a domestic chaplain, he was ordained on 11 January 1721 at the Old Jewry, being then assistant to Joshua Oldfield, at Maid Lane, Southwark. =Career= Though a non-subscriber at Salters' Hall in 1719, Hughes was an evangelical preacher. With Nathaniel Lardner and others he established a Tuesday evening lecture at the Old Jewry; he belonged also, with Jeremiah Hunt and others,to a ministers' club which met at Chew's Coffee-house, Bow Lane. On Oldfield's death on 8 November 1729 he became sole pastor at Maid Lane, and was at once elected Oldfield's successor as trustee of Dr. Williams's Foundations. He took part in 1734 in the course of sermons against popery at Salters' Hall. From 1738 to 1750 he was secretary to the presbyterian board. In 1743 he succeeded Samuel Say at Long Ditch (now Princes Street), Westminster. He became one of the Salters' Hall lecturers in 1746. Hughes's health failed him while he was still in his prime, and he died on 10 December 1751. Funeral sermons were preached by Samuel Lawrence of Monkwell Street, and John Allen of New Broad Street; that by the latter was published. Family Hughes married a sister of Sir John Fryer, 1st Baronet, one of the presbyterian gentry, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1721. He adopted his wife's niece, Delicia Fryer, who married Joshua Iremonger and died in December 1744. Bibliography Walter Wilson gives a list of fourteen separate sermons by Hughes published between 1726 and 1749, eight of them being funeral sermons, including those for Oldfield and Say. Others were: *A Sermon on the Anniversary of King George's Coronation, 1725 *The Salvation of God's People, 1745 *Peace attended with Reformation, 1749.

The company is located in Acheson, Alberta with distribution nodes across Alberta and Saskatchewan. About Paradox Access Solutions was founded in 2004 by Marc Breault, who holds six patents relating to roadway construction. In 2012, the company formed an engineering firm called Stratum Logics to provide geotechnical engineering expertise. In the aftermath of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, the company assisted with road restoration into affected communities, creating 40 km of temporary roads in a little over week. It also donated used mats to regional nature trail construction groups to aid in trail stabilization and sustainability. In 2018, the company began work to restore the Hudson Bay Railway to Churchill, Manitoba, which was washed out by floods in May, 2017. Paradox provided railbed restoration while Cando Rail repaired the rails. Products and services The company is a provider of wooden, rubber and composite mats (often called rig mats or swamp mats), intended to provide stable, if temporary, roadways for industrial applications, such as in oil and natural gas, pipeline access, mining, and utility corridors. The mats are placed in the spring when the ground thaws and removed later in the year when the ground re-freezes, providing extended access to industrial sites in locations where traditional access construction methods are ill suited, due to location, cost or sensitive environmental conditions. These mats may also be used in aviation, rail transport and paved or unpaved public or private road surfaces applications. Other similar companies that work within the plant and machinery company include Powered Access Solutions located in Swidon, UK. =Tough Cell= Paradox Access Solutions is the sole Canadian distributor of a product called Tough Cell, a Novel polymeric alloy cellular confinement product developed by PRS-Geo-Technologies known as Neology geocell. Once the honeycomb-shaped geotextile is placed, it's filled with sand, gravel, dirt, or other locally available materials, and then compressed. The honeycomb shape is able to support heavy equipment by redirecting downward energy outward, ‚Äúdecreasing differential settlement of soft subgrades,‚Äù providing soil confinement, stabilization, and reinforcement. The resulting surface is functional in very cold (-60C) to very hot (60C) conditions. The product is notable for its durability, and reduced cost and carbon footprint, resulting from the use of local, rather than imported, aggregate materials. In addition to temporary roadway applications, it has also been approved for municipal road construction projects.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as \\"At Risk, Declining\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Achille Guen√©e in 1868 from a specimen collected by Richard William Fereday in Canterbury. George Vernon Hudson discussed and illustrated the species in 1898 and again in 1928. He states that Fereday's specimens were collected at the foot of Mount Hutt. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  The eggs of this species are yellowish-white in appearance, elliptical in shape and have hexagonal depressions on the surface. Larvae are coloured pale yellow-brown on their dorsal side and a dull ocherous shade on their lateral side. They have 16 legs and are extremely thin. The pupa is approximately cm long and is initially coloured pale yellow but darkens to golden then dark brown. Hudson described the adults of the species as follows:  Distribution  D. partheniata is endemic to New Zealand. This species has occurred at Waiouru, the Tararua Range including at Mount Holdsworth, Wellington, Mount Arthur, Mount Hutt, Arthur's Pass National Park, Homer, Mount Cook, Dunedin, Lake Wakatipu, and at the Hump Ridge. The species can occur from sea level up to approximately 1500m in altitude. Behaviour D. partheniata larvae are nocturnal and when their safety is threatened drop to the centre of the plants they are feeding on. The larvae of this species has been observed, in the present of an Ichneumon wasp, gripping the blade of its foodplant with its prolegs and beating it with its body, causing the blade to move from side to side. The adults of this species are day flying moths and are on the wing during the months of October to March. Habitat  The species occurs in open grassy areas. In Wellington the species prefers coastal cliffs and at Mount Hutt specimens have been collected in tussock grass. Host species  The host plants of this species are in the genus Aciphylla and include Aciphylla subflabellata. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being At Risk and Declining.

When complete, it will span the Yakima River and the Columbia Canal north of Interstate 182, connecting Central Richland with the Queensgate-area. The Queensgate-area has experienced a large amount of growth since the late-2000s and construction of the bridge is expected to fuel continued growth on the west side of the river. The bridge will also provide the first street connection between Central Richland and South Richland.

History Construction of the Duportail Bridge has been Richland's top priority since at least 2007. For individuals to get between Richland's center and the Queensgate-area today, they must travel on I-182. In 2016, the bridge carrying I-182 over the Yakima River carried an average of 54,000 vehicles a day. The new bridge is expected to remove thousands of vehicles from this load. Official planning for the bridge began in 2011, but encountered several roadblocks before construction began. After the job was awarded to Apollo Construction, another bidder, N.A. Degerstrom from Spokane filed an injunction. That injunction was lifted a few days later, allowing Richland to officially award the contract in January 2018. Funding The City of Richland went through several avenues to secure funding to build the bridge. In 2014, it applied for a federal grant that would have paid for the entire cost. In the application, the city listed a number of benefits including decreased air pollution, less traffic deaths, and saving up to $30 million in improvements to I-182. That application was later denied, forcing the city to seek other sources for funding. Over $30 million was provided by the state government to complete the bridge, with approximately $2 million coming from federal sources. The majority of the state funding is coming from an 11.9 cent increase in the state's gas tax, with a smaller portion being allotted for improvements to the intersection at State Route 240. Another source for funding is through car tabs. Richland established a Transportation Benefit District to levee a $20 fee that will be added to the cost of a resident's annual car registration. This licensing fee was expected to raise $875,000 in the first year. Of that $20 fee, $3 will go directly to construction costs of the new bridge. This fee is expected to be removed in 2039. Construction Construction on the bridge officially began in March 2018 and is expected to continue until Summer of 2020. The project is split into two phases, the bridge itself and improvements to the intersection of State Route 240 and Duportail Street. The project will also add traffic lights to the intersection of Duportail and Tanglewood Drive on the east side of the river and at City View Drive on the west side of the river. A water pipeline, currently running beneath the Yakima River, will be replaced with the new line crossing the bridge. Portions of the building involving the river will be restricted to the summer months due to state and federal regulations. These regulations are in place to make it easier for fish to migrate through the channel. During construction, access to the Yakima River and trails around it will be restricted. Richland has set up detours for recreational trails, and has suggested that boaters use boat launches that are either upstream or downstream of the construction site. Community Response The Duportail Bridge project has been controversial in the City of Richland since it was first proposed. Many of the businesses in the Queensgate-area are in favor of the new bridge, because they expect the new accesspoint to bring more customers to the district. Even before construction, property values began to rise on the west side. The bridge will also provide better access to first responders on both sides of the Yakima River. Many residents are against bridge construction because it will increase already high traffic volumes in the Queensgate-area. The Washington State Department of Transportation has begun a project at I-182 to try to alleviate some of these issues. Immediate neighbors to the future bridge are concerned that the city will not do enough to allow them access to the street by making it hard for them to make turns leaving the neighborhood. Richland residents were also against the new car tab fee that was introduced.

Bridges  Most of the trestle bridges were surveyed and built by Frank Ward (born in 1873 in Manchester; died 2 June 1956). Although he was of a small stature and seemed a bit frail, his strength in wielding an axe was unusual. He worked mainly on his own, when he built trestle bridges ahead of the bush gangs, who felled the trees and hauled them to the track for being carted with the locomotive of the tramway to the mill. He had to carve the uprights and girders by hand from massive totara logs. The trimming of trestles and squaring of stringers was done using a broadaxe with a much wider blade than that of normal axes.Bush trams and other log transport. Goodbye to the bush. His masterpiece was high and long. It was actually two bridges in one. The lower section of bents was high and the upper section another . Frank Ward chose the best totara trees for the stringers and broadaxed them down to a uniform thickness of from end to end commencing at the butt. He left the sap edges on, so that the a very high strength was achieved by retaining the natural strength of each tree‚Äôs grain. He used only a crosscut saw, mauls, axes, wedges, files, marking line and chalk for line marking. The only machine that he used was a hand winch and one of the Vulcan steam haulers, known as Ward‚Äôs Hauler which he always operated by himself.Ken Anderson and Ron Cooke: Tringamoot: The story of Taringamutu Totara Sawmills Ltd in the Taringamotu Valley.

It is based on Stephen King and Joe Hill's 2012 novella of the same name. It stars Harrison Gilbertson, Laysla De Oliveira, Avery Whitted, Will Buie Jr., Rachel Wilson, and Patrick Wilson. The project was in initial development in early 2015 but failed to start. Then, in May 2018, the video streaming site Netflix announced that it had purchased the film rights with Natali as director, who also wrote the adapted screenplay. Principal photography was expected to begin on July 30, 2018 lasting until Sept. 14, 2018 in Toronto, Ontario. The film had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest on Sept. 20, 2019, and was later released on Oct. 4, 2019, by Netflix. It received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, atmosphere and faithfulness to the novel, but criticizing its inconsistent tone and dialogue. Plot Siblings Becky, 6 months pregnant, and Cal DeMuth travel to San Diego. They hear a young boy, Tobin, calling for help from a field of tall grass. His mother, Natalie, shuts him up. Concerned, they enter but quickly get separated and finds that their distance changes unnaturally. Panicked, they decided to leave but can't find the road. Becky encounters Tobin's father Ross, he tells her to stay with him and don't lose sight of him. She does lose him. Cal stumbles across a bruised, dirty Tobin holding a dead crow. Tobin claims the grass won't move dead things and buries the bird in the path. He tells Cal that Becky will die soon and that the rock told him that. Tobin leads Cal to a rock in the field and tells him to touch it, interrupted by Becky's scream, attacked by a ghost. The father of Becky's child, Travis, arrives looking for her and Cal. He investigates the field, stumbling across Tobin, implying that they are acquaintances, leading him to Becky's corpse. Tobin arrives at a nearby church with his parents. Hearing Travis, who is now calling out to Tobin, their dog Freddy runs into the grass, and the family runs in after him, where Travis hears Tobin and looks for him. The family panics, with Ross stumbling across the rock and touching it. Becky and Cal re-enters the grass as Tobin states that Freddy died. Knowing the grass's trait, Becky and Cal move towards Tobin, and all four find each other. Travis tells Becky and Cal that they had been missing for two months. The group spots a building in the distance. Becky receives a phone call from someone warning them not to keep making the same \\"mistake.\\" The grass seemingly enters Becky's uterus, and she passes out, only to be revived by Ross, who then reunites with Tobin and says he'll show them out. Ross leads them to the rock where they are confronted by Natalie, she warns them not to touch the rock. Then, she claims she saw Becky's corpse earlier. Natalie warns Ross is dangerous, and the others decides to leave. Travis attacks Ross who then breaks his arm and crushes Natalie‚Äôs head. Ross claims the rock showed him the truth and the way out, but he doesn't want to leave. Becky, Cal, Travis, and Tobin reach the building, and while scouting, Travis and Cal discover that Freddy has managed to escape the field via a \\"hole\\" that leads to the road. Jealous Cal, implied to have incestuous feelings for Becky, lets go of Travis as he slips, causing him to fall off the roof. Tobin flees into the field when Ross follows them to the roof. The two follow Tobin, but Becky refuses to leave Travis and goes back as Cal flees, Cal is strangled to death by Ross. It is revealed they are in a time loop, with Cal permanently being hunted by an insane, possessed Ross in the grass. Travis survives and searches for Becky. Becky says the baby will be fostered. Becky is attacked by Ross but escapes by stabbing him in the eye, and a thunderstorm begins. Becky is confronted by Grass Creatures, who carry her to the rock, which has prophetic marks relating to her pregnancy. Becky makes a phone call, pleading for her past self to prevent Cal from hurting Travis. As she screams in pain from contractions, the ground underneath the rock opens, revealing multiple roots that turn into humanoid figures reaching towards her. She passes out and wakes up to Cal who squeezes water into her mouth. He is holding her baby. She goes back to sleep and wakes up to Cal feeding her baby to her and telling her its just grass and seeds. Becky realizes that \\"Cal\\" is Ross. Tobin finds Travis and tells him that he killed the baby and Cal and is going to keep killing them over and over. They are confronted by Ross, who mortally wounds him. As Ross forces Tobin to touch the rock, Becky attacks him and scratches out his other eye, before dying from her wounds. Travis kills Ross. To understand, Travis touches the rock and sees strange visuals. He grabs Tobin's hand and guides him to an exit, instructing him to stop Becky and Cal from entering. Tobin emerges across the road as Becky and Cal are about to enter the grass, convincing them to stay out by showing them Becky's necklace that Travis gave him, hence closing the loop. Becky decides to keep her baby as they drive back home. Travis listens to them leaving and dies.

It has round or heart-shaped leaf and a translucent greenish flower with dark red or burgundy-coloured spots and blotches. The edges of the labellum have a few short, blunt teeth.  Description  Corybas limpidus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single thin, round or broad heart-shaped leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. There is a single erect, translucent green flower with dark red spots and blotches, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is burgundy-coloured, long and wide and curves forward over the labellum. The lateral sepals are green, about long, wide, joined at their bases and taper to a fine tip. The petals are about long, wide and taper to a thread-like tip. The labellum is longer than the dorsal sepal, long, wide with a greenish mound in the centre. The edges of the labellum have a few short, blunt teeth. Flowering occurs in August and September.  Taxonomy  Corybas limpidus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones, in Australian Orchid Research, based on specimens collected near Albany in 1986. The specific epithet (limpidus) is a Latin word meaning \\"clear\\", \\"transparent\\" or \\"pure\\", referring to the dorsal sepal and part of the labellum. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Corysanthes but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The crystal helmet orchid grows under dense shrubs between sand dunes in coastal areas from Esperance to Walpole in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions. Conservation Corybas limpidus is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

This was the moment when the Babylonian ruler, Nabopolassar, led a revolt against Assyrian rule. After a few years of war, the Babylonians expelled the Assyrian forces from their territory. The situation became highly dangerous for Assyria with the offensive of Cyaxares, king of the Medes, in 616 BC. The Median forces swiftly conquered Tarbisu and decisively defeated the Assyrian army at the Battle of Assur. Then, they joined the Babylonian army and launched a combined offensive against Nineveh in 612 BC. After the Battle of Nineveh, where the Assyrian king Sin-Shar- Ishkun died, Ashur-uballit II became king and went to Harran with his remaining troops. But the Medes and the Babylonians besieged Harran and took the city, forcing Assur-Uballit II to flee to the Egyptian city of Carchemish with the remnants of his army. After Harran fell, Egyptians and the remnants of the Assyrian forces left Carchemish and attacked the Medes and the Babylonians garrisoned in Harran.

Bred in the vicinity of Hailes Castle in East Lothian by William Riddell, in 1880 Help was donated to John Climpson. Climpson, who was the long-serving guard of the night boat train to Newhaven on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, had previously had the idea of using a dog to obtain donations for the Orphans Fund of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS). He did not provide Help with any special training, the dog simply being fitted with a wooden collecting box on his back, and a silver collar and medal. The medal was inscribed: \\"I am Help, the railway dog of England, and travelling agent for the orphans of railwaymen who are killed on duty. My office is at 306, City Road [later 55, Colebrooke Row], London, where subscriptions will be thankfully received and duly acknowledged\\". While Help often travelled with Climpson, he was also lent out to other guards to undertake collections on their routes. By the time of his death, it was claimed that he had travelled every railway line in Britain and visited all the major towns, and had also travelled twice to France, in the course of his travels raising more than ¬£1,000. He also attended many of the conferences of the ASRS. Help was awarded a silver medal at the Bristol Dog Show of 1884, was the subject of numerous paintings and sketches, and appeared on a commemorative badge. He was retired in 1890, settling in Newhaven. He died in late 1891, the Railway Review claiming in his obituary that he was \\"without doubt the best known dog in the United Kingdom\\".

The memorial in Bamako was inaugurated in January 1924, and the original replica in Reims in July of the same year. History The original replica in Reims The original replica of the Monument in Reims was erected in 1924 where the Boulevard Henry Vasnier meets the Avenue du G√©n√©ral Giraud. The first stone was placed by Minister of War Andr√© Maginot, on 29 October 1922. This ceremony was also addressed by Blaise Diagne, the Senegalese political leader. In July 1924 the monument was inaugurated with a Military and Sports fete presided over by Minister of the Colonies √âdouard Daladier. General Louis Archinard was the president of the committee that supervised the erection of the monument, highlighting the role of African troops of the 1st Colonial Infantry Corps in the defense of Reims from the German Army in 1918. They were particularly renowned for their tenacious defence of Fort de la Pompelle. 10,000 people attended the fete which was held immediately following the inauguration. The original monument, consisting of five figures, was a replica of a similar monument erected in Bamako, Mali in January 1924. The monument was dismantled during the German occupation in September 1940. In September 1958, on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Defence of Reims, a new monument was started. This was completed in time for a second inauguration ceremony on 6 October 1963, with Pierre Messmer, Minister of Armies, Jean Sainteny, Minister of veterans, Jacques Foccart, secretary general of the Communaut√© et les affaires africaines et malgaches, and General Georges Catroux, grand chancellor of the L√©gion d'honneur.

He would stay in this position until 1986. Afterwards, he would transition into television, joining Central Television to executive produce the popular soap Crossroads. He then exec produced crime drama Boon, and created the British Satellite Broadcasting science fiction soap opera Jupiter Moon. The series is set in the year 2050 and concentrates on the space ship Ilea. 150 episodes were commissioned and made, but only the first 108 were broadcast before the closure of BSB. He would later write several non-fiction books, such as seven editions of the screenwriting manual, How to Write for Television, which also includes advice for writing radio.

For a time, the Artillery Branch and Engineer Branch were combined. Unit designations did not yet contain the terms \\"Field Artillery\\" or \\"Coast Artillery,\\" although units so designated, as well those of the air defense artillery, would eventually trace their lineage and honors to some of the early formations. Battalion of Artillery The Battalion of Artillery consisted of four companies. The first company of the battalion was retained from the Continental Army. A second company, commanded by Captain Thomas Douglass, had been raised in Pennsylvania in 1784. Two other companies were raised as a result of congressional action in 1786 to deal with Shays's Rebellion. The battalion was organized on September 29, 1789; the commander of the first company, Captain John Doughty, was promoted to major and assigned as the commandant of the battalion; the companies were identified by the names of their commanders: Captains James Bradford, Henry Burbeck, William Ferguson, and Joseph Savage. Doughty served as commandant from September 29, 1789 to March 4, 1791 and the battalion was recognized as a part of the United States Army. William Ferguson succeeded Doughty as commandant (serving from March 4, 1791 to November 4, 1791) and was himself succeeded by Henry Burbeck (serving from November 4, 1791 to May 9, 1794). Legion of the United States In 1792, during Henry Burbeck's tenure as commandant, the Army was organized into the Legion of the United States. One artillery company was assigned to each of the four sublegions of the Legion of the United States. The Artillery Battalion no longer existed. (Burbeck is listed as a member of the Legion's artillery, but without any indication of his duty position.) Captains of the Legion's artillery companies were Mahlon Ford (1st Sublegion), John Pierce (2nd Sublegion), Moses Porter (3rd Sublegion), and Daniel McLane (4th Sublegion). Artillerists and Engineers =Corps of Artillerists and Engineers= On May 9, 1794, the companies that had been the Battalion of Artillery was merged into the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers. In January 1794, Congress appointed a committee to investigate the needs for coastal defenses. The act of May 9, 1794 recognized the need to defend the coast lines of the United States. The Corps of Artillerists and Engineers was established by including the existing Battalion of Artillery into a larger organization of four battalions, each having four companies. The original act established the Corps for three years; an act of March 3, 1795 continued the Corps indefinitely. The resulting organization of forts and units is known as the First System. Leadership of the Corps was placed upon two lieutenant colonels‚Äîcommandant: Stephen Rochefontaine (serving from February 26, 1795 to May 7, 1798) and Henry Burbeck (serving from May 7, 1798 to April 1, 1802). On March 3, 1799 the Corps was designated as the First Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers. On April 1, 1802, the First Regiment was combined with the Second Regiment to form the Regiment of Artillerists =Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers= Because of increased tensions with France, an additional unit, the Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers, was formed on April 27, 1798. When the regiment was first organized, it had three battalions, each of four companies. An additional artillery battalion was authorized on March 3, 1799. Concurrent with the increase in strength, the regiment was designated as the Second Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers. The regiment had two lieutenant colonels‚Äîcommandant: John Doughty (serving from June 1, 1798 to May 26, 1800) and Louis Toussard (serving from May 26, 1800 to April 1, 1802). On April 1, 1802, the Second Regiment was combined with the First Regiment to form the Regiment of Artillerists Regiments of Artillery The assets of the First and Second Regiments of Artillerists and Engineers were combined to form the Regiment of Artillerists, without reference to engineers; it consisted of five battalions of four companies each. Colonel Henry Burbeck was the only commander of the regiment from its activation on April 1, 1802 until inactivation on May 12, 1814. On January 11, 1812, two additional artillery regiments, the Second and Third, were created and the Regiment of Artillerists was re-designated as the First Regiment of Artillery; regardless, the First Regiment was referred to as the Regiment of Artillerists in reports. Regiment of Light Artillery The act of April 12, 1808 provided for a Regiment of Light Artillery consisting of ten companies. Moses Porter served as the only colonel of the regiment from March 12, 1812 to June 1, 1821. Prior to the war of 1812, only one company was equipped as field artillery. It was mounted as such in 1808 and dis-mounted in 1809. During the war of 1812, other companies were equipped as horse artillery or as field artillery. On May 17, 1815, under the act of March 3, 1815, the 15th, 26th, 30th, 31st, 34th, and 45th regiments of infantry were consolidated with the Regiment of Light Artillery. On June 1, 1821, as provided by the act of March 2, 1821, this organization, along with the Corps of Artillery, was inactivated and its components distributed to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Regiments of artillery. Corps of Artillery The Corps of Artillery was formed on May 12, 1814 (under the act of March 30, 1814) by consolidating the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments of Artillery. Its structure was defined as 12 battalions, each with four companies. On May 17, 1815 (under the act of March 3, 1815) under the military peace establishment, the Regiment of Dragoons and the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd Regiments of Infantry were consolidated with the Corps of Artillery, raising its strength to eight battalions, each with four companies. On June 1, 1821 (under the act of March 2, 1821) the Corps of Artillery ceased to exist. Assets of the Corps of Artillery and the Regiment of Light Artillery formed the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Regiments of Artillery.

From 2004 to 2019 she was an adjunct professor in Anthropology at the University of Victoria. She is best known for her blog posts on polar bear biology, which oppose the scientific consensus that polar bears are threatened by ongoing climate change.  Early life and education  Crockford first gained her interest in the Arctic in elementary school, when she read about Inuit life and Arctic fauna. Her scientific interest in the Arctic was stoked when she received her first Alaskan Malamute at age eleven. Crockford received her Bachelor of Science in Zoology at the University of British Columbia in 1976 and her doctorate in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Victoria in 2004. Differing from a normal Zoology degree, she chose to focus on speciation in mammals, with a focus on thyroid function.  Career  A 33,000 year old canid skull from Siberia analyzed by Pacific Identifications. = Business = In 1988, Crockford, along with colleagues Rebecca Wigen and Gay Frederick, founded the contracting company Pacific Identifications Inc. in Victoria. The company specializes in offering bone and shell analysis of skeletal elements of fish, mammals and birds from western North America and maintains a prominent library of reference animal remains. Since the start of her career, she has worked primarily through paid contracts for specific work on a variety of topics. = Books = In 2006, she published the book Rhythms of Life: Thyroid Hormone and the Origin of Species, explaining the effect of thyroid hormone secretion upon evolutionary change. She hypothesized that the thyroid is the key to controlling species-specific growth and for maintaining homeostatic conditions for individuals. The species-specific flow of hormones would therefore be the root cause of why‚Äîfor example‚Äîa chimpanzee would develop into a chimpanzee while in its mother's womb, instead of a human, despite possessing 99% of the same genes. The most controversial portion of her book was the challenge to the idea that humans alone domesticated animals. She argued species adapted to fulfill the ecological niche provided by becoming the companions of humans or by living within their communities. = Dogs = Crockford is a specialist on the evolutionary history of dogs, especially in regards to their domestication and speciation. In 2007, she was called upon as the scientific consultant for the PBS documentary, Dogs that Changed the World, focused upon the domestication of dogs. In the two-part documentary, she was called upon multiple times to give insight into the process of domestication and the emergence of dogs as a separate species from wolves. She has also written several peer-reviewed papers on this topic. = Polar bears = Crockford blogs about polar bears. Crockford has been a constant voice of disagreement with the mainstream opinions of polar bear scientists, notably Steven Amstrup and Ian Stirling, regarding polar bears' current status and level of endangerment. Declining levels of summer sea ice and the corresponding levels of polar bear population decline from 2004-2010 was published in a study and used for the popularization of the polar bear as the symbol for climate change. Crockford suggests that the decline in the polar bear population was in fact caused by unusually thick spring ice that year, a recurring trend every decade for the past century, which led to a shortage of their preferred prey, ringed seals. Either the subsequent seal shortage or declining ice levels was the cause of an approximately 40% decrease in polar bear numbers in the Beaufort Sea area. She charges that this study, which only used data up to 2010, despite being available until 2013, used cherry picked results due to an undisclosed conflict of interest to cause the species to be categorized as \\"Threatened\\" in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's 2015 Red List. A response to her op-ed was written by Amstrup and Andrew Derocher, to which she replied on her blog.  Controversy  Crockford is a signatory of the International Conference on Climate Change's 2008 Manhattan Declaration, which states that \\"Carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse gas' emissions from human activity...appear to have only a very small impact on global climate,\\" and \\"Global cooling has presented serious problems for human society and the environment throughout history while global warming has generally been highly beneficial.\\" Between at least 2011 and 2013, she received payment from The Heartland Institute, in the form of $750 per month, which Crockford states was to provide summaries of published papers that might not have been covered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report. This payment has been construed as an undisclosed conflict of interest, by blogs such as Desmog Blog. Her response to such claims was a disclosure of the job description, how much she was paid, and the duration of the contract. Although some polar bear scientists disagree with Crockford's claims, her blog has been widely cited by websites that either deny or are skeptical of climate change, with over 80% citing it as their primary source of information on polar bears. Critics point out that none of Crockford's claims regarding the effects of climate change on polar bears has undergone peer review, nor has she ever published any peer- reviewed articles whose main focus is polar bears. After 15 years as an adjunct professor, University of Victoria did not renew her contract in May 2019, possibly for her climate change views.

The distal phalanx of affected thumbs is approximately two- thirds the length of full-length thumbs. It is a type of brachydactyly, or shortness of digits, and is associated with the HOXD13 gene.  Physiology  Brachydactyly type D is a skeletal condition allegedly caused by a 'partial fusion or premature closing of the epiphysis with the distal phalanx of the thumb', according to Goodman et alia (1965). J.K. Breithenbecher (1923) found that distal phalanges of stub thumbs were one-half the length of full-length thumbs, while R.M. Stecher (1957) claimed that it be approximately two-thirds. The condition may either be unilateral (affecting one thumb) or bilateral (affecting both).  Genetics  A genetic trait, brachydactyly type D exhibits autosomal dominance and is commonly developed or inherited independently of other hereditary traits. The condition is associated with the HOXD13 gene, which is central in digital formation and growth.  Epidemiology  A 1965 scientific study in Israel found that 3.05% of Palestinians in Israel had one or two stub thumbs, compared with 1.57% among Ashkenazi as well as non-Ashkenazi Jews. However, as the survey's Arab test persons were mainly recruited from a handful of large and closely related clans living in a particular village, said percentage should be 'considered with some reservation', according to Goodman et alia (1965). Stub thumbs are also relatively common in Japan. Cases of stub thumbs have also been found in Eastern Nepal for Jirel ethnic individuals from their participation in various epidemiologic studies. Some studies included taking radiographs of hands and wrists to examine their skeletal structure. Of the studied sample 2,130 participants; 969 male and 1,722 female were found to have brachydactyly type D. This amount had accounted for 3.55% of the total studied sample.  Terminology  The condition is known under numerous names. The most commonly used name is clubbed thumb, or club thumb. American researcher R.A. Hefner used the terms \\"short thumb\\" and \\"brachymegalodactylism\\" in 1924, and \\"short thumb\\" has continued to be used in a few other studies since then, including the study that defined Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome in 1963. \\"Stub thumb\\" is the common term preferred by the online database Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and was first used in a 1965 study. Stub thumbs have also been called murderer's thumb (allegedly among fortune tellers), bohemian thumb, Tory's thumb and potter's thumb. The common term \\"clubbed thumb\\" should not be confused with nail clubbing, which is a clinical sign associated with a number of diseases.

For Statement 2, since G acts transitively on X and the smooth locus of X is nonempty (by characteristic zero), X itself is smooth. Since G is smooth, each geometric fiber of p is smooth and thus p_0 : \\\\Gamma_0 := (G \\\\times V_{1, \\\\text{sm}}) \\\\times_X V_{2, \\\\text{sm}} \\\\to V_{1, \\\\text{sm}} \\\\times V_{2, \\\\text{sm}} is a smooth morphism. It follows that a general fiber of q_0 : \\\\Gamma_0 \\\\to G is smooth by generic smoothness. \\\\square  Notes  References  * Category:Algebraic geometry ","title":"Kleiman's theorem"},{"id":"57371622","text":"Odo Van Maelcote, (also known as Malcotius)(b. Brussels 28 July 1572, d. Rome 14 May 1615) was a Jesuit priest, scientist and mathematician from the Spanish Netherlands (present day Belgium).  Biography  Odo Van Maelcote, lord of Kessel, was the oldest son of Johannes Van Maelcote, who was doctor of both civil and canon law at the University of Louvain, First Counsellor and Vice- Chancellor in the chancellery of Brabant and his wife Marie de Viron. He entered the noviciate with the Jesuits at Tournai on 12 February 1590 and studied at the University of Douai. In 1607 he published in Brussels a small tract on the equinoctial astrolabe that he had designed and manufactured, involving two conjoined hemispheres. The device was useful to missionary ventures around the world, as it could be used in both northern and southern latitudes. This made his name known among scientists, and when he sent an astrolabe as a gift to Christopher Clavius in Rome, Clavius responded by inviting him to Rome to teach mathematics and Hebrew at the Roman College in 1608, where he soon became assistant to Christoph Grienberger. In 1610, Cardinal Bellarmine asked four Jesuits, Grienberger, Clavius, :it:Paolo Lembo and Maelcote, for their opinion on the new phenomena discovered by Galileo using his telescope. Reporting on behalf of his colleagues, Maelcote advised that they agreed with most of Galileo's findings, although they were uncertain the Saturn consisted of three bodies as Galileo stated (the fact that Saturn had rings was not evident from the first telescopes); rather, it seemed to be elliptical in shape. Maelcote also reported that Clavius did not believe that the moon had mountains and craters as appeared through the telescope; its surface was smooth, and the uneven distribution of some substance within the moon merely created the illusion of an uneven surface. Galileo was invited to a banquet at the Roman College, on 18 May 1611, during which Maelcote pronounced a long formal eulogy, praising Galileo's work. Nevertheless, they were called to order by the Superior General of the Jesuits, Claudio Acquaviva, and obliged to uphold the traditional Aristotelian view of the universe, which Galileo's discoveries overturned. In 1611 Van Maelcote was back in Brussels, and from 1612 to 1614 he began a correspondence with Kepler, asking him in particular for his views on sunspots, following the publication of observations and commentary from both Christoph Scheiner and Galileo. Kepler agreed with Maelcote and Galileo that sunspots did not to behave like satellites. He returned to Rome, where he worked at the observatory of the Roman College until his death. Among his pupils was Orazio Grassi.
