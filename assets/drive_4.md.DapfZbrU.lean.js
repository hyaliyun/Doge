The training takes a minimum of nine years after the baccalaur√©at and concludes with a thesis. Upon successful presentation of their thesis, the medical student is awarded a dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sp√©cialis√©es (DES), based on their specialty. Certain high-achievers are awarded a dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sp√©cialis√©es compl√©mentaire (DESC). French medical training is one of the longest study paths in French higher education. It consists of both theoretical and practical training, with a gradual shift from theory at the beginning, to more practical aspects as training progresses. Medical students in France are traditionally known as carabin (riflemen) because the uniforms of military medical students resembled those of Italian riflemen. History 18th century Under the Ancien R√©gime, medicine was one of four faculties and generally only accessible through the Facult√© des Arts de Paris.See :fr:Facult√© des arts de Paris Teaching was mostly theoretical and involved lectures and readings from authorities. Practical components were gradually introduced in the 18th century. Until the French Revolution in 1789, doctors and surgeons were considered to be separate professions. Surgeons were known as barber surgeons. The university system was abolished in 1793 and replaced the following year by four medical schools in Paris, Montpellier, Bordeaux and Strasbourg. With the creation of the Imperial University in 1808, medical schools reopened their faculties and expanded across France. 19th century In the 19th century, new practical training schools were established in response to the rapid technical evolution of medicine and the mediocrity of university theoretical teaching. Acceptance into these practical training programs was restricted and highly sought after, as hospitals were synonymous with the elite. Medical students began to neglect their faculty examinations to prepare for these practical training entrance examinations and it was possible that upon completing their studies, they had not seen a single patient. 20th century Hospital reforms in 1958 merged the teaching functions of hospitals and universities, creating the position of University Professor and Hospital Practitioner (Professeur des universit√©s ‚Äì Praticien hospitalier, PUPH). One goal of the reforms was to reduce the number of graduates moving to private practice. Following the events of May 1968 protests in France, practical training entrance restrictions were removed: all medical students received practical training. Practical and theoretical training were finally combined into a single course, based on the 1958 ideal of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire. Following the Faure reform, medical colleges were integrated into universities as UER (from 1984, research and teaching centres \\"UFR\\"). This reform, along with the general population increase, led to a large surge in student numbers. In 1971 this resulted in a fixed number of training places in exams at the end of the first year of medical studies Until the 1990s, any doctor could become a specialist, either by taking the selective hospital residential pathway, or by taking the open access university pathway resulting in a lower-status certificate of specialized studies (THESE). The result was a two-speed medical system, divided between THESE graduates and ‚Äúformer interns‚Äù and ‚Äúformer senior hospital registrars‚Äù. A reform dropped the THESE medical certificates, returning to obligatory internships for the ‚Äúordinal qualification‚Äù specialists, through diplomas of specialized studies (OF) to supplement the diploma of Doctor of Medicine. Interns were required to spend part of their training in a non-academic ‚Äúperipheral hospital‚Äù belonging to a regional hospital centre (CHR). Recent changes Until 2004, future general practitioners did not sit the entrance exams for internships. Their second cycle was followed by two and a half year ‚Äúr√©sidanat‚Äù (three years for residents starting in or after 2001). Since 2004, a new reform has been applied: all medical students must pass the national classifying examination. The r√©sidanat was replaced with an internship in general medicine, helping to raise the status of general practice as a profession. From the 2010 academic year, the medical first year course is common with pharmacy, dentistry and midwifery, and medical studies fall under the process of Bologna. Organization Medical studies proceed in three cycles within a university having a unit of \\"formation\\" and medical research (sometimes a combination of medicine and pharmacology), associated with the one of the 29 university hospitals. Their total duration varies from nine years (general medicine) to 12 years (another speciality plus a sub-speciality). Description of medical studies in France First cycle of medical studies The first cycle of medical studies (in summary PCEM) takes two years, with a \\"concours\\" (competitive final exam) at the end of the first year selecting students admitted to continue medical or dental studies. National law specifies that the teaching of the first cycle and the first year of the second cycle must teach the following disciplines or disciplinary units: *physics, biophysics and image processing; *chemistry, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology; *anatomy, embryology, developmental and reproductive biology; *cytology, histology and pathological anatomy; *bacteriology, virology and parasitology; *fundamental hematology, immunology and oncology; *genetics and biotechnologies; *physiology and nutrition; *pharmacology and major classes of drugs; *epidemiology and biostatistics; *clinical and biological semiotics and medical imagery terminology; *first aid; *demography, health economics, and health systems. Teaching must also include foreign languages, epistemology, psychology, medical ethics and deontology. First year (until 2009) The first year academic cycle for medical students is common with dentistry and midwifery. Requirements during the first year include: physics, biophysics, chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, cellular biology, physiology, anatomy, histology, and embryology.Decree of March 18, 1992 relating to the organization of the first cycle and the first year of the second cycle of the medical studies, article 8 First year (as from 2010) The first year of the studies of health (PACES) is common to the medical studies, dental, pharmaceutical and midwife (sometimes also kinesitherapy). It is divided into two six-month periods. To be allowed to be registered in first year of the studies of health, the candidates must have one of the following qualifications: *a baccalaureate degree; *a diploma of \\"access to academic works\\"; *a French diploma or foreign diploma that can be considered equivalent to the baccalaureat pursuant to the national regulation; *a qualification or an achievement considered to be sufficient. As for any formation of system LMD, the year is divided in two six-month periods and ‚Äúunits of teaching‚Äù (EU) which are seen allotting a certain number of appropriations ECTS. In first half of the year, the lesson is common to all the fields.Decree of October 28, 2009, article 3 Tests are organized at the end of this one; the badly classified students can be reorientated in other university fields.Decree of October 28, 2009, article 5 With the second half-year, the students choose one or of the EU specific (S) to a field, in addition to the common formation. The students pass a competition at the end of the year leading to four classifications.Decree of October 28, 2009, article 8 The first year may only be repeated once. The grade is final if the student fails to pass twice. Second year The second year (in summary PCEM 2 or P2) begins with four weeks of obligatory and non-remunerated nurse placement.Decree of March 18, 1992 relating to the organization of the first cycle and the first year of the second cycle of the medical studies, article 15 It takes place during the holidays preceding the re-entry by the students admitted in second year of medicine or odontology. Lastly, a more medical matter, the semiotics, traditionally taught in third year, is at the present time transferred in second year in most universities, in order to improve the range of the clinical training courses of second and third years (usually called ‚Äútraining courses of checklist‚Äù or ‚Äútraining course of semiotics‚Äù). The first cycle of the medical studies follows a national plan, but the organization between the two years varies between the universities. In the same way, there exist three types of teaching: *linear teaching: each matter is taught separately (anatomy, histology, biophysics, etc.). This type of teaching does not require great coordination between the professors, but it can lead to great redundancies, even with contradictions. *integrated teaching: the students have modules gathering of the lesson of various disciplines around the same apparatus. For example, a module of neurosciences includes/understands the anatomy and the histology of the nervous system, sensory biophysics and the neurobiochimy. The student follows then a cardiopulmonary module, a digestive module, etc. *coeducation: certain aspects are presented in integrated teaching, others in linear teaching. Second cycle of medical studies The Medical college of the Montpellier, the oldest in the world In four years, the student receives a formal and practical training on the various pathologies segmented in modules: transverse modules (more or less interdisciplinary) or modules of body. These modules are the classifying official program of the national examination (see low), and include a numbered list of items which correspond either to pathologies, or with clinical or therapeutic situations. Third year of medicine The third year of medicine (in summary DCEM 1 or D1) is a year of transition where the student learns bioclinical sciences (pharmacology, bacteriology, virology, parasitology, etc.) which make the interface between fundamental sciences of the first cycle and lesson of pathology. They also learn how to carry out the anamn√®se (medical history) and the clinical examination of a patient at the time of their clinical training courses (called ‚Äútraining courses of checklists‚Äù, because the clinical examination linear and is structured, with boxes which one notches) associated with teaching with semiology. They start with the first modules. Certain universities start the hospital training courses in third year, the clinical training course of second year is then developed further. This year is particularly compatible with Erasmus exchanges. Externship The three following years constitute the ‚Äúexternat‚Äù. This term of everyday usage (which is a survival of the old contest of the externat removed following the demonstrations of 1968) does not officially exist. The official textsDecree n¬∞ 70-931 of 8 October 1970 and the internal texts of the CHU and the universities speak about ‚Äúhospital students‚Äù, because the students are remunerated by the hospital complex to which the university is attached. They are paid under limited time contract, attached to a social security office. The student, under the responsibility for an intern (nonofficial) or of a senior (senior registrar or hospital practitioner), learn how to recognize the various signs of a disease. The student at this stage does not have therapeutic responsibility, nor the right to prescribe. The student is however responsible for his acts (civil responsibility, which requires the subscription of a suitable insurance). The externat generally consists of four training courses per year, three months in each specialty service, chosen by grids at the beginning of each year or quarter, either by classification with the merit, or by alphabetical classification. The training courses consist of five mornings per week in the services. Certain training courses are obligatory from the statutory texts (pediatrics, obstetric gynaecology surgery, internal medicine and emergency medicine.), and can then integrate theoretical teaching (the student is t present at the hospital all the day). Conversely, certain services do not have the external ones, that depends on the agreements made with the university. Certain universities replaced the half-time (mornings) permanent by one full-time by alternation: the external ones are then present all the day but only 6 weeks over 3 months, the 6 remaining weeks being devoted to the lesson, the examinations, the preparation of the ECN‚Ä¶ During the externat, lecturing, is replaced more and more by directed work; the lectures are held in alternation with hospital training courses: this teaching is that of a true trade-guild, where the external one approaches by ‚Äúclinical cases‚Äù of true situations lived in the services. The external one must, during its three years of externat, to carry out 36 sessions of 12, 18, or 24 hours (according to the service and the day of the week), that is to say approximately a session per month, remunerated 26 euros rough. The remuneration of the training courses is as for it ‚Äúsymbolic system‚Äù (approximate remuneration: 122 euros per month in fourth year, 237 euros in fifth year, 265 euros in sixth year), but the external student has the statute of a paid worker and contributes to the paid mode of social security, and the pension fund. The pension fund complementary to external is the IRCANTEC, as it is the case for the interns and the hospital practitioners. The external ones, like any employee, have five weeks of paid vacations. Since 2004, the second cycle of the medical studies is sanctioned by a diploma (recognized in the European Union). Module 11 of the second cycle is the old certificate of clinical and therapeutic, essential synthesis to replace a general doctor. Third cycle of the medical studies Students able to reach the third cycle of medical studies (TCEM): *have completed the second cycle of the medical studies in France; *are amenable to the European state or Community, Swiss Confederation, Principality Member States of Andorra left to the agreement on European Economic Area, others that France, holders of a diploma of end of second cycle of the medical studies or of an equivalent title from one of these states. Classifying national tests Tests are organized for the candidates quoted above. According to its classification, the student chooses his university hospital (and thus the city) of assignment. This choice is carried out initially by Internet (phase of pre-choice and simulations), the final choice taking place during a ‚Äúamphitheatre of garrison‚Äù which brings together all the students by sections of classification. This procedure makes it possible the student to choose his station by being informed fully of the places available. The 11 existing fields in 2008 are, with the number of places available, or 5704 places on the whole: *General medicine: 3200 stations *Medical specialties: 885 stations *Surgical specialties: 550 stations *Psychiatry: 280 stations *Anaesthesia-reanimation: 260 stations *Pediatric: 200 stations *Gynecology-obstetrics: 155 stations *Public health: 60 stations *Medical biology: 40 stations *Occupational medicine: 54 stations *Medical gynaecology: 20 stations In 2005, a thousand places were not filled, certain students preferring to retry rather than to choose a speciality by default. Hospital training Defence of a thesis exercise. Although they have the statute of student and a supervision, an intern is an autonomous professional, since they can prescribe and carry out replacements in liberal cabinets (provided they have on validated a certain number of six-month periods, and obtained a ‚Äúlicence of replacement‚Äù from the departmental council of doctors). They act more than one initial track records that real studies (more especially as France is one of the rare countries to regard the interns as students). The boarding school of general medicine lasts three years, and is validated when the whole of the six months training courses necessary were carried out (diploma of specialized studies of general medicine) and it is followed of a thesis of exercise. It consists of six months training courses remunerated, associated with a hospital, but also associated with a general doctor, or of an extra-hospital structure of care. The student takes complete charge of their patients, but still under the responsibility of a ‚Äúsenior‚Äù (see supra): this includes clinical examination, regulation of complementary examinations and treatment. Teaching is primarily practical at this stage. The speciality training lasts four years or more. According to the speciality chosen, the student must take a minimum number of training courses remunerated in hospital services where its role is similar. The training is validated when the whole of the six months training courses necessary are carried out. It also requires a thesis of exercise generally relating to a topic of the speciality, generally in the last year of training . The speciality is sanctioned by the diploma of specialized studies, after defence of a report, which is sometimes confused with the thesis (thesis-memory, when this one is constant in the last year of training and relates to a subject of the speciality). The diploma of State of doctor of medicine is conferred after defence successfully thesis of exercise. Registrarship and assistantship For certain specialities, in particular surgery, additional training is required: either at a university clinic for two to four years, or a specialty assistantship for at least 1 year. The total training for these specialities therefore ranges from 12 to 15 years.

Biography Born in Hanover County, Virginia, \\"Father\\" David Rice was one of twelve children. Raised an Episcopalian but converting to Presbyterianism early in life, he was educated at the College of New Jersey at Princeton before undertaking further studies under John Todd, who had spent a great deal of time working with Samuel Davies among slaves. Rice would eventually follow in Todd and Davies' footsteps, working among slaves as an ordained Presbyterian minister in Virginia for over twenty years. After being forced out of Virginia, Rice joined the efforts of the Kentucky Abolition Society, serving also as a member of the 1792 Kentucky Constitutional Convention. It was as a member of the convention that Rice pleaded for a gradual emancipation initiative, giving an address entitled, Slavery Inconsistent with Justice and Good Policy. Ultimately, Rice saw the institution of slavery as not only unconstitutional, but as that which violated the most basic tenets of a natural, moral law. He believed, moreover, that it was especially the responsibility of the church to lead the cause for emancipation, expressing in 1799 in a letter to a friend that he wanted Christians to adopt \\"a rational plan for the gradual abolition of slavery; and do it under the influence of religion and conscience, without any regard for law\\" (Letter to James Blythe, 1799). In 1792, Rice served as an elected delegate to the Danville convention of 1792 where he pushed for the insertion of a clause in the state's first constitution that would have ended slavery. Rice, ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts towards abolition, served for much of the rest of his life in the Kentucky Abolition Society. Rice also helped to organize the Transylvania Presbytery, the Synod of Kentucky, and Transylvania Seminary, which became Transylvania University. Married to Mary Blair, the daughter of Presbyterian minister Samuel Blair, Rice was the father of twelve children. He died in Green County, Kentucky and is buried, alongside his wife, in the cemetery beside the Presbyterian church of Danville.

In 1959 he was posthumously awarded the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic. Will Lammert in his studio, 1956  Life   Germany (1892-1933)  Small Girl Sitting, 1913 Will Lammert was born in Hagen in 1892, the son of a machinist. He completed an apprenticeship as stucco, stone and wood sculptor and initially worked in the studios of the Russian sculptor Moissey Kogan. From 1911 he studied under Richard Luksch at the state Kunstgewerbeschule (school of applied arts) in Hamburg with a scholarship received on the recommendation of the art collector and founder of the Folkwang Museum, Karl Ernst Osthaus. Between 1912 and 1913 he spent time studying in Paris. There he was introduced by his former teacher Moissey Kogan to the sculptors Alexander Archipenko and Otto Freundlich. In 1914 he served as a soldier in the First World War, which he survived only after being seriously wounded. After the war he attended the College of Ceramics in H√∂hr, near Koblenz. In the years which followed he worked as a freelance sculptor in the town of his birth, as well as in D√ºsseldorf and Munich. He also exhibited works in conjunction with the group Das Junge Rheinland, whose members included Otto Dix and Max Ernst. In 1920 he married Hette Meyerbach. Mutter Erde, 1926 (destroyed) He moved to Essen in 1922, at the same time as the Folkwang Museum. In Essen, the state sponsored the foundation of the Margarethenh√∂he artists colony, where he occupied a studio. He created free- standing and architectural sculptures for buildings designed by the architects Edmund K√∂rner, Georg Metzendorf and Alfred Fischer. Along with his work as an artist he also ran a ceramics workshop. Both Hermann Blumenthal and Fritz Cremer began their artistic careers in his studio. In 1931, on the express recommendation of Max Liebermann, he received a scholarship from the Prussian Academy of Arts to study in Rome, and spent nine months at the Villa Massimo, working alongside the artists Werner Gilles, Ernst Wilhelm Nay and Hermann Blumenthal. In 1932 he joined the KPD, the German Communist Party.  Exile (1933-1951)  After the Nazis seized power Lammert was sought by the Gestapo on charges of high treason. In the early summer of 1933 he was forced to emigrate via the Netherlands to Paris, his Jewish wife Hette and their two sons Till and Ule following on. For periods he lived in the same building as the German writer Bodo Uhse and publisher Willi M√ºnzenberg. However, in 1934 Lammert was expelled from France and forced to flee again, this time to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, in Essen the press was stirring up hatred against the \\"Bolshevist artist with his close Jewish relations\\" and his \\"degenerate art\\". In the years which followed, almost all his works in Germany were destroyed by the Nazis. Memorial Tragende, 1959 Despite Lammert's greatest endeavours to find work as a sculptor, efforts which led him all the way to Siberia, there were few opportunities in the Soviet Union for him to practise his art. In 1938 he moved out of Moscow and into the suburb of Peredelkino, where was able to stay in Friedrich Wolf's dacha. He kept in close contact with other German emigres too, such as Johannes R. Becher, Adam Scharrer and Erich Weinert. He worked in various architect's offices and ran drawing groups together with another exiled artist, the painter Heinrich Vogeler. After the attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 he was expelled from the greater Moscow region, this time for being German, and arrived first of all in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, where he worked at a \\"kolkhoz\\" collective farm. A year later he was conscripted into the Labour Army and brought to Kazan. His exile did not end with the war, however, but was merely converted into a \\"Special Exile in Perpetuity.\\"  Return to Germany (1951-1957)  Lammert was only allowed to leave the Soviet Union in December 1951, finally able to return to Germany - to the then East Germany. Prior to this, other returnees, such as Else and Friedrich Wolf, had repeatedly called for him to be given an exit permit. One year later he was elected a full member of the German Academy of the Arts. He died in October 1957 in Berlin, still working on the pieces for the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp memorial site he had begun in 1954. Lammert was laid to rest in the Pankow III Cemetery in the Niedersch√∂nhausen district of Berlin where he had his studio. The National Prize of the German Democratic Republic was awarded to him posthumously in 1959. His wife used the money to set up the Will Lammert Prize, which was awarded by the German Academy of the Arts to numerous young sculptors between the years of 1962 to 1992.  Works  Weiblicher und m√§nnlicher Akt, 1931/32 (destroyed)  Early works  At the age of twenty-two Lammert was already getting attention at the Cologne Werkbund exhibition. Two of his golden figures were removed from the exhibition as being morally offensive. All that remains of them today is a fragment of Kopf einer goldenen Figur (Head of a Golden Figure) from 1914. The other, Kleine Sitzende I (Small Girl Sitting I), had been created prior to that, in 1913. After the First World War he was represented by the gallery owner Alfred Flechtheim, and participated in various exhibitions held by the group Das Junge Rheinland. He created portraits, large standing and reclining female figures and a variety of small-scale sculptures. At the same time he was taking public commissions, including for example Mutter Erde (Mother Earth) in 1926, for the entrance to the South-West Cemetery in Essen, and a memorial to the war dead in Marburg in the form of a lion (1926/27). He returned from his study visit in Italy with Weiblichen und m√§nnlichen Akt (Female and Male Figures) from 1932/33. After 1933, Lammert's early work was destroyed almost in its entirety in the run-up to the \\"Degenerate Art\\" campaign, on the instigation of its protagonist, Klaus Graf von Baudissin. This part of his output is known to us today primarily through the photographs of Albert Renger-Patzsch and Edgar Jen√©. Together with some few small sculptures, only the Kleine Liegende (Small Reclining Girl) of 1930, a fragment of Ruth Tobi (1919) and an early version of Karl Ernst Osthaus (1930) remain. Casts of these sculptures can be found today in some museums, including the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, and in the Smart Museum of Art in Chicago. We also have a series of drawings, made predominately during his study visits to France (1912/13) and Italy (1932). Memorial at the Jewish Cemetery  Later works  Lammert could only take up his art again after his return from eighteen years of exile. During this period he produced some portrait and memorial sculptures, including figures of Karl Marx (1953), Eduard von Winterstein (1954), Friedrich Wolf (1954), Wilhelm Pieck (1955), and Thomas M√ºntzer (1956), but in the main he dedicated himself to his composition of the memorial site at the former Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. After his death, some of Lammert's design was realised. The Tragende (Woman with Burden) from 1957 was enlarged and exhibited on a plinth in 1959. Thirteen sculptures originally intended for the foot of the stele have stood in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Berlin Mitte since 1985 to commemorate the Jewish victims of fascism. This group of figures (arrangement by Mark Lammert) was the first memorial in Berlin to the Jewish victims of the Nazis. A bust of Karl Marx, which was on display in the entrance to Berlin's Humboldt University, was removed at the time of German reunification.

Abd al-Malik was a very wealthy member of a noble Arab family. Spurred by critics who decried his lack of military victories, he led an expedition north to Pamplona, where a Frankish or Aquitanian party had taken over after the Battle of Poitiers. Despite his failure to capture the Basque fortress, he left troops to invest it, and decided to continue his way north across the Pyrenees, where he engaged the Basques in skirmishes and was eventually overcome, but managed to escape back to Al-Andalus. After being deposed and incarcerated by his successor Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj or possibly the governor of Ifriqiya (\\"was bound in chains\\"), he made his way back to prominence in 740, when he was appointed wali (governor) of Al-Andalus again after the former¬¥s natural death. This time he had to deal with serious Berber rebellion in North Africa, expanded now to Iberia too. The governor saw no option but to take the Syrian troops commanded by his adversary Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri as ally to quash the rebellion, so putting down the uprisings. However, ultimately Balj ibn Bishr had him arrested in Cordova for former grievances, put him to a horrible death in 742, and had him crucified on the outskirts of the city flanked by a similarly killed pig and dog on either side.

Early life and education  Originally destined for Holy orders, he was elaborating, while yet a student at the abbey school of St. Blasien and at the University of Dillingen, his plan of \\"gaining his livelihood by the dissemination of good books\\" as a \\"scholarly publisher\\".  Career  In 1801, during the turbulent period prior to the dissolution of the old German Empire, he began his career, at the instance of the Prince-Bishop (soon afterwards Prince Primate) Karl Theodor von Dalberg, in the capacity of \\"publisher to the princely episcopal court of Constance\\", at Meersburg on the Lake of Constance, the episcopal residence and seat of a seminary. Among his first publications, which were mainly of a theological and pedagogic character, were Wessenberg's Archiv f√ºr pastorale Conferenzen in den Landkapiteln des Bisthums Constanz (1802‚Äì27). In 1810 Herder transferred his business to Freiburg im Breisgau, where, in connection with the university, he gave a more comprehensive character to his publications and developed in new directions. One of his most important publications was Karl von Rotteck's Allgemeine Geschichte vom Anfang der historischen Kenntniss bis auf unsere Zeiten (9 volumes, 1812‚Äì27; the 15th edition being issued by another firm), which for more than a generation was \\"the gospel of the educated liberal middle classes\\". Being entrusted with the publication of the official war bulletin, the Teutsche Bl√§tter, by the royal and imperial authorities at headquarters as early as the end of 1813, Herder went to Paris with the allied armies in 1815 in Metternich's train as \\"Director of the Royal and Imperial Field Press\\". Subsequent to the conclusion of peace he founded an art institution for lithography, copperplate engraving, and modelling in terra cotta, in connexion with his publishing business. In the course of time upwards of three hundred pupils were turned out from this institution, while the sumptuous illustrations and maps that were issued mark an epoch in the history of this branch of technic‚Äìespecially the Heilige Schriften des Alten und Neuen Testamentes in 200 biblischen Kupfern (the Holy Writ of the Old and the New Testament in 200 biblical engravings), of which he reproduced numerous impressions by an original lithographic process, and Woerl's Atlas von Central-Europa in 60 Bl√§ttern (Atlas of Central Europe in 60 plates, 1830), which was the earliest employment of two-colour lithography. As late as 1870 this atlas rendered important service to the German army by reason of the map of France it contained. Although such great achievements won a European reputation for the house, the commercial profits derived therefrom were entirely disproportionate to the expenditure. Consequently, the condition of the house at Bartholom√§us Herder's death in 1839 was by no means a satisfactory one. His two sons, Karl Raphael Herder and Benjamin Herder succeeded him.

It took place in the region of Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy. The war was an episode in the over 300-year-long struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines. Modena won the Battle of Zappolino (the only battle of the war), and the bucket remains in Modena to this day. A common myth surrounding the War of the Bucket is that it was caused when the Modenese stole a bucket from a Bolognese well. However, this is mostly incorrect, as the bucket was (according to most accurate accounts) taken as a trophy by the Modenese after the war. The actual reason Bologna declared war on Modena is because Modena took the castle of Monteveglio from Bologna.  Background  From the late Middle Ages until the Renaissance, northern Italy was divided between factions supporting the rival political claims of the Holy Roman Emperor (\\"Ghibellines\\") and the Pope (\\"Guelphs\\"). Modena was Ghibelline; Bologna was Guelph. This political difference exacerbated the natural conflicts over border territories. In 1176, Frederick Barbarossa was defeated at the Battle of Legnano by the Lombard League, which supported Pope Alexander III. This was the start of a protracted period of conflict in Medieval Italy between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. From that year, the two opposing factions warred with each other. The town of Modena was a staunch supporter of the Holy Roman Empire and pledged to be a Ghibelline city. The northern city of Bologna was a Guelph city, and it was led by the Popes because they supported them. In 1296, Bologna seized Bazzano and Savigno from Modena. Pope Boniface VIII confirmed Bologna's title that same year. Azzo VIII d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara controlled Modena from 1293 to 1308 and confronted Bologna in part to bolster his lukewarm support among Modena's nobles. His elected successor, the Mantuan Passerino Bonacolsi, was an agent of Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria.Called \\"creatura di Ludovico il B√°varo\\" by Salvatore Muzzi, Compendio della storia di Bologna, 1875: ch. xxiv:104. He continued the Ghibelline war policy, with Parma and Reggio also under his power. Pope John XXII declared Bonacolsi a rebel against the Church, granting indulgences as befit a Crusader to any who could harm his person or his possessions.Messer Passerino Signor di Modena ribelle di Santa Chiesa, fosse lecito a ciascuna persona di poter danneggiarlo nell'avere e nella persona, dando a chiunque certa perdonanza,come se andassero oltra mare a ricuperare il Sepulcro (Scriptores Rerum Italicum vol. XVIII, column 338, quoted in Angelo Namias, Storia di Modena e dei paesi circostanti 1894, book v, c. XIX:220) In the months before the battle, border clashes intensified. In July, the Bolognese entered the Modenese territory and laid waste the fields in the section \\"between the canals\\", by fire and sword; in August a Bolognese rabble headed by their podest√† spent two weeks ravaging other lands of Modena.Griffoni, Matteo. \\"Conflictus Zapolini\\", in Memoriale historicum de rebus bononiensium, s. anno 1325. In September the Mantuans took their turn, and at the end of that month, the strategic Bolognese rocca of Monteveglio was betrayed to Modena by malcontents; two renegade castellans were decapitated.  Battle of Zappolino  Torre della Ghirlandina, the place where the bucket was kept. Bologna mustered an army of 32,000 men and marched against Modena in November. 7,000 Modenese under Bonacolsi met them at Zappolino, in Bolognese territory. The Bolognese was routed, fleeing into the walls of their city. About 2,000 men were killed on both sides. Some accounts state that the Modenese took a bucket from a well just outside a city gate as a trophy.  Aftermath  17th-century Italian poet Alessandro Tassoni composed the mock- heroic epic La secchia rapita on the events of the War of the Bucket. After the war, Ghibelline power had risen once again, but the wars were not over. In 1447, the Ghibellines encountered failures when the Ambrosian Republic was created and broke down. The wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines continued until 1529 when Charles I of Spain seized imperial power in Italy during the Italian Wars. Faced with the threat of a foreign invasion, the two factions made peace with one another. A wooden bucket is kept in the Torre della Ghirlandina in Modena to this day.Saul, David: War: From Ancient Egypt to Iraq  References  Wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines 1325 in Europe Conflicts in 1325 History of Modena History of Emilia-Romagna ","title":"War of the Bucket"},{"id":"30026906","text":"Alfred A.

The school offered high level education, where ancient philosophy and modern physical science were taught. With the establishment of the Athonite Academy the local monastic community took a leading role in the modern Greek Enlightenment during the 18th century. It aroused the hostility of more conservative circles and was shut down in 1821, but reopened in 1842. The Academy's function was also suspended in 1916‚Äì1930 and 1940‚Äì1953 due to the World Wars. Establishment The Athonias was founded in 1749 as a dependency of Vatopedi monastery with the initiative and the financial support of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Cyril V. The first building of the Athonias was erected on the top of a hill northeast of Vadopedi, where its imposing ruins still exist today. First director became the theologian Neophytos Kafsokalyvitis. Modern Greek Enlightenment Eugenios Voulgaris (1716-1806), scholar, theologian and figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment. In 1753, the Ecumenical Patriarchate entrusted Eugenios Voulgaris with the renewal of ecclesiastical education because it considered that he possessed the best available talents and offered him the post of the Academy's director. The time when Voulgaris became director of the Athonias (1753‚Äì1759), the modern Greek Enlightenment movement was exerting a productive influence throughout the entire monastic community of Mount Athos. The teaching methods of Voulgaris for the revival and upgrading of learning within the Orthodox Church envisaged a substantial training in classic studies combined with an exposure to modern European philosophy, including works of Ren√© Descartes, Gottfried Leibniz, Christian Wolff and John Locke. This curriculum could only be taught in a monastic environment for as long as Voulgaris enjoyed the full and unswerving support of the highest powers inside the church. When Cyril V fell from the patriarchal throne conservative circles of Mount Athos were encouraged to come out openly against the progressive educational methods of Voulgaris. The latter, feeling abandoned, resigned in 1758/9 and was replaced by Nikolaos Zerzoulis, who was known as one of the first proponents of Newtonian science in Greek education. However, by the end of the 18th century the rate of literacy in Mount Athos had declined and the traditional local circles became hostile towards the progressive teaching in the Athonias. 19th century ‚Äì present The Athonias was closed in 1821 when the Greek War of Independence broke out and reopened in 1845 in Karyes, the administrative center of Mount Athos. It was financially supported by the monasteries and the monks of the region. The Academy's function was also suspended in 1916‚Äì1930 and 1940‚Äì1953 due to World War I and World War II.

He published translations into English of a number of books and articles concerning the Orthodox faith and services.  Biography  Nicholas Bjerring was born in 1831 in Vejle, Denmark, where his father was an official. Bjerring was educated in Vejle and studied philosophy and theology in the University of Breslau. He was active in the Roman Catholic schools in Europe and performed missionary work in Lapland. In 1868, he came to the United States to be a teacher at St. Alphonsus in Baltimore, Maryland. It has been mistakenly thought that he was a professor of philosophy and history at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, but he never actually taught at that seminary. He married while still a Roman Catholic and was the father of three children when he was received into the Orthodox Church. Bjerring left the Roman Catholic Church in 1870 in protest of the adoption of the dogma of papal infallibility, stating his position on a letter of January 24, 1870 to Pope Pius IX. Nicholas Bjerring had become interested in Orthodox Christianity through the scholarly journal L'Union Chr√©tienne. After careful consideration, in early 1870 he petitioned the Holy Synod to be received into the Orthodox Church. Receiving his letter, the Synod requested him to appear in person before them. On May 3, 1870, he was received into the Orthodox Church in ceremonies in the chapel of the St. Petersburg Academy. He was then ordained to the diaconate on May 6 and to the priesthood on May 9 by Metropolitan Isodore (Nikolsky) of St. Petersburg and Novgorod. Bjerring served his first liturgy in German on May 17 in the academy chapel. He was then directed to establish a church in New York City. In the meantime, in 1864, Rev. Dr. John Young Freeman had visited Metropolitan Philaret Drozdov of Moscow on behalf of the Russo-Greek Committee of the Protestant Episcopal Church. This meeting dealt with establishment of an Orthodox center in the northeastern United States which could provide a place for Orthodox rites to be experienced in the proper setting. The assignment of Fr. Nicholas to New York was fortuitous and appeared to have supported Rev. Freeman‚Äôs request. Bjerring served the chapel of the Holy Trinity in New York until 1883, when funding was removed from the mission and he was requested to return to Russia to teach at St. Petersburg Academy. Rather than accept such a prestigious offer, Bjerring desired to remain in America and began exploring where to transfer his ecclesiastical affiliation. In 1883, he decided to join the Presbyterian Church and was subsequently received as a pastor (though after some debate). Although little is known about this period of his life, he engaged in social ministry to Germans living in tenement housing (an act consistent with work he had begun amongst Russians in 1881). The Presbyterian Church would later remove the funding from his mission and he returned to the Roman Catholic Church in 1899. Regardless, in 1899 and early 1900 he published articles in Catholic World in which he clearly cites religious convictions for returning to the Roman Catholic Church and discussed the labor question. He died in September 1900 as a Roman Catholic layman.

Falklands Islands Although both countries were mostly on good terms, Venezuela expressed its support to its sister nation of Argentina over the British-Argentine Falklands Islands dispute that eventually led to the Falklands War between the UK and Argentina in 1982. UK support for change of president As of August 2017, the British Government advised against 'all but essential travel' to Venezuela, and withdrew dependents of British Embassy staff, due to the 'ongoing unrest and instability', citing the protests and crime in the country. In January 2019 during a visit to the United States, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt stated that \\"Nicol√°s Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela\\" and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid√≥ should become President of Venezuela. On 4 February 2019, Hunt stated that the UK officially recognised Guaid√≥ as President. However the United Kingdom continued to maintain consular and diplomatic relations with the Maduro controlled government, suggesting some ambiguity. This policy is a partial exception to the UK's long held policy of recognising states rather than specific governments. In Autumn 2019 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office created the 'Venezuela Reconstruction Unit' led by John Saville, formerly UK ambassador to Venezuela, to coordinate a UK effort to support Venezuela. After this became public in May 2020, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza summoned the UK‚Äôs Charge d'Affaires \\"to present a formal protest and demand explanations\\", and in a Twitter post wrote \\"We demand that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland withdraw from Washington's coup plans and from any destabilizing initiative\\". Venezuela characterised the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit as an attempt to give future preferred status to British companies in Venezuela. Control of gold in London Since 2018, the Bank of England has delayed releasing 31 tonnes of Venezuelan gold to the Maduro government. UK foreign office minister Alan Duncan said in January 2019 that while the disposition of the gold was a Bank of England decision, \\"they will take into account there are now a large number of countries across the world questioning the legitimacy of Nicol√°s Maduro and recognising that of Juan Guaid√≥.\\". On 14 May 2020, the Central Bank of Venezuela filed a legal action against the Bank of England, to force Britain to release the ‚Ç¨930m worth of gold to the United Nations Development Programme to buy healthcare equipment, medicine, and food for the COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela. Guaid√≥ has appointed a parallel Venezuelan central bank board of directors, so the court will have to decide which board of directors legally controls the gold. In July 2020 the High Court ruled that Guaido was interim president, but the Court of Appeal ruled in October 2020 that the British Foreign Secretary's statement on recognition was ambiguous, clarified the legal importance of the distinction between de jure president and de facto president, and returned the case to the High Court for reconsideration.

The minder had a non-speaking part in the show, and when a female contestant's statement \\"It leaves a bad taste in my mouth\\" prompted Courtney to ad-lib, \\"That's spunk\\" he received a furious dressing down from Sadowitz.

An ecotype of this snail introduced from further south has become invasive in Laizhou Bay, with population densities of over 160 snails per square meter.  Description  The shell is bullate, fairly thick, white, spirally striate, with a well- developed periostracum. There is no spire and no umbilicus. The columella is smooth and simple. The aperture extends for the whole length of the shell, and is narrower above than below. The apertural lip extends upwards beyond the apex of the shell. The height of the shell is 8 mm and the width of the shell is 6 mm.Pilsbry H. A. (1895). Manual of Conchology, structural and systematic, with illustrations of the species. Polyplacophora, (Chitons.)

The cephalic disc is large and slipper-shaped, feebly emarginate on the dorsal surface behind and with a narrow free margin. The cephalic disc, which is rounded in front, occupies about half of the whole bulk in a contracted state. The edge of the mantle is smooth, without processes of any kind. It, the edge of the mantle (which is slightly retroverted over that of the shell), the foot and the epipodia are (in alcohol) of a pale green colour. The greater part of the mantle, however, under the shell is colourless and transparent. The foot is short, truncate before and behind, and with the epipodia (in much contracted specimens) apparently not well developed. The eyes are minute and quite invisible on the surface. The eyespots are deeply sunk in the tissues. The gill, which is situated far back on the right side, is large and consists of a considerable number of fleshly lobes. Drawing of one row of teeth in the radula of Bullacta exarata. C - central tooth, L - lateral tooth, 1-12 - marginal teeth. Digestive system: The mouth is a minute transverse slit in the front of the cephalic disc. The jawss are large, but imperfectly cornified. The jaws are angular and minutely, irregularly serrate. They are composed of numerous minute prismatic rods. On the margin many of these rods are transverse and project slightly, forming a minute serration. The radular sack is small. The radula has the formula 12.1.1.1.12. The central tooth is a simple flat triangular plate. The single lateral tooth is well differentiated from the marginal teeth, from which it is separated by a considerable space, and points in the opposite direction. The marginal teeth are slender, elongate, curved rod-like bodies somewhat expanded at the base. They decrease in size gradually from the second or third marginal, which is slightly larger than the first, outwards. There is a long, narrow, thin-walled oesophagus with a single coil; before entering the muscular gizzard it is considerably dilated. A longitudinal strand of muscular tissue runs up its dorsal surface for a short distance from the gizzard. The gizzard is large and it contains three horn-shaped, transversely ridged chitinous plates arranged in a triangle. It is maintained in position by a stout transverse muscle on either side, the proximal end of the muscle being fixed to a constriction in the outer wall of the gizzard. The gizzard contains three large, stout chitinous bodies, which are smooth and heart-shaped at their base on its external surface. Internally they are convex, curved and tapering, with stout, somewhat serrate reversed V-shaped transverse ridges. The intestine after leaving the gizzard bears three small, almost spherical, diverticula, one behind the base of each of the chitinous plates. The wall of the intestine is thin and its structure simple; it has a single closely adpressed bend. Drawing of penis- sack of Bullacta exarata. Drawing of penis extracted from the sack. stylet extracted from the penis. Reproductive system: The male intromittent organ is provided with an elongate chitinous stylet. The penis is enclosed in an oval sack. When extracted therefrom it is an almost cylindrical organ with two coils, or constrictions, in its course, bluntly pointed at the apex and much contracted proximally. Its walls are highly muscular, but all the muscles are longitudinal and there is no circular muscular bulb. Its outstanding feature is the presence of a long, slender, sharply pointed, scimitar-shaped, black, horny stylet with a saddle-shaped base which is sometimes prolonged into a long, sharply pointed spur. In some individuals, however, the spur is completely absent. The female genitalia include a well-developed uterus but no spermatheca. The hermaphrodite gland is small in immature specimen. Nervous system: The central nervous system closely resembles that of Aliculastrum cylindricum.  Ecology  The habitat for this species includes intertidal flats, including the supratidal zone and subtidal zone. Bullacta exarata is a hermaphroditic species. Its life cycle has been extensively studied: * Vitellogenesis (Ying & Yang, 2001) Ying X. P & Yang W. X. (2001). \\"Mitochondrial changes during vitellogenesis in oocytes of Bullacta exarata\\".

She is also known for her work exploring male and female gender roles, different guises and personas and for her soft fabric environments where she often appears as the central element.A History of Installation Art and the Development of New Art Forms, Faye Ran. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., New York, 2009. . Work and themes Early works Colette's first performance/photo work took place in 1970 when she had herself photographed as \\"Liberty Leading the People\\" after Delacroix. She presented this work to the public in 1972. In an installation, composed of white parachute silk, embedded lighting, [lightboxes, lavender-painted floors inscribed with her personal code and audios, she posed as Libert√©. This tableau vivant could also be viewed from the windows of the gallery. Fred McDarrah photographed it for The Village Voice in January 1973. By 1973 Colette had completed the opus of her work: With white silk ruched parachute silk and embedded lighting and no visible furniture she turned her living space into a \\"Minimal Baroque\\" sculpture and included herself as part of it. The same year, Stefonatty Gallery NYC, which had just opened its doors, offered her a solo show. The painter Malcolm Morley, and the conceptual artists Les levine, Dennis Oppenheim, Vito Acconci, Bill Beckley and Roger Welch also exhibited at Stefonatty. In her first solo show there, sixteen larger-than-life, three-dimensional paintings resembling her, titled \\"the Sandwomen\\" were showcased. The gallery office was transformed into a dreamlike environment, in the style of her living space. In this room she posed still every day for the duration of the exhibition as the \\"Sleeping Gypsy\\" after Henri Rousseau and titled it \\"The Transformation of the Sleepy Gypsy without the Lion\\". In 1974, Colette posed as Persephone in \\"Persephone's Bedroom\\" in a billowing parachute dress for the Norton Museum, in Miami, Florida. The environment created for that theme was made up with what became her trademark, muted treated rushed soft fabrics, which became her trademark. In this space, she embedded mirrors into the fabric walls. Her street works were exhibited in an adjacent room. Street art In the early 1970s she began creating large street paintings anonymously and soon became known when her identity was discovered by Willoughby Sharp of Avalanche magazine. In 1973, Al Hansen, the late Fluxus artist, interviewed her in a video tape \\"The Ear\\" which records artist painting a huge ear at the Spring Street intersection in SoHo, while Arnold Newman was shooting her for Verizon magazine. Colette painted the streets during early morning hours not only to not be identified but also in also to avoid being arrested by the police. One of her better-known street works is \\"The Lips\\". In 1974 she painted huge lips on the intersection of West 57th Street, which could be seen from above the windows of her gallery during her exhibition. During her show at the Norton Museum also in 1974, she executed a very long street work \\"It was here\\" which included the federal highway in front of the museum. On the morning of Friday 13 December 1974, during an eclipse, Colette completed painting Aristotle text on the pavements. Dressed in a pink satin slip, she ended the work with a sleeping performance on the steps of the museum. It did not take long for the police to arrive and interrupt. That summer, she was invited by Art Tape Florence to do two videos of street art performances: \\"There Is No Place Like Home\\" and \\"L'incident a la place st Unnunziata\\". Her love partner at the time, furniture designer Dakota Jackson, assisted her and performed in both street works. Colette's Early Street Works and Window Works were presented the Academy of Arts, Berlin for the React feminism exhibition in 2008http://www.adk.de/reactfeminism/raf_ausstellung.htm and in the traveling show \\"React Feminism II\\" which opened October 7, 2011 in Centro Cultural Montehermoso, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. The show traveled, with its last presentation in July 2013 in Berlin. Art and fashion: 1970s In 1975 Colette was asked to participate in \\"Fashion as Fantasy\\" at Rizzoli's bookstore. In this fashion/art event (co-curated by Frederico Suro), a larger- than-life perforated light box of Colette was featured, while throughout the store and its windows Colette performed as \\"Ragdoll\\" with veiled breasts, a Victorian corset, bloomers and boots. Images of her \\"look\\" and her habit of wearing and incorporating undergarments began to appear not only in art publications, but also in fashion and popular press: Art News, Women's Wear Daily, and Daily News. References to Colette's look worn in art and life, are still made as having inspired a young Madonna and later Lady Gaga. During this time Colette begun to be referred to as a \\"walking performance\\". In 1975 she appeared in many group shows. For the Idea Warehouse in NYC she staged a sleeping tableau \\"If it takes forever, I will wait for you\\" using slide projections and musak. Another show, \\"Lives\\", also took place downtown in the Fine Arts Building\\" and was curated by Jeffrey Deitch. In these shows her work was placed with some of the same artists she had exhibited before: Dennis Oppenheim, Roger Welch, Lynda Benglis, Hannah Wilke, Vito Acconci, Bill Beckley, Laurie Anderson, Charlemagne Palestine, Phil Glass, Willoughby Sharp, and Carolee Schneeman. Later that year at Clocktower she presented \\"The Dream Series\\", an exhibition curated by Alanna Heiss. In a large square room, \\"Real Dream\\", made of rushed pink satin, embedded lighting and audios, Colette slept nude at its center every day for the duration of the exhibition. This show was a topic of Jeffrey Deitch interview with Colette for WPS1 art radio in 2009.http://www.collectcolette.com/pics/mp3/sbarccohp_deitch.mp3 For the opening of \\"PS 1\\", as part of the \\"Rooms\\" exhibition in 1976, she transformed the attic with brown satins and tulle, embedded lighting, props dipped in resin and audios. The work was titled \\"David' Wraith\\"and she posed as Marat. In 1977, Colette represented the US in the Paris Bienale, with \\"Let them eat Cake\\" reclining in a lavender and salmon color boudoir. She also constructed \\"Clearance Sale\\" in the bedroom of Nancy Gillesby Delaage Gallery in Paris. Two other rooms were occupied with Annette Messager's and Laurie Anderson's work. A few weeks later, she was featured in the performance section of the Cologne Art Fair with other artists: Jack Smith, Marina Abramoviƒá, Jurgen Klauke, Laurie Anderson and Michel Butta. She lived for six days in her piece \\"Ancorra Tu\\" which resembled her living environment in New York City with her personal belongings and art works, and the public could see her room through a light veil. For the opening of her street art show \\"It reappears\\" at the Eugenia Cucalon gallery which also took place in 1977 she slept in a light blue satin box as \\"Femme Fatale\\" which could be seen from the streets and the windows of the gallery. Also exhibited were light boxes referring to famous artists she either admired or knew. ex; \\"Dennis's chair\\" (referring to a chair from his work 'the lecture' a gift to the artist; she draped in blue satin and embedded with light). Another work in the show was: \\"Sleeping on a Carl Andre\\": a photograph of herself (in a light box) - sleeping on one of his large minimal sculpture nude as it were a pedestal for herself. In December 1977, at the Museum of Modern Art she performed Camille II. Adjacent to her performance were installed fragments of Camille I, (these works now are part of the permanent Brooklyn Museum collection). Another version of Camille was presented in Washington, D.C. at the Polo Gallery. Also on view was her video tape of the performance in the \\"Downtown NY\\" show held in Berlin 1976 at the Akademie der K√ºnste, curated by Renee Block. In her performance \\"Memory of Ophelia and all those who died of Love and Madness\\" 1976, she laid in an exotic silk and satin room (with sand color, and blue fabric satins and rags), reclining nude next to another female Tabea Blumenschein.to the sound of echoes of her voice with sound of Hamlet's soliloquy \\"To be or not to be\\". Justine of the Colette is Dead Co (Reverse Pop Series) 1978-82 In 1978 Colette staged a mock death in an installation/performance at the Downtown Whitney titled \\"The Last Stitch\\" part of the \\"Out of the House\\" exhibition. She performed her resurrection at PS1 now part of MOMA a few days later as \\"Justine and the Victorian Punks\\" (the first in a series of living personas). Justine armed with Colette's vision posed as a recording star, fashion designer, inventor & conceptualizer of products - \\"The Beautiful Dreamer\\" (Colette) doll, perfume, beautiful dreamer bed, fashions, lps etc... And was the head of the Colette's estate. In 1978 Fiorucci invited her to do an exhibition, which included a sleeping installation performance in the windows of the West 59th Street store in NYC. Soon after, Fiorucci began using live models in the store and Colette's \\"Victorian Punk Look\\" became part of the 1980s NYC \\"Downtown New Wave\\" world. In 1979 Emilio Fiorucci commissioned her to create a line of clothes for the store. Her \\"Deadly Feminine Line\\" was showcased in the windows of the boutique and Colette staged a fashion art performance at the Mudd Club in celebration. During that year, Banco gallery in Brescia, Italy presented \\"Les actions de Justine\\"; a mostly blue satin installation with slide projections. She posed as \\"the Piet√†\\" in it for its opening. In the second room of the gallery, her record album covers, collages embedded in satin, which recorded her life as \\"Justine\\" were exhibited. In 1979 in a store window art exhibition curated by Peter Pakesh held in department stores over the city of Graz, Austria. In her window at K&O;, Justine of the Colette is dead Co. posed as a recording star in a white satin environment in her \\"Victorian Look\\" promoting her conceptual \\"beautiful Dreamer Lp\\" (not yet released). Her music played outside on the streets. Concurrently she transformed one of the large mirror rooms of the Neue Gallery for the exhibition \\"Masculin Feminin\\" (curated by Klaus Honnef) as Justine's Disco Punk Church Club. This term has currently surfaced in the music industry to describe current music. In an installation at Victoria Falls, a vintage boutique on Spring St. NYC, she presented her multimedia spectacle \\"Ripping myself Off\\". Clothes she designed, inspired by her image, which had filtered into the commercial world, were displayed inside the store. In its windows she posed as Joan of Arc, in a work entitled \\"Paranoia is heightened awareness\\". For its opening a fashion show was staged including the song \\"Ripping Myself Off\\" she co-wrote with Albert Crabtree. During this period nightclubs also became a venue for reaching younger audiences and an ideal setting for her multimedia spectacles - Colette was a regular and performed and exhibited in most of them: Mudd Club, The Underground, Studio 54. Her close association with Rudolf the German nightclub impresario who created Danceteria influenced her to do more nightclub spectacles. Her first installation there, was \\"Fuck Art Lets Dance\\" for the opening of the club in May 1980. This led to other young artists showcasing their art there. Colette also appeared in the day and the Night life in her \\"beautiful dreamer\\" uniforms inspired by the walls of her legendary environment as a living sculpture: an experiment in walking architecture. The fashion photographer Chris Von Hohenberg assisted her in recording her wearing these uniforms for her series of photo works. In 1981, she joined Niki Carson's La Rocka Modelling agency for unusual models, and staged a multimedia performance in his club Armegedon. By 1984, art in nightclubs was the vogue. The Palladium showcased not only her work but also those of Keith Herring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francesco Clemente and Julian Schnabel. In 1981 she broke record attendance in three consecutive museums shows: her retrospective - \\"Colette - 10 Years of Work\\" at the Kunstverein Munster (with a monograph published by Politi); \\"Other Realities\\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston, Texas (other artists that participated with individual openings weeks apart were Robert Wilson, Joan Jonas, Vito Acconci, and Eleonor Antin); and in the show Persona at the New Museum with the Mr. Apology, Lynn Hershmann and Eleanor Antin. Other public installation/performances putting closure to a period before Colette's departure for Berlin, were Justine's thrift shop on West Broadway (her beautiful dreamer uniforms and gowns were offered for sale to the public with a window work of that theme), and \\"Art on Stage\\" a multimedia event held at Danceteria. Mata Hari and the Stolen Potatoes: Berlin (1984-86) In 1984 she received the DAAD one year grant from city of Berlin. Prior to her departure she dismantled her \\"living environment\\" - a continuously evolving work of art. The late Leo Castelli was involved in placing this inner sculpture in a well known museum. This fell through, and the environment was dismantled in 1982. The environment was dismantled and placed in storage. Its actual wall fragments (made up of rushed salmon colored satin and white silk parachute material), lightboxes, draped lamps and other furniture as well as her \\"beautiful dreamer\\" uniforms have been exhibited over the years: The living installation has never been shown in a public space in its entirety and is currently still in search of a permanent home.http://www.artslant.com/ny/events/show/177409-night-scented-stock In Berlin she took on a new persona, \\"Mata Hari\\" and the Stolen Potatoes. She exhibited her new works and paintings at the Silvia Menzel gallery and Kunstlerhaus Bethanien in Berlin, and the Danny Keller gallery in Munich. In 1985 she created sets and costumes for the Berlin Opera production of Ravel's L'heure espagnole directed by Knutt Summers, and participated with a video room installation in the Venice Biennale for the Italian pavilion. In 1985 during her stay in Berlin, Three monographs were published on her work: 1.\\"From Silk To Marble\\" - a series of photographs of Colette transforming herself with a white sheet into sculptures of different periods of history, thus documented the style and fashion of that period.were exhibited with an opening performance re-enacting the images live. K√ºnstlerhaus Bethanien (with the Torkil Gudnason) helped her document the images right before her departure to Berlin. 2.\\"Colette new works and paintings\\" - 85 for her solo show at the Berlin Kunstverein (published by Kammerer & Unverzagt) and 3.\\"Art on Stage\\", distributed by the Stadtische Galerie Nordon (Germany). Colette presented a multimedia installation / performance with her works on the stage of its auditorium. Its co-publisher was Daniel Newburg Gallery (New York Gallery which represented her work during that period). Countess Reichenbach - 1986-91 Beginning 1986 Colette moved to Munich, while still maintaining her Pearl St. atelier in New York City. Bavaria became new source of inspiration and a new persona \\"The Countess Reinchenbach\\". During this time she created staged photographs from her private performances in the Ludwig Castles, the \\"Dial C for Scandal\\" series, \\"The Secret lives of Count and Countess Reichenbach\\", the \\"Light Figures\\", which aimed to blend fantasy and reality, art and life (she accidentally lived on Reichenbach Strasse. Her boyfriend's mother was Countess Reichenbach). During this period, Colette's installations with her art and fashion designs were showcased in the windows of Munich's most prominent department stores: Loden Frey and Ludwig Beck (where her couture wedding dresses were available). At the beginning of her stay there May 1986 she was awarded a studio at Lothringstrasse, which she immediately turned into an environment. In Munich her works were shown at the Dany Keller Gallery and in Berlin where she often commuted to exhibit her works. There, Nathan Federowsky gallery presented \\"Colette and the Russians\\", which included Colettesized Russian icons. Her haute couture clothes of ruched and crinkled satin and other fabrics were on view at the Boutique DurBruch. A special presentation was held there with models staged inside the store wearing Colette's one of a kind creations. In NYC, the Gallery of Wearable Art carried her evening one of a kind couture and commissioned her to do a window. During her short return to New York in 1986, before going to Munich she had a solo exhibition at Daniel Newburg gallery \\"Autobiographs\\" with an after-opening celebration held with a special installation at Area where the impersonator \\"Zet \\"posed in a Colette bed. In a group show, Logosimmi, curated by Alan Jones, Daniel Newburg was introduced to Colette's work and gave her a solo show \\"Autobiographs\\" the same year. In 1987, in another solo show \\"An exhibition for dolls\\" was presented there. A group of upcoming artists; Richard Prince, Jeff Koons, Sinclair Cemin, Wolfgang Stahle, Taro Suzuki and Frank Shroeder also were exhibited at Daniel Newburg gallery. In 1988 works from her \\"Bavarian Adventure\\", which included, tall light sculptures, large scale altered photographs, objects and collages were exhibited in a solo exhibition at the Frauen Museum in Bonn with a catalogue published by Dumont Verlag in Cologne. The House of Olympia: 1990s In 1990 in an exhibition in Munich at Carol Johnssen Gallery \\"Visits to the Normal World\\" Colette began to use the name Olympia. It was the first of seven solo shows at that gallery. In 1991 she presented her Colettesized commissioned portraits in \\"The Aristocrats\\"; among the portraits of local aristocrats were Leslie and Dedlef Von Waggonheim, Kiki and Eckbert Von Buehlen & Urbach; and an installation featuring \\"The Unnunciation\\". The subject Colette as \\"the Countess Reichenbach\\" (with her then boyfriend actor Misha Tregor (\\"Count Reichenbach\\") a regular at the Kammerspiele theater in Munich). In 1991 By 1992 Colette returned to New York and made it once again her primary residence, while continuing to travel and exhibit abroad, especially to Munich and Berlin. During that time her art was represented by the Dorsky Gallery where she exhibited new works from the Bavarian adventure and \\"the figures come to life\\". In 1990 the Rempire Gallery in SoHo presented \\"Through the Looking glass\\" and \\"Love in ruins /the artist and her Muse\\"_ The works from \\"The secret lives of Count and Countess Reichenbach\\" were featured among other works referring to other muses, friends, and well-known personages: a portrait of Frida Kahlo and a large light box \\"the bath\\" with a young Jeff Koons- (made from a still image of her video \\"Justine & the Boys\\"). The Persona Olympia\\" emerged in 1990 in Munich when she was beginning the process of returning to New York permanently. In 1991, her work was exhibited with Joseph Beuys, John Armedledder in the group show \\"The Invisible Body\\" curated by Alan Jones at the Rempire Gallery in NYC. Once she re-established herself in New York (1992), she named her New York Downtown atelier \\"The House of Olympia\\". The work of that decade was inspired by the eighteenth century. Like all her personas, Olympia developed a philosophy based on a message as well as a \\"look\\". The rules of the House of Olympia: # No money - no art # Retrieving my history. Preservation of earlier works and fabrication of ideas conceived as far back as the seventies. e.g. the Colette Mannequin Sculpture. # Self appropriation - recycling of images of myself from earlier works into mixed media new works. # Colettesizing: thus transforming into my style selected masterpieces of the eighteenth century such as Boucher, Fragonard, Watteau and exhibiting them amidst images of myself inspired by that period and in this way synchronizing them. # Bringing back the return of chivalry and good manners, innocence and romance. # Art that elevates the spirit and celebrates life. # Matches the furniture and promotes the return of the commissioned portrait and the art patron. In 1993, an exhibition at LOK gallery in the Meatpacking District titled \\"The Ruins and Rise of the House of Olympia\\" Colette presented her new works. A Colette mannequin replaced her presence. Through the nineties Colette continued to seek various settings and stages in which to exhibit. Eighteenth century salon inspired and \\"Colettesized\\"artworks were installed in environments created for them:- ex;\\" Colette goes Uptown \\"Uptown Downtown gallery\\" (1995), Eugenia Cucalon (1996) \\"the House of Olympia persists its way unto reality \\", \\"Me Myself and I\\", Carol Johnssen, Munich. At the Lowen Palais part of the Starke Foundation in Berlin, she was given her own \\"Colette Salon\\". There she periodically appeared and entertained in eighteenth century style, and presented her latest comissined portraits and works of art work of her choice. In 1997 the \\"Salon de la Refusee\\" at the Gerswirn Hotel was viewed both by an art audience as well as random passers- by. Through its windows a Colette mannequin sculpture was installed in the gallery space, along with Colette's new works and objects, that incorporated her life's costumes. Simultaneously, In a show titled Art?fashion, another Colette mannequin sculpture dressed in one of her rushed gowns worn in live performances during her\\"Nightclubbing\\"days of the early 1980s was featured at the downtown Guggenheim Museum. Nightclubs continued to be a place of celebration after her opening exhibitions as well as a and showcase for her art. ex; The Palladium 1992, Life Club in 1997 after the opening of Le Salon de La Refusee, The Limelight in 1990, and in 1998 a multimedia production with art work, video installations, and a tableau appearance for the opening to songs co-written with Jacob Engel. 1990& 1998-., Club U.S.A \\"to celebrate chivalry and good manners\\". During her House of Olympia period, the Guggenheim Museum in 1992 acquired and later exhibited a large scale box sculpture from the Justine - \\"Reverse Pop Series \\" (1978) with LPs and other personal items. In 1993, another of her life-size light boxes from the series \\"Major works form the estate\\" (1980) which was exhibited at the Montreal Museum of Art (1980) and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston, Texas, was acquired and exhibited at the MOCA. In 1993 another large work from that series was placed in museum of FIU's permanent collection in Miami, Florida. 1993, Newport Harbor Museum, Los Angeles, acquired and exhibited a large wall fragment from her living environment(1982. In 1995 one of her large constructed photographs from \\"Real I Dream\\" (1975) became part of the Ludwig Museumin Cologne collection, and also exhibited in \\"The Nude Photograph\\". In 1999 \\"Poses\\", a retrospective of her constructed and stage photo/performance works, (beginning with the early seventies till 99) was held at the KIM Foster Show in Chelsea. A monograph \\"The Essence of Olympia\\" dedicated to that persona and its creations was published by \\"the Institut\\" (a gallery in Berlin Mitte) where she had a solo exhibition, and the Carol Johnssen gallery in Munich in 1997. Maison Lumiere-2001/renamed Laboratoire Lumiere 2010 Colette begun using the name \\"Lumiere\\" publicly following the September 11 attacks after she was allowed to reenter her Lower Manhattan atelier, which had been covered with white dust from the nearby catastrophe. Her introduction to her new paintings as \\"Lumiere\\" was in NY at Egizio's Projects in January 2002. Later that year, more works by Lumiere were featured in the 3rd Montreal Biennale curated by Claude Gosselin - \\"The New Me\\" in 2002. Inside the Mexican Consulate gallery space (loaned to the biennale for the duration of the show), Colette reinstalled her downtown atelier now called \\"Maison Lumiere\\". Located in the center of the city and with large ground floor windows, the space was intentionally designed to give the appearance, at first glance,of a high- profile fashion boutique, a home, or a showroom. For its audios the theme song \\"A la Maison de la lumiere \\" was co-written with Jacob Engel. Other shows and highlights of that period concentrated on reaching larger audiences and Colette began using the label \\"C.I.A. - Colette Institute of Art\\" and its no 1. Moto - \\"Fight Terror with Glamor, also \\" beware of When In Pink \\". She presented her C.I.A. (Colette institute of Art) with an installation performance on April 1st at the NYC club\\" Crowbar\\". In \\"Domestic Bliss\\" (1994), an arresting vision that featured a long pink table with Lumiere plates, could be seen from the streets of Rosenthal's Madison Avenue Rosenthal's Show Room.

Other sections displayed racks of clothes, furniture,and art made at different times displayed on shelves or stacked against the walls. The exhibition addressed the nomadic life of the artist, particularly addressing personal concerns at the time and the uncertainties of human existence in general. \\"The Closet\\" - at Windows Gallery, Long Island City, reconstruction of the clothes of her closet resembling a thrift shop with street painting leading to it from PS1.connecting the artist history there to the current show.) These shows proceeded the unnounced vacatefrom her loft, that came soon after and were somewhat prophetic. By 2008 Colette had relocated and was awarded a wonderful studio space at The Marie Walsh Sharpe Art foundation in Dumbo for a year. She transformed her new atelier into a living space and there was able to begin a new body of works.

Manipulation techniques The pipe may be improvised, aboard ship, from available hoses and pumps, to discharge untreated waste water directly into the sea. As ships are required to keep records of waste and its treatment, magic pipe cases often involve falsification of these records too. The pipe is ironically called \\"magic\\" because it bypasses the ship's oily water separator and goes right overboard. Therefore it can make untreated bilge water \\"magically disappear\\". Often the pipe can be easily disconnected and stored away into a different spot of the ship so state and regulatory officers would not be able to detect its usage. The use of magic pipes continues to this day as well as efforts to improve bilge water treatment to make the use of magic pipes unnecessary also continue. Legal ramifications In the United States, magic pipe cases often attract large fines for shipping lines, and prison sentences for crew. Cases are often brought to light by whistle blowers, including a 2016 case involving Princess Cruises, which resulted in a record US $40 million fine. On older OWS systems bypass pipes were fitted with regulatory approval. These approved pipes are no longer fitted on newer vessels. In some serious emergencies ship's crews are allowed to discharge untreated bilge water overboard, but they need to declare these emergencies in the ship's records and oil record book. Unregistered discharges violate the MARPOL 73/78 international pollution control treaty. Motivation and responsibility The problem is worsened by a lack of facilities in developing countries; some port reception facilities do not allow for oily water to be discharged easily and cost effectively. Crew members, engineers, and ship owners can receive huge fines and even imprisonment if they continue to use a magic pipe to pollute the environment. Conclusively, some engineers use the magic pipe manipulation technique because of: *1. Lack of training *2. Lack of shore side assistance with regard to bilge water treatment *3. Simple disregard of the ocean environment. Proper process The oily bilge waste comes from a ship‚Äôs engines and fuel systems. The waste is required to be offloaded when a ship is in port and either burned in an incinerator or taken to a waste management facility. In rare occasions, bilge water can be discharged into the ocean but only after almost all oil is separated out.

He stood tall and weighed . Born in San Francisco, Dempsey graduated from Sequoia High School (Redwood City, California), then the University of San Francisco (USF), where he played baseball and basketball. With the outbreak of World War II, he joined the United States Navy, serving in the Pacific and European theaters; he was awarded four medals for bravery. Dempsey began his professional baseball career during the postwar era at age 24, winning 16 games in 1947 in the Class C Pioneer League, then joining his hometown San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1948. As a PCL rookie in 1948, he again won 16 games (losing 11), and led the league in strikeouts (171) and earned run average (2.10). Then, in 1949, he won 17 of 31 decisions for the Seals, and again led the PCL in strikeouts (164), although his ERA rose to 4.23. Dempsey moved to the Seals' bullpen in 1950, splitting 18 decisions. Although his ERA remained high (4.36) his contract was purchased on a conditional basis by the Pirates during the 1950‚Äì51 offseason.

Dempsey, now 28, made Pittsburgh's opening- season, 28-man roster. But his new overhand delivery was not effective. Given two starting assignments, on April 28 against the Cincinnati Reds and May 4 against the New York Giants, he absorbed two losses and was able last only five total innings pitched. In the latter game, he surrendered home runs to both Bobby Thomson and Hank Thompson.Retrosheet box score: 1951-05-04 After two innings of mop-up relief on May 5, in which he allowed no runs on two hits, Dempsey was returned to the Seals, where he finished the 1951 campaign.

As a major leaguer, he allowed 11 hits and seven earned runs in seven full innings pitched; he issued four bases on balls and struck out three. Dempsey returned to USF to earn a master's degree in education, then began a 34-year career as a teacher and coach in San Francisco's public school system.

It originally aired on Showtime on December 12, 2010. In the episode, Dexter attempts to save Lumen from Jordan Chase, as his sister, Debra, comes closer to uncovering the truth in her investigation. Meanwhile, Quinn falls under suspicion for Dexter's murder of Stan Liddy. The episode was directed by Steve Shill, and the teleplay was written by former showrunner Chip Johannessen and executive producer Manny Coto. It marked the conclusion of the season-long subplot pertaining to Lumen seeking revenge against Jordan Chase, and marked the last in a string of regular guest appearances by Julia Stiles and Jonny Lee Miller, who played Lumen and Chase, respectively. Plot Dexter's situation grows desperate when he discovers that Lumen has been set up and captured by Jordan. Despite knowing that he's being baited into a trap, Dexter risks his life to save Lumen. In the Barrel Girls case, Debra comes to the conclusion that the disappearance of the rapists is due to a pair of vigilantes. Liddy's body is found and the team is called to the scene. There, LaGuerta informs Quinn that the last five calls found on Liddy's phone were to him. LaGuerta then notices blood on Quinn's shoes and has him taken in for questioning. Dexter tracks down the address of one of Jordan's camps, where Lumen was first assaulted. Dexter speeds to the scene but, in his haste, his car flips over a backhoe on the road. Following his crash, Jordan locates Dexter and ties him up alongside Lumen. As Jordan opens Dexter's knife kit, he notices one knife is missing, which Dexter uses to break free and stab Jordan in the foot. Dexter incapacitates Jordan and frees Lumen before they then strap Jordan to a table. Jordan taunts Lumen about the rape, and she kills him by stabbing him in the chest. Meanwhile, Debra tracks down the street vendor who reported seeing Jordan heading in the direction of the camp. She walks in just as Dexter and Lumen are cleaning the crime scene behind plastic wrapping, which conceals their identities. She tells the two that she knows who they are and advises them to be gone within an hour to avoid the police, and she leaves without seeing them. After disposing of Jordan's body, Dexter proceeds to the lab to perform the blood-work on Quinn's shoe. When he returns, Lumen informs Dexter that she wants to leave, stating that her need to kill has now gone. Dexter initially laments her leaving, but eventually assures her that she should not be sorry, promising to carry her darkness for her along with his own. After saying goodbye to Lumen, he attends Harrison's first birthday party with his family and co-workers, visibly distraught. Quinn thanks Dexter for the bloodwork, which has exonerated him from Liddy's murder. Dexter tells Debra that he still dislikes Quinn but accepts that he makes Debra happy. He removes his wedding ring for the first time and reflects on what Lumen brought into his life, that someone could see him for who he is and not see a monster, and that nothing, not even darkness, is set in stone. He then blows out Harrison's candle on the birthday cake. Production \\"The Big One\\", the Dexter fifth- season finale, was directed by Steve Shill, and the teleplay written by former showrunner Chip Johannessen and executive producer Manny Coto. While the fourth season finale, \\"The Getaway\\", ended with Rita Bennett's murder, Johannessen said the production staff sought for \\"The Big One\\" to be more of a resolution, with a similar sense of closure more in keeping with the first, second and third season finales. Johannessen said this allowed the staff to focus less on Dexter seeking atonement for Rita's death in future episodes and start fresh in a new direction for the series. The episode marked the conclusion of the season-long subplot of Lumen seeking revenge against Jordan Chase and his accomplices, and marked the last in a string of regular guest appearances by Jonny Lee Miller. Julia Stiles said at the start of her time on the series, she believed Lumen would likely be killed by the end of the season because most characters who have learned the truth about Dexter's double life have ended up dead. The actress said she never predicted that Lumen would break up with Dexter, and she found that scene difficult to act due to the level of intimacy the two characters had built up throughout the season. She prepared herself for the scene by focusing on the fact that Lumen was healed and that the reality of the murders she committed with Dexter had sunk in. Stiles said she found Lumen's repudiation of Dexter particularly sad because she knew more about his true self than anyone else, which meant her breakup was a rejection of him as a person. Johannessen said the teleplay for \\"The Big One\\" sought to more illustrate what Lumen went through more vividly than previous episodes did. As a result, while Debra watches police evidence tapes, footage of the crimes committed by Jordan and his accomplices are shown to a longer and more graphic degree than in previous episodes. Reception The episode received mixed to positive reviews. IGN gave the episode an \\"Impressive\\" score of 8.0/10, saying that \\"I don't mind where the show left us, but I also can't deny that this season had me expecting more of a pay- off...\\" and \\"So 'The Big One' was a solid season closer, complete with the typical (though not predictable) \\"is this when Dexter will finally get caught?\\" moment... Having her leave was, unfortunately, inevitable and it meant that we had to sit through her explain the reason for her wanting to leave to Dexter, which to us was a little plodding because we knew that it was all a way of getting her off the show when it felt so much more right, story- wise, for her character to want to stay. No, Dexter and Lumen's romance wasn't the true seller here, but it did fit within their vigilante partnership. And it seems like something that she wouldn't want to give up. I did appreciate Dexter's anger when he came to the sad realization that he was forever \\"broken\\" - and had hoped Lumen would be too. Forever broken, with an inner eternal dark flame. Like his. Hell, if you watched Julia Stiles' post-show interview, it felt like perhaps she didn't like the way Lumen left the show. She even referenced Lumen being out there, in the world now, with a lot of new knowledge. So it's not like she couldn't come back if the writers wanted her to. (Pretty please!)\\", reviewer Matt Fowler concluded with \\"Now look, an 8 is still a damn good score, and an 8-point episode of Dexter is still better than a 20 point episode of most other shows, but I still felt like this episode could have handled the end of Lumen's story a bit better. And possibly given us a bit more to chew on as far as Deb knowing that Dexter was a part of something (more the barrel girls and less the Liddy murder, of course). I'm fine with a book-end, but I also need progress. And maybe a little more change to the show status-quo.\\" The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, feeling that the finale dropped short in places. Reviewer Emily VanDerWerff said: \\"Another case in point: I realize that the show has been building to Deb's acceptance of Lumen's vigilante kills all season long, and on a show that wasn't transparently trying to stretch out its length with bullshit maneuvers, I might have enjoyed the scene where she runs across the vigilante and has a chance to just let them walk away, then takes it. But it's such a nakedly desperate attempt to bring someone that much closer to catching Dexter without actually doing so that it rankles. It's properly built to, and on its own, it might be a nice little scene, but it also feels completely ridiculous, tossed into the episode solely to give a sense of something happening, while ultimately preserving the status quo. (The same goes for Deb bringing up the Ice Truck Killer for his annual season finale mention but not bringing up that she, uh, knows Dexter is the guy's brother, a plot point that's been completely dropped).\\" Unrealityshout.com reviewed the episode relatively positively but felt that it was somewhat unbelievable. Reviewer Gerard McGarry said \\"It's possible the sequence of the season finale was a little too neat. You could almost feel the plot points being ticked off a list as they were resolved.\\" and concluded that the season had been \\"...an interesting season for Dexter. I can appreciate the challenges Rita's death raised for the writers, and the idea of atoning for her death by helping Lumen is inspired. And while the season started out rather slow and deflated, it quickly regained its usual levels to tension and fun.\\" References  External links   2010 American television episodes Dexter (TV series) episodes ","title":"The Big One (Dexter)"},{"id":"30028101","text":"Articles 108 through 108-C of the define crimes similar to those known as murder in Anglophone countries. The term (\\"murder\\") is no longer used in the Penal Code since 2014. Article 108: Qualified homicide , known formerly as , is the killing of another in any of the following circumstances: # For ferocity, cupidity, profit, or for pleasure # To facilitate or hide another crime # With great cruelty or treachery # By fire, explosion, or other method which is capable of placing in danger the life or health of other persons It is punishable by deprivation of liberty of at least 15 years. The specific mention of poison in the fourth provision, and the term , was removed by Law No. 30253 of 24 October 2014. Historically, qualified homicide had been one of the only crimes subject to capital punishment in Peru. The abolished the death penalty for all crimes, but four years later Article 16 of the restored it solely for the crime of qualified homicide. The Law of 11 May 1861 defined fifteen circumstances in which a killing would constitute the crime of qualified homicide, closely following the definition in Article 15 of the 1859 Penal Code. Article 232 of the 1862 Penal Code restricted this to five circumstances, though a separate article also imposed the death penalty for the crime of parricide, which had previously been included as qualified homicide under the 1861 law. Article 15 of the subsequently abolished capital punishment again, but it was in effect only briefly before the 1860 Constitution was restored. Article 21 of the continued to permit capital punishment specifically in cases of treason and qualified homicide, but in practice the drafters of legislation only exercised this power for treason. Articles 151 and 152 of the 1924 Penal Code, defining the crime of qualified homicide, specified life imprisonment as the maximum penalty. Article 51 of the also continued to permit capital punishment for treason and qualified homicide. However, life imprisonment remained the maximum statutory penalty for qualified homicide until Decree Law No. 10976 of 25 March 1949 increased the penalty to death once again. Other laws in the 1970s further extended capital punishment to other forms of homicide besides qualified homicide, but the subsequently abolished capital punishment once again for all crimes except wartime treason. Article 108-A: Homicide qualified by the condition of the victim The killing of certain government officials, including members of the National Police, the Armed Forces, a judicial magistrate, a public minister, a member of the Constitutional Court, or an elected official, in or as a consequence of the exercise of their official functions, is punishable by deprivation of liberty of between 25 and 35 years. Article 108-B: Feminicide The killing of a woman in the context of domestic violence; of coercion, harassment, or sexual assault; of abuse of power or similar; or of discrimination against women, is punishable by deprivation of liberty of no less than 15 years. The minimum sentence is increased to 25 years in the presence of certain aggravating circumstances, including if the victim is a minor, or is pregnant. Article 108-C: Assassination , the crime of killing a person at the order of another to obtain an economic benefit for one's self or another person, is punishable by deprivation of liberty of no less than 25 years. It is also a crime (under Article 108-D) to conspire in promoting or facilitating such a killing, or to act as an intermediary in arranging one, regardless of whether the killing is committed. Contrast with other types of homicide Under Article 106, (\\"simple homicide\\") carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. The absence of premeditation is an important element distinguishing simple homicide from qualified homicide. (\\"homicide with violent emotion\\"; Article 109 of the current Penal Code, Article 153 of the 1924 Penal Code) may be compared to the crime of voluntary manslaughter in U.S. law. It carries a sentence of three to five years' deprivation of liberty, except when it also involves the crime of parricide as defined in Article 107, in which case the sentence is increased to five to ten years.

A native of California, he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II before working at what is now Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. After moving north to Oregon, he started working for Tektronix before starting several companies in what became the Silicon Forest in the Portland metropolitan area. He founded or helped to found Floating Point Systems, Lattice Semiconductor, and Thrustmaster. Winningstad and his wife were also noted philanthropists in the Portland area, with a theater at the Portland Center for the Performing Arts named in his wife Dolores' honor. Early life C. Norman Winningstad was born in Berkeley, California, to Chester and Phyllis Winningstad on November 5, 1925. He grew up in California and then served in the United States Navy during World War II as an electronic technician's mate. After the war Winningstad continued in the electronics field when graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in electrical engineering. He graduated in 1948 as an expert in vacuum tubes, which was the same year Bell Labs developed the transistor. As the transistor would replace vacuum tubes in most applications, Winningstad later joked that he \\"graduated technically obsolete\\". He then worked at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in his hometown for a few years. He was married to Dolores, and they had two sons, Richard and Dennis, along with a daughter Joanne. Oregon Lattice Semiconductor's headquarters Winningstad moved north to Oregon in 1958, settling in the Portland metropolitan area. There he worked for technology company Tektronix (Tek), near the city of Beaverton. While with Tek, he was later described as \\"one of its leading brains during its 1960s heyday\\". Tek manufactured oscilloscopes, and later diversified into areas such as printers and even television production equipment. Winningstad continued his education with a degree from Portland State University. He left Tektronix in 1970 to help start supercomputer company Floating Point Systems in Beaverton. At his new company, he received assistance from his old company in the way of simulations and early production of prototypes. Winningstad grew the company to 1,600 employees and annual revenues of $127 million, though he left and came back to resurrect the company before Floating Point went bankrupt in the early 1990s. Winningstad continued his entrepreneurial ways by helping to found Lattice Semiconductor in Hillsboro in 1980 and Thrustmaster in 1990, also in Hillsboro.

The park receives about 50,000 visitors each year. Description Edgewood has 160 acres of serpentine soil which are known for having high proportions of native plant species including rare and locally endemic species. Edgewood has grasslands, chaparral, coastal scrub, foothill woodlands, and wetlands supporting over 500 distinct species, three of which are federally listed as endangered or threatened. Edgewood is also home to the Bay checkerspot butterfly, also a threatened species. Its northwestern slopes have small tributaries to Cordilleras Creek, while its southwestern slopes host the source of Laguna Creek. Edgewood contains all the major ecological zones specific to the San Francisco Peninsula with the exception of Redwood forest. History Various development projects were proposed on what is now Edgewood beginning in 1967 including a college, recreational complex, solar energy facility, and a golf course. The property was acquired by San Mateo County in 1979 from California for approximately . County supervisors moved forward with plans for an 18-hole public golf course, approving a master plan and certifying an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) by the end of 1982. In 1983, the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) filed a lawsuit challenging the EIR, which was settled out-of-court on the condition that sensitive habitats would be given protection. The Bay checkerspot was declared a threatened species in 1987, followed by the Edgewood Park harvestman in 1988, and one of the members of the County Board of Supervisors ran for Congress in 1988, narrowly defeating a primary challenger after the supervisor's support of the golf course was made one of the focal points of the campaign. In 1992, two-thirds of Edgewood Park were set aside for a natural preserve with one- third to be considered for the golf course, pending the results of a feasibility study. In the summer of 1993, the County Board of Supervisors declared Edgewood County Park a Natural Preserve, following the feasibility study results, which concluded the parts of the park flat enough to support a golf course were also the same parts that contained the protected species. The Natural Preserve declaration in 1993 protected the entire park from future development.

It was near the head of the Adriatic coast.Keppie, The Army and the Navy, 383.; Hornblower, Ravenna, 1294. For almost five hundred years it was an important strategic military port. When it was not being used as a military port, it was an important commercial port for the imperial capital of Ravenna in the Roman Empire.Bowerstock, Ravenna, 662. Classe comes from the Latin word classis, meaning fleet. Mosaic in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo showing the military port of Classe Overview of the acheological site in Classe Ancient streets and walls in Classe foundations of port Tavern  Republican Period  There was a small port and harbor for commercial trade.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 27, 30; Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 26. The city of Ravenna, north of the harbor, was founded in the late 3rd or early 2nd century BC. Early Roman Imperial Period Origins of Classe  Sometime between 35 and 12 BC,Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 26; Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 229. Octavian (later known as emperor Augustus) established Ravenna's harbor as one of the home ports for his new Roman navy. South of the harbor, the area was occupied mainly by cemeteries, but by the 2nd century AD a town, known in Latin as Classis, had grown up. Augustus may have chosen this site because of its strategic position. The area in which Augustus wanted to construct Classe was in a lagoon.Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 26; Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 27 It was impregnable from land and surrounded by marshes. The base was artificially constructed in this lagoon.Starr, Influence of Sea Power, 68 Unlike the ports of Portus or Ostia, Classe did not feature a hexagonal basin. Instead the base installations were built on stilts.Pitassi, Navies of Rome, 206 Once those were in place the port was made of large oak beams. By the 1st century CE the builders had incorporated ceramic fragments. By the 2nd century, it was redone with bricks.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 28 Augustus designed the port for military purposes only.Starr, Roman Imperial Navy, 21 The town had only one weakness, access to fresh water. This obstacle was overcome by the Emperor Trajan who built a long aqueduct to Ravenna, that might also have supplied Classe.Deliyannis,Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 34; in fact, the path of the aqueduct is uncertain, since it brought water from south of the harbor all the way to Ravenna. After the fleet was built, the population of the soldiers and their families living there grew slowly but steadily.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 30 For the next three hundred years, Classe would be one of Rome‚Äôs most important naval bases, the home of the eastern Mediterranean fleetDeliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 26 The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio states that the fleet had two hundred and fifty ships. This is the only account that survived to this day and it is only because it was quoted by Jordanes, a 6th-century historian. Society Before Augustus' establishment of the fleet, there is no evidence of any habitation in the area that became Classe. As of today, archeologists have only found remains of cemeteries from this time period. It is unknown if these cemeteries were pagan or Christian. However, they were most likely pagan because archeologists do not find evidence of a population returning until the 2nd century. This coincides with the rise of Christianity in Classe.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity,30, 38 Later Roman Imperial Period Due to the crisis of the third century, Ravenna and the port began to decline.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 36 The city of Ravenna was sacked at least twice in the 250s and 260s, and the harbor was no longer maintained; it started drying out and began filling with silt.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 37 Despite this, as early as 306, Roman emperors started staying at Ravenna in order to watch the harbor to see if any enemies were close.Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 30, 34 When Ravenna was chosen as an official western imperial capital in 402, Classe became more prosperous than ever, and the residential area to the south of the harbor was surrounded by a wall in the late 4th centuryChristie, City Walls of Ravenna, 114; Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 37 A vital part of the royal administration was its grain warehouse and distribution.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 118 Even after 476, when Ravenna was no longer a Roman imperial capital, it and its port survived, and the town of Classe was restored under the Ostrogothic king Theodoric.  Society  While Ravenna was an imperial capital some sailors and their families lived there. However, the majority of the sailors and their families lived in the vast barracks of the imperial fleet.Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 229; but there is no evidence at all for this Because there were no other large cities in the area, families stayed, putting down roots in Ravenna and Classe.Starr, Royal Imperial Navy, 23 (note that sailors were not legally allowed to be married while enlisted in the fleet). As for the government of Classe, it was overruled by the imperial prefect of the imperial fleet.Starr, Roman Imperial Navy, 22 However, once Ravenna became the imperial capital in 402, it appears Classe fell under its jurisdiction.  Christian presence  Archeological remains show Christianity was an important part of life in Classe. ‚ÄúIt became a focus of the earliest Christian community.‚Äù Cemeteries from the late 2nd century show the beginning of Christianity in Classe. Starting in the 4th century, Classe acquired several magnificent churches, as well as its own baptistery. ‚ÄúThe centerpiece of Christian worship in the Classe region both geographically and symbolically, was the church dedicated to the first bishop of Ravenna, Saint Apollinare‚Äù, which was built in the 540sDeliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 259 Sant'Apollinare in Classe is the only church from Classe still standing today. Other churches near Sant'Apollinare were dedicated to other early bishops who had been buried there, as this was the region in which cemeteries were located in the Roman period.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 38 There is no evidence of Classe ever having its own bishop. This was probably because Classe was so much smaller than Ravenna, there was no need for Classe to have its own bishop.All information on Classe's lack of bishop is in Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 197 Finally, the church of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in the city of Ravenna features a mosaics depicting the harbor of Classe in the 520s. The city of Classe is walled with an amphitheatre, basilica and the entrance of the harbor is flanked by two lighthouses. The remains of the lighthouses have never been found. Classe Fleet  Western  Classe could hold a fleet of two hundred and fifty ships and could accommodate arsenals, magazines and barracks.Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 28-29;Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 28; Charles, Transporting the Troops, 279. The fleet consisted of triremes, quadriremes and liburnians (light vessels). These ships were named after gods, goddesses and rivers. The fleet employed ax makers, carpenters, doctors, flag bearers, horn players, officers, oarsmen, pilots, repair personnel, rhythm keepers for oarsmen, scribes, sailors, and weapons masters. There were as many as ten thousand men connected to the fleet in some way. The fleet was used primarily to keep the peace in the Mediterranean. The fleet's main focuses were the Adriatic Sea and Aegean Sea, though it patrolled the waters of the Mediterranean as far away as Spain.Keppie, The Army and the Navy, 383. In 24 the fleet was used to put down a slave revolt in Brundisium. When the fleet was not being used for military purposes, it was used to protect merchant ships from pirates.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 27 Although little evidence exists, recent scholarly consensus rejects the assumption that there were no pirates in the Mediterranean during the early Empire, preferring to credit the fleet at Classe with their suppression. Tombstones from sailors of the fleet have been unearthed there.Starr, Roman Imperial Navy, 189 By 69 the Classe fleet had five thousand ships.Pitassi, Navies of Rome, 222 By 324 the western ‚ÄúAugustan navy‚Äù was gone. This was most likely because the western half of the empire was preoccupied with civil war. Emperor Constantine was engaged in fighting civil wars with his fellow tetrarch emperors Maxentius and Licinius for sole control of the empire. The empire did not have the means or resources to have a navy at Classe. For further information, there is a detailed article on the Roman navy.  Eastern  The eastern part of the Roman Empire understood how important Classe was as a military port. Scholars are unclear as to when the transition between the western focused navy and the eastern focused navy took place; estimates are between 324 and 383. This new eastern navy was a permanent fleet in Classe. The fleet was used to control the Aegean Sea and the eastern part of the Mediterranean. Later it was used to help reclaim the lost Roman territory in the west, such as Italy.Starr, Roman Imperial Navy, 198 However, between 383 and 450 the standing fleet disappeared.Charles, Transporting the Troops, 276 Ostrogothic Period Roman imperial rule came to an end when in 476, Odoacer, a Germanic magister militum, deposed the Western emperor Romulus Augustulus and declared himself king of Italy. By the 480s, the emperor in the east, Zeno, was determined to put an end to Odoacer and his kingdom. Zeno encouraged Theodoric to invade Italy and rule it as a viceroy. Theodoric was successful in destroying Odoacer‚Äôs kingdom, but he subsequently declared himself king of Italy, and established his capital at Ravenna. The Ostrogothic Kingdom of Theodoric the Great lasted between 490 and 540.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 137 The Classe that Theodoric inherited was no longer a first class military port. Part of the harbor was completely dried up; however, Theodoric worked to repair the harbor and port.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 117 Despite this renovation, the port was no longer an important military naval outpost. In fact Classe was taken off of the formal army register. Instead, the port became an important commercial port for all of northern Italy. Exarchate of Ravenna The eastern half of the empire had been connected to Classe since 324 through the navy. By the first half of the 6th century, the empire had its sights on claiming the port city for its own. Emperor Justinian I opposed the Ostrogothic rule of Italy on the grounds that the Arian sect constituted a heresy. He sent his general Belisarius to recapture Italy, including Ravenna and Classe, for the eastern half of the empire. In 540 Classe was reconquered by Belisarius in the Gothic Wars (535-554). It stayed under eastern control until 751. This time is known as the Exarchate of Ravenna. Justinian, understanding the strategic importance of Classe, once again refurbished the harbor. Classe became the second most important port after Constantinople.Lewis, European Naval, 22 Classe in the early 6th century became a prosperous cosmopolitan naval and trading center.Kazhdan, Ravenna, 1773. Because of this, there was an increase in population. New churches and basilicas were built for the new population, including Sant'Apollinare in Classe, mentioned above.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 196, 257 Another major church of this time was the San Severo. Construction on it began in 570 by Archbishop Peter III and was completed Archbishop John II in 582. Upon completion it was dedicated to Ravenna‚Äôs 4th- century bishop, Saint Severus.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 274 Lombard War During the late 6th century, the barbarian group known as the Lombards invaded Ravenna and plundered Classe in 579. The raid was led by Faroald, the Duke of Spoleto, who controlled the cities for a short time. However, Drocdulf, a Sueve who fought for the eastern Empire regained Classe and forced the Lombards to give the cities back to the Eastern Empire.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 206 In 717-8 the Lombard duke Faroald captured Classe, but was ordered to withdraw by King Liutprand, who himself captured Classe a few years later and again returned it to the Byzantines. In 751, another king, Aistulf, succeeded in conquering Ravenna. This ended the Exarchate of Ravenna. During the Lombard Wars, while Ravenna was spared for the most part, Classe seems to have been completely destroyed. By this time the harbor had completely dried up. Because of the Lombard Wars and the decay of the harbor, the city of Classe dramatically shrank.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 289 After this event, Classe was never again an important port militarily or commercially. Middle Ages The Frankish king Pepin the Short drove the Lombards out of Ravenna and Classe in 756; following this, the territory was briefly ruled by the archbishops of Ravenna. Pepin's son Charlemagne's conquest of the Lombard kingdom in 774 saw the two cities turned over to the Pope and they became part of the newly formed Papal States. In the mid-9th century, Classe was raided and sacked by Muslims.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 260 Also, sometime in the Middle Ages, the Po River completely destroyed the port. Because of this, archeologists are forced to use other evidence to reconstruct how the port may have looked.Starr, Roman Imperial Navy, 21 ?? the Po River was nowhere near Classe Modern Era Today Classe is an archaeological site. The main excavation sites are: Podere Chiavichetta, San Severo, Podere Marabina and Saint Probus.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 12 The ground under Ravenna and Classe has been sinking for centuries. In fact, it sinks about every century. This makes excavating extremely difficult. When archeologists dig they find artifacts at various levels. From below the surface there is material dating from Imperial rule; from , material from the Ostrogothic Kingdom; and from , material from the Republic. Due to the accumulation of silt, the coastline has moved to the east.Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity, 13 If visiting Classe, one has to climb to the top of the last watch tower to see the ocean.Hutton, Story of Ravenna, 230 On 16 July 2015 the archeological site became a museum which is open for visitors. Main sites Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe San Severo See also * Ravenna * Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe * Roman Navy * Portus * Ostia Antica Citations References Ancient sources Because of the tumultuous times, few firsthand accounts survive to this day. There are two main sources: Appian, the historian who in 39 BCE stated that: Augustus ordered new buildings at Classe. There is also Cassius Dio who is referenced by Jordanes. This means that archeologists are forced to rely on epigraphic evidence such as wall carvings, mosaics and tombstones when trying to reconstruct what life was like in Classe. Modern sources Finding scholarly information on Classe in English is extremely challenging. The most comprehensive book is Ravenna in Late Antiquity by Deborah Mauskopf Deliyannis. In it, she discusses the various stages of the port and also gives the most up to date archeological information as of January 2010. Another book in English is Edward Hutton‚Äôs The Story of Ravenna, published in 1926. Most of the latest information on Ravenna and Classe can be found in Italian academic journals.

Model Description  The semi-distributed DPHM-RS (Semi-Distributed Physically based Hydrologic Model using Remote Sensing and GIS) sub-divides a river basin to a number of sub-basins, computes the evapotranspiration, soil moisture and surface runoff using energy and rainfall forcing data in a sub-basin scale. It consists of six basic components: interception of rainfall, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, saturated subsurface flow, surface flow and channel routing, as described in Biftu and Gan.Biftu, G.F., and Gan, T.Y., 2001.

This model solves the non-linear equations based on the energy balance for the canopy, surface, and air temperatures at canopy height, evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from vegetation. A soil profile of three homogeneous layers (active, transmission and saturated layers) is used to model the soil moisture on the basis of water balance between layers. The active layer is 15‚Äì30 cm thick and it simulates the rapid changes of soil moisture content under high frequency atmospheric forcing. The transmission zone lies between the base of the active layer and the top of the capillary fringe and so it more characterizes the seasonal (instead of transient) changes of soil moisture. In modeling the unsaturated flow component of soil water, the water transport is assumed vertical and non-interactive between sub-basins. The lower boundary of the unsaturated zone is the top of capillary fringe controlled by the local average ground water table derived from the catchment average water table and topographic soil index which include the spatial variability of the topographic and soil parameters.Sivapalan, M., Wood, E.F., and Beven, K.J., 1987. On hydrologic similarity, 2 a scaled model of storm runoff prediction. Water Resources Research 23(12), 2266-2278 Starting with an observed value from the surrounding wells of the modeled basin, the temporal changes in the average ground water depth is based on the water balance analysis for the whole catchment, and the rate of change of the average ground water table is assumed to be the rate of change of local water table.Famiglietti, J.S., and Wood, E.F., 1994. Multi-scale modeling of spatially-variable water and energy balance process. Water Resources Research 30(11), 3061-3078. After simulating the soil moisture, the saturation and Hortonian infiltration excess for vegetated and bare soil are computed to generate the surface runoff for each sub-basin. Philip's equation is used to compute the infiltration capacity of soil, and the surface runoff is distributed temporally using a time lag response function obtained from a reference rainfall excess of 1 cm depth applied to each grid cell within the sub-basin for one time step. Then for each grid cell, which has the resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM) used, the flow is routed according to the kinematic wave equation from cell to cell based on eight possible flow directions until the total runoff water for the sub-basin is completely routed. The resulting runoff becomes a lateral inflow to the stream channel within the sub-basin and these flows are routed through the drainage network by the Muskingum-Cunge routing method whose variable parameters are evaluated by an iterative four point approach.Ponce, V.M., and Yevjevich, V., 1978.

Plot summary Mad Monkey vs. the Dragon Claw is a scenario for use with Oriental Adventures, in which the player characters go in search of the lethal Dragon Claw school of martial arts and travel across T'u Lung to the headquarters of the Cult of the Black Leopard. In this first edition Oriental Adventures module, a group of player characters return to large quest-based adventures. This was the only adventure published for Oriental Adventures based entirely on Kara Tur's mainland, and one of the few modules that actually allows characters to multiclass who would not otherwise be able to do so. Background The background story is that the demon Dragon Claw, in the celestial bureaucracy, has convinced the Celestial Emperor to allow him to showcase his fighting style on Toril. It contends that its style is superior to all other forms, and if this turns out to be the case, it wants to rule an empire on the prime material plane. The Celestial Emperor has agreed, if only to see out the demons boast of its fighting style. Dragon Claw has neglected to mention that its fighting style includes it giving all of its students magical weapons which, aside from making them fanatical devotees to its fighting style, also make them much tougher than an average fighter. In this way, Dragon Claw is stacking the deck in its favor. Monkey, an agent among the court, has seen through the demon's plot, and is determined to thwart it. Monkey chooses to teach his own fighting style to the player characters, owing to them being able to multiclass freely as monks, though they normally are able to. All this leads up to the final battle in Toril's version of Sigil.

In 1750 he built a small stockade to protect the strategic western end of the Shenandoah Mountain pass from Indian raids. One of a series of fortifications authorized by the Virginia Colonial General Assembly along the frontier during the French & Indian War. Col. Lewis went on to die a hero's death fighting the Shawnee, allies of the British, in the 1774 Battle of Point Pleasant, now widely regarded as the first conflict of the American Revolution. His vast 3,200 acre mountain farm, still known as Fort Lewis Farm, has remained relatively unchanged over its 200-year history. In the 1740s Virginia frontiersmen found herds of buffalo roaming in fertile grounds of the Cowpasture River Valley. The Shawnee had long since cleared these fields and regarded them as sacred hunting grounds. Early settlers introduced domestic livestock and small grains but found hemp to be the most valuable crop. Descendants of Col. Lewis managed the plantation for over a century. By 1850 the Lewis family had diverted water from the river and built a gristmill to service the plantation and neighboring farms. The Cowden family purchased Fort Lewis Farm in 1959 and brought a herd of registered Black Angus cattle to the valley. Today the Cowden family continues to oversee the farming operation and also manages Fort Lewis Lodge, a full-service country inn with miles of river for trout and bass fishing, a classic swimming hole, extensive hiking trails, mountain biking, and magnificent vistas. The gristmill has been faithfully reconstructed and now serves as the main dining room. Fort Lewis was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.

Jos√© de San Mart√≠n was an Argentine-born general who moved to Spain during his childhood. He served in the Spanish army from 1789 to 1811. During that time he fought among Spanish forces under siege by Moors, in a naval battle against the British navy and in the Peninsular War. In 1795 he was promoted to second lieutenant and during the Peninsular War he reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. However, San Martin ended up resigning his position and moved briefly to Britain, and then to Buenos Aries. In 1811, he participated in the Spanish American wars of independence. Early life Jos√© de San Mart√≠n was born in Yapey√∫, Corrientes, son of Juan de San Mart√≠n and Gregoria Matorras del Ser. The exact year of Mart√≠n's birth is unknown, and historians are divided between 1777 and 1778. An officer in the military, Juan de San Mart√≠n requested a new deployment, and in 1781, he moved his family from Yapeyu to Buenos Aires. In 1783, the family moved to Madrid, where Juan made several requests for military promotion. In 1785, they moved to M√°laga. Three years later, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n reached the age to join the army.Galasso, p. 24 First battles Jos√© de San Mart√≠n joined Murcia's Infantry Regiment of Line on July 15, 1789. The minimum age to join the army was 16 years old, unless the person was the son of an official. In that case, the minimum age was 12 years old. In his incorporation, he declares being the son of an official, of a Christian family and twelve years old.\\"Ser hijo de oficial, provenir de familia cristiana y haber cumplido los doce a√±os\\" (San Mart√≠n) - Galasso, p. 24 He was destined to Melilla, an African Spanish city, the following year. In June 1791, he was among the Spanish forces under siege by Moors in Or√°n. The siege lasted for 33 days, and he was promoted to grenadier. In June 1793, he was promoted to second sublieutenant, in July 1794 to first sublieutenant, and in May 1795 to second lieutenant. His father Juan died in 1796, and by that time he had his baptism of fire in a naval battle, against the British navy. He joined the staff of the Santa Dorotea in 1798, disembarking at Toulon. He learned a bit of the French language, and became aware of the French Revolution. Oral tradition says that Napole√≥n Bonaparte passed review of the Spanish troops, and when he passed near San Mart√≠n, he saw his jacket and read \\"Murcia!\\" aloud.Galasso, p. 26 The ship was captured by the British ship HMS Lion, and he was prisoner of the British for some time. The following reports of San Mart√≠n are found months later, then fighting against Portugal. He was attacked by thieves on his way from Valladolid to Salamanca, receiving great injures in his chest and throat. He received medical aid in a nearby village.Galasso, p. 27 Peninsular war Second of May, 1808: Pedro Velarde takes his last stand. The Spanish monarchy entered crisis during the Abdications of Bayonne, when the Mutiny of Aranjuez forced king Charles IV to abdicate and give the throne to his son, Ferdinand VII. Napoleon Bonaparte, whose troops were in Spain en route to Portugal, forced Ferdinand to abdicate as well, ending Bourbon rule and appointing his brother Joseph Bonaparte as monarch. This was the start of the Peninsular War, the Spanish resistance to the French invasion. Spain was already divided between the enlightenment and the absolutists, but the French invasion divided the ideas even more. The Enlightenment was based in the ideas of the French revolution, but it was the French themselves who were invading the country. The Spanish afrancesados supported the French invasion as a way to remove the absolutist Spanish monarchy and replace it with a liberal monarchy, even if a foreign one. A higher portion of the enlightened Spanish rejected such a perspective, and opposed both the French invasion and an absolutist restoration. San Mart√≠n was part of this group.Galasso, p. 29 By this time, San Mart√≠n was second to Francisco Mar√≠a Solano Ortiz de Rosas, governor of Andaluc√≠a and a close friend. Solano, influenced as well by the enlightenment ideas, had doubts about using his army to back the Dos de Mayo Uprising, even when requested by the Junta of Seville. Some historians consider him an afrancesado, others just hesitant. A popular uprising overran the barracks, killed him and dragged his corpse in the streets. San Mart√≠n was nearly killed as well during the uprising. He would keep an image of him for years, because of their friendship, although he fully supported the popular uprising. He would say years later that After those events, San Mart√≠n became involved into the democratic revolution that moves across Europe. C√°diz was by then a very active city, with discussions about Jovellanos, Fl√≥rez Estrada, the French and British democratic advances, popular intervention in politics, the role of the Juntas and the military leaders.Galasso, p. 30 They initiated planned revolutionary steps within lodges, while the war against the French occupation continued. San Mart√≠n joined the army of Andaluc√≠a, and moved first to Sevilla and then to Ja√©n. In June 1808, he joined a force combining regiments and militias, organized by Juan de la Cruz Mourge√≥n, thus learning further ways to wage war beyond the classic military discipline. This would influence him in the future to have a good opinion of G√ºemes and Artigas. By this time, San Mart√≠n was becoming a renowned military leader. Spanish historian Barcia y Trelles considers that San Mart√≠n is a new man since May 1808, but this turning point of his life was overlooked by both the Argentine and Spanish historians. Argentine historians talk in little detail about San Mart√≠n's military career is Spain, because they were unrelated with the Argentine War of Independence, and the Spanish ones would not be much interested in him because he departed to America in the middle of the war.Galasso, p. 28 San Mart√≠n took part in the combat of Arjonilla, being promoted to First Captain for his brave actions. In the battle, a French officer nearly killed him with his sword, but he was saved by Sargeant Juan de Dios, who died in the effort.Galasso, p. 31 The following July 19 he took part in the Battle of Bail√©n, where 14,000 Spanish defeated 10,000 French. San Mart√≠n was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and his prestige continued to rise. This victory gave new hopes to the Spanish front, forcing Joseph Bonaparte to leave Madrid and allowing later the liberation of Andaluc√≠a. However, San Mart√≠n is forced to take a license, because of a pulmonary affection. He resumed service in Catalonia, under the command of the marquis of Coupigny. He helped Torres Vedras at Portugal, and returned to C√°diz. By this point, San Mart√≠n joined the Lodge of Rational Knights. However, Napole√≥n Bonaparte gave new strength to the French forces, leading them personally, and Joseph returned to Madrid. Despite of the Spanish victory at the Battle of Albuera, where San Mart√≠n fought next to William Carr Beresford, France prevailed and conquered most of the Iberian Peninsula, with the exception of C√°diz. San Mart√≠n would leave the Peninsular War by this point, but the exact nature of his resignation is unknown because it was lost from the Spanish records, and San Mart√≠n himself did not keep a copy of it among his documents.Galasso, p. 53 He moved briefly to Britain, and then to Buenos Aires. Return to South America Arrival of San Mart√≠n and Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear to Buenos Aires, aboard the frigate \\"George Canning\\". The reasons that San Martin left Spain in 1811 to join the Spanish American wars of independence as a patriot remain contentious among historians. The action would seem contradictory and out of character, because if the patriots were waging an independentist and anti- Hispanic war, then that would turn him into a traitor or deserter. There are a variety of answers and explanations by different historians. Bartolom√© Mitre, one of the earliest historians of San Mart√≠n, wrote that \\"the American criollo had paid with usury his debt to the mother country, joining her during her conflicting days, and could consequently separate himself from her without deserting during an hour of need, leaving her protected by the powerful aegis of Great Britain that guaranteed the definitive triumph under the command of the future victor of Waterloo. Then, he turned his eyes to South America, whose independence he had presaged [...] and decided to return to his distant nation, which he had always loved as a true mother, to offer her his sword and devote her his life\\".Galasso, p. 33 Besides extrapolating future events (the defeat of Napoleon and the independence of South America), Mitre provided a long-standing explanation: San Mart√≠n returned because he missed South America, and the war of independence justified changing sides to support it. This perspective was held by mitrist historians, rosist revisionists and socialists. Those groups shared a common perspective about the revolutions and rebellions that took place in the Americas between 1809 and 1811: they considered that they were, from this early stage, separatist wars, intending to create new countries apart from Spain.Galasso, p. 34 Later historians, such as Norberto Galasso, Oriol Anguerra or Rodolfo Terragno, consider this to be unlikely. San Mart√≠n was thirty-five years old by then, and left America when just seven years old. He was completely Spanish, and ideas such as \\"the call of the jungle\\" or the \\"telluric forces\\" have no room in modern psychology to explain a change like this. They consider instead, that the wars in the Americas were not initially separatist, but instead wars between supporters of absolutism and liberalism. This fight took place in both Spain and the Americas, and became independentist when Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and started the absolutist restoration. Under this logic, those historians consider that San Mart√≠n's move to the Americas to continue a fight about to be lost in Spain would make complete sense.Galasso, p. 34-35 Other historians like Tulio Halper√≠n Donghi or Ricardo Levene hinted the similarities of both fights, but avoid giving clear or deep explanations in order to avoid a conflict with the Mitrist perspective.Galasso, p. 39 Most Spanish historians, with a deeper understanding of the conflicts of the Peninsular War, endorse this point of view.Galasso, p. 42-43 Jos√© de San Mart√≠n moved to Buenos in the George Canning ship, with other American born generals like Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear or Jos√© Mat√≠as Zapiola, but also with Spanish born generals like Francisco Chilavert and Eduardo Kailitz, for whom the \\"telluric forces\\" would bear absolutely no value.Galasso, p. 55 There are writings of San Mart√≠n that may clarify those reasons, but whose terms allow either interpretation. Jos√© Pac√≠fico Otero found a report of a speech of San Mart√≠n to his soldiers, where he said that \\"I knew of the revolution in my country and, when I left my fortunes and my hopes, I only regretted not having anything else to sacrifice to the desire of contributing to the freedom of my country\\".Galasso, p. 41 For the Mitrist perspective, \\"revolution\\" and \\"freedom\\" mean emancipation from Spain, for the later one, they mean the revolution against the absolutist status quo. Similarly, his resignation as head of the Army of the Andes says \\"...I had the first news of the general movement at both Americas and that their original purpose was to emancipate themselves from the Peninsular Tyranic Government. [note: with capital letters in the original] From that moment on, I decided to employ my short services to either point that stand insurgent: I preferred to return to my native country where I had been employed at anything within my reach, my nation has rewarded my short services giving me plenty of honours that I do not deserve.Galasso, p. 42 Here, San Mart√≠n does not talk about emancipation from Spain itself, but from its government, capitaling \\"tyranic\\". He also mentions that, even if preferred returning to his native country, he could have been destined to either South or Central America. An 1848 letter to the president of Per√∫ Ram√≥n Castilla says \\"In a meeting of Americans in C√°diz, knowing about the first steps taken in Caracas, Buenos Aires, etc; we decided to return each one to our native countries, to offer them our services in the struggle that we calculated would be waged soon\\". This quote is more strange, as it does not mention an ongoing conflict, but a conflict that would be waged soon (but not by then). Such a conflict may be a possible absolutist restauration, which took place when Ferdinand VII returned to the throne, but could also happen if the Regency Council prevailed over the Junta of Seville. The similarity between San Mart√≠n's military campaign and the British Maitland Plan may suggest that San Mart√≠n was actually a British agent or spy.Galasso, p. 35 This perspective was first proposed by Ricardo Piccirilli in 1957, and supported by Carlos Steffens Soler or J.C.J.Metford.Galasso, p. 37 This perspective, however, fails to give an explanation for the hostility between San Mart√≠n and the anglophil Bernardino Rivadavia, or his support to Juan Manuel de Rosas during his conflicts with Britain.Galasso, p. 38 Patricia Pasquali pointed similar causes but arriving to a different conclusion: San Mart√≠n may have moved to South America in order to get higher military promotions, which would be more difficult to get at the Peninsular War. However, the author does not include the promotions (including promotions to national government) that were actually rejected by San Mart√≠n in her essay.Galasso, 39-40 Bibliography * References Jos√© de San Mart√≠n San Martin, Jose de Military history of Spain ","title":"Military career of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n in Spain"},{"id":"30029161","text":"Laurent Schwartz (born 6 October 1958, in Strasbourg, France) is a French oncologist and scientist.

He was the son of William, Nancy Hanks Lincoln's uncle and grandson of Joseph Hanks.  Early years and marriage  John Hanks was born near Beardstown, and near the Falls at Rough Creek, in Nelson County, Kentucky on February 9, 1802. Four years later his family moved to Hardin County, Kentucky. Hanks married Susan Malinda Wilson in Kentucky in 1826. She was born on February 14, 1804 and died on March 11, 1863. Their children were William, Louis, Jane, Phelix, Emily, Mary Ellen and Levi.  Thomas Lincoln family Hanks lived in Indiana with Thomas Lincoln for four years from 1822 or 1823. While there, he and Abraham farmed corn and were hired out to split rails. He then traveled to Kentucky for a year or two. In 1828 settled in Macon County, Illinois after having built the first house in Decatur, Illinois. It was he who persuaded Thomas to move to Illinois in 1830. He worked alongside Abraham at his first job after he left home. Hanks and Abraham together went to New Orleans in 1831, as hired hands on a flatboat owned by Denton Offutt, Lincoln (and his stepbrother John D. Johnston) being hired at Hanks' recommendation. Hanks claims that he initiated the first speech for Lincoln, believing that he would deliver a better speech than the candidate running for office. Having heard the speech, the candidate urged Lincoln to continue giving speeches. Black Hawk war Hanks served four or six months during the Black Hawk War of 1832, during which time he helped build a fort at Ottawa. 1860 Republican presidential campaign   Rail splitter campaign It was Hanks who accompanied Richard J. Oglesby to the old Lincoln farm and brought back the split fence rails for Lincoln's famous \\"rail splitter\\" campaign at the Republican Party convention at Decatur, Illinois, in 1860. On May 9, 1860, the opening day of the convention, Oglesby addressed the crowd, announcing that \\"An old Democrat of Macon county [‚Ä¶] desire[s] to make a contribution to the Convention\\". At this cue, Hanks, and Isaac Jennings, carried two of the fence railings into the Convention hall, which were tagged with a banner that read \\"Abraham Lincoln, the Rail Candidate for President in 1860. Two rails from a lot of three thousand made in 1830 by John Hanks and Abe Lincoln.\\". This election stunt had the side-effect of making Hanks into somewhat of a national celebrity. Supporters requested \\"genuine Lincoln rails\\" split by Hanks and Lincoln. Oglesby wrote certificates of authenticity of the 72 \\"genuine\\" Lincoln rails that were dispatched on Hanks' behalf. Rumor The Democrats started a rumour that Hanks was not in fact going to vote for Lincoln come election time. They had come to that conclusion based upon his having voted for Stephen A. Douglas, the Democratic presidential hopeful, in 1858. Oglesby transcribed a letter in response for the illiterate Hanks, stating that he would be voting for Lincoln and why. The letter was condemned by Hanks' brother Charles and the Democrats, who were suspicious that it was written by someone else, some \\"smart Republican\\", on Hanks' behalf. Charles stated that he thought Hanks \\"even yet does not know what is in it, much less did he ever write it\\". It was decided that no more open letters by Hanks should be published, and instead Hanks took to making personal appearances in support of Lincoln on the campaign trail. Political appointment request After Lincoln's election, Hanks sought a political appointment in the new administration, again through Oglesby as a letter-writing intermediary, preferring to be an Indian agent. However, although (according to Henry Clay Whitney) Lincoln did give the matter some serious consideration, he was not appointed to any position by Lincoln, although he did visit the White House several times and attended Lincoln's inauguration. Civil War When the United States Civil War broke, Hanks enlisted as a teamster in the Illinois regiment, under Ulysses S. Grant, despite being technically too old to enlist. Hanks was never to see his first cousin, once removed, in the flesh again, their paths only crossing for a final time when Hanks attended Lincoln's funeral.

Company history Beginnings Antonio Zanussi (Lino's father) was the son of a blacksmith. At the age of 26, in 1916, when the economy of Pordenone was still largely agricultural, he opened a small workshop where he began making stoves and ovens. He sold his products under the brand name \\"Rex\\". By 1920, when Lino was born, the \\"Workshop Antonio Zanussi\\" had 10 workers and launched a product that was initially created for export: the AZP (Antonio Zanussi Pordenone), the first wood-burning oven made of molded iron. Lino takes charge When Antonio died on November 21, 1946, the company had one hundred employees. Lino and his brother Guido took over the company. At first, they decided to produce for the domestic market. Having received an education in business by his father, Lino developed the company, making it a major European producer of appliances. By 1962, it had surpassed its German competitors to become the largest company in Europe producing gas and electric stoves, gas rings, washing machines, dishwashers and refrigerators domestically marketed under the \\"Rex\\" and \\"Naonis\\" brand names (export models were always branded \\"Zanussi\\"). In 1960, the company also began making televisions under the brand name \\"Seleco\\".Piero Martinuzzi, Nico Nanni, \\"Lino Zanussi\\", Edizioni Studio Tesi, Civilt√† della Memoria, Pordenone, 1993 The company's business model, according to Lino Zanussi, is \\"... To sell we need to produce a better quality with lower costs, if we don't have one of these two requirements, we lose the market .... \\" At the time of Zanussi's death, the company had 13,000 employees in 13 factories. Since then, other companies have been acquired which now make up the Zanussi Group. Achievements and accolades Zanussi participated in creating the CUOA Foundation at the University of Padua. In the spring of 1963, the University gave him an honorary degree in industrial engineering. On the 21 of October 1966, President Giuseppe Saragat with the Minister of Industry Giulio Andreotti in the Zanussi factory in Porcia, said: :\\"When we talk of our Nation, we have to think about life in our country. Our nation's life is linked to the past and projected into the future, but is represented by people living today. And living in its noblest form is work. It is more than creating wealth: Work is the greatest creator of the moral forces on which civil society is founded \\" Zanussi's philosophy Zanussi advocated this concept of work as a source of morality and civilization. His idea of enterprise is a severe but not paternalistic control, modern and rational, directed toward globalization of markets (with a dominant presence in the European market, with constant attention to assimilating technical and managing know-how, and with a strategy oriented towards the Eastern European countries), the company must create wealth for employees and for the local territory, developing it from a social and cultural point of view. Death On 18 June 1968, a Piaggio PD.808 demonstration aircraft I-PIAI crashed in bad weather when it flew into the side of Mount Jaizkibel, near San Sebastian, Spain. All six on board, including Zanussi, were killed.

When not on a mission, the player is given free roam over a small area of San Francisco, which includes a park, several stores and the homes of Johnny's friends Mark and Denny. There are several side quests that the player can engage in when not on missions, such as reading Denny's daily diary entries or finding ten hidden spoons, which unlocks an extended ending to the game. Plot For the most part, the game follows the plot of the movie: amiable banker Johnny helps his friends with their day-to-day problems while preparing for his wedding to his future wife, Lisa. When he discovers that Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark, Johnny is outraged and ultimately kills himself. The game diverges from the film by only showing the events from Johnny's point of view. The player controls Johnny as he engages in activities that were only referred to in the film, such as his taking on a mystery client at his bank and his turning over drug dealer Chris-R to the police. The game also contains several in-jokes that attempt to provide backstories and account for idiosyncrasies in the film and its story. For example, a scene in the game's final level attempts to explain the inexplicable disappearance of supporting character Peter from the final act by revealing that an escaped Chris-R, in an act of revenge for his arrest, stole Johnny's car during the party and killed Peter in a hit and run. The game begins with a prologue, showing Lisa and Denny at Johnny's grave (a statue of Tommy Wiseau) and then segueing into a level that occurs a day before the main action of the movie begins, in which Johnny learns that an earthquake has sealed San Francisco off from the rest of the state. The final level of the game permits players to \\"tie up\\" loose plot threads left hanging at the end of the film, such as the fate of Chris-R and Johnny's contentious relationship with his superiors at the bank. The game also includes an epilogue revealing that Johnny was, in fact, an alien being inhabiting a human body; after Johnny's \\"suicide\\", he returns to his mother ship, a giant mechanical spoon orbiting the Earth, and laments how he and his fellow extraterrestrials may never understand human life. Johnny and two of his fellow aliens then assume forms resembling a naked Tommy Wiseau and begin dancing, ending the game. Should the player collect each of the hidden spoons throughout the game, rather than simply dance during the climax the aliens fire a ray gun at Earth that reshapes the planet into a giant spoon. Reception Entertainment Weekly called the flash game \\"as addictive as scotchka!\\". The game has also received positive reviews from TIME, Wired, Destructoid, The Escapist, Bitmob, Infinite Lives, Westword, Game Culture, and Geeks of Doom. In co-star Greg Sestero's memoir, The Disaster Artist, Sestero stated that during the filming of The Room, he came up with the idea of having Mark be an undercover narcotics police officer to account for the disparate elements of his character, but the idea was rejected by Wiseau. Sestero \\"had a good laugh\\" when playing the game and seeing that its developers had given Mark a similar backstory by portraying him as a narcissistic hedonist.The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside the Room by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, pg. 196.

A British force blockading the Rappahannock River of Virginia sent several hundred men in boats to attack four American privateers. Ultimately the British were victorious and the American ships were captured.Scott, pg. 78-90 Background On April 1, 1813, a British squadron consisting of the ships- of-the-line and , four frigates , , and , two brigs, Mohawk and and one schooner, blockaded the Rappahannock from Lynhaven Bay. They held several American prizes and were out to capture more so the British commanders prepared a cutting out expedition, where small boats attempt to capture larger vessels at anchor. On the following day, the British dispatched seventeen, pinnaces, barges, launches, and other boats with a few carronades to sail around the bay. Each boat carried up to fifty marines or sailors mainly armed with steel, Lieutenant James Polkinghorne was in command. While abreast of Windmill Point at about 4:00 pm, the expedition sighted five American vessels and chased them all through the night until losing sight as they passed a turn in the river. The British had difficulty in rowing up the Rappahannock so during the descent twelve of the boats fell far behind leaving only five British craft, one 12-pounder and 105 officers and men to make the attack.Scott, pg. 78 Four of the pursued ships were armed schooners under Captain William S. Stafford in the twelve gun . The others were Lynx of six guns, Racer of six guns and Arab of seven guns. In all, the American schooners mounted 30 guns with 160 men.Roosevelt, pg. 98 Most or all of these vessels were built in Baltimore. Captain Stafford had little alternative but to scuttle the schooners or fight. He decided to offer resistance and anchored his ships in line of battle with portside guns facing the mouth of the Rappahannock where the British would originate.Scott, pg. 79 Battle A Baltimore Clipper, very similar to the American vessels captured on the Rappahannock. The largest of the American ships was Arab of over 380 tons but with a crew of only forty-five men, she was sternmost in line and was considered to be the most \\"war like\\" of the four. Dolphin of 300 tons was headmost and she was Captain Stafford's flagship, carrying ninety-eight men into battle. When the British came within sight of the American line, they first stopped to wait for the wind and the remaining twelve boats to come up so Polkinghorne took the time to rally his men. After a few more minutes the wind was still calm so the lieutenant ordered an attack in order to deny the Americans time to prepare defenses or escape. Polkinghorne sent a boat with the 12-pounder forward to commence an artillery duel with the intention of delaying the Americans but this failed when Stafford's ships all opened fire with a combined broadside. Lieutenant Polkinghorne decided to stop waiting at this point and he led his boats directly for the center two American ships, Racer and Lynx, each of 280 tons and with crews totaling seventy-six men. As the British closed range the Americans fired another broadside so Polkinghorne had his men alter course and head for Arab. When the British boats drew near there were three left, two having been hit and sunk by American fire.Scott, pg. 79-82 The remaining Britons boarded while shouting various phrases, Arab tacked to try to bring her starboard guns into battle but she was boarded before achieving this and so her commander ran her aground on the riverbank. Racer and Lynx were quickly taken, their crews surrendered as the British climbed on deck, others jumped over the side and escaped capture. When Polkinghorne went for Dolphin, Captain Stafford put up a stubborn fight and it reportedly took fifteen minutes to secure the vessel. Five Americans were wounded before Dolphin struck her colors and ended the battle, though casualties from the other privateers amounted to six killed and five more wounded. By the time the fighting was over the remaining British boats arrived and assisted in taking over 100 prisoners.Scott, pg. 82Maclay, pg. 467 Aftermath Polkinghorne reported that only two of his men were killed and eleven wounded, including himself.Scott, pg. 82 American newspaper reports in Niles Register at first claimed that fifty Britons had been killed,Niles Weekly Register Vol. IV, April 10, 1813, pg. 119, cited by editor in Scott, pg. 94 later reducing that claim to nineteen dead.Niles Weekly Register Vol. IV, May 1, 1813, pg. 149, cited by editor in Scott, pg. 94 A review by British and American historians later put the British losses at two dead and eleven wounded with American losses as sixteen killed and wounded.Roosevelt, pg. 98 The battle lasted in between fifteen minutes and two hours according to various accounts. Captain Stafford later returned to Baltimore. He was treated well in captivity partly due to his good treatment towards British prisoners from his captured prizes. Lynx was taken into British service as and was sold out of the Royal Navy in 1820. A replica of Lynx now spends its time on an educational mission sailing back and forth between the Great Lakes and Florida's Gulf Coast. Racer became and Dolphin retained her name as .

McKeever Brothers was built as a commercial steam \\"menhaden fisherman\\"-type fishing vessel of the same name by Robert Palmer & Sons at Noank, Connecticut, in 1911. In May 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from her owners, Steven W. McKeever and Edward J. McKeever, for use during World War I. Assigned the section patrol number 683, she was commissioned on 5 May 1917 as USS McKeever Brothers (SP-683). Her acquisition from the McKeevers apparently formally took place retrospectively on 18 May 1917. Assigned to the 4th Naval District and based at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, McKeever Brothers conducted coastal and minesweeping patrols in the Delaware River and Delaware Bay for the remainder of World War I. McKeever Brothers was decommissioned after the war, stricken from the Navy List on 22 May 1919, and sold on 1 July 1919. The ship was used as a private fishing vessel in the Chesapeake Bay, home-ported out of Shad Point, Maryland, along the Wicomico River into the early 1960s. After several years of inactivity, McKeever Brothers was towed down the Nanticoke River, and into a specially dug channel alongside the river, near the intersection of US Route 13 and Concord Rd in Seaford, Delaware. Once in place, the channel was backfilled, leaving the ship grounded. Following extensive alterations, McKeever Brothers opened to the public in 1968 as the Flagship Nanticoke Queen seafood restaurant. The ship operated in that capacity for several decades, under different owners and a few name changes. The facility last operated as the Nautico Restaurant, and closed sometime in the early 2000s. McKeever Brothers remains in place, in deteriorating condition. This was just demolished, in February 2020.

Track listing Concept After Iras had read Erian's Book, he discovered the secret that was threatening the known world from Nekrons 7th Black Book. During one of the final battles between heaven and hell; Thanor the Black Dragon had betrayed Nekron by telling the angels where the son of Kron was hidden to them. When Kron learned of Thanor's betrayal his rage cracked the Earth. Thanor was captured and tortured, but before being killed his eyes had been ripped out of his face. Iras and his companions finally understood. They remembered the stone dragon without eyes guarding Erians book inside the fortress of Har-Kuun, and realized it was indeed Thanor himself. After the Angels had defeated Nekron they banished him from the world and they took Thanor's eyes and turned them into two precious stones, Aelin and Mornir. Later the Angels scattered the stones across the known world to symbolically spread courage and wisdom in Thanor's name. Despite his dark past, Thanor sacrificed his life, to help the Angels' secure victory. As Iras read on, he also learned that on the day of the seventh eclipse the mystic energies of the eclipse would awaken the seven winged demons of Har-Kuun, who would the open the gates of hell and unleash Nekron from his prison. But Erian's book also revealed, that if on the same day Thanor had gotten his eyes back, the scream of his soul would quake the Earth and that he would be able to rise again to stop Nekron's evil plans. Despite the remaining pages missing due to Tarish's betrayal, what they needed to know for sure had been revealed to them. The two precious stones, Thanor's eyes, had to be found. After learning of these events, the Wizards of the White Dragons Order decreed that Iras along with his friends who braved the dangers of Har-Kuun had to travel to the borders of the known world to find the two stones. As the seventh eclipse approached, war was sounding on the horizon. The seven winged demons had been awakened and Nekron was released. Iras and his friends had been able to find the 2 stones and returned to Har-Kuun to place them in the empty spaces on Thanor's statue. Thanor had awakened, and rose from the abyss where Nekron had tortured him. After an epic battle, Thanor returned victorious from destroying the seven winged demons and Nekron, and returned to stone. With Iras and Dargor present, Thanor opened his eyes once again, and were brighter than ever. He chose Dargor to come with him into the afterlife. Dargor being half demon did not understand why he had been chosen, but it was the decision of the gods and angels, because he chose light over darkness despite his past. The Angels deemed him worthy.

Campbell (1828‚Äì1867) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War, and the last official commanding officer of the 66th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Pre-war activities Campbell was born in Virginia in 1828, and eventually moved to Terre Haute, Indiana. There he married Eliza J. Henbest. Later he moved to Paris, Illinois, where he pursued a career as a tailor. Correspondence in the files of the Adjutant General of Illinois, in the Illinois State Archives indicates that he was active in politics.Illinois State Archives, IL Adjutant Generals Office Civil War Records, Records Group 318, Letters of recommendation from distinguished citizens of Bureau County, to IL Adj Gen Fuller Civil War From August to September, 1861, he helped raise a company of men for military service, and reported to Benton Barracks at St. Louis, Missouri, for induction. He was appointed captain of Company E, Birge's Western Sharpshooters (later, the 66th Illinois). From December 1861, to February 3, 1862, he participated in the north central Missouri campaign. On February 4, 1862, with the rest of the regiment, Campbell embarked by steamboat, and was transported by river, finally disembarking at Fort Henry, Tennessee. From there, Campbell and regiment marched to Fort Donelson, where the regiment participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson. Later the next month, the regiment fought in the Battle of Shiloh on April 6‚Äì7, 1862, although Campbell was not present. The regiment participated in the Corinth Campaign, and served as provost guard in Corinth, Mississippi, after the Confederate commander, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard evacuated the city on the evening of May 29‚Äì30, 1862. In early October, a combined Confederate Army under Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn and Maj. Gen. Sterling Price attempted to recapture the city. The Western Sharpshooter fought a bitter skirmish, on October 4, 1862, the second day of Second Battle of Corinth against elements of the Confederate Missouri Brigade in the timber in front of the Federal lines. Col. Thomas W. Sweeny commander of the 52nd Illinois Infantry who observed the fight, declared that the Sharpshooters \\"fought like heroes\\".Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Series 1, Vol XVII, pt 1 p274 Captain Campbell was not present for the battle. The regiment was transferred to Illinois state control on November 20, 1862.

Campbell was not able to join his regiment in many of the battles of the Atlanta Campaign having been transferred to General Sweeny's staff. Captain William S. Boyd (Company A) carried out field command of the regiment during most of this period. Campbell was present at Decatur, Georgia, on July 22, 1864, where he was wounded. On September 15, 1864, Governor Yates promoted Campbell to lieutenant colonel. He was mustered out with the regiment on July 7, 1865.

It is concerned with how forces acting on the vehicle influence its speed and attitude with respect to time. For a fixed-wing aircraft, its changing orientation with respect to the local air flow is represented by two critical angles, the angle of attack of the wing(\\"alpha\\") and the angle of attack of the vertical tail, known as the sideslip angle(\\"beta\\"). A sideslip angle will arise if an aircraft yaws about its centre of gravity and if the aircraft sideslips bodily, i.e. the centre of gravity moves sideways.Flightwise - Volume 2 - Aircraft Stability And Control, Chris Carpenter 1997, Airlife Publishing Ltd., , p.145 These angles are important because they are the principal source of changes in the aerodynamic forces and moments applied to the aircraft. Spacecraft flight dynamics involve three main forces: propulsive (rocket engine), gravitational, and atmospheric resistance.Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent. Propulsive force and atmospheric resistance have significantly less influence over a given spacecraft compared to gravitational forces. Aircraft Axes to control the attitude of a plane Flight dynamics is the science of air-vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation with respect to the three aircraft's principal axes about its center of gravity, known as roll, pitch and yaw. Aircraft engineers develop control systems for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its center of gravity. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or moments about the center of gravity of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw. For example, a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the center of gravity of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down. Roll, pitch and yaw refer, in this context, to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined equilibrium state. The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level heeling angle on a ship. Yaw is known as \\"heading\\". A fixed-wing aircraft increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the angle of attack (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually \\"banks\\" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is streamlined from nose to tail to reduce drag making it advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though aircraft are deliberately \\"side-slipped\\" when landing in a cross-wind, as explained in slip (aerodynamics). Spacecraft and satellites Propulsive, aerodynamic, and gravitational force vectors acting on a space vehicle during launch The forces acting on space vehicles are of three types: propulsive force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); gravitational force exerted by the Earth and other celestial bodies; and aerodynamic lift and drag (when flying in the atmosphere of the Earth or another body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be controlled during powered atmospheric flight because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces. There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, solar power generation, communications, or astronomical observation). The flight dynamics of spacecraft differ from those of aircraft in that the aerodynamic forces are of very small, or vanishingly small effect for most of the vehicle's flight, and cannot be used for attitude control during that time. Also, most of a spacecraft's flight time is usually unpowered, leaving gravity as the dominant force.

Born in Flippin, Arkansas, Wood began his outdoors career as a fishing guide on numerous lakes and rivers in Arkansas, while maintaining a construction business and a cattle farm. Wood began to build lake boats in 1968 behind a service station. The business moved to an old nightclub; by 1970, Ranger Boats sold 1,200 units. The boats are considered to be the prototypes of what are now called bass boats. The facility was destroyed by fire in 1971, but Wood salvaged orders from his desk in the building and restarted. That same year, Wood qualified for the first-ever Bassmaster Classic. The next year, Wood signed a sponsorship deal with the tournament, making it the Classic's official boat from then until 2000. Wood sold Ranger Boats in 1987, but remained active in the industry. In 1996, the tournament organizer Operation Bass renamed itself with Wood's initials, a name it retains to this day. Wood is a member of the Professional Bass Fishing Hall of Fame, the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, the International Boating Hall of Fame, National Marine Manufacturers Hall of Fame, Legends of the Outdoors Hall of Fame, Arkansas Game and Fish Hall of Fame, Arkansas Walk of Fame, and the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 12, 2010. The episode follows the events caused by Stan Smith, as he gives his son Steve a rifle for Christmas, even though his wife Francine forbade him to. When Steve is practicing shooting, he accidentally kills a mall Santa. The family decides to bury the body in the woods, but it then turns out that it was the real Santa, who wants revenge by killing the Smiths. The episode was written by Erik Durbin and directed by Bob Bowen. It was slightly modeled after the film 300, and was first announced at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2010. It is the fourth American Dad! Christmas special, following in the footsteps of \\"The Best Christmas Story Never Told\\", \\"The Most Adequate Christmas Ever\\" and \\"Rapture's Delight.\\" The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics, with some of them praising its bloody themes, while others dismissed it for being crude and unoriginal. According to the Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 6.26 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Clancy Brown and Jeff Fischer, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. The episode features the song \\"Carol of the Bells\\" as performed by Pennsylvania metalcore band August Burns Red as its main theme. Plot Stan Smith continues to reject the idea that Jeff Fischer is now a member of the family despite Francine's suggestion that he should be included in their family traditions. Despite Francine's objections, Stan gives Steve an AK-47 assault rifle for Christmas and Steve accidentally shoots a mall Santa. Steve, in turn, is shattered emotionally and swears never to pick up a weapon again. Meanwhile, Roger goes off in search of the strongest whiskey possible and he is directed to a moonshiner in the Chimdale Mountains, named Bob Todd, who teaches him his ways. Stan convinces Steve to hide the body from Francine and try to find out whom the Santa was with his fingerprint, but his DNA is not in the CIA database. Stan dismisses this and doesn't investigate further. Francine quickly discovers the body, and as the family buries the body; she chastises them for not letting her cut off the hands and smash the teeth out; much to their chagrin. The next day they receive threatening letters, stating that someone knows what they did and that they will be punished. They watch the news and discover that no one really feels like it is Christmas, as if someone killed Santa. Feeling a little doubt they then dig up the body and discover it is gone. When an elf appears and tells them that it was actually the real Santa that they buried and that he was recovered and rejuvenated in a Star Wars Bacta Tank at the North Pole and vows vengeance on the Smiths, they decide to take refuge with Roger in the moonshiner's cabin where Bob Todd lives. Jeff arrives to spend the holiday with Hayley, much to Stan's displeasure. However, Santa soon arrives since Jeff wrote a letter telling him where they would be staying. Bob Todd reveals that his airplane-house is also an armory, which includes an M60 machine gun, two RPKs and an M16 assault rifle, to fend off an attack of endless waves of armed elves, flying reindeer, and an enormous snowman (reminiscent of a Cave Troll from Lord of the Rings) led by Santa. Francine snaps Steve out of his fears, ordering him to \\"pick up a gun this instant and send these toy makers to Hell!\\" and the family proceeds to defend themselves. Santa tries to convince Jeff to abandon the Smiths, recognizing that he was not involved in their plot to hide his body, and by offering a relic from The Golden Compass. Jeff walks to Santa's side, but then turns on him and is able to pull Stan who was injured to safety. While Jeff takes care of Stan; Jeff says he thinks Stan is an ass. But, the two agree on their love for Hayley, causing Stan to see Jeff as a true member of the family. The family is almost overrun, until Santa and his army are forced to retreat because they only had until Christmas morning to get vengeance. Santa disappears, leaving behind a letter warning them that he will return next year to take his revenge and kill them, while the Smith family realizes that they have found a new Christmas tradition. Production 210px \\"For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\\" was written by series regular Erik Durbin and directed by series regular Bob Bowen. The episode was the twenty-second to be produced in the season five production cycle. The first few minutes of the episode were previewed at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2010, but shown in black-and-white form. While writing the episode, the writers tried to come up with a bloody story. Writer Durbin said, \\"Everybody in the [writing] room kind of was talking about making it as bloody as possible, I think. It was just which movie were we going to model it after. [...] I think ‚Äò300‚Äô got thrown around the most, talking about trying to make it as bloody and cool as ‚Äò300.‚Äô\\" The episode had a TV-14 rating, and series co-creator Seth MacFarlane said that \\"no kids will ever see it\\", joking that \\"They follow those [content ratings] like the f-ing Bible.\\" He also said that the episode informs kids that \\"Santa really exists\\". He said, \\"Except that he‚Äôs a crazed murderer. But as long as the tradition is upheld, then I guess that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs important.\\" In August 2010, MacFarlane and the voice cast were present at the Television Critics Association (TCA) press tour in Los Angeles, promoting the hundredth episode, \\"100 A.D.\\" The event also included a table read of \\"For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\\", and Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote, \\"not much can really be said about the episode except that it includes a mass slaughter of elves.\\" The event also previewed the animation for the final act of the episode. The band August Burns Red's cover of \\"Carol of the Bells\\" was featured in the episode. Series regulars Matt McKenna and Erik Durbin provided the voice of Santa Claus and the moonshiner Bob Todd, respectively, while guest star Clancy Brown provided the voice of the liquor store manager. Cultural references The episode contains several pop culture references. The title of the episode \\"For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\\" is a parody of the novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls and the Metallica song inspired by the novel. The action sequence and bloody themes were slightly modeled after the film 300. When Bob Todd is teaching Roger moonshining, Roger jumps over barrels of moonshine, similar to the Donkey Kong video games. Frosty the Snowman appears in Santa's army, which is a reference to the cave-troll scene in Moria from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The elves are wrangling Frosty in with a collar and chains almost exactly like the scene from Fellowship. When Jeff confronts Santa, he stabs him with the polar bear helmet from the film The Golden Compass. When Santa arrives and finds them the song 'Carol of the Bells' by August Burns Red plays. You can see GH-7 Medical droids from Star Wars facilitating Santa's recuperation in a recovery tank, similar to the scene of Luke Skywalker recovering in the film The Empire Strikes Back. Reception \\"For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\\" was broadcast on December 12, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by an hour-long Christmas episode of creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's other show, Family Guy. It was viewed by 6.26 million viewers, according to the Nielsen ratings. The episode was up 18% in total viewership from the last episode. It also acquired a 3.1 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, up 24% from the previous episode. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and Family Guy that preceded the show, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"American Dad always thrives at this time of year, since it plays perfectly into Stan's idea of patriotism and Americana as a kind of religion, but the too-lengthy action sequence killed any humorous momentum the episode had built up.\\" She ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the second best of the night, behind the Family Guy episode \\"Road to the North Pole\\" and beating The Simpsons episode \\"Donnie Fatso\\". Jessica Russell of TV Guide Canada wrote that she was \\"already sick of holiday-themed episodes\\" due to their \\"feel- good, warm-and-fuzzy, family-oriented storylines.\\" However, she praised the episode for being \\"anti-Christmas\\", saying, \\"that‚Äôs why I give props to Seth MacFarlane and his crude minions for pulling off the ultimate anti-Christmas episode in last night‚Äôs American Dad.\\" In response to writer Durbin's goal to make it as \\"bloody and cool as 300\\", Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote that it was \\"bloody\\", but not \\"cool\\". He called the episode \\"just derivative trash\\", and compared the episode's themes to the film Bad Santa and the evil Robot Santa from Futurama. He concluded, saying, \\"as usual, \\"American Dad‚Äôs\\" Seth MacFarlane and his minions have done uninspired, unoriginal work that somehow mistakes crude for funny.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad was positive on the episode, and concluded saying, \\"[...] Santa will be back next year to try and finish the job.

Components of a converged infrastructure may include servers, data storage devices, networking equipment and software for IT infrastructure management, automation and orchestration. IT organizations use converged infrastructure to centralize the management of IT resources, to consolidate systems, to increase resource-utilization rates, and to lower costs. Converged infrastructures foster these objectives by implementing pools of computers, storage and networking resources that can be shared by multiple applications and managed in a collective manner using policy-driven processes.Overview of Converged Infrastructure IT vendors and IT industry analysts use various terms to describe the concept of a converged infrastructure. These include \\"converged system\\", \\"unified computing\\", \\"fabric-based computing\\", and \\"dynamic infrastructure\\". The evolution of data centers Historically, to keep pace with the growth of business applications and the terabytes of data they generate, IT resources were deployed in a silo-like fashion. One set of resources has been devoted to one particular computing technology, business application or line of business. These resources support a single set of assumptions and cannot be optimized or reconfigured to support varying usage loads. The proliferation of IT sprawl in data centers has contributed to rising operations costs, reducing productivity, and stifling agility and flexibility. Maintenance and operations can consume two-thirds of an organization's technology budget, according to a 2009 InformationWeek survey of executives in 500 companies with annual revenue over $250 million.InformationWeek Reports ::Research: 2009 InformationWeek 500 Report. Analytics.informationweek.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26. That leaves just a third of the budget for new IT initiatives. This ratio prevents IT from supporting new business initiatives or responding to real application demands. A converged infrastructure addresses the problem of siloed architectures and IT sprawl by pooling and sharing IT resources. Rather than dedicating a set of resources to a particular computing technology, application or line of business, converged infrastructure creates a pool of virtualized servers, storage and networking capacity that is shared by multiple applications and lines of business. Benefits of converged infrastructure Converged infrastructure provides both technical and business efficiencies, according to industry researchers and observers.Mani, Rahul Neel with Donatelli, Dave. \\"Converged Infrastructure Means Endless Possibilities,\\" InfoSec Island, August 5, 2010 These gains stem in part from the pre-integration of technology components, the pooling of IT resources and the automation of IT processes. Converged infrastructure further contributes to efficient data centers by enhancing the ability of cloud computing systems to handle enormous data sets, using only a single integrated IT management system Writing in CIO magazine, Forrester Research analyst Robert Whiteley noted that converged infrastructures, combining server, storage, and networks into a single framework, help to transform the economics [of] running the datacenter thus accelerating the transition to IP storage to help build infrastructures that are \\"cloud-ready\\".Whiteley, Robert. Forrester Research.\\"Your Next IT Budget: 6 Ways to Support Business Growth,\\" CIO Magazine , July 21, 2010 The combination of storage and compute into a single entity is known as converged storage.Davis, Jessica. \\"Pivot3 Offers Converged Storage Platform to Data Protection Market,\\" ChannelInsider, September 30, 2010. Decreased complexity, through the use of pre-integrated hardware with virtualization and automation management tools, is another important value proposition for converged infrastructure as noted in an IDC study.Broderick, Katherine and Scaramella, Jed. \\"Considering All of IT: Converged Infrastructure Survey Findings,\\" IDC, June 2010 In April 2012, the open source analyst firm Wikibon released the first market forecast for converged infrastructure,Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market by Storm - Wikibon with a projected $402B total available market (TAM) by 2017 of which, nearly 2/3rds of the infrastructure that supports enterprise applications will be packaged in some type of converged solution by 2017. InformationWeekCrump, George. \\"Why 'Unified' Is The Hot New Idea For Data Centers,\\" InformationWeek, March 14, 2009 highlighted the promise of two long-term advantages of a unified data center infrastructure: :1. Lower costs as the result of both: ::*lower capital expenses resulting from higher utilization, less cabling, and fewer network connections ::*lower operating costs resulting from reduced labor via automated data center management and a consolidating storage and network management infrastructure teams :2. Increased IT agility by: ::*virtualizing IP and Fibre Channel storage networking ::*allowing for single console management. Data centers around the world are reaching limits in power, cooling and space.Uptime Institute.\\"Many data centers running out of space this year or next,\\" May 23, 2011. At the same time, capital constraints are requiring organizations to rethink data center strategy. Converged infrastructure offers a solution to these challenges. Converged infrastructure and cloud computing Converged infrastructure can serve as an enabling platform for private and public cloud computing services, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

This bee is native to Europe, Asia and North Africa. It has recently been seen in regions of South America, New Zealand, and the Canary Islands. They are generalists, and do not seem to prefer any plant genera for foraging, although in New Zealand native plants are visited less frequently by this bee species. It was accidentally introduced into North America from Europe some time in the mid 20th century, first seen in 1963 near Ithaca, New York, and since then an invasive pest. Taxonomy and phylogeny This species belongs to the family Megachilidae and the order Hymenoptera, which consists of organisms such as ants, bees and wasps, and the superfamily Apoidea, which is more specific to bees and wasps. Description and identification 219x219px A female A. manicatum A male A. manicatum Anthidium manicatum is originally an Old World bee. It has a wingspan of approximately , with a body length of about for females, and for males.Anthidium manicatum (Linnaeus, 1758), Discover Life The males are substantially larger than females. A. manicatum are black and covered with yellow-grey hairs. Their faces and abdomen are covered in yellow spots. Male A. manicatum have a black head and thorax, coated with short yellowish brown hairs. The cheeks below the antennae, a small spot behind each eye, a bilobate spot on the clypeus, and the mandibles (except the apex) are yellow. The wings are dusky in color. The abdomen is black with grey hairs, with a band of brown hairs at each segment's apex as well as along their lateral margins. This feature distinguishes male A. manicatum from New World Anthidium species. There is a yellow spot on each side of the segments except the 7th. A second pair of spots is often seen on the disks of the 4th and 5th segments. There is a spine on each side of the 6th and 7th segments at the apex, the 7th having a third thin spine in the middle. The legs exhibit variegation of yellow and are covered with grey hairs. Female A. manicatum are smaller in size than the males, but have a similar color pattern. The abdominal spots are smaller and the apex is rounded. Female legs are almost completely black, with very small yellow spots. The anterior sides of the tarsal segments of each leg of female A. manicatum have fine, soft and small white-colored hairs. This pilosity occurs in most species of Anthidium in the Western Palearctic region. Male A. manicatum resemble A. maculosum in appearance. The two species have similar spiniform pygidia, as well as largely rounded sixth sterna (although that of A. manicatum is more so). Distribution and habitat Anthidium manicatum is found in parts of Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America. It has also recently been documented in the Canary Islands, and South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. As of 2006, this species is also now established in New Zealand. Apoidea (Insecta: Hymenoptera). Fauna of New Zealand 57. This insect was accidentally introduced into the United States from Europe sometime prior to 1963, when it was discovered in New York State. It has since spread from the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada across the United States to California, where it was first collected in 2007.Anthidium manicatum ‚Äì Definition and Scientific Information ‚Äì Page 1 This species' tendency to occupy ready-made nesting sites, usually movable objects, allows it to spread to new locations easily. In Europe, this species is normally found in gardens, fields, and meadows in the southern part of Wales and England, but is localized in other places within the United Kingdom, where they can be seen from May to September. A. manicatum is the only species of the genus Anthidium that can be found in England. Nesting 'Wooly' trichomes as seen on Stachys byzantina, used by A. manicatum for nest construction. Being a member of the Anthidiini tribe of megachilid bees, A. manicatum engages in highly elaborate nesting behavior. These bees construct their nests in preexisting cavities, using the trichomes of wooly plants. Female A. manicatum use their mandibles, which are sharply toothed, to remove trichomes from the stems and leaves of various plants. They then roll up the trichomes into a ball and bring them to a preexisting cavity. Inside the cavity, the bees fashion the trichome ball into cells, where they deposit an egg as well as a provisioning mass consisting of nectar and pollen. The female creates several cells in a cavity. Once finished, she seals the entrance to the cavity with a terminal plug, which consists of inorganic and organic materials that she brings to the nest. Females collect \\"down\\" from such plants as lamb's ears (Stachys byzantina). They scrape the hairs from the leaves and carry them back to their nests bundled beneath their bodies. There it is used as a lining for their nest cavities.Anthidium manicatum ‚Äì Wool Carder Bee Females tend to build their nests at high locations. This may be in order to minimize the nest's exposure to parasites and predators. This may also be to avoid nest usurpation by other female A. manicatum. Materials Besides trichomes, other materials used by female A. manicatum for building brood cells include mud, stones, resin, and leaves. Some of the plant materials that are collected are hydrophobic, a feature that may serve an anti-microbial function for the nest. Females smear a plant substrate, plant extrafloral trichome secretions, on brood cells. The primary material used to build the cells are plant hairs, or \\"wool\\" (hence the name \\"wool carder bee\\"), that is collected from the stems and leaves of plants. Females largely use the hairs of Lamiaceae, especially those of the genus Betonica or Stachys. Additionally, females use specialized hair-like structures on the exterior of their tarsi to absorb the secretions of the plant hairs to apply onto the brood cells. These secretions are obtained from different species, such as Anthirrinum, Crepis, and Pelargonium. Behavior Anthidium manicatum asleep in a flower Mating behavior The mating system of A. manicatum is unlike those of most other bees. Females exhibit polyandry and continuously mate throughout their reproductive life. The interval of time between copulations amongst different males can be as short as 35 seconds in length. Males exhibit resource defense polygyny. A. manicatum display extreme polyandry, which is linked to male territoriality and resource defence of flowering plants. Males claim patches of floral plants, aggressively ward off conspecific males, bees, and other resource competitors, and mate with the females who forage in their territories. Copulations occur repeatedly and regularly in both sexes. Males that are unable to defend their own territory (usually because of their relatively small size) utilize an alternative ‚Äòsneaking‚Äô tactic. These unfit males receive fewer copulation opportunities than females. Such mating and territorial behaviour in bees has also been observed in Anthidiellum notatum, Anthidiellum perplexum, and Anthidium banningense. However, males of the genus Anthidiellum chase away intruders rather than physically attacking them, so their aggressive behaviour differs significantly. Resource defence and aggression The territorial mating behaviour of male A. manicatum occurs when foraging resources are amassed, allowing for monopolization and defence of territories by individual males. Resource defence, as exhibited by male A. manicatum, has been thought to benefit females by reducing foraging competition for pollen and nectar. The rate a female visits a territory is highly correlated with the number of flowers in that area. If females forage in sites that are being defended by males and the cost of additional matings is low for female members, then male resource defence and female polyandry may co-evolve. Male A. manicatum display highly aggressive behaviour. Males are highly aggressive towards each other as well as other visitors to the flowers in its territory. In the process of obtaining and defending flowering plant territories, males will regularly patrol their territory and attack conspecific males and heterospecific pollinators. This typically consists of brief aggressive \\"tackles\\" but they will sometimes lethally injure the pollinators as a result of their aggressiveness. The territorial behaviour of males develops after a period of flight without any localisation in search of a suitable flower patch. They will also defend conspecific females, although they do harass them by holding them immobile and repeatedly attempting to mate. Late male sperm precedence Studies show that there appears to be no selection pressure on male A. manicatum to be the first to copulate, and hence no (or very little) selection pressure to emerge before females. This is due to the females' polyandrous behaviour, and can also be attributed to a phenomenon called \\"'Late' male sperm precedence\\". Patterns of sperm use by the females determine the benefits of resource defence for males. If the female uses only the sperm from her first copulation in a breeding season, then selection will not favor the ‚Äòsit-and-wait‚Äô strategy of resource defence for the males over strategies that are pre-emptive, such as patrolling nest sites. However, if delayed mating can still ensure a high probability of procreating, then the resource defence strategy will be favoured. ‚ÄòLate male sperm precedence‚Äô, or LMSP, is an experimental situation in which two males mate in sequence with a female and the second male will hold paternity of over 50% of the female's offspring. Although females do have a spermatheca for long-term sperm storage, more recent mates tend to father the brood she produces. This phenomenon might be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including sperm digestion or removal by the female, removal by the next male, or stratification of sperm from different males in the sperm storage organ of the female (i.e. the last sperm in is the first to come out). Studies have shown that A. manicatum males that copulate late in a sequence have a greater than average chance of paternity of the female's eggs. Late male sperm precedence may have fostered the evolution of resource defence in A. manicatum males. Diet and foraging behavior Anthidium manicatum consumes the pollen from flowers of varying families. They are thus considered to be generalists. They visit garden flowers and weeds preferring blue flowers that have long throats with Old World origins. Both males and females can maintain a precise static hover near flowers similar to flies in the family Syrphidae. Sexual dimorphism Unlike most other species of Hymenoptera, male A. manicatum are larger than females in size, displays male-biased sexual dimorphism. The selection for larger size in males may have resulted due to their aggressive territorial behavior and subsequent differential mating success. Although it does not tear other males apart, the abdominal armature of a male A. manicatum may have been developed due to territorial aggression, rather than for mating purposes. Male size has been found to correlate with mating success. Smaller males will implement alternative mating tactics if they cannot defeat larger males for territory. The mating behavior of male A. manicatum can be determined by relative body size to other conspecific males. Territory owners are larger in size than wanderers, and copulate with females more frequently as well. The number of copulations a male territory owner can achieve varies based on the size of the territory ‚Äì males with larger territories generally achieve more copulations than those with smaller territories. This difference may be due to the energy expenditure of smaller bees to defend their territory from larger males, the inability of small males to mate on their territory, or female choice of larger males (regardless of territory size). Hence the number of copulations a male obtains is positively correlated with territory quality as well as male size.

She studied piano with Johann Peter Pixis, Theodor Dohler, Sigismond Thalberg and Bernhard Molique and composition with opera composer Saverio Mercadante. In 1870 Gabriel went for an extended stay at Glamis Castle in the Scottish Lowlands, and was reportedly responsible, among others, for later accounts of the castle's \\"secret\\" having to do with a mysterious occupant, the Monster of Glamis. Gabriel wrote popular ballads which established her reputation as a songwriter and composer. Although women songwriters were well accepted in the 19th century and she had no problems in getting her songs published, she struggled to get publishers for her more serious compositions. For example, she had to pay for self- publication of her cantata Dreamland. Although her songwriting style was Romantic, her songs always reflected ability and inventiveness because of her strength as a serious composer. Gabriel married her librettist George March in 1874, who was employed by the Foreign Office. The Times reported that she died in 1877 from \\"injuries sustained by a fall from a carriage\\".

Description Stratiformis is responding to the local labor history of the Historic Third Ward. Reliable Knitting Works was a knitting company that created wool hats, gloves and hockey stockings. It was the last company to create these goods in the United States. The company and its president, Isabelle Prolacheck, were instrumental in creating the characteristics of The Historic Third Ward, as we know it today. It was once at risk of becoming a red light district. Prolacheck donated old knitting machines for this project. Hand labor is a key theme in Stratiformis. The salvaged knitting machines bear traces of wear by their operators, and the artist left bits of stray yarn and thread connected to some of the machine parts to evoke a sense of warmth associated with knit goods. The steel is hand-welded to assure longevity. The galvanized and copper wires were hand-wrapped and then hand-filed. A sealant is applied by hand at regular intervals to prevent excessive rust.

Lane is serving an 18-year prison sentence and will be eligible for parole on 12 May 2024, after serving a period of 13 years and five months in custody. On 18 April 2011, Lane's lawyers lodged an appeal against her conviction at the same time as a Sydney taxi driver alleged he saw Lane dispose of the child. Her final application for appeal was rejected by the High Court in August 2014.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-15/keli-lane-loses-application-to- appeal-against-murder-conviction/5673402 Early life Lane is the daughter of Sandra Lane, a former hospital worker at Manly Hospital, and Robert Lane, a retired police officer. Educated at Mackellar Girls High School in Manly, Lane enrolled in an arts degree at the University of Newcastle from which she dropped out and then went on to study at the Australian College of Physical Education while working part-time at Ravenswood School for Girls as a water polo coach. She went on to hold a position as sports convener at Ravenswood where her credentials are listed in the school year book as a degree qualified teacher with honours. Between 1994 and 1998, she was in a relationship with rugby union player Duncan Gillies. An elite water polo player at national and international level, Lane was a member of the silver medal-winning Australian Junior Women's team at the 1995 World Championships in Quebec, Canada in which she competed just months after giving birth to her first child, whom she gave up for adoption. Tegan Lane On 12 September 1996, Lane, aged 21, gave birth to Tegan Lee Lane at Auburn Hospital. Less than two days after giving birth, Lane left the hospital with Tegan at around 11 am-12 pm and by 3 pm, Lane arrived at her parents home alone. A few hours later, on the same day that Tegan was last seen by her mother, Lane attended a friend's wedding all dressed in white with her partner Gillies. There was no sign or mention of baby Tegan. In 1999, 25 weeks pregnant with her third child, Lane flew to Queensland to seek a late term abortion. She was refused due to the foetus being of a viable gestation. Three months later, in May 1999, Lane gave birth to a boy who she decided to put up for adoption as she did with her first child in 1995. Lane advised a social worker that this was her first child and that Gillies was the father. Gillies denied the claims. Department of Community Services investigations Prior to finding a permanent home for this child, the Department of Community Services (DOCS) child protection worker, John Borovnik, made further investigations that led to finding that the child born in 1999 was in fact not Lane's first child and that she had given birth in 1996 at Auburn Hospital. Further investigations revealed that Lane had also given birth in 1995, during her four-year relationship with Gillies. Gillies claimed he was completely unaware of Lane's pregnancies. When confronted with these allegations in October 1999, Lane initially denied the existence of the two earlier children. Several days later, she claimed that her daughter was living with a family in Perth. Concerned about the situation, Borovnik alerted the local police who began investigations in late 1999. Initial police investigations In February 2001, Lane, who by now was seven months pregnant with her fourth child, was interviewed by police. During the police interview, Lane claimed that she had given Tegan to the baby's father, a man called Andrew Norris (or Morris), with whom she claimed to have had a brief affair. According to Lane, the affair took place at a unit block in Balmain on Friday nights after a drinking session at the Town Hall pub (\\"The Townie\\"). Lane alleges in her police interviews Norris's long-term partner, Melanie, also lived there as she often saw female apparel strewn around the unit. According to Lane, Melanie was in retail although she was not present at the unit on Friday nights. During police interviews, Lane claimed that she felt forced to hide her pregnancies because of her fear of the reaction of her parents and friends as according to investigations she could not be sure who any of the fathers of the babies might be. She told police she handed the baby over to Norris in the Auburn Hospital car park but later changed this story to state it was inside the hospital foyer. It was reported that during the police interviews Lane said several times she felt alone when she became pregnant and told her mother in an intercepted phone call \\"I had no other choice\\", referring to why she gave baby Tegan to Norris. Manly Police referred the matter to the New South Wales Coroner in 2005. Coronial inquest A coronial inquest into the disappearance of Tegan Lane began in June 2005 and ran until February 2006. The inquest was presided over by the State Coroner, John Abernethy, and heard that police had undertaken an extensive search for the child, including attempting to match DNA samples. The inquest resulted in the coroner declaring that he was \\"... comfortably satisfied that Tegan Lane is in fact deceased...\\" and that he was concerned that Tegan had met with foul play, although he also stated that there still existed a possibility that she was alive somewhere. The Coroner ordered that a birth certificate would be issued for Tegan and recommended that the brief of evidence and transcript of the coronial inquiry be forwarded to the New South Wales Homicide Squad for assessment and if necessary further investigation. Subsequent police investigations From 2006, police investigations focused on locating Norris, Melanie (Mel), and Noeline (Nana) Norris, Andrew Norris's mother, all alleged to have participated in or witnessed carriage of baby Tegan from Auburn Hospital. Despite nine documented versions of what happened that day, it was reported that police were unable to locate any persons who matched those profiles. Sightings of Norris were reported at the Sydney Aquarium but discounted as according to Caroline (Carol) Meldrum Hanna on the ABC Exposed Documentary post screening, Lane had told her \\"Andrew had no interest in water\\". Police also sought to locate Tegan Lane by searching the records of over 9,000 primary schools in Australia ‚Äì a search process that lasted two years. Two girls named Tegan Lane were found in Queensland and another possibility was picked up on a Torres Strait island. Finally, police excluded all possible leads. The police investigators, assessing that they had no conclusive evidence or any physical evidence pointing to baby Tegan's death, decided not to charge Lane; however, they referred the matter to the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Nicholas Cowdery. In what the National Times described as \\"an unusual step\\", on 17 November 2009, the DPP charged Lane with the murder of Tegan Lane. Lane pleaded not guilty, and the matter went to trial by jury. Trial process and criminal finding The matter was heard in the Supreme Court; presided over by Justice Anthony Whealy; with Mark Tedeschi, QC as the Crown Prosecutor; and Keith Chapple, SC defending Lane under instruction from Legal Aid; and began on 9 August 2010. The Crown alleged that Lane became pregnant five times over seven years during the 1990s; terminating the first two pregnancies, placing two babies up for adoption, and allegedly murdering her baby, Tegan, on 14 September 1996. The jury heard that Lane concealed her pregnancies from her family and friends in order to protect her personal image and reputation. According to Supreme Court judge Peter Hammill, who acted in her defence in 2006, images would have been destroyed by revelations of the salaciousness of her sex life centering around numerous rugby players from The Manly Marlins club over which Robert Lane presided. The evidence heard at the trial was similar to that presented at the inquest four years earlier. The major differences were the police searches that occurred in between, and the discovery that Lane had left Auburn Hospital not at 2 pm on the day Tegan disappeared, but several hours earlier. The Crown produced evidence that, as a motive for murder, Lane was prepared to abandon her children at birth to increase her chances of representing Australia in water polo at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. There was also evidence she believed children would interfere with her educational plans, her social life, and the regard in which she was held by parents and friends. It was also alleged that her friends' wedding on 14 September may have been a crucial factor; as Lane sought a permanent solution to a potential problem to hide evidence of the pregnancy and birth from family and friends. Lane's defence rested on the lack of evidence about how or where Tegan might have been killed. The defence claimed that, even if Lane had killed Tegan, the Crown could not prove she had done so deliberately or with the intention to kill. On 13 December 2010 the jury found Lane guilty of lying under oath in relation to documents dealing with her adopting out two other babies. The jury was not able to come to a unanimous verdict on the murder charge. Under advice from Whealy, the jury was given the option of returning a majority of 11 to one verdict. A little later on the same day, the jury found Lane guilty of murder of Tegan Lane. Lane was refused bail. Sentencing Sentence procedures commenced on 11 March 2011, again in the Supreme Court before Whealy, with the Crown calling for the court to pay particular regard to general deterrence. It was reported that psychiatrist Michael Diamond, who appeared before the hearing on behalf of the Crown, found no evidence of a psychiatric disorder and that Lane's decisions appeared to be based on \\"problem solving\\". On 15 April 2011, Lane was sentenced to 18 years' jail with a non-parole period of 13 years and five months. She will be eligible for parole on 12 May 2023. Appeal and aftermath Lawyers acting for Lane lodged an appeal against her conviction on 18 April 2011. The same day, claims were aired in the media that a taxi driver saw Lane dump the baby in bushland, en route to Manly. Some news reports allege that, since being jailed, Lane has been bashed by other inmates, causing facial injuries. Lane has responded by denying such incidents.http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8527203/baby-killer-lane-denies- being-bashed An appeal was lodged and was heard in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal between July and December 2013. The court dismissed the appeal, commenting that the there was \\"ample\\" evidence available to the jury of Lane's guilt. Lane made a further application for leave to appeal to the High Court, and that application was rejected in August 2014.  Exposed: The Case of Keli Lane  In September 2018, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired a three part documentary, an opinion piece, which featured interviews with Lane, conducted via numerous six-minute telephone calls from inside jail of which a small percentage were included and edited down for production space. It was the first time that Lane had given interviews about the case, having approached journalist Caro Meldrum-Hanna via a letter on the advice of Michele Ruyters and the BOHII (Bridge of Hope Innocence Initiative) at the RMIT. Through interviews with experts, witnesses, family members and acquaintances of Lane, and the intensive re-examination of evidence, the program cast doubt on the soundness of Lane's trial and subsequent conviction. The program also detailed instances of slut-shaming and media bias that may have prejudiced the case. Following the release of the documentary, academics subsequently called for an urgent review of Lane's case. The BOHII under Michele Ruyters were to petition the Attorney General in December 2018 an attempt to be granted a review of the case. The petition is being led by the RMIT's Innocence Initiative, which believes the case against Lane was a miscarriage of justice. No information has been forthcoming regarding the progress of this petition so far. In 2019, the ABC documentary was criticised by trial lawyer and author Simon Davis. Davis analysed the trial and concluded it was fair and the conviction was overwhelming. Davis fact-checked the documentary and identified numerous inaccuracies.

Early life Dooley was born in Manhattan, New York to Winnie Holzman, a writer, and Paul Dooley, an actor. Dooley has said that her mother's work on My So Called Life, \\"doing some groundbreaking stuff with gay teenagers,\\" helped her to come out as queer herself to her parents. She attended Bennington College, where she studied screenwriting and video production, and graduated in 2007. Career Dooley was still in college when television producer Robin Schiff, a family friend, asked Dooley in 2007 to script a television film for ABC Family based on Sasha Paley's novel Huge, about a group of teenagers at a weight-loss camp. Schiff had been interested in directing the adaptation but, having been Dooley's longtime writing mentor, wanted her to write the script. Dooley completed the script but ABC Family dropped the project when the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike began in November 2007 and halted development. When the strike ended, Dooley began to work on several other projects, including a pilot for CBS which was never picked up. In 2009, ABC Family approached Dooley again about rewriting her adaptation of Huge as a 10-episode television series. Since Schiff was unable to work full-time on the show and the network wanted an experienced producer, Dooley suggested that her mother Winnie Holzman join the show as a writer and producer. Huge also features Dooley's father Paul Dooley in a small acting role as the camp cook and her uncle Ernest Holzman as the director of photography. Dooley co-wrote and directed a short film, Snapshot, with Miranda Sajdak, about the first meeting between a girl's mother and her prom date, which premiered at the 2010 Outfest.

Founded in 1935 by Simon Ackerman, a tailor born in Russia who immigrated to the United States, and presently owned by Prominent Europe. The business provided ready-to-wear clothes, as well as made-to- measure tailoring. History At the turn of the 20th century, Simon Ackerman left Kaunas, Russia for New York City. Having built up a high-priced, quality tailoring business in and around New York, in 1935 he decided that he wanted to import quality British-made suits for the US market. He traveled to England, founding Chester Barrie in 1935 and opening a factory in Crewe in Cheshire - midpoint between cloth mills of Huddersfield and the Port of Liverpool. His aim was to create ready-to-wear tailoring, that was of the same quality and had the same attention to detail as the bespoke tailors of Savile Row but without the wait and high cost. Suits for export had the button holes un-finished, where by sending them back to the United States unfinished thus avoided the import duty. The factory was opened in Chestnut Grove under the name Chester Barrie, based on combining: *Chester, the city and county town of the location he choose for his factory *Barrie, the surname of children's fiction writer J. M. Barrie, who wrote Peter Pan. In 1937, the business opened a store on Savile Row. The following year Ackerman returned to the United States, placing his son Myron in charge of the British business. The business's growth continued until late 1939 and the start of World War II when the factory's production turned to the war effort, eventually picking up a contract to produce officers' uniforms for the US Army in Europe, after the United States entered the war post the attack on Pearl Harbor. Post-war, business picked up, and in 1949 the factory moved into no longer needed sections of the Rolls-Royce Crewe factory, which itself had been constructed pre-war as a shadow factory to mass-produce the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The new capacity allowed the firm to expand, including supplying its product to Harrods after Myron sent his own sales people in initially to promote the product. Ackerman was very wise in his promotional activity, engaging popular movie stars including Cary Grant and popular figures including Sir Winston Churchill, backing this up with practical and relatively affordable style. Having sold across Europe and the former Commonwealth Empire since 1955, in 1961 the company moved to a new factory in Crewe, to allow the Bentley Motors business to expand. In 1978, the Ackerman family sold the business to the Austin Reed Group, by which time the business was employing 470 people, selling to Harrods, Selfridges, Turnbull & Asser and Saks Fifth Avenue, in Manhattan, New York. Austin Reed started using the factory to produce a number of other brands beside Chester Barrie, and from 1981 started to produce the ready-to-wear stock for fellow Savile Row tailor H. Huntsman. In 1989 the company won the Queen's Award for Export Achievement, and in 1998 started making the purple label suits for Polo Ralph Lauren. Present As the dot.com boom decline hit world markets, the demand for bespoke suits declined. In financial troubles, Austin Reed sold the loss-making Chester Barrie business to Thompson Holdings (Richard Thompson) in 2000. After the business went in receivership in 2002, the Crewe factory sold to former management, trading as the Cheshire Clothing Company, who later moved to a new factory. SRG Group plc acquired the Chester Barrie Brand and worldwide licensing rights, and engage CCC to manufacture top-end bespoke suits. In 2006, CCC itself went into receivership and closed. A new independent manufacturing company was formed in Crewe, Cheshire Bespoke, who again widened their manufacturing offering to supply ranges for brands including Ozwald Boateng. In 2007, the ownership of the Chester Barrie brand and worldwide licensing rights were sold to Prominent Europe. This has given the brand a new lease of life, while the relationship with Cheshire Bespoke is much diminished. Chester Barrie ran a number of concessions within department stores across the UK - including Harvey Nichols, Austin Reed, John Lewis and House of Fraser - where they offered their ready-to-wear tailoring as well as a Made To Measure service. The product offer was expanded to include shirts and ties plus a more \\"dress-down\\" selection, reflecting the shift in styles of dressing.. The presence of other brands, introduced to the portfolio in 2015 (and sold in the same locations), with arguably stronger identities and a wider-global appeal (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43140996) ensured a continued dilution of the Chester Barrie identity in a changing-modern market. Chester Barrie's then-Buyer, Chris Modoo, doubled-down on the classic English look, bringing in Edward Sexton to help with the development of the brand's \\"block\\" (https://mensflair.com/an-interview-wirth-christopher-modoo-chester-barrie- savile-row/ http://www.twenty6magazine.com/issue-l/london-tailors/interview- christopher-modoo-chester-barrie). However, this alienated the brand from the \\"mainstream\\" stores it had concessions in, which saw competitors, and the market as a whole, moving to softer-shouldered garments, a more contemporary silhouette and more lifestyle-led; and in 2017 Chris Modoo was made redundant by Prominent Europe. However, a new creative direction saw the brand split into three distinctive categories: Chester by Chester Barrie (an entry level version of the brand, primarily sold in John Lewis), Chester Barrie Black Label (primarily sold in the House of Fraser concessions) and Chester Barrie Gold Label (sold in the flagship Savile Row store). It was hoped the \\"halo effect\\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect of the high end product would filter down from the gold label to the other lines. There was some initial success, with a bumper year in 2018, as gross sales for Prominent Europe began to soar,https://www.drapersonline.com/news/prominent-revenue- soars-as-profit-drops however this growth was down to the business having opened more locations in House of Fraser and less about the Chester Barrie brand itself, this was in spite of a ¬£100,000 re-fit of the flagship (https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/chester-barrie-to-refurbish-savile-row- store/2018081334164 https://www.menswearstyle.co.uk/2018/09/28/chester-barrie- newly-refurbished-savile-row-store/8302). However, in October 2019 Prominent Europe announced to its Chester Barrie staff that they were under threat of redundancy as they looked to restructure the overall business https://www.drapersonline.com/news/chester-barrie-owner-reviews-brand-strategy and in January 2020, Prominent Europe made the decision to close its branded business,https://www.drapersonline.com/news/chester-barrie-owner-closes- branded-business/7038396.article with the closure of the Savile Row flagship (the building has since been taken up by Daisy Knatchbull https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-54470547) and it being exited from the aforementioned department stores. The last remaining store is the Chester Barrie outlet in York, which is scheduled to close in early 2021. It is unknown if there is a buyer in place to salvage the brand.

It is the most general metric theory of gravity yielding conserved second order equations of motion in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions D. In this sense, Lovelock's theory is the natural generalization of Einstein's General Relativity to higher dimensions. In three and four dimensions (D = 3, 4), Lovelock's theory coincides with Einstein's theory, but in higher dimensions the theories are different. In fact, for D > 4 Einstein gravity can be thought of as a particular case of Lovelock gravity since the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action is one of several terms that constitute the Lovelock action. Lagrangian density The Lagrangian of the theory is given by a sum of dimensionally extended Euler densities, and it can be written as follows : \\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n=0}^{t}\\\\alpha _{n}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{R}^{n}, \\\\qquad \\\\mathcal{R}^{n}=\\\\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\\\delta _{\\\\alpha _{1}\\\\beta_{1}... \\\\alpha _{n}\\\\beta _{n}}^{\\\\mu _{1} u _{1}...\\\\mu _{n} u_{n}} \\\\prod\\\\limits_{r=1}^{n}R_{\\\\quad \\\\mu _{r} u _{r}}^{\\\\alpha _{r}\\\\beta _{r}} where RŒºŒΩŒ±Œ≤ represents the Riemann tensor, and where the generalized Kronecker delta Œ¥ is defined as the antisymmetric product : \\\\delta _{\\\\alpha _{1}\\\\beta _{1} \\\\cdots \\\\alpha _{n}\\\\beta _{n}}^{\\\\mu _{1} u _{1}...\\\\mu _{n} u _{n}}=(2n)!\\\\delta _{\\\\lbrack \\\\alpha _{1}}^{\\\\mu _{1}}\\\\delta _{\\\\beta _{1}}^{ u _{1}}\\\\cdots \\\\delta _{\\\\alpha _{n}}^{\\\\mu _{n}}\\\\delta _{\\\\beta _{n}]}^{ u _{n}}. Each term \\\\mathcal{R}^{n} in \\\\mathcal{L} corresponds to the dimensional extension of the Euler density in 2n dimensions, so that these only contribute to the equations of motion for n < D/2. Consequently, without lack of generality, t in the equation above can be taken to be for even dimensions and for odd dimensions. Coupling constants The coupling constants Œ±n in the Lagrangian \\\\mathcal{L} have dimensions of [length]2n ‚àí D, although it is usual to normalize the Lagrangian density in units of the Planck scale :\\\\alpha _{1}=(16\\\\pi G)^{-1}=l_{P}^{2-D}\\\\,. Expanding the product in \\\\mathcal{L}, the Lovelock Lagrangian takes the form : \\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\ (\\\\alpha _{0}+\\\\alpha _{1}R+\\\\alpha _{2}\\\\left( R^{2}+R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\mu u }R^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\mu u }-4R_{\\\\mu u }R^{\\\\mu u }\\\\right) +\\\\alpha _{3}\\\\mathcal{O}(R^{3})), where one sees that coupling Œ±0 corresponds to the cosmological constant Œõ, while Œ±n with n ‚â• 2 are coupling constants of additional terms that represent ultraviolet corrections to Einstein theory, involving higher order contractions of the Riemann tensor RŒºŒΩŒ±Œ≤. In particular, the second order term :\\\\mathcal{R}^{2}=R^{2}+R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\mu u }R^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\mu u}-4R_{\\\\mu u }R^{\\\\mu u } is precisely the quadratic Gauss‚ÄìBonnet term, which is the dimensionally extended version of the four-dimensional Euler density. Equations of motion By noting that :T = \\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\mathcal R^2 = \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left(R^2 + R_{\\\\mu u\\\\rho\\\\sigma} R^{\\\\mu u\\\\rho\\\\sigma} - 4 R_{\\\\mu u} R^{\\\\mu u}\\\\right) is a topological constant, we can eliminate the Riemann tensor term and thus we can put the Lovelock Lagrangian into the form :S = - \\\\int d^Dx \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left( \\\\alpha R_{\\\\mu u} R^{\\\\mu u} - \\\\beta R^2 + \\\\gamma \\\\kappa^{-2} R\\\\right) which has the equations of motion :\\\\alpha\\\\left( - \\\\frac{1}{2} R_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} R^{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} g_{\\\\mu u} - abla_ u abla_\\\\mu R - 2 R_{\\\\rho u\\\\mu\\\\sigma} R^{\\\\sigma\\\\rho} + \\\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\Box R + \\\\Box R_{\\\\mu u} \\\\right) + \\\\beta \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} R^2 g_{\\\\mu u} - 2 R R_{\\\\mu u} - 2 abla_ u abla_\\\\mu R + 2 g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\Box R \\\\right) + \\\\gamma \\\\left( - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\kappa^{-2} Rg_{\\\\mu u} + \\\\kappa^{-2} R_{\\\\mu u} \\\\right)=0. Other contexts Because Lovelock action contains, among others, the quadratic Gauss‚ÄìBonnet term (i.e. the four-dimensional Euler characteristic extended to D dimensions), it is usually said that Lovelock theory resembles string-theory-inspired models of gravity. This is because a quadratic term is present in the low energy effective action of heterotic string theory, and it also appears in six- dimensional Calabi‚ÄìYau compactifications of M-theory. In the mid 1980s, a decade after Lovelock proposed his generalization of the Einstein tensor, physicists began to discuss the quadratic Gauss‚ÄìBonnet term within the context of string theory, with particular attention to its property of being ghost- free in Minkowski space. The theory is known to be free of ghosts about other exact backgrounds as well, e.g. about one of the branches of the spherically symmetric solution found by Boulware and Deser in 1985. In general, Lovelock's theory represents a very interesting scenario to study how the physics of gravity is corrected at short distance due to the presence of higher order curvature terms in the action, and in the mid-2000s the theory was considered as a testing ground to investigate the effects of introducing higher-curvature terms in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.

He was one of the first members of the famous Impressionist colony in Giverny, France and was a prominent teacher in Hartford, Connecticut, St. Louis, Missouri and San Antonio, Texas. Dawson- Watson was a versatile artist, and made significant contributions to the American Arts & Crafts Movement, first in Boston, Massachusetts and then in Woodstock, New York.Dawson Dawson-Watson, The Cactus Impressionist, Jeffrey Morseburg, Texas Wildflower Paintings website His works are on display in the Witte Museum in San Antonio and at the San Antonio Art League. Childhood and studies Dawson Dawson-Watson was born in the London suburb of St. John's Wood, then in Middlesex, on June 21, 1864.See The Cactus Impressionist article He came from an artistic family. His father John Dawson Watson (1832‚Äì1892) was a famous illustrator who did illustrations for Robinson Crusoe and Arabian Nights. His grandfather Dawson Watson was a talented amateur artist. His uncle Thomas J. Watson (1847‚Äì1912) was also a well recognized painter and his aunt was married to the Victorian painter Myles Birket Foster (1825‚Äì1899). Dawson- Watson grew up in St. John's Wood surrounded by artists, writers and figures from the British aesthetic movement. He was a child prodigy whose first work was accepted by the Royal Academy at the age of sixteen.The Cactus Impressionist essay goes into this extensively. His father and an American artist Mark Fisher (1841‚Äì1923) were his first teachers. A wealthy brewer from Manchester paid for his art studies in Paris, where he remained from 1886 to 1889. He worked under a number of prominent teachers including Carolus-Duran (1837‚Äì1917), L√©on Glaize (1942-1932), Luc-Olivier Merson (1846‚Äì1920), Aime Morot (1850‚Äì1913) and Raphael Colin (1850‚Äì1916). The Impressionist Colony The American painter John Leslie Breck (1860‚Äì1899), who was one of the first Americans to settle in Giverny with Louis Ritter (1852‚Äì1896), Willard Leroy Metcalf (1858‚Äì1925) Blair Bruce (1859‚Äì1906), Henry Fitch Taylor (1853‚Äì1925), Theodore Robinson (1852‚Äì1896) and Thedore Wendel (1859‚Äì1932), invited Dawson- Watson to live in Giverny, the spring after its founding.The Cactus Impressionist goes deeply into this chronology He first registered at the Baudy Cafe on May 12, 1888.This is referenced in William Gerdts' Monet's Giverny book on the American Impressionists In Giverny,McConkey's Impressionism in Britain also features a section on D-W. Dawson-Watson did paintings that were said to be influenced by the subjects of the Barbizon School but with the palette of Impressionism.Morseburg's Cactus Impressionist covers this and features an image. Dawson-Watson only had a \\"nodding acquaintance\\" with Claude Monet, who lived in Giverny and insisted that the original painters were not drawn to the village because they knew Monet lived there.William Gerdts speaks to this in Monet's Giverny. The United States Dawson Dawson-Watson and his family moved to the United States in 1893. They first stayed in Boston and then he took a position teaching art for the Hartford Art Association. His son, the artist Edward Dawson-Watson was born in Hartford in 1893 and his daughter Hilda Dawson Watson in 1895. During the time he lived in Hartford he exhibited in Boston and when he left the art association, he moved back to Boston where he became part of the Arts & Crafts colony in Scituate, Massachusetts. He collaborated with the artist Thomas Meteyard on a small publication titled the Courrier Innocent and was part of the Bohemian community. When his parents died, he received a small inheritance and moved back to England where he and his family lived for a number of years.Cactus Impressionist covers this ground. Canada and Woodstock The Dawson-Watson family returned to North America on June 9, 1901Date confirmed through search on Ancestry.Com web site for ship manifests and settled in Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River. He painted Impressionist paintings of the bluffs and river while he was in Quebec and was mentioned extensively in the 1906 book Quebec Sketch Book.A series of chapters on the province published in 1906 and available online. In Quebec he grew to know the American Tonalist painter L. Birge Harrison (1854‚Äì1929), who was instrumental in his employment at Byrdcliffe, the famous utopian Arts & Crafts Colony in Woodstock, New York. At Byrdcliffe he taught students decorative design in the Byrdcliffe Summer School and designed Arts & Crafts furniture for the furniture company that the colony's founder Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead (1854‚Äì1929)There are examples of his designs on various web sites including American Decorative Design. They are very rare and extremely valuable. had hoped would support the colony. Dawson-Watson only taught for short time at Byrdcliffe and in 1904 he took a position in St. Louis.See Cactus Impressionist. San Antonio Dawson-Watson began spending time in San Antonio while he was still living in St. Louis. From 1914 to 1926 he spent part of each year in San Antonio, until finally becoming a full-time resident. From 1918-1919 he served as director for the San Antonio Art Guild. It is generally stated that it was the Edgar B. Davis Wildflower Competition that drew him to San Antonio permanently. In 1926 it was announced that the oilman Edgar B. Davis would sponsor an art competition that was intended to draw attention to the beauty of the Texas Hill Country. A jury selected paintings for an exhibition and there were categories for artists who were residents of Texas and those who came from outside of the state. The formal name of the contest, organized by the San Antonio Art League, was the Texas Wildflower Competitive Exhibition. In 1927 Dawson-Watson won the prize for artists who came from outside Texas and was awarded the $5,000 first prize for Glory of the Morning while his friend, Jose Apra, the Spanish painter won the prize for Texas residents.Texas Art & The Wildcatter's Dream covers this exhaustively, there is a short account in The Cactus Impressionist by Morseburg as well. He went on to win first and fifth prizes in the 1929 competition. These awards not only gave Dawson-Watson great prestige in San Antonio, but national recognition and the financial awards made him comfortable for the first time in his life. Glory of the Morning was presented to the Lotos Club in New York by Edgar B. Davis. In San Antonio he became famous for his paintings of the many variety of Cacti that grow in the Texas Hill Country. Dawson-Watson raised his children in San Antonio and remained a resident until his death in 1939.This section drawn from Art for History's Sake by Steinfelt.

The attack killed six people and injured 23 more. Ford had been diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia with violent tendencies, she had been treated and released by seven different hospitals before moving to Reno in 1980. Ford launched numerous appeals against her death sentence, all of which failed. A heavy smoker, she died at the age of 75 after suffering from emphysema. Ford's blood-alcohol ratio was .162, above the limit to legally drive. During the 100-foot drive, Ford drove as fast as 40 miles per hour. Ford did not resist when police asked her to exit her car. Officer Oakes, who was an officer at the crime scene, stated that Ford was remarkably calm. When she asked Oakes how many people she killed, he responded, \\"five or six,\\" and she replied back, \\"good\\". Another officer stated that Ford said, \\"The more dead, the better,\\" while she was in custody. On August 4, 1981, Ford was found competent to stand trial after being found incompetent on January 29 of that year. The trial lasted almost five months. After 13 hours of deliberation, a jury composed of seven women and five men found Ford guilty on six counts of murder and 23 counts of attempted murder on March 19, 1982. On March 28, 1982, the jury decided she was to be put to death. Even though seven people died as a result of Ford's attack, issues in the indictment caused Ford to only be charged with six. Ford's lawyer claimed she was mentally ill with schizophrenia and should not be put to death, rather spend the rest of her life in a mental institution, while the District Attorney called her \\"evil personified\\" and fought for Ford to be found legally sane. Ford herself went on the stand and testified that she believed she was the reincarnation of Jesus and therefore incapable of sin. The murders were not her only interaction with law enforcement during her life. In 1957, Ford shot her second husband in self-defense before turning the gun on herself. Ford was also arrested for trespassing and assault when her daughter was eleven. Ford, a heavy smoker, died of emphysema at 75 at Southern Nevada Women's Correctional Center in North Las Vegas, Nevada on January 29, 2005.

See Analytic hierarchy process#Practical examples for context for this example. Overview This example describes the use of the AHP in choosing a leader for a company whose founder is about to retire. There are several competing candidates and several competing criteria for choosing the most suitable one. By using the AHP, the board of directors is able to choose the best candidate in a rational, transparent way that can be examined and understood by all concerned. The diagram below shows the AHP hierarchy at the end of the decision making process. The goal is to choose the most suitable leader based on four specific criteria. Dick is the preferred alternative, with a priority of .493. He is preferred about a third more strongly than Tom, whose priority is .358, and about three times more strongly than Harry, whose priority is only .149. Experience is the most important criterion with respect to reaching the goal, followed by Charisma, Education, and Age. These factors are weighted .547, .270, .127, and .056, respectively. The balance of this article describes the derivation of these priorities.  Example details The goal of this decision is to select the most suitable leader from a field of three candidates. The factors to be considered are experience, education, charisma, and age. According to the judgments of the decision makers, Dick is the strongest candidate, followed by Tom, then Harry. Their decision process is described in depth below. Decision scenario The company, founded in 1960, makes specialized industrial equipment. Its future success will depend on maintaining the strength of its older product lines and on generating a constant flow of new ones. The company's founder is retiring soon, and a consulting firm has developed a detailed plan for continuing its success in his absence. The plan will take five years to implement, and will replace the founder's highly subjective \\"seat of the pants\\" style with a more carefully thought out way of doing business. The board of directors needs to choose someone to lead the company through the change and upheaval that implementing the consultant's plan will involve. In doing this work, the new leader will be required to make many unpopular decisions and take many unpopular actions. He or she will be expected to ‚Äúclear the air‚Äù by stepping aside after the plan is fully implemented. Six months ago, the board said: Last week, they said: The three candidates are Tom, Dick, and Harry. Summaries of their backgrounds are shown below: center Decision hierarchy The AHP hierarchy for this decision is shown below. center As the decision makers continue with the AHP, they will determine priorities for the candidates with respect to each of the decision criteria, and priorities for each of the criteria with respect to their importance in reaching the goal. The priorities will then be combined throughout the hierarchy to give an overall priority for each candidate. The candidate with the highest priority will be the most suitable Alternative, and the ratios of the candidates' priorities will indicate their relative strengths with respect to the Goal. Pairwise comparisons The priorities will be derived from a series of measurements: pairwise comparisons involving all the nodes. Each colored box in the hierarchy diagram above is called a node. The nodes at each level will be compared, two by two, with respect to their contribution to the nodes above them. The results of these comparisons will be entered into a matrix which is processed mathematically to derive the priorities for all the nodes on the level. The comparisons can be made in any sequence, but in this example we will begin by comparing the Alternatives with respect to their strengths in meeting each of the Criteria. Then we'll compare the Criteria with respect to their importance to reaching the Goal. Since there are three alternatives (Tom, Dick, and Harry) and we need to compare each one to each of the others, the decision makers (the Board) will make three pairwise comparisons with respect to each Criterion: Tom vs. Dick, Tom vs. Harry, and Dick vs. Harry. For each comparison, the Board will first judge which member of the pair is weaker with respect to the Criterion under consideration. Then they will assign a relative weight to the other candidate. They will use the AHP fundamental scale in assigning the weights: center Alternatives vs. criteria Experience Using their knowledge of the work the leaders will be required to do, the board needs to evaluate the candidates' strengths with respect to experience. Though they have good information about each candidate's work history, there is no such thing as an objective scale for measuring \\"experience.\\" Thanks to the AHP, the Board will be able to develop a scale, applying only to this one case, that measures the candidates' relative strengths with respect to experience. Here is the Board's thinking about experience: As a reminder, here is their summary of the candidates' experience: center The next step in the AHP is to compare pairs of candidates with respect to Experience. For each comparison, the Board decides which candidate is the weaker with respect to Experience, giving his experience a weight of 1. Then, using the AHP Fundamental Scale, they assign a weight to the experience of the other candidate. Their comparisons are summarized below. (A summary in this form is not an essential part of the AHP. It is presented here only to help readers understand this example. The colors in the squares will help them see where each entry belongs in the AHP matrix): center The next step is to transfer the weights to a matrix, using a method unique to the AHP. For each pairwise comparison, the number representing the greater weight is transferred to the box of the corresponding color; the reciprocal of that number is put into the box of the color corresponding to the smaller number: center By processing this matrix mathematically, the AHP derives priorities for the candidates with respect to Experience. The priorities are measurements of their relative strengths, derived from the judgments of the decision makers as entered into the matrix. Mathematically speaking, they are the values in the matrix's principal right eigenvector. These values can be calculated in many ways, including by hand, or with a spreadsheet program, or by using specialized AHP software. They are shown below to the right of the matrix, along with an Inconsistency Factor computed by the specialized AHP software that was used to process the data: center Education Now the Board needs to evaluate the candidates with respect to Education. Here is their thinking on the subject: Though a person's education can be measured by academic degrees, grades and honors, those measurements are not so useful in this non-academic situation. Through its system of pairwise comparisons, the AHP can develop accurate measurements that are perfectly suited to the decision at hand. Here is the Board's summary of the candidates' educational backgrounds: center As they did previously with Experience, the Board now compares pairs of candidates with respect to Education. For each comparison, the Board decides which candidate is the weaker with respect to Education, giving his education a weight of 1. Then, using the AHP Fundamental Scale, they assign a weight to the education of the other candidate. For the sake of our example, we again provide a table summarizing their deliberations: center The Board transcribes its judgments into the AHP matrix shown below. Looking at Tom's row in the matrix, we can see that his education has three times the weight of Dick's, but only a fifth the weight of Harry's. Similar relationships can be seen in the other two rows, where Dick's education is strongly dominated by Tom's and Harry's, while Harry's education strongly dominates that of both the other men. center Once again we use AHP software to derive priorities from the numbers in the AHP matrix: center The priorities tell us that, according to the judgment of the decision makers, Harry's education is by far the strongest of the three. Generally speaking, it dominates Tom's by a factor of almost 4, (0.731√∑0.188=3.95) and Dick's by a factor of 9 (0.731√∑0.081=9.02). Charisma The Board's next step is to pairwise compare the Alternatives (candidates) with respect to Charisma. Here's what they have to say about it: Here is their summary of the candidates' leadership qualities: center And here are their judgments about those qualities as they relate to Charisma: center Putting their judgments into the matrix and processing it with the AHP software, they get: center Note that even though \\"charisma\\" is a highly subjective concept with no imaginable measurement scale, the AHP has allowed the board to measure its relative strength among these three candidates. Also note that with different candidates, or even with different board members, the measurements would likely be different as well. The AHP's measurements apply only to the specific case at hand. Age A person's age can be determined with a precision of days or even minutes. But such measurements aren't highly useful in making the decision at hand, since there is more to \\"Age\\" in this context than mere chronology. Also, there are U.S. laws against employment discrimination by age. Anyone using age as a decision factor must be very explicit about their reasons and justifications. In this case, it wouldn't be good if an unsuccessful candidate decided to sue the company on the basis of age discrimination. The Board has said this about Age: Tom, Dick, and Harry are now 50, 60, and 30 years old respectively. Here's a summary of the Board's evaluation of them with respect to Age: center Transferring their judgments to an AHP matrix and processing it with software yields this result for the Alternatives with respect to Age: center Criteria vs. the Goal Now that the decision makers have evaluated the Alternatives (candidates) with respect to their strength in meeting the Criteria, they need to evaluate the Criteria with respect to their importance in reaching the goal. Once again they do this by a series of pairwise comparisons. As with the Alternatives, this part of the process requires much discussion and debate among the decision makers. In this case, the Board agrees on these relative weights for the various pairs of Criteria: center Note that pairwise comparison of four nodes requires six separate comparisons, while that of three nodes requires only three. These comparisons require a larger matrix, but it is processed in the same way as the smaller ones. Here is the matrix for the Criteria, along with the resulting priorities and Consistency Factor: center Note that, in this decision, Experience, the highest ranked Criterion, is about twice as important in reaching the goal as the second-highest ranked Criterion, Charisma. Similarly, Charisma is about twice as important as Education, which in turn is more than twice as important as Age. Synthesizing final priorities Now that we know the priorities of the Criteria with respect to the Goal, and the priorities of the Alternatives with respect to the Criteria, we can calculate the priorities of the Alternatives with respect to the Goal. This is a straightforward matter of multiplying and adding, carried out over the whole of the hierarchy. In our example, each Alternative's priority with respect to reaching the Goal is the sum of: :::* His priority with respect to Experience, multiplied by Experience's priority with respect to the Goal, and :::* His priority with respect to Education, multiplied by Education's priority with respect to the Goal, and :::* His priority with respect to Charisma, multiplied by Charisma's priority with respect to the Goal, and :::* His priority with respect to Age, multiplied by Age's priority with respect to the Goal Here are the calculations for the Candidates with respect to the Criteria: Key: Column A shows the priority of this Alternative with respect to this Criterion. Column B shows the priority of this Criterion with respect to the Goal. Column C shows the product of the two, which is the global priority of this Alternative with respect to the Goal. Looking only at Tom, we can see that his priority with respect to the Goal is 0.358, calculated as follows: :::* Tom's priority with respect to Experience is 0.217 x 0.547 = 0.119, plus :::* Tom's priority with respect to Education is 0.188 x 0.127 = 0.024, plus :::* Tom's priority with respect to Charisma is 0.703 x 0.270 = 0.201, plus :::* Tom's priority with respect to Age is 0.265 * 0.056 = 0.015, :::* For a total of 0.119 + 0.024 + 0.201 + 0.015 = 0.358 Here are the overall priorities for all of the Candidates: center Making the decision Based on the Board's choice of decision criteria, on their judgments about the relative importance of each, and on their judgments about each candidate with respect to each of the criteria, Dick, with a priority of 0.492, is by far the most suitable candidate. Tom, with a priority of 0.358, is second, and Harry, at 0.149, is third. The Board should choose Dick as the company's new leader. Because they have used the AHP, it is easy for them to trace their thinking and to justify the steps along the way to their decision. If they have second thoughts about the final outcome, they can revisit the process and make changes if appropriate. And if they choose to, they can reveal the details of their process to their consultants and confidants, to the candidates, to the shareholders, or to anyone else who might be concerned with the decision. References Notes Bibliography The Tom, Dick, and Harry example draws heavily on principles described in the books below, which are the current basic texts on the AHP. They contain detailed descriptions of the theory underlying the process, plus many examples of its use in the real world.  * Group decision-making ","title":"Analytic hierarchy process ‚Äì leader example"},{"id":"30031215","title":"Body Language (Boney James album)"},{"id":"30031218","text":"Hurricane Epsilon was the 27th named tropical or subtropical storm and the final of 15 hurricanes in the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November 29 about 915 mi (1470 km) east of Bermuda, becoming the second tropical storm to do so in that area of the Atlantic within the span of a week. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear. Epsilon persisted into December, extending the 2005 season beyond its stated November 30 end date. On December 1, it began a northeast motion due to an approaching trough, and the next day it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December 5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December 7, the winds dropped below hurricane status for the first time in five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December 8\\\\. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated. Since Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.  Meteorological history  On November 27, a surface storm with gale-force winds developed beneath an upper-level low pressure area, about 1150 mi (1850 km) east of Bermuda. At the time, a cold front extended eastward from the surface storm toward the eastern Atlantic Ocean, north of Tropical Storm Delta. By that time, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the possible development of a subtropical cyclone, and although they were inconsistent, National Hurricane Center (NHC) specialist Eric Blake stated, \\"blocking at high latitudes seems to favor another subtropical cyclone effort.\\" The blocking referred to a ridge stretching across the northern Atlantic. The surface storm gradually separated from the frontal zone, but initially its convection, or thunderstorm activity, was sparse and poorly organized. The NHC introduced the system in its tropical weather outlook on November 28, with the possibility of subtropical or tropical development noted. It moved slowly westward, becoming better organized, and by late that day resembled a subtropical cyclone; however, as it was still connected to the cold front, it could not have been classified as such. Early on November 29, an area of deep convection developed and organized over the surface center when it was about 915 mi (1470 km) east of Bermuda. The NHC accordingly assessed the system as developing into a tropical storm, designating it with the Greek letter Epsilon. Operationally, the NHC did not initiate advisories until 1500 UTC on November 29, about nine hours after it actually developed. By that time, the convection had wrapped into a ring in diameter. In the first advisory on Epsilon, the NHC forecast steady strengthening to near hurricane status due to marginally favorable conditions, followed by extratropical transition within five days; an alternate possibility was Epsilon being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm. Epsilon moved westward after its development, steered by a ridge to its north. Initially, Epsilon was embedded beneath an upper-level low that provided an area of low wind shear and instability. An eye-like feature briefly developed in the center of the convection, although the thunderstorms waned late on November 28 due to restricted inflow. However, banding features and outflow improved at the same time. By November 30, the NHC anticipated extratropical transition to occur within two days, although some strengthening was still expected. That day, there was an increase in convection over the center and the development of a ragged eye-feature. The winds briefly increased to , although the intensity of the thunderstorms diminished. Initially Epsilon was predicted to continue westward and eventually turn to the north and northeast. Instead, it turned toward the southwest and executed a cyclonic loop; the unexpected motion caused larger than normal errors in the extended track forecast. As it moved to the south, the storm crossed over an area of warmer water temperatures, and the NHC remarked that \\"just a modest increase in convection [would be] needed to make Epsilon a hurricane.\\" At the time, forecasters assessed the winds in Epsilon to be around , although in a post- season re-analysis it was found to have been weaker. Late on November 30, Epsilon made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 645 miles (1045 km) east-southeast of the island. Hurricane Epsilon viewed from the International Space Station on December 3 Tropical Storm Epsilon began its motion to the east and northeast on December 1, due to an approaching trough. Its structure became that of a \\"shallow hybrid-type tropical cyclone\\", and an eye-feature again developed within the convection. At the time, the NHC and several computer models anticipated extratropical transition within 36 hours as it accelerated northeastward near the Azores. However, four computer models predicted an alternate scenario, and forecaster Stacy Stewart stated such transition would only occur \\"barring any southward motion over warmer water that would prolong both the lifetime of Epsilon and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.\\" As it continued northeastward, the storm separated from upper-level low it was previously beneath. After a decrease in convection, the thunderstorm activity again increased over the center, and there were more banding features. Despite moving over slightly cooler water temperatures, Epsilon attained hurricane status late on December 2, following the development of a well-defined eye 29 miles (46 km) in diameter. A few hours after reaching hurricane status, the NHC thought Epsilon reached peak winds, as the storm was about to move over cooler water temperatures. Additionally, the hurricane was expected to stall near the Azores, in contrast to the original forecast of continued acceleration to the northeast. On December 3 it turned due eastward, still maintaining an eye, modest amounts of convection, and outflow. Despite moving into an area of cooler waters and generally unfavorable atmospheric conditions, Epsilon retained its hurricane status; the only entity supporting its intensity was its warm upper-level temperature. By late on December 3, its presentation was described as \\"remarkably well- organized for a hurricane at high latitude in December... embedded in a strong upper-level westerly wind environment and moving over [70-72 ¬∞F (21-22 ¬∞C)] water.\\" Hurricane Epsilon shortly after peak intensity on December 5 As it continued eastward, Epsilon developed characteristics of an annular hurricane; such cyclones, more often found in the deep tropics with greater intensity, have circular eyes, surrounded by a nearly uniform ring of convection and a general lack of thunderstorms outside the ring. For several days, the intensity fluctuated in a narrow range, and although Epsilon was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status on December 4, the NHC assessed it as remaining a hurricane. After it was thought to have weakened, the eye became more symmetric as the ring of convection became stronger. The hurricane remained difficult to forecast, as NHC forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, \\"There are no clear reasons... and I am not going to make one up... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon.\\" By late on December 4, the NHC was no longer anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm and there was no interaction. At 0600 UTC on December 5, the hurricane's appearance generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system used to estimate intensity from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's duration, and suggested winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), its peak intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage of a cold front. Despite the cold water temperatures and unfavorable strong upper-level winds, Epsilon maintained its intensity, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model predicted it would remain a hurricane for nearly three days. On December 6 the hurricane turned to the south and southwest. As it did so, Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear. After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large and distinct eye in the daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration. However, late on December 7, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system, displacing the convection from the center and causing the eye to dissipate. After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920 mi (1480 km) southwest of the Azores. Once weakened to a tropical storm, Epsilon began rapidly deteriorating. On December 8, it was downgraded to a tropical depression as the convection had totally dissipated. The NHC issued their final advisory on Epsilon at 1500 UTC that day, after the cyclone consisted of a tight swirl of low clouds with no convection. On issuing the last advisory, Lixion Avila remarked, \\"I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.\\" There was ultimately one more tropical storm - Zeta. Late on December 8, Epsilon transitioned into a remnant low pressure area. The remnant circulation elongated in advance of a frontal zone, and it dissipated late on December 9. The front absorbed the remnants the next day.

Biography Mohammad Rafi was a renowned scholar from the Mewat region who lived in the 17th - 18th centuries. He was a Muslim fundamentalist faqih who had mastered Sharia law like his father, Qazi Syed Mohammad Zaman. Being qadi of the city, he was responsible for all of the city's administrative and managerial affairs. Family Syed Mohammad Rafi belonged to the Gardƒìzƒ´ Sadaat family. He was married to Fazal Nisan, daughter of Mohammad Saeed ibn Mohammad Hussain ibn Maulana Abul Khair of Palwal. The mother of Fazal Nisan, Mah Bibi, was the daughter of Ali Asghar bin Ali Akbar bin Abdul Wasey bin Mohammad Murad Narkhi. Ali Asghar was the brother of Mian Mohammad Shoeb's grandfather Ali Mohammad Karwari. His brother-in-law, Raham Ali, was killed along with Aulia Khan Balooch at Pargana Hansi. His other brother-in-law, Fazal Ali's son Mohammad Murad, was also killed during combat in a war with Jauhira Singh and Zaufa Singh at Rewari. He had two sons: Qazi Syed Mohammad Ashraf and Syed Mohammad Shamsuddin and one daughter: Bibi Khan Daulat. Bibi Khan Daulat was married to Mian Mohammad Yunus. Mohammad Rafi's son, Syed Mohammad Shamsuddin, due to his knowledge of Islam, was employed in the army at Nagpur. He married Sahibun Nisan, daughter of Ghulam Sharfuddin ibn Mohammad Naim ibn Mohammad Taqi ibn Abdul Hadi. Ghulam Sharfuddin was married to Shaikh Imam Ali at Gageen District Jodhpur by the hands of Zamindars. Syed Mohammad Shamsuddin had one son, Masihuddin, and three daughters. The elder daughter Faridun Nisan was married to Ghulam Ali ibn Qazi Qutubuddin of Jhajjar. In 1829 (1240 Fasli), Ghulam Ali migrated to Nagpur from Jhajjar, where his brothers were in top positions. He became Kotwal but latterly left the job in 1841. In Nagpur, Choti Masjid (Masjid Ahle Hadith) was built by him. The elder Brother of Ghulam Ali, Mohammad Saaduddin was employed at Nagpur as Faujdar during the Bhonsle Dynasty at the princely state of Nagpur. At that time, Maharaja Senasaheb Subha Chhatrapati Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III was the ruler of the princely state of Nagpur (1818‚Äì1853). He was promoted as Subahdar in 1839 (Rajab 1247 Fasli) at Raipur. For this job, he was awarded one Palki and Rs. 900 monthly. Mohammad Saaduddin was married in 1830 at Posd, District Aiwat Mahal (Maharashtra) in a family of Jagirdar, a sister of Nawab Mohsin Ali Khan and Nawab Hasan Ali Khan. He is buried at Takia Masoom Shah. He built the Jamia Masjid at Nagpur. He had one son Akbar Ali Khan, who was married to Badrun Nisan, daughter of Imdad Hussain bin Ashraf Hussain (Subahdar at Chhindwara). Akbar Ali Khan was hanged to death by Britishers during the revolt of 1857. In consequence, his property was also snatched. His grave is at Tekri Sitabildi. Another brother of Ghulam Ali, Mohammad Saladuddin, was also an administrator, kotwal, and a minister in the court of Maharaja Senasaheb Subha Chhatrapati Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III. Maharaja had great faith in him; all secret papers were in the custody of Mohammad Salahuddin. Like his brother, he was also married in 1830 in the same family of Jagirdar, a sister of Nawab Mohsin Ali Khan and Nawab Hasan Ali Khan. He died in 1833 (Fasli 1243) and was buried at Takya Masoom Shah. All three brothers, Ghulam Ali, Mohammad Saaduddin, and Mohammad Saladuddin are remembered as great Urdu and Persian scholars. They founded 'Jhajjar Bagh' at Hansapuri (Now Mominpura) at Nagpur. In this location, they built their residence 'Aina-e Mahal,' as well as Masjid.Nagpur ka Muslim Muashra (Gondwana aur Bhonsle Aihad [1700‚Äì1845]); Vol 2 by Dr. M.

The third daughter of Syed Mohammad Shamsuddin, Masihun Nisan, was married to Mufti Yaqinuddin ibn Imamuddin ibn Qutubuddin ibn Sirajul Haq. Mufti Yaqinuddin was a renowned scholar and Mufti of Rewari. Being Mufti of the city, he issued Fatwa against the British forces and to support the forces of Rao Tula Ram. In response to his Fatwa, Muslims of Rewari and nearby villages fought against the British invasion. They supported the small force of Rao Tula Ram with their hearts and souls. However, many experienced martyrdom in the fight later known as the 'Fight at Narnaul.' After the defeat of Rao Tula Ram on 16 November 1857, Mufti Yaqinuddin was arrested from Tijara along with brother-in-law Abdur Rahman (alias Nabi Baksh). His brother Mufti Nizamuddin was arrested from Rewari. They were taken to Delhi and executed by hanging.

Heated resin is injected into the mold to impregnate the fiber layup. Having the mold heated and under vacuum, as in Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) assists the resin flow. The mold is then held at a temperature sufficient to cure the resin. Current RTM technology produces lightweight parts with excellent mechanical properties. With these qualities, composite materials are gaining wide use in a variety of structural and non-structural applications common in aerospace and aviation. RTM is one method of fabricating these composite structures.https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/processes/Resin_Transfer_Molding.aspx Same Qualified Resin Transfer Molding (SQRTM) SQRTM is a closed mold composites manufacturing method similar to RTM (Resin Transfer Molding). \\"Same Qualified\\" refers to this method injecting the same resin as that used in the prepreg layup. The attributes of \\"same qualified\\" are significant to a manufacturer because those who adopt this process need not re-qualify resin materials for their production process. SQRTM Process: Liquid molding + prepreg What sets SQRTM apart from standard resin transfer molding (RTM) is that, in place of a dry fiber preform, it substitutes a prepreg layup.http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/sqrtm-enables-net-shape-parts SQRTM is an RTM process adapted to prepreg technology. The prepreg is placed in a closed mold and during the cure cycle, a small amount of resin is injected into the cavity through ports positioned around the part. This resin does not go into the laminate, but only presses up against the edge of the laminate in order to establish hydrostatic pressure on the prepreg, similar to the goal of autoclave curing. This pressure is similar to the autoclave, on the order of 6-7 bars (90-100 psi). Hydrostatic pressure minimizes voids by keeping dissolved air, water and resin monomers in solution in the resin. The tool can either be self-clamped and self-heated or heated and clamped by a press. The equipment is composed of a tool, a press, an injector, and a vacuum pump.http://www.jeccomposites.com/news/features/rtm-infusion/highly- integrated-structure-manufactured-one-shot-prepreg-ud-tape Cedric De Roover and Bertrand Vaneghem, SABCA (Published on January‚ÄìFebruary 2011 ‚Äì JEC Magazine #62) The key factors in the SQRTM process include precision machined closed mold tooling, high pressure presses, a high vacuum applied to the tool interior, and precise control of heating platens, injected resin volume, heat, and pressure. The advantages of the SQRTM process include a high level of integration, tight tolerances and the use of qualified prepregs. Its disadvantages include higher tool costs and a lower level of flexibility to design changes.H. P. J. de Vries, Development of generic composite box structures with prepreg preforms and RTM, NLR-TP-2002-019, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR, Amsterdam, January 2002.  Vacuum assisted RTM (VARTM)  VARTM is one of three processing alternatives that proponents claim can achieve aerospace-grade results without resort to autoclave cure. VARTM denotes a variety of related resin infusion processes now commonly used in the marine, transportation and infrastructure markets. The processes differ radically from prepreg processing in that fiber reinforcements and core materials are laid up dry in a one-sided mold and vacuum bagged. Liquid resin is then introduced through one or more ports strategically placed in the mold, and drawn by vacuum through the reinforcements by means of a series of designed-in channels and/or carefully placed infusion media that facilitate fiber wetout. Unlike the autoclave, VARTM cure requires neither high heat nor high pressure. VARTM's comparatively low-cost tooling makes it possible to inexpensively produce large, complex parts in one shot, such as the tail on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet.Perrett, Bradley. \\"MRJ Test Program Laid Out As Prototype Revealed\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 October 2014. Accessed: 25 October 2014. Archived on 25 October 2014  Balanced pressure fluid molding  Balanced pressure molding using fluid as the heat transfer is commercially practiced as the 'quickstep' process. This process allows for the curing, partial curing, and joining of composite materials. The process involves a fluid-filled, pressure balanced, heated floating mould technology. The heated floating mold technology used within the process works by rapidly applying heat to the laminate which is trapped between a free floating rigid or semi-rigid mold that floats in, and is surrounded by, a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The rapid heating can lead to significantly lower resin viscosities, and this in turn allows achieving full laminate consolidation using pressures lower than those used in autoclave. The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under full vacuum, is subject to pressures as high as 250kPa fluid pressure and can be rapidly heated to the desired cure temperature without risk of catastrophic exothermic reaction, as the HTF can draw excess heat as desired. The air is then removed under vacuum and the laminate is compacted and heated until the part is cured. A flexible membrane beneath the mold is bonded into a pressure chamber creating the lower half of a 'clamshell' or 'chamber' like mold set. A second flexible membrane is bonded to a second pressure chamber creating the upper half of the clamshell. These pressure chambers are clamped together during processing, permitting the laminate to be compressed while reducing stress to the mold as it is floating in a balanced pressure environment within the HTF. The process can use thermosetting, thermoplastic prepregs (pre- impregnated composite fibers), and wet resin with dry fiber to produce superior composite parts. This out of autoclave process can achieve aerospace grade void contents of less than 2%, with extremely fast cycle times, and at significantly lower pressures and lower labor costs than many alternative autoclave production systems using many typical autoclave qualified prepregs. The quickstep out of autoclave system is unique in that it uses fully immersed balanced pressure fluid curing and it allows the user to stop the composite cure reaction at any point in the cure cycle, and thus can halt processing on all or part of the laminate and either return to it at a later to complete cure or to co-cure, join and bond other composites to it to create larger parts. The use of fluid to control temperature, as opposed to the gas generally used within methods such as autoclave and oven curing equates to lower energy consumption, faster cycle times and extremely accurate part temperature control.  Prepreg compression molding  Another Out of autoclave method for achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts is through the use of heat shrink tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) film. Heat shrink tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or curing cycle. When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction). Heat shrink tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface. Examples would be composite tubes for aerospace, wind energy, consumer sporting goods, etc. Heat shrink tape allows these parts to be processed without the need to cure with the heat and pressure of an autoclave.

Between January 1943 and February 1946 in the camp housing first Italian and then German prisoners of war in the United States. While there are few remaining structures, the walls of the Officer's Club were painted with murals by three Italian prisoners. These paintings depicting western life and folklore are now registered with the United States Department of the Interior National Park Service on the National Register of Historic Places. The story of this POW camp is an important part of the history of the town of Douglas.  Officer's Club  The Officer's Club on the site of the former Douglas POW Camp, constructed in 1943, is a one-story rectangular building measuring 37 feet wide and 132 feet long. The utilitarian, wood-framed building rests on a partial concrete pad and concrete footers. Stucco applied during the 1980s covers the original walls that were sided with asbestos shingles. The gable roof is covered with asphalt shingles. An enclosed porch projects from the west side of the building. A tall brick chimney is located on the far northeast side of the roof. A kitchen, pantry, and furnace room are located at the north end of the building which is accessed by a single door on the north side. South of the kitchen area on either side of a hallway are located two bathrooms, a hall closet, and a small game room. The majority of the building is devoted to a large club room from which one can access, through two separate doorways, the west side enclosed porch which also has a door leading to the small game room. The south side of the building beyond the club room consists of a large hallway and three separate rooms now used for storage. An exit doorway on the south side is covered with a small shed roof and concrete steps lead up to it. The building includes numerous single and paired, wood- framed, six- over-six lite windows. The west side porch has banks of windows on its three sides; most have been stuccoed over. Most interior walls are covered with celotex although the walls of the club room and small game room are half-paneled. Floors in the kitchen and pantry area are concrete while others in the more public areas are wood. The kitchen and bathroom floors have been covered with linoleum and both entry halls are now carpeted. Ten wood trusses project through the newer drop ceiling in the club room. All other ceilings are the original celotex. Some globe light fixtures hang from the ceiling in the club room along with newer fluorescent units. The club room features one of Wyoming's 20th-century treasures, sixteen murals painted by three Italian prisoners-of-war during 1943-1944. The charmingly rendered murals painted directly on the celotex walls depict icons of the mythical American west: cowboys, Indians, wagon trains, cattle drives, a stockade fort, and even the famous Old Faithful geyser in Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park. The murals gain special significance for the very reason that they are a vision of the west created by three Italians who had most likely only seen the fabled American West through a train window. The images they created were no doubt inspired from American movies and books. Within the past year, an effort has been made by the local historic preservation board and the City of Douglas to assist the dedicated Odd Fellows in preserving this unique structure. Grant funds were received to hire a conservator for an analysis of the paintings and the development of a conservation plan. The next step is to find funding for the actual conservation of the murals. It is hoped that the building can one day be open to the public so they can view the murals. Few people in Wyoming today, outside of Douglas residents, are even aware the murals exist. The building exhibits integrity of design, location, feeling, association, and workmanship. The stucco siding over the original has a negative impact on integrity of materials. Integrity of the setting has been compromised by nearby development that has taken place over the past thirty years. The former Officer's Club at the Douglas Prisoner of War Camp is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A for its association with the direct impact of World War II on hundreds of local communities in the United States. Although armed conflict never reached the US shores, the effects of the war were nonetheless experienced in many different ways on the home front. The Douglas POW Camp exemplifies indirectly the strength and power the United States brought to the European war effort, especially the technological, mobilization, and organizational skills that were quickly marshaled for the war effort as evidenced by the rapid construction of various types of military facilities built in record time throughout the country. The building also represents a new approach to construction techniques introduced on a mass scale during this time of rapid defense mobilization: the standardization of plans for pre-fab units, and assembly-line approach to construction of building with a planned temporary shelf life.  Murals  Especially significant are the murals painted on the interior walls of the building by three Italian POWs. The images are of the American West and take on special meaning in that they were painted by men who had most likely not seen the west other than in movies and books. Although murals were painted at other military installations throughout the United States during the World War II period, a survey of other State Historic Preservation Offices revealed that only a few survive due to demolition of buildings never expected to remain standing long enough to qualify as \\"historic\\". The survey also indicated that these murals may be the only extant collection painted by Italian POWs as most others were reputed to be the work of German prisoners. The Officers Club is located on the site of the former Prisoner of War Camp and was one of the 180 buildings constructed during a 95-day period in the spring of 1943 for an estimated cost of $1.1 million. The camp was among the 155 base camps and branch camps that were constructed throughout the United States during the war to house Prisoners of War from Europe and Japan.

But overcrowded POW compounds overseas led U. S. military authorities to come up with an American internment program by September of that year. The immediate measures to accommodate over 50,000 POWS held by the British in North Africa included reactivating Civilian Conservation Corps camps; opening unused portions of several major military bases; utilizing such facilities as fairgrounds, race tracks, armories, and auditoriums; and setting up \\"tent cities' in remote areas of the country. The longer-range $50 million-dollar program of POW camp construction began in the fall of 1942. Security regulations dictated the camps be located in remote and isolated areas. No camps could be built within 170 miles inland from the east and west coasts; nor within a 150-mile-wide zone along the Canadian and Mexican borders. Locations near shipyards, munitions plants, and other vital wartime industries were forbidden due to fears of sabotage. The ideal site, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, was an area of 350 acres of level and well-drained land located within five miles of a railroad and 500 feet from any public road. Construction of POW camps in the United States also abided by the international Geneva Convention agreements, signed by 47 world powers in 1929, which defined treatment of enemy prisoners. The U.S.A. made a much greater attempt to live up to the pact than the Axis powers. According to interpretation by American military leaders, camps had to be constructed to the minimum standards of a regular military compound. The presence of a large POW camp would provide an economic boon to a state and the nearby communities so it's no surprise that \\"Chambers of Commerce, business men, the Commerce and Department, city mayors, and the state's political leaders sought to secure the establishment of military installations'\\" in Wyoming, according to historian T. A. Larson. These lobbying efforts were rewarded with construction of a new air base at Casper, a large expansion at Cheyenne's Fort F. E. Warren, and the selection of a site on the outskirts of the small town of Douglas as the location for a POW camp. History of the camp on a sign at the entrance The Douglas site met the defense regulations. Located in Converse County within one mile of a rail line that passed through downtown Douglas, the 687-acre site sat above the banks of the North Platte River. The federal government acquired the land through condemnation; a legal battle ensued in which the defendants were eventually awarded more money for their land than the government had initially proposed. Government surveyors and engineers arrived in Douglas in December, 1942, fueling rumors of the proposed POW camp although the official announcement did not come until January, 1943. Peter Kiewit and Sons of Omaha, Nebraska came in with the low bid and the company set up operations in Douglas by February. Four to five hundred construction workers used the 4-H buildings on the state fairgrounds as dorms and a dining hall. The government contract specified the buildings be completed within 120 days; Kiewit and Sons finished the job in 95 days. The Officers quarters, clubhouse, and softball field were located at the north main entrance to the camp, outside the double rows of wired fencing (the inner fence was electrified) and guard towers that surrounded the rest of the complex. The hospital area and the troop barracks were built directly inside the fence. Beyond that, the prison complex was organized into three compounds, separated by wire electrified fencing, each with a capacity of approximately one thousand men. Auxiliary areas for prisoners included a large outdoor recreation area near the river, a softball field, and one football field. The camp also accommodated a variety of operational functions in buildings designed for the motor pool, a heating plant, warehouses, corrals, a K-9 dog unit, a sewage disposal plant, as well as a salvage yard and gravel pit. The Douglas mayor urged local residents to rent any spare rooms in their houses to the incoming military personnel and their families as a housing crunch was inevitable in the town. The town leaders eagerly put their best foot forward in the home front war effort and quickly established a Service Men's Center in the downstairs room of the Moose Lodge. Moose members cleaned and remodeled the room while the ladies of the lodge scrounged up furniture and curtains from local donations. The Moose Lodge basement became a popular hangout for servicemen with daily hours from 5 p.m. till midnight, and stayed open till 2 a.m. on Saturday nights. The Center affiliated with the national USO organization during the final days of the war. The local newspaper focused on the anticipation and excitement of the arrival of the U. S. Army coming to their town, especially the officers, and downplayed any apprehension people may have felt about having an enemy population one mile away that outnumbered the townsfolk. No press was given to any opinion that may have differed from the positive spin the paper put on the POW camp. Part of that bubbling enthusiasm may have been directly related to the role planned for the prisoners as employees outside of the camp. As elsewhere throughout the United States, the departure of thousands of Wyoming's men to the war left the state with a critical shortage of agricultural labor. POWs provided a solution to the problem and performed many essential jobs related to agriculture, particularly harvesting crops whether it was cotton in the South or sugar beets and timber in Wyoming. In anticipation of the much-needed prison labor, local Converse County ranchers and farmers formed a corporation before the first prisoner arrived and appointed a manager to handle the governmental red tape involved in the contracting procedures.  Camp opening  The first of the eventual five hundred plus Army personnel arrived at the camp in May and more filtered in throughout the summer of 1942. On June 20, before the camp received any POWs, the new facility was opened for the first and only time to the curious civilian population. Over two thousand people from seventeen Wyoming counties visited the site during the two-hour open house and, according to local newspaper reports, were especially impressed by the 150-bed hospital.  Italian POWs  Italians were the first group of POWs that arrived in August, 1942 from New York City. A crowd gathered to watch the four hundred and twelve closely guarded captives from the Tunisian Campaign as they alighted from the train in Douglas and proceeded to march, in units of fifty, the one mile to the outlying camp. As routine for all incoming POWs, the Italian prisoners were checked into the camp through the hospital where they were examined and treated for minor disorders. Their clothes were searched and each man was issued new clothing and assigned to one of the three compounds. By year end, the number of Italian POWs at the camp had reached 1900 men and included one major, four captains, and twenty two lieutenants. The Italian officers had their own barracks and were assigned supervisory duties over their enlisted compatriots. The first prisoner to die from illness at the camp was a captain whose body was buried in a small cemetery plot on the camp grounds and later disinterred and sent back to Italy. The prisoners enjoyed playing soccer and doing calisthenics outside in spite of the cold winter. One Italian prisoner learned American cooking at the camp and enjoyed cooking both American and Italian food for his fellow prisoners, the camp officers, and patients and staff at the hospital. A Catholic chaplain of Italian descent provided musical instruments to some of the prisoners. They set up a small Catholic church in the camp theater where they also put on musical and theatrical productions with costumes made of flour sacks. Three Italian prisoners left a remarkable artistic legacy with the sixteen murals they painted almost sixty years ago that can be seen today on the walls of the Officers Club, one of only a few camp buildings still standing. These men, known only by their signatures on the murals- -V. Finotti, E. Tarquinio, and F. DeRossi - painted a variety of western scenes. The large murals, most are six feet high and some as long as fifteen feet, depict cowboys, bar shootouts, a Native American smoking a peace pipe, a wagon train, a frontier stockade fort, and most surprisingly, Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful geyser erupting in front of a cowboy audience. Ironically, although they were right in the middle of cowboy country, they of course as prisoners would have had very little opportunity to explore it. No doubt, some of the western images came from American movies while others the artists may have seen in books.  German POWs  With the surrender of Italy in 1944, the Italian prisoners were quietly shipped out by early spring. Although the POW camp was vacant and deactivated in July, 1944, it was quickly reactivated a month later to prepare for incoming Germans prisoners. By the first of October, 1944, over 2000 German prisoners resided at the camp; the numbers peaked the following summer at 3,011. The Germans were a less homogenous group than the Italians, they ranged in age from 14 to 80 years old. Although the majority of German prisoners were characterized as \\"cooperative\\" by their guards, a number of hardcore Nazis made up part of the population and caused trouble for the guards by repeatedly cutting through fences to other compounds and harassing their more docile comrades. Camp censors put a halt to their camp newsletter after only two issues due to its rabid Nazi propaganda. A less political paper replaced it and ran for twenty issues. Prisoners spent time in the camp library or became involved in sports. Others staged plays and concerts or the entertainment of not only their fellow prisoners but the public was invited as well. Artisans among the POWs sketched portraits and made such handcrafted items as shelves and decorative plaques which they glued together using dried cottage cheese from their meals. A number of these items were gifts to Douglas community members and are on display at the Douglas Pioneer Museum. Like the Italian prisoners before them, the German POWs also provided thousands of hours in agricultural labor for which they were paid daily wages of $4.00. They received one-half of their wages in script they could use in the post exchange; the other half was set aside until their release from the camp. Some thrifty prisoners returned to their homeland with over $500 in savings. POWs worked in the surrounding area and also were assigned to crop harvest crews in Clearmont, Wheatland, Basin, and Lovell. Others spent time as timber men in nearby Esterbrook and as far away as Ryan's Park in the Medicine Bow Mountains. Guards always accompanied the internees although security might become lax on the job site as escape attempts appeared to be less of a threat away from the camp.  Escape attempts  There were several minor escape attempts at the camp. Guards found two prisoners hiding in a haystack down river from the camp, both clothed in six pairs of G.I. winter underwear. Three Germans hid their escape by the clever use of paper dummies that their comrades propped up during roll call. Another group of escapees made it south about twenty-five miles where they hid out for a week until their capture when they inquired what state they were now in.  Camp closing  By August 1945, as the war wound down, the regional camp commander announced the end of POW labor and that prisoners would now be prepared for repatriation. The Douglas camp gradually released the prisoners beginning in November, 1945, until February 1, 1946 when the camp officially closed. Undoubtedly, there were mixed feelings on both sides as friendships between the prisoners and members of the local community had been forged in spite of being on opposite sides of the war. As a testament to the strength of those ties, correspondence continued for many years between former prisoners and Douglas residents. Overseas visits by Wyomingites and return visits to Douglas by the former POWs also cemented the bond they shared during the war. The deserted Douglas camp became the property of the War Assets Administration, a federal agency established to dispose of surplus property and provide lumber and other materials for temporary government-approved housing programs. Federal agencies and local governments were given first priority to acquire surplus buildings before they were scrapped. Converse County purchased the camp hospital; the Community Country Club acquired the Officers Club; and School District 17 acquired fifteen buildings and 163 acres for an experimental farm which operated until 1969. Buildings purchased by a lumber company still stand south of the Officers Club. Spiegelberger Lumber and Building Company of Laramie dismantled 137 buildings. By the 1980s, the site of the former POW camp had become unrecognizable. Interstate 25 cut through the camp, and businesses, housing subdivisions, two large mobile home parks, and a new school building covered many of the 687 acres that once made up the Douglas camp. Only a few local people fought to keep the history of the camp from fading forever. Among those few were members of the Douglas Lodge #15, Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The Odd Fellows purchased the Officers Club from the Douglas Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1963 for $5,000. Over the years, the local I.O.O.F. lodge has maintained the building and taken pains to protect the unique murals painted by three Italian prisoners of war. In 2015, the Officers' club became a Wyoming State Historic Site and is now maintained by WY State Parks, Historic Sites and Trails, a Division of WY State Parks and Cultural Resources. The Officers' Club is open to the public during the summer months only June-August and on specific days. The listing of the former Officer's Club of the Douglas Internment Camp on the National Register of Historic Places is a tribute to those dedicated to its preservation today and to the thousands from the past who made a wartime home at the camp.

Late 19th century China, or the last years of the Qing dynasty formed a tumultuous time in China's history. This period immediately followed the defeat of China in the First Opium War by the British Empire and opened several ports, such as Shanghai, to foreign trade. This period was further destabilized by the Taiping Rebellion and the unequal treaties signed with European imperial powers. Shanghai, as an open city, became a sort of Asian melting pot where the various European powers could freely express their influence on the city. In turn, this influence gave rise to a new middle class which supported a new style of art known as the Shanghai school. The three hundred years of Chinese art history prior to the advent of the Shanghai School was dominated by the Literati style exemplified in the paintings of Shen Zhou in the 16th century. The Shanghai style marked the first major departure from traditionalist Chinese painting by breaking the elitist tradition of Chinese art, and focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style and more on the visual content of the painting itself. The inspiration for this new style of painting came from 17th century eccentrics shunned by the Chinese art community at large and 18th Century Yangzhou style painters. However, the Shanghai school was characterized by its even greater form exaggeration and brighter colors. The Shanghai School was unable to gain significant traction against the traditional painting style because of greater Western interest (and money) in the Literati tradition. In an era of rapid social change, works from the Shanghai School were widely innovative and diverse and often contained thoughtful yet subtle social commentary. Some important artists of the Shanghai School include Wu Changshuo, Zhao Zhiqian, Ren Bonian,JSTOR He Tianjian, Xie Zhiliu, and Cheng Shifa.

Upon his hiring, the school yearbook, The Kentuckian, wrote, \\"Previous to the year 1906, State had secured foot ball coaches from the North, South, East, and West ... When the authorities began the task of selecting a man to train the squad of '06, they felt that among the alumni we had warriors just as capable as those sent forth from the great gridirons of the North and East.\\"The Kentuckian, p. 107, University of Kentucky, 1907. Before the 1906 season, the Lexington Herald feared that financial difficulties would prevent Kentucky and Transylvania University, its traditional Thanksgiving Day intrastate rival, from fielding football teams. While Transylvania did indeed temporarily disband its team, Kentucky was able to maintain a squad. In his first season, Guyn arranged to play Centre College in Lexington on Thanksgiving, a game which the Herald wrote would be a de facto state championship and \\"swell the athletic association's treasury.\\" Centre won the game, 12‚Äì6, in front of 3,500 spectators. A shortage of funds continued, however, during Guyn's tenure, and in 1907, the program was unable to provide the team with proper equipment. That season, Transylvania renewed the sport, and the Crimson proceeded through its season undefeated before it met Kentucky in the finale. The game, originally scheduled for Thanksgiving, was postponed until December 5 due to heavy rains, which both schools feared would curtail gate receipts. Kentucky won, 5‚Äì0, in what was described as a \\"dull game\\" before a crowd half the size as expected. Before the 1908 season, Kentucky lacked funds to equip several players, so the athletic association scheduled a game with Michigan in Ann Arbor in a bid to generate revenue. Travel costs limited the income, and on the gridiron, Kentucky was shut out, 62‚Äì0. The program did succeed in rescheduling Centre on Thanksgiving, and newly constructed stands and luxury boxes at Stoll Field seated the largest crowd in city history. Kentucky beat Centre, 40‚Äì0. The book Before Big Blue: Sports at the University of Kentucky, 1880‚Äì1940 noted that \\"these [Thanksgiving] games, and the revenue from them, saved the university sports program and prepared the way for a more modern athletic department in the next decade.\\" With the money, Kentucky was able to purchase suitable equipment and hired a respected Eastern coach for the following season, Edwin Sweetland.

When the outbreak of the Civil War cut off supplies of gunpowder to California's mining and road-building industries, a local manufacturer was needed. Originally located near Santa Cruz, California, the company was incorporated in 1861 and began manufacturing gunpowder in May 1864. For 50 years, it was a major employer in the county, employing between 150 and 275 men. The powder works was located on a flat adjacent to the San Lorenzo River, three miles upstream of Santa Cruz. Facilities at Santa Cruz A dam was built on the San Lorenzo River upstream of the powder works on what is now Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A tunnel long was dug in 1863 to bring water from the dam through the powder works. Water powered powder mill machinery and was used to dissolve and purify the crude potassium nitrate from Chile. Water was distributed through the powder works by a system of flumes later dismantled when electricity became available to power the wheel mills. Charcoal was manufactured locally using redwood fuel to char willow, madrone and alder. To facilitate transport and shipping, the company built a bridge across the river (the first bridge can be seen in an early panoramic lithograph, viewable online) and purchased a wharf off the main Santa Cruz beach. The first bridge collapsed in 1871 and was replaced the following year by the covered bridge (now a National Historic Landmark) still in use today built by the Pacific Bridge Company. The wharf was used to receive shipments of potassium nitrate and sulfur from Sicily. Horse-drawn wagons moved raw materials and gunpowder between the wharf and the powder works until the South Pacific Coast Railroad was built. The powder works wharf was unused after 1882 when railroad freight rates encouraged use of wharves in San Francisco Bay. A railroad wharf constructed near the powder works wharf in 1875 was made available for powder works freight until at least 1892 and was not demolished until 1922. Two Victorian mansions were built on a bluff overlooking the powder works as homes for the powder works superintendents. Company housing was available for powder mill workers, and a school opened nearby for their children. California Powder Works began producing smokeless powder for firearms ammunition in the early 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz under the direction of assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp.146-149 Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-J√∏rgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW Smokeless powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder. California Powder Works manufactured powder for naval artillery. Initial production was prismatic brown powder, and the works later obtained a license to produce The United States Navy's patented nitrocellulose smokeless powder. Both powders were used by the Pacific and Asiatic Fleets, and for Pacific harbor and coast defense. The powder works operated a proving ground at Santa Cruz beginning 1892 using guns provided by the United States Inspector of Ordnance. Individual powder lots were test fired in the guns for which they were intended, including a 57mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss, a 6\\"/45 caliber Quick-Fire Rifle Model 1897, and an 8\\"/32 caliber Breech-Loading Rifle Model 1888. Manufacture of dynamite at Hercules 1883 advertisement for Hercules Powder. Shortly after the invention of dynamite by Alfred Nobel in 1867, the newly-formed Giant Powder Company of San Francisco acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell it in the U.S. A special formulation of dynamite was patented in 1874 by J.W. Willard, superintendent of the California Powder Works in Santa Cruz. He called his invention \\"Hercules powder\\", a competitive jab at rival Giant Powder Company, as the mythological Hercules was known as a giant slayer. The California Powder Works thereafter became the only manufacturer of Hercules powder. In 1877, J.W. Willard moved to Cleveland, Ohio to oversee the opening of a new California Powder Works plant there, dedicated to the manufacture of Hercules powder. In 1881, the California Powder Works moved its Hercules powder manufacturing in California to a new site along the northeast shore of San Francisco Bay. The company town that grew up around the facility became known as \\"Hercules\\", later (1900) incorporated as Hercules, California. After initial purchases in 1868, DuPont had obtained 43% interest in California Powder Works by 1876. In 1882, thanks to their interlocking ownership interests with the California Powder Works by that time, the DuPont corporation and Laflin & Rand Powder Company acquired the rights to manufacture Hercules powder and incorporated the Hercules Powder Company for that purpose. In 1904, Du Pont dissolved this first Hercules Powder Company as part of its ongoing effort to consolidate the many explosives manufacturers that it controlled. California Powder Works was likewise dissolved on January 1, 1907.US v. Du Pont 188 Fed 127, 147 Thereafter, its facilities were operated under the DuPont name. Explosive powder manufacturing was an extremely dangerous endeavor at the time, and uncontrolled explosions were frequent. Hercules's isolated location at the time, plus its proximity to rail and water transportation along San Pablo Bay, made it an ideal choice. The explosives manufactured at Hercules played a significant and decisive role in the United States Army's efforts to contain the fires started by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, as recounted by General Funston. In 1911, the United States won a lawsuit that it had brought against the Du Pont corporation under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.US v. Du Pont 188 Fed 127 The U.S. Circuit Court in Delaware found that Du Pont had been operating an unlawful monopoly, and ordered a breakup of its explosives and gunpowder manufacturing business. The breakup resulted in the creation of two new companies in 1912, Atlas Powder Company and a second Hercules Powder Company. The new Hercules Powder Company contributed significantly to the production of explosives during both World Wars. By the Second World War, the plant had diversified to produce fertilizers and other chemical products. Eventually the facility was out- competed by foreign manufacturers, and the plant was closed in 1976. However, by this time the surrounding area was experiencing rapid growth as the commuter belt moved further outward from San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, home construction companies began to build new subdivisions and changed Hercules into the residential suburb as it was known up until the late 1990s. Back in the 1970s, Hercules was one of the first cities in the United States to develop a comprehensive Noise Element of the General Plan. This work included the production of noise contour maps for all major highways and arterial roads, as well as a citywide mitigation plan. Considerable study has been made of the heavy metal lead accumulated as upper layer soil contamination from prior air pollution smokestack emissions from the California Powder Works operations from this era.M. Papineau and C. Michael Hogan, Air quality analysis of stationary sources, Hercules, Ca., Earth Metrics inc. (1976) End of Santa Cruz operations The great explosion of 1898 started in the smokeless powder plant at 5:15 PM on April 26. Santa Cruz was rocked by a series of heavy explosions which killed 13 men at the powder works and injured 25 more. Windows were broken in Santa Cruz, and flaming debris fell on Mission Hill. Many buildings used to house company employees were set afire and a community effort was required by residents of Santa Cruz to prevent fires from reaching powder magazines closer to the city. The explosion caused apprehension among Santa Cruz residents about the safety of operating the powder works so close to the city. Santa Cruz County closed the powder works school and required powder works employee housing facilities to be vacated. California Powder Works became a DuPont subsidiary in 1903, and operated under the DuPont name after 1906. Powder works wharf demolition begun in 1883 was completed before construction of the Neptune Casino at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in 1904.Upon the breakup of DuPont's control of explosives manufacturing in the United States, the manufacture of blasting explosives was assigned to Atlas Powder Company, while California Powder Works double-base smokeless powder patents were assigned to Hercules Powder Company's smokeless powder manufacturing facility at Kenvil, New Jersey. DuPont retained manufacture of black powder and single base smokeless powders including the powder being manufactured for the United States Navy. When the Panama Canal simplified transport to the Pacific Fleet, DuPont consolidated production facilities in New Jersey and terminated operations at Santa Cruz in 1914. Powder mill facilities were dismantled, and the property was sold in 1924. The two mansions occupied by powder works superintendents were abandoned and razed in the 1930s.

The disease was reintroduced to Haiti in October 2010, not long after the disastrous earthquake earlier that year, and since then cholera has spread across the country and become endemic, causing high levels of both morbidity and mortality. Nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera, and more than 9,000 have died, according to the United Nations (UN). Cholera transmission in Haiti today is largely a function of eradication efforts including WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene), education, oral vaccination, and climate variability. Early efforts were made to cover up the source of the epidemic, but thanks largely to the investigations of journalist Jonathan M. Katz and epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux, today it is widely believed to be the result of contamination by infected United Nations peacekeepers deployed from Nepal. In terms of total infections, the outbreak has since been surpassed by the war-fueled 2016‚Äì20 Yemen cholera outbreak, although the Haiti outbreak is still one of the most deadly modern outbreaks. The last case was identified in January 2019.  Background  Haiti's Artibonite River, the first place the outbreak spreadIn January 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti, killing over 200,000 people and further disrupting healthcare and sanitation infrastructure in the country. In the aftermath of the earthquake, international workers from many countries arrived in Haiti to assist in the response and recovery efforts, including a number of workers from countries where cholera is endemic. Before the outbreak, no cases of cholera had been identified in Haiti for more than a century, and the Caribbean region as a whole had not been affected by the cholera outbreak originating in Peru in 1991. The population's lack of prior exposure and acquired immunity contributed to the severity of the outbreak.  Outbreak  Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that when ingested can cause diarrhea and vomiting within several hours to 2‚Äì3 days. Without proper treatment including oral rehydration, cholera can be fatal. The suspected source of Vibrio cholerae in Haiti was the Artibonite River, from which most of the affected people had consumed the water. Each year, tens of thousands of Haitians bathe, wash their clothes and dishes, obtain drinking water, and recreate in this river, therefore resulting in high rates of exposure to Vibrio cholerae. The cholera outbreak began ten months after the January 2010 earthquake, leading some observers to wrongly suspect it was a result of the natural disaster. However, Haitians grew immediately suspicious of a UN peacekeeper base, home to Nepalese peacekeepers, positioned on a tributary of the Artibonite River. Neighboring farmers reported an undeniable stench of human feces coming from the base, to the extent that local Haitians began getting their drinking water upstream from the base. In response, United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) officials issued a press statement denying the possibility that the base could have caused the epidemic, citing stringent sanitation standards. The next day, 27 October 2010, Jonathan M. Katz, an Associated Press correspondent, visited the base and found gross inconsistencies between the statement and the base's actual conditions. Katz also happened upon UN military police taking samples of ground water to test for cholera, despite UN assertions that it was not concerned about a possible link between its peacekeepers and the disease. Neighbors told the reporter that waste from the base often spilled into the river. Later that day, a crew from Al Jazeera English, including reporter Sebastian Walker, filmed the soldiers trying to excavate a leaking pipe; the video was posted online the following day and, citing the AP report, drew increased awareness to the base.Al Jazeera English 28 October 2010 MINUSTAH spokesmen later contended that the samples taken from the base proved negative for cholera. However, an AP investigation showed that the tests were improperly done at a laboratory in the Dominican Republic, which had no prior experience of testing for cholera. For three months, UN officials, the CDC, and others argued against investigating the source of the outbreak. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was \\"not important\\". Hartl said, \\"Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [if there will be]. It is not something we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti.\\" Jordan Tappero, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for the source of the bacteria and that \\"we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain.\\" A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that \\"at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, it may be possible to identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti.\\" Paul Farmer, co-founder of the medical organization Partners In Health, and a UN official himself who served Bill Clinton's deputy at the Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, told the AP's Katz on 3 November 2010 that there was no reason to wait. Farmer stated, \\"The idea that we'd never know is not very likely. There's got to be a way to know the truth without pointing fingers.\\" A cholera expert, John Mekalanos, supported the assertion that it was important to know where and how the disease emerged because the strain is a \\"novel, virulent strain previously unknown in the Western Hemisphere and health officials need to know how it spreads.\\" Some US professors have disagreed with the contention that Nepalese soldiers caused the outbreak. Some said it was more likely dormant cholera bacteria had been aroused by various environmental incidents in Haiti. Before studying the case, they said a sequence of events, including changes in climate triggered by the La Ni√±a climate pattern and unsanitary living conditions for those affected by the earthquake, triggered bacteria already present in the water and soil to multiply and infect humans. However, a study unveiled in December and conducted by French epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux contended that UN troops from Nepal, rather than environmental factors, had started the epidemic as waste from outhouses at their base flowed into and contaminated the Artibonite River. A separate study published in December in the New England Journal of Medicine presented DNA sequence data for the Haitian cholera isolate, finding that it was most closely related to a cholera strain found in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008. It was more distantly related to existing South American strains of cholera, the authors reported, adding that \\"the Haitian epidemic is probably the result of the introduction, through human activity, of a V. cholerae strain from a distant geographic source.\\" Under intense pressure, the UN relented, and said it would appoint a panel to investigate the source of the cholera strain. That panel's report, issued in May 2011, confirmed substantial evidence that the Nepalese troops had brought the disease to Haiti. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) utilized DNA fingerprinting to tests various samples of cholera from Haitian patients to pinpoint the specific strand of cholera found in Haiti. During an epidemiological outbreak investigation, DNA fingerprinting of bacteria can be extremely helpful in identifying the source of an outbreak. The results of the CDC tests showed that the specific strain of cholera found in samples taken from Haitian patients was Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, a strain found in South Asia. This specific strain of cholera is endemic in Nepal, therefore supporting the Haitian suspicion that Nepalese peacekeepers were the source of the outbreak. However, in the report's concluding remarks, the authors hedged to say that a \\"confluence of circumstances\\" was to blame. Rita Colwell, former director of the National Science Foundation and climate change expert, still contends that climate changes were an important factor in cholera's spread, stating in an interview with UNEARTH News in August 2013 that the outbreak was \\"triggered by a complicated set of factors. The precipitation and temperatures were above average during 2010 and that, in conjunction with a destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure, can be considered to have contributed to this major disease outbreak.\\" In August 2016, after Katz obtained a leaked copy of a report by United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston, Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon accepted responsibility for the UN's role in the initial outbreak and stated that a \\"significant new set of U.N. actions\\" will be required to help solve the problem. In 2017, Katz also revealed the existence of emails that showed that \\"officials at the highest levels of the U.S. government were aware almost immediately that U.N. forces likely played a role in the outbreak\\". Katz reported that these emails showed \\"multiple federal agencies, from national security officials to scientists on the front lines, shielded the United Nations from accountability to protect the organization and themselves\\".  Reactions  At the beginning of the outbreak, widespread panic regarding the virulence of the disease and the UN's denial of the blame caused increased tension between the UN and the Haitian community. On 15 November 2010, a riot broke out in Cap-Ha√Øtien following the death of a young Haitian inside the Cap-Ha√Øtien UN base and rumours that the outbreak was caused by UN soldiers from Nepal. Protesters demanded that the Nepalese brigade of the UN leave the country. At least 5 people were killed in the riots, including 1 UN personnel. Riots then continued for a second day. Following the riots, the UN continued their position that the Nepalese soldiers were not to blame, and rather said that the riots was being staged for \\"political reasons because of forthcoming elections\\", as the Haitian government sent its own forces to \\"protest\\" the UN peacekeepers. According to one author, rather than confront the inescapable conclusion that the UN was indeed the cause, \\"the world‚Äôs preeminent humanitarian organization continued to dissemble.\\" During a third day of riots, UN personnel were blamed for shooting at least 5 protestors, but denied responsibility. On the fourth day of demonstrations against the UN presence, police fired tear gas into an IDP camp in the capital. The outbreak of cholera became an issue for Haitian candidates to answer in the 2010 general election. There were fears that the election could be postponed. The head of MINUSTAH, Edmond Mulet said that it should not be delayed as that could lead to a political vacuum with untold potential problems. In November 2011, the UN received a petition from 5,000 victims for hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations over the outbreak thought to have been caused by UN members of MINUSTAH. In February 2013, the United Nations responded by invoking its immunity from lawsuits under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. On 9 October 2013, Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI), the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), and civil rights lawyer Ira Kurzban's law firm Kurzban Kurzban Weinger Tetzeli & Pratt, P.A.(KKWT) filed a lawsuit against the UN in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit was dismissed, but an appeal was filed in the Second Circuit. In October 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the United Nations' immunity from claims. On 11 March 2014, a second lawsuit was filed, Laventure v. United Nations, in the Eastern District of New York, on behalf of more than 1,500 victims of the disaster. In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, an attorney for the plaintiffs wrote: \\"Imagine if the United Nations killed thousands on the streets of New York. Or London. Or Paris. And sickened nearly a million more. Would the U.N. claim it was not liable? Of course not. The international community wouldn't allow it.\\" A lead lawyer for the plaintiffs also noted that the lawsuit was different from the one filed by the IDJH, in that it alleged that liability had been accepted by the U.N. the 1990s. The lawyer stated that immunity: \\"should not be a shield to hide behind because the United Nations (or the U.S. government) doesn‚Äôt like the price tag that comes with the U.N.'s indisputable gross negligence in this case.\\" This case, too, was dismissed by the U.S. District Court, and the Court of Appeals. The appeal is currently before the United States Supreme Court. In December 2016, the then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon finally apologized on behalf of UN, saying he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for the outbreak. The Secretary-General promised to spend $400 million to aid the victims and to improve the nation's crumbling sanitation and water systems. As of March 2017, the UN has come through with only 2 percent of that amount.  Morbidity and mortality  Domestic  On 21 October 2010, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) confirmed the first case of cholera in Haiti in over a century. The outbreak began in the rural Center department of Haiti, about north of the capital, Port-au-Prince. By the first 10 weeks of the epidemic, cholera spread to all of Haiti's 10 departments or provinces. It had killed 4,672 people by March 2011 and hospitalized thousands more. The outbreak in Haiti was the most severe in recent history prior to 2010; the World Health Organization reported that from 2010 to 2011, the outbreak in Haiti accounted for 57% of all cases and 45% of all deaths from cholera worldwide. When the outbreak began in October 2010, more than 6% of Haitians resulted in acquiring the disease. The highest incidence of cholera occurred in 2011 immediately following the introduction of the primary exposure. The rate of incidence slowly declined thereafter, with spikes resulting from rainy seasons and hurricanes. As reported by the Haitian Health Ministry, as of August 2012, the outbreak had caused 586,625 cholera cases and 7,490 deaths. According to the Pan American Health Organization, as of 21 November 2013, there had been 689,448 cholera cases in Haiti, leading to 8,448 deaths. While there had been an apparent lull in cases in 2014, by August 2015 the rainy season brought a spike in the number of cases. At that time more than 700,000 Haitians had become ill with the disease and the death toll had climbed to 9,000. As of March 2017, around 7% of Haiti's population (around 800,665 people) have been affected with cholera, and 9,480 Haitians have died.Government of Haiti, health ministry Latest epidemiological report by WHO in 2018 indicate a total of 812,586 cases of cholera in Haiti since October 2010, resulting in 9,606 deaths. However, a 2011 serological survey indicated that a large number of patients may have not been diagnosed: while only 18% of over a 2,500 respondents in a rural commune reported a cholera diagnosis, 64% had antibodies against it.  International  The first case of cholera was reported in the Dominican Republic in mid-November 2010, following the Pan-America Health Organization's prediction. By January 2011, the Dominican Republic had reported 244 cases of cholera. The first man to die of it there died in the province of Altagracia on 23 January 2011. The Dominican Republic was particularly vulnerable to exposure of cholera due to sharing a border with Haiti, and a large Haitian refugee population displaced following the 2010 earthquake. As of the latest epidemiological report by WHO in 2018, there has been a total of 33,188 cases of cholera in the Dominican Republic resulting in 504 deaths. In late January 2011, more than 20 Venezuelans were reported to have been taken to hospital after contracting cholera after visiting the Dominican Republic. 37 cases were reported in total. Contaminated food was blamed for the spread of the disease. Venezuelan health minister Eugenia Sader gave a news conference which was broadcast on VTV during which she described all 37 people as \\"doing well\\". The minister had previously observed that the last time cholera was recorded in Venezuela was twenty years before this, in 1991. In late June 2012, Cuba confirmed three deaths and 53 cases of cholera in Manzanillo; in 2013 there were 51 cases of cholera reported in Havana. Vaccination of half the population was urged by the University of Florida to stem the epidemic.  Vulnerabilities   Infrastructure  Before the outbreak, Haiti suffered from relatively poor public health and sanitation infrastructure. In 2002, Haiti was ranked 147th out of 147 countries for water security. As of 2008, 37% of Haiti's population lacked access to adequate drinking water, and 83% lacked improved sanitation facilities. As such, families often obtain their water from natural sources, such as rivers, that may be contaminated with V. cholerae. Poor sanitation infrastructure allows cholera bacterium to enter these waterways. Persons are subsequently infected via the fecal-oral route when the water is used for drinking and cooking, and poor hygiene often contributes to the spread of cholera through the household or community. There is also a chronic shortage of health care personnel, and hospitals lack adequate resources to treat those infected with cholera- a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake.Robert Lee Hadden and Steven G. Minson. 2010. The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science. handle.dtic.mil. p. 10. Insufficient water and sanitation infrastructure, coupled with a massive earthquake in 2010, made Haiti particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of waterborne disease.  Physiological  Malnutrition of the population, another pre-existing condition that was exacerbated by the earthquake, may have also contributed to the severity of the outbreak. Research from previous outbreaks shows that duration of diarrhea can be prolonged by up to 70% in individuals suffering from severe malnutrition. Furthermore, Haitians had no biological immunity to the strain of cholera introduced since they had no previous exposure to it. Therefore, physiological factors including malnutrition and lack of immunity may have allowed cholera to spread rapidly throughout the country.  Information  Lack of information and limited access to some rural areas can also be a barrier to care. Some aid agencies have reported that mortality and morbidity tolls may be higher than the official figures because the government does not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center. Limitations in the data from Haiti stem from a lack of pre-outbreak lack of surveillance infrastructure and laboratories to properly test samples and diagnose cases. Haiti was tasked with developing surveillance systems and laboratories after the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak which caused difficulties tracking the progression and scale of the outbreak. Because of the lack of established surveillance, much of the case report data is anecdotal and potentially underestimated. Also, because of lack of laboratory confirmation for the vast majority of cases of cholera, it is possible that other diarrheal diseases were being falsely classified as cholera.  Environmental  Rainy seasons and hurricanes continue to cause a temporary spike in incident cases and deaths. Moreover, as a result of global warming and climate change, Haiti is at an increased risk of cholera transmission. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) advances that global warming between 1.5‚Äì2 degrees Celsius will very likely lead to an increase in frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Resource-poor countries are poised to be affected more so than more developed and economically secure countries. Environmental factors such as temperature increases, severe weather events, and natural disasters have a two-fold impact on the transmission potential of cholera in Haiti: 1) they present conditions favorable to the persistence and growth of V. cholerae in the environment, and 2) they devastate a country's infrastructure and strain public health and health care resources. An exhaustive study into environmental factors influencing the spread of cholera in Haiti cites above average air temperatures following the earthquake, \\"anomalously high rainfall\\" from September to October 2010, and damage to the limited water and sanitation infrastructure as likely converging to create conditions favorable to a cholera outbreak.  Challenges and solutions to eradication  Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been dedicated towards eradicating cholera in Haiti since its introduction in 2010, yet unsanitary conditions and climate-driven forces allow cholera transmission to continue. While the number of new cases of cholera has drastically decreased from 2010, and is currently the lowest it has been since the outbreak began, the incidence remains at 25.5 per 100,000 population as of October 2018. Over time, there has been significant progress in the reduction of caseloads and overall number of deaths. According to one PAHO/WHO report, \\"the cumulative case-fatality rate (CFR) has remained around 1% since 2011\\". These achievements can be contributed to intensified international and local medical efforts and an increased emphasis on preventative measures, including improved sanitation, such as latrines, and changes in Haitian behaviors such as treating water, thoroughly cooking food, and rigorous hand-washing. Despite these progresses, cholera remains endemic in Haiti, and further resources are needed to fully eradicate it. After former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon accepted UN responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti in December 2016, Moon projected a necessary $400 million in funding over two years in order to fully eradicate cholera in Haiti. The Government of Haiti has dedicated itself to the complete eradication of cholera from Haiti by 2022 as presented in the Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 ‚Äì 2022. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, successor to Ban Ki Moon, took up Moon's commitment to assist Haiti in the eradication of cholera when he took office on 31 December 2016, as demonstrated by strategic objective 2 of the 2017‚Äì 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan. Strategic objective 2 reads, \\"Save lives from epidemics ‚Äì Reduce mortality and morbidity due to cholera outbreaks and other waterborne diseases through the reduction of vulnerability, strengthening of epidemiological surveillance and ensuring of rapid and effective response\\". The 2017 ‚Äì 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan identifies 1.9 million people in need of assistance for the protection from cholera, of which, 1.5 million people are targeted through programming totaling US$21.7 million. Currently, the UN and Government of Haiti are on target to reach the 2016 ‚Äì 2018 midterm goal to reduce the incidence of cholera to less than 0.1% by the end of 2018. However, any disruption in funding of support services may result in a spike in transmission and the interruption of the downward trend.  Challenges   Protracted crises: Hurricane Matthew 2016  The first challenge to the eradication of cholera in Haiti is the country's vulnerability to disasters, putting it in a state of protracted crises. The climax of cholera incidence in Haiti was in 2011 with 352,000 new cases following the introduction of cholera in Haiti in late 2010. Incidence rates gradually declined until 2016 when there was another spike in the transmission and incidence of cholera following Hurricane Matthew's destruction in Haiti from 2‚Äì5 October 2016. There was a rise in cholera incidence from 32,000 new cases in 2015 to 42,000 new cases in 2016. By re-damaging Haiti's fragile water and sanitation infrastructure, Hurricane Matthew allowed cholera to rear its head. These figures demonstrate that the fight against cholera in Haiti, while improving, is on unstable ground. This indicates that while eradication efforts have largely been focused on vaccination and community education to prevent transmission, and oral rehydration to reduce mortality, the underlying vulnerabilities that perpetuate the disaster remain, particularly insufficient and unequal access to improved water and sanitation.  Funding  While the Government of Haiti's Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 ‚Äì 2022 and the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti (see solutions below for more information) lay out plans for the elimination of cholera in Haiti by 2022, these are entirely dependent on funding. In former Secretary General Moon's 5 December 2016 remarks he says, \\"Without political will and financial support from the membership of the United Nations, we have only good intentions and words. Words are powerful ‚Äì but they cannot replace action and material support\\". Due to the infectious nature of cholera, any lapse in funding for programming will likely result in setbacks in elimination. As of 2017, funding for cholera is at risk due to increasing food insecurity and shelter needs for Haitian refugees returning from the Dominican Republic. In the 2017 ‚Äì 2018 Revised Haiti Humanitarian Plan, funding requirements for cholera programming is the third largest at $21.7 million, behind $76.6 million for food security and $103.8 million for shelter/NFI needs.  Solutions   Vaccination campaigns  In 2013, the Government of Haiti launched an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign in two regions: Cerca Carvajal and Petite Anse. These regions were chosen because of particularly high attack rates, sanitation infrastructure, and access to healthcare. This vaccination effort was slightly controversial because the WHO guidelines at the time did not encourage mass vaccination campaigns in areas where outbreaks had already occurred. Prior to the 2010 outbreak in Haiti, vaccination campaigns were thought to detract from more important prevention measures like water treatment and good hygiene. Relative success rates (up to 65% or higher protective effectiveness 5 years after vaccination) in recent vaccination campaigns in Haiti and other countries affected by cholera has led to more widespread use of oral cholera vaccine programs and a change in the WHO guidelines to encourage use of vaccines in addition to other prevention and treatment strategies.  UN approach  At the end of 2016, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon presented the \\"New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti\\". This two-track approach marked the UN's acceptance of responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti and demonstrated its commitment to the eradication of the disease in Haiti. Since the 2016 admission of guilt, there has been increased coordination and goodwill between the Government of Haiti and UN, resulting in great strides towards the elimination of cholera. 2017 was a hallmark year in the elimination of cholera from Haiti. The 2017 ‚Äì 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan reports, \\"As of 31 December 2017, 13,682 suspected cholera cases and 150 deaths had been registered in the country in 2017 compared to 41,955 cases and 451 deaths for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 67% in both cases\\". Newly developed rapid response teams are largely to credit for the reduction in disease incidence. The ability for the humanitarian sector to act quickly and bounce back following Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as to maintain the downward trend during the heavy rain season, demonstrates progress in the eradication of cholera in Haiti. = Track 1 = Track 1 of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti aims to \\"intensify efforts to respond to and reduce the incidence of cholera in Haiti\\" through three main projects. The first is strengthening and supporting the rapid response framework developed by the Haitian Government which deploys to communities where cholera is suspected within 48-hours. There are currently 13 government led rapid response teams, and 60 mobile teams of humanitarian actors that support the rapid response teams. The goal of rapid response teams is to cut the transmission of cholera by first setting up a perimeter called a cordon sanitaire and investigating the source of the outbreak at the household level. This investigation is coupled with education and awareness raising on cholera prevention, administering oral prophylaxis and distribution of WASH kits. If an outbreak is confirmed, temporary chlorination points are installed on community water sources. People treated for cholera by the rapid response teams are then recruited to Community Engagement & Hygiene Awareness (CEHA) teams. The CEHA teams return to their communities to conduct outreach and sensitization on how to cut transmission and assist the government in monitoring water sources. This rapid response design with the assistance of the CEHA teams is responsible for a major decline in disease incidence in the Ouest department in 2017. As long as funding continues to support rapid response, a continued decline in disease incidence can be suspected. The second project of track 1 is the continued support of oral cholera vaccination campaigns as a preventative measure. In 2018, the oral cholera vaccine campaign will focus on departments with the highest incidence of disease, particularly Artibonite and Centre departments. The final aim of track 1 is to \\"more effectively address‚Ä¶ the medium/longer term issues of water, sanitation and health systems\\". The 2010 earthquake and subsequent cholera outbreak/epidemic exposed to the international community how vulnerable the Haitian water, sanitation, and health infrastructure was. Cholera and other water-borne diseases will continue to circulate in Haiti as long as large sections of their population do not have access to improved water and sanitation facilities. As part of the UN's \\"New Way of Working\\" which aims to bridge the development and humanitarian gap, the UN will be working with major development actors including the World Bank and the International Development Bank to address infrastructure vulnerabilities that put Haiti at risk of protracted crisis. The \\"New Way of Working\\" aims to draw from funding sources on both sides of the spectrum, both development and humanitarian, to work towards the Sustainable Development Goals. No joint funded projects have been reported in Haiti yet. = Track 2 = The second track of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti proposes to provide material assistance to individuals and families who were most affected by cholera. The material assistance package is the UN's attempt at reparations after accepting responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti. The UN reports, \\"nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera since 2010 [as of 2016] and more than 9,000 have died\\". First, consultations will be conducted with the community to identify what materials will be of greatest impact.  See also  * Cholera outbreaks and pandemics Further reading * Frerichs, Ralph R.

On August 18, 1917, in the State Capitol gallery in Nashville, Tennessee, she witnessed the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution being ratified, giving women the right to vote. This inspired her lifelong fight for the civil rights of minorities and women. She is also known for her New Deal legislative efforts. Early life Somerville was born on July 1, 1895 in Greenville, Mississippi. As the daughter of Nellie Nugent Somerville, nationally known as a temperance and woman suffrage leader and the first woman to serve in the Mississippi Legislature, she was raised in an atmosphere of female equality, a rarity for 19th century Mississippi. Somerville attended Randolph-Macon Women's College, now Randolph College, in Lynchburg, Virginia, (1912-1916) where she was a member of Alpha Omicron Pi fraternity, Pi Gamma Mu international honor society and the Phi Beta Kappa Society. After completing her A.B. she continued her education at Columbia University as a graduate student in psychology and economics. While living in New York City, she would attend political rallies and meetings; she also regularly visited settlement houses and sweatshops where she first saw how bosses mistreated working women and minorities. These experiences sparked her lifelong interest in civil rights. From 1920 to 1922 she returned to the South and enrolled in the Law School of University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, and graduated summa cum laude with a LL.B., being one of only two women in her class. While a law student at the University of Mississippi, she started a female basketball team, a writers group and a book review column. Political life Howorth moved to Cleveland, Mississippi, to begin practicing law. She then moved her law practice to her hometown, Greenville, Mississippi, where she married Joseph M. Howorth, a local lawyer. After five years of practicing law, she was appointed as a judge. She was admitted to Mississippi state and federal courts, the U.S. Supreme Court, and all of the courts in the District of Columbia. As a Democrat, she served Mississippians as a Hinds County Representative and as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1932-1936. Appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Howorth served on the Board of Veterans Appeals from July 1934 to April 1943. Howorth served on the War Claims Commission, 1949-1954, as associate general counsel, deputy general counsel, and general counsel. After leaving government work in 1954, she moved back to Cleveland, Mississippi, where she practiced law with her husband. In 1961 John F. Kennedy appointed her to his Commission on the Status of Women. She regularly traveled the US and internationally to give speeches and serve on boards that protected and furthered civil rights. She retired from her law practice in 1980 at 85 years old. Activism and community involvement In her lifetime Howorth was a member of many organizations including the National Association of Women Lawyers, Phi Delta Delta Legal Fraternity (founded 1911, merged with Phi Alpha Delta in 1972), the Professional Women's Club, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. She served as vice president of the American Association of University Women, and played a role in ending their segregationist practices in the 1940s. She was member and chairman of the United Nations League of Lawyers, and she served as the chairman of the Cleveland Public Library Commission for ten years. Later life and legacy Howorth co-edited her grandfather's Civil War letters, which were published under the title, My Dear Nellie (1978). Her husband died in 1982 after 54 years of marriage. She died from heart failure in Cleveland, Mississippi, on August 23, 1997, at the age of 102. The Lucy Somerville Howorth Collection is held at Delta State University and consists of some of her professional and non-professional works, personal correspondences, certificates, awards and other items of memorabilia, photos and artwork, and newspaper clippings, and a scrapbook she and her husband owned. The first biography of Howorth, published in 2006, is titled Lucy Somerville Howorth: New Deal Lawyer, Politician, and Feminist from the South and is by Dorothy S. Shawhan and Martha H. Swain. The Lucy Somerville Howorth Lecture Series is held at the University of Mississippi, and brings speakers on women's studies to the campus.

Cocrystals can encompass many types of compounds, including hydrates, solvates and clathrates, which represent the basic principle of host‚Äìguest chemistry. Hundreds of examples of cocrystallization are the reported annually. History The first reported cocrystal, quinhydrone, was studied by Friedrich W√∂hler in 1844. Quinhydrone is a cocrystal of quinone and hydroquinone (known archaically as quinol). He found that this material was made up of a 1:1 molar combination of the components. Quinhydrone was analyzed by numerous groups over the next decade and several related cocrystals were made from halogenated quinones. Many cocrystals discovered in the late 1800s and early 1900s were reported in Organische Molekulverbindungen, published by Paul Pfeiffer in 1922. This book separated the cocrystals into two categories; those made of inorganic:organic components, and those made only of organic components. The inorganic:organic cocrystals include organic molecules cocrystallized with alkali and alkaline earth salts, mineral acids, and halogens as in the case of the halogenated quinones. A majority of the organic:organic cocrystals contained aromatic compounds, with a significant fraction containing di- or trinitro aromatic compounds. The existence of several cocrystals containing eucalyptol, a compound which has no aromatic groups, was an important finding which taught scientists that pi stacking is not necessary for the formation of cocrystals. Cocrystals continued to be discovered throughout the 1900s. Some were discovered by chance and others by screening techniques. Knowledge of the intermolecular interactions and their effects on crystal packing allowed for the engineering of cocrystals with desired physical and chemical properties. In the last decade there has been an enhanced interest in cocrystal research, primarily due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Cocrystals represent about 0.5% of the crystal structures archived in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). However, the study of cocrystals has a long history spanning more than 160 years. They have found use in a number of industries, including pharmaceutical, textile, paper, chemical processing, photographic, propellant, and electronic. Definition The meaning of the term cocrystal is subject of disagreement. One definition states that a cocrystal is a crystalline structure composed of at least two components, where the components may be atoms, ions or molecules. This definition is sometimes extended to specify that the components be solid in their pure forms at ambient conditions. However, it has been argued that this separation based on ambient phase is arbitrary. A more inclusive definition is that cocrystals \\"consist of two or more components that form a unique crystalline structure having unique properties.\\" Due to variation in the use of the term, structures such as solvates and clathrates may or may not be considered cocrystals in a given situation. The difference between a crystalline salt and a cocrystal lies merely in the transfer of a proton. The transfer of protons from one component to another in a crystal is dependent on the environment. For this reason, crystalline salts and cocrystals may be thought of as two ends of a proton transfer spectrum, where the salt has completed the proton transfer at one end and an absence of proton transfer exists for cocrystals at the other end. Properties A schematic for the determination of melting point binary phase diagrams from thermal microscopy. The components interact via non- covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, van der Waals interactions and Œ†-interactions. These interactions lead to a cocrystal lattice energy that is generally more stable than the crystal structures of the individual components. The intermolecular interactions and resulting crystal structures can generate physical and chemical properties that differ from the properties of the individual components. Such properties include melting point, solubility, chemical stability, and mechanical properties. Some cocrystals have been observed to exist as polymorphs, which may display different physical properties depending on the form of the crystal. Phase diagrams determined from the \\"contact method\\" of thermal microscopy is valuable in the detection of cocrystals. The construction of these phase diagrams is made possible due to the change in melting point upon cocrystallization. Two crystalline substances are deposited on either side of a microscope slide and are sequentially melted and resolidified. This process creates thin films of each substance with a contact zone in the middle. A melting point phase diagram may be constructed by slow heating of the slide under a microscope and observation of the melting points of the various portions of the slide. For a simple binary phase diagram, if one eutectic point is observed then the substances do not form a cocrystal. If two eutectic points are observed, then the composition between these two points corresponds to the cocrystal. Production and characterization Production There are many synthetic strategies that are available to prepare cocrystals. However, it may be difficult to prepare single cocrystals for X-ray diffraction, as it has been known to take up to 6 months to prepare these materials. Cocrystals are typically generated through slow evaporation of solutions of the two components. This approach has been successful with molecules of complementary hydrogen bonding properties, in which case cocrystallization is likely to be thermodynamically favored. Many other methods exist in order to produce cocrystals. Crystallizing with a molar excess of one cocrystal former may produce a cocrystal by a decrease in solubility of that one component. Another method to synthesize cocrystals is to conduct the crystallization in a slurry. As with any crystallization, solvent considerations are important. Changing the solvent will change the intermolecular interactions and possibly lead to cocrystal formation. Also, by changing the solvent, phase considerations may be utilized. The role of a solvent in nucleation of cocrystals remains poorly understood but critical in order to obtain a cocrystal from solution. Cooling molten mixture of cocrystal formers often affords cocrystals. Seeding can be useful. Another approach that exploits phase change is sublimation which often forms hydrates. Grinding, both neat and liquid-assisted, is employed to produce cocrystal, e.g., using a mortar and pestle, using a ball mill, or using a vibratory mill. In liquid- assisted grinding, or kneading, a small or substoichiometric amount of liquid (solvent) is added to the grinding mixture. This method was developed in order to increase the rate of cocrystal formation, but has advantages over neat grinding such as increased yield, ability to control polymorph production, better product crystallinity, and applies to a significantly larger scope of cocrystal formers. and nucleation through seeding. Supercritical fluids (SCFs) serve as a medium for growing cocrystals. Crystal growth is achieved due to unique properties of SCFs by using different supercritical fluid properties: supercritical CO2 solvent power, anti-solvent effect and its atomization enhancement. Using intermediate phases to synthesize solid-state compounds is also employed. The use of a hydrate or an amorphous phase as an intermediate during synthesis in a solid-state route has proven successful in forming a cocrystal. Also, the use of a metastable polymorphic form of one cocrystal former can be employed. In this method, the metastable form acts as an unstable intermediate on the nucleation pathway to a cocrystal. As always, a clear connection between pairwise components of the cocrystal is needed in addition to the thermodynamic requirements in order to form these compounds. Importantly, the phase that is obtained is independent of the synthetic methodology used. It may seem facile to synthesize these materials, but on the contrary the synthesis is far from routine. Characterization Cocrystals may be characterized in a wide variety of ways. Powder X-Ray diffraction proves to be the most commonly used method in order to characterize cocrystals. It is easily seen that a unique compound is formed and if it could possibly be a cocrystal or not owing to each compound having its own distinct powder diffractogram. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction may prove difficult on some cocrystals, especially those formed through grinding, as this method more often than not provides powders. However, these forms may be formed often through other methodologies in order to afford single crystals. Aside from common spectroscopic methods such as FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, solid state NMR spectroscopy allows differentiation of chiral and racemic cocrystals of similar structure. Other physical methods of characterization may be employed. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are two commonly used methods in order to determine melting points, phase transitions, and enthalpic factors which can be compared to each individual cocrystal former. Applications Cocrystal engineering is relevant to production of energetic materials, pharmaceuticals, and other compounds. Of these, the most widely studied and used application is in drug development and more specifically, the formation, design, and implementation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Changing the structure and composition of the API can greatly influence the bioavailability of a drug. The engineering of cocrystals takes advantage of the specific properties of each component to make the most favorable conditions for solubility that could ultimately enhance the bioavailability of the drug. The principal idea is to develop superior physico-chemical properties of the API while holding the properties of the drug molecule itself constant. Cocrystal structures have also become a staple for drug discovery. Structure-based virtual screening methods, such as docking, makes use of cocrystal structures of known proteins or receptors to elucidate new ligand-receptor binding conformations. Pharmaceuticals Cocrystal engineering has become of such great importance in the field of pharmaceuticals that a particular subdivision of multicomponent cocrystals has been given the term pharmaceutical cocrystals to refer to a solid cocrystal former component and a molecular or ionic API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). However, other classifications also exist when one or more of the components are not in solid form under ambient conditions. For example, if one component is a liquid under ambient conditions, the cocrystal might actually be deemed a cocrystal solvate as discussed previously. The physical states of the individual components under ambient conditions is the only source of division among these classifications. The classification naming scheme of the cocrystals might seem to be of little importance to the cocrystal itself, but in the categorization lies significant information regarding the physical properties, such as solubility and melting point, and the stability of APIs. The objective for pharmaceutical cocrystals is to have properties that differ from that expected of the pure APIs without making and/or breaking covalent bonds. Among the earliest pharmaceutical cocrystals reported are of sulfonamides. The area of pharmaceutical cocrystals has thus increased on the basis of interactions between APIs and cocrystal formers. Most commonly, APIs have hydrogen-bonding capability at their exterior which makes them more susceptible to polymorphism, especially in the case of cocrystal solvates which can be known to have different polymorphic forms. Such a case is in the drug sulfathiazole, a common oral and topical antimicrobial, which has over a hundred different solvates. It is thus important in the field of pharmaceuticals to screen for every polymorphic form of a cocrystal before it is considered as a realistic improvement to the existing API. Pharmaceutical cocrystal formation can also be driven by multiple functional groups on the API, which introduces the possibility of binary, ternary, and higher ordered cocrystal forms. Nevertheless, the cocrystal former is used to optimize the properties of the API but can also be used solely in the isolation and/or purification of the API, such as a separating enantiomers from each other, as well and removed preceding the production of the drug. It is with reasoning that the physical properties of pharmaceutical cocrystals could then ultimately change with varying amounts and concentrations of the individual components. One of the most important properties to change with varying the concentrations of the components is solubility. It has been shown that if the stability of the components is less than the cocrystal formed between them, then the solubility of the cocrystal will be lower than the pure combination of the individual constituents. If the solubility of the cocrystal is lower, this means that there exists a driving force for the cocrystallization to occur. Even more important for pharmaceutical applications is the ability to alter the stability to hydration and bioavailability of the API with cocrystal formation, which has huge implications on drug development. The cocrystal can increase or decrease such properties as melting point and stability to relative humidity compared to the pure API and therefore, must be studied on a case to case basis for their utilization in improving a pharmaceutical on the market. A screening procedure has been developed to help determine the formation of cocrystals from two components and the ability to improve the properties of the pure API. First, the solubilities of the individual compounds are determined. Secondly, the cocrystallization of the two components is evaluated. Finally, phase diagram screening and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) are further investigated to optimize conditions for cocrystallization of the components. This procedure is still done to discover cocrystals of pharmaceutical interest including simple APIs, such as carbamazepine (CBZ), a common treatment for epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar disorder. CBZ has only one primary functional group involved in hydrogen bonding, which simplifies the possibilities of cocrystal formation that can greatly improve its low dissolution bioavailability. Another example of an API being studied would be that of Piracetam, or (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetamide, which is used to stimulate the central nervous system and thus, enhance learning and memory. Four polymorphs of Piracetam exist that involve hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl and primary amide. It is these same hydrogen bonding functional groups that interact with and enhance the cocrystallization of Piracetam with gentisic acid, a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and with p-hydroxybenzoic acid, an isomer of the aspirin precursor salicylic acid. No matter what the API is that is being researched, it is quite evident of the wide applicability and possibility for constant improvement in the realm of drug development, thus making it clear that the driving force of cocrystallization continues to consist of attempting to improve on the physical properties in which the existing cocrystals are lacking. Regulation On August 16, 2016, the US food and drug administration (FDA) published a draft guidance Regulatory Classification of Pharmaceutical Co-Crystals. In this guide, the FDA suggests treating co-crystals as polymorphs, as long as proof is presented to rule out the existence of ionic bonds. Energetic materials Two explosives HMX and CL-20 cocrystallized in a ratio 1:2 to form a hybrid explosive. This explosive had the same low sensitivity of HMX and nearly the same explosive power of CL-20. Physically mixing explosives creates a mixture that has the same sensitivity as the most sensitive component, which cocrystallisation overcomes.

He \\"toured in vaudeville and burlesque between 1895 and 1930.\\" By 1897, he was \\"teamed with Charles Osborne in a comedy contortion and burlesque acrobatics act.\\" Around this time, he dropped an \\"f\\" from his last name. In the 1902‚Äì1903 season, he first worked with longtime vaudeville partner Hugh Conn, an association that lasted into the 1920s or possibly 1930s. Marcel Corinne (died 1977), sometimes spelled Coreene, joined the act sometime in the 1910s. She and Imhof married in 1913. The trio of Imhof, Conn and Corinne toured in two comic sketches, \\"The Pest House\\" and \\"Surgeon Louder, U.S.A.\\", the latter \\"a military comedy\\" Imhof had written. \\"The Pest House\\" was \\"the most popular and longest running of several sketches starring the portly pair Roger Imhof and Marcel Corinne\\". According to an October 1920 edition of the Oregon Daily Journal, the sketch involved Imhof playing an Irish peddler who spends a mishap-filled night at an inn. In 1923, he appeared in the Broadway play Jack and Jill. He reportedly invested in Chicago and Los Angeles real estate, but lost most of his money in the stock market and during the Great Depression. He became involved early on in the nascent Hollywood film industry, apparently \\"as a presenter, promoter, or agent\\". As an actor, he appeared in films from 1932 to 1944, including San Francisco (1936), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and This Gun for Hire (1942). Of the songs he composed, eleven are extant, including the 1906 \\"Old Broadway\\". Imhof died on April 15, 1958 and was buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery.

It is based on the Rudyard Kipling book of the same name. Plot The adventures of Mowgli, a human foundling raised by Akela's wolf pack, and his best friends, fatherly bear Baloo and playful panther Bagheera. They live in the Indian jungle where many dangers lurk, such as the mighty Bengal tiger Shere Khan. The inquisitive Mowgli often gets himself into trouble and can't resist helping animals in danger or solving other problems. Characters Main *Mowgli (voiced by Emma Tate in seasons 1‚Äì2, Sarah Natochenny in season 3) ‚Äì A young human raised by wolves in the jungle, as the adoptive son of Daruka and Raksha, and the brother of Lali and Bala. He keeps a tiger claw as a pendant which he took in a battle from Shere Khan. Mowgli is never depicted as naked, as in the book. *Bagheera (voiced by Sam Gold in seasons 1‚Äì2, Abe Goldfarb in season 3) ‚Äì A Black panther. He is Mowgli's best friend. Unlike his counterpart in the Disney film, Bagheera is not as wise or strict as in the book. Most animals in the jungle never dare to step in the way of the panther. He often fights Shere Khan to save Mowgli. *Baloo (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert in seasons 1‚Äì2, David Wills in season 3) ‚Äì A hungry brown bear. In the series, he is bipedal, wears glasses and he is Mowgli's mentor. Baloo likes to tell stories of the jungle. *Kaa (voiced by Joseph J. Terry in seasons 1‚Äì2, Billy Bob Thompson in season 3) ‚Äì An Indian rock python. Like in the book, he is sort of friends with Mowgli, Bagheera, and Baloo, yet moody and feared. Seeonee Wolf Pack *Akela (voiced by Joseph J. Terry in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì An Indian wolf who is the most trusted leader of the Seeonee Wolf Pack and the grandfather of Phaona. *Daruka (voiced by Aaron Albertus in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì The adopted father of Mowgli. Although Mowgli usually lives with Baloo and Bagheera, he visits Daruka's family sometimes. *Raksha ‚Äì The adopted mother of Mowgli. She is patient and motherly, but can be stern when necessary. * Lali ‚Äì The daughter of Daruka and Raksha. She is sweet, and caring, like her mother, but can be extremely protective and rebellious. *Bala ‚Äì The son of Daruka and Raksha. He is a brave and loyal, but competitive wolf, who often gets in trouble. Villains *Shere Khan (voiced by David Holt in seasons 1‚Äì2, Marc Thompson in season 3) ‚Äì A man-eating Bengal tiger who is the main antagonist of the series. He's going to kill and eat Mowgli, but often fails in his attempts. He has a scar on his left eye. Shere Khan lost one of his claws in an earlier fight with Mowgli who keeps the claw as a pendant. *Tabaqui (voiced by Nigel Pilkington in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì An Indian jackal. He is Shere Khan's sycophantic, greedy, devious sidekick where he lacks the courage to disagree with his tiger master. He is usually the one to set up traps for Mowgli so Shere Khan can eat him. *Bandar-log ‚Äì A group of langurs who like to cause trouble for Mowgli and his friends. They live in the Cold Lair temple ruins.  Masha (voiced by Joseph J. Terry in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì A langur who is the queen of the Bandar-logs. * Jacala ‚Äì A giant Mugger crocodile who would eat anyone that trespasses into his territory. * Kala (voiced by Colin McFarlane in season 1-2) - A black panther who looks like Bagheera, with a scar. Highly territorial and hostile towards Bagheera and Mowgli. He also has a scar on his right eye. * Phaona (voiced by Aaron Albertus in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì An Indian wolf who is the grandson of Akela. He dislikes Mowgli being in the wolf pack, tries every attempt to expel the adopted human from the pack, and will stop at nothing to attempt becoming the next pack leader. Phaona's plots tend to backfire and he tends to get punished by his grandfather. * Hajeet ‚Äì A bad-tempered and highly territorial honey badger. * Kulu ‚Äì A Crow who works for Shere Khan, and has a rivalry with Tabaqui Other animals *Darzi (voiced by Peter Michail/Teresa Gallagher in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì A tiny solid-red bird without a mate or nest. Brave for its size and friendly, but poor as a messenger (as in the book) causing bird-brain and terrible memory. *Hathi (voiced by Phil Lollar in seasons 1‚Äì2) ‚Äì A wise Indian elephant who is the leader of the jungle's elephants.  Gajjini ‚Äì A light violet Indian elephant who is the wife of Hathi.  Appu and Heetah ‚Äì Hathi and Gajjini's two calves who are Mowgli's friends. * Rangoo ‚Äì A colourful fruit-eating bird. * Chil ‚Äì A kite. * Ikki ‚Äì An Indian crested porcupine. *Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (voiced by Nigel Pilkington in seasons 1‚Äì) ‚Äì An Indian gray mongoose. Here he lives in the jungle with the other animals. Very cute-faced, ferret-sized and fearless (once even fought with Shere Khan in order to defend Mowgli). * Thuu ‚Äì An Indian cobra, occasionally the leader of a cobra's nest. * Manny ‚Äì A young langur monkey who is friends with Mowgli. * Oo and Boo ‚Äì A couple of old turtles. * Pavo ‚Äì A leucistic peacock. * Alonna ‚Äì A Demoiselle Crane. * Hoola ‚Äì A peacock who is Pavo's rival. * Rana ‚Äì A purple Wild Pig who has a short temper. * Ravi and Vira ‚Äì A Bluebird couple. * Chota ‚Äì A young Tiger cub. * Ponya ‚Äì A red panda. * Langur ‚Äì A Himalayan monkey. * ChuChip ‚Äì A young sambar deer mowgli befriends. * Bella ‚Äì A female bear that Baloo falls for, but she's actually trying to get rid of Baloo, but she later reformed after she and Baloo Recouncil. * Lori and Barasingha Barashinga is a deer with the same name who dreams of becoming one of Santa's flying Reindeer, Lori is a Loris who is always worried about Bara. * Ackney is an Indian Giant Squirrel.

The Missouri State Convention, acting under authorities granted to it by the special election earlier that year, declared the office of Governor vacant, and appointed former Missouri Supreme Court Justice Hamilton Gamble Governor. Even opponents of Federal action in Missouri generally respected Gamble. Political As the secession crisis deepened, Missouri attempted to follow a policy of armed neutrality, in which the state would not support either side in the war but remain in the Union. A special election in February established a Missouri Constitutional Convention to determine the relationship between Missouri and the United States. The convention voted against secession and affirmed the state's neutrality. The outbreak of hostilities at Fort Sumter led to unrest in Missouri. Secessionists seized the Liberty Arsenal a week later. Governor Claiborne Jackson called up the state militia for drill in St. Louis and to receive some arms clandestinely obtained from the Confederacy. This resulted in a confrontation with the aggressive Union commander Nathaniel Lyon, who forced the surrender of the militia, in what was called the Camp Jackson Affair. After a deadly riot ensued, the Missouri legislature authorized the reorganization of the militia into the Missouri State Guard, controlled by the governor. General William Harney reached an agreement with the new Missouri State Guard commander Sterling Price, known as the Price-Harney Truce. Lincoln appointed Lyon to replace Harney as commander of the Department of the West. During negotiations among the governor, Lyon, and Price, Lyon would not accept the governor's proposed limitations on Federal troops and volunteers. The meeting ended abruptly with Lyon declaring, \\"Rather than concede to the State of Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my government in any matter however important, I would see you, and you, and you, and you, and every man, woman, and child in the State, dead and buried! This means war. In an hour one of my officers will call on you and conduct you out of my lines.\\"Albert Castel, General Sterling Price and the Civil War in the West, p.24 As the Missouri government fled into exile Lyon moved rapidly capturing the capitol at Jefferson City, Missouri a few days later in mid-June 1861. The Missouri Constitutional Convention reconvened to consider the status of the state in July. The convention declared the governor's office and state legislative offices to be vacant and appointed Gamble as governor of a provisional government of Missouri on August 1. Gov. Jackson called a rump session of the exiled General Assembly in Neosho, Missouri, and in late October with a dubious quorum passed an ordinance of secession.http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#Missouri Although secessionists considered Gamble an unelected puppet of the Union forces, he opposed harsh Union treatment of the state. For instance, he protested to President Lincoln about the Fremont Emancipation, which unilaterally freed the state's slaves in 1861 and imposed martial law. Lincoln agreed to Gamble's request to overturn this decision, rescinded the emancipation and removed John C. Fremont from command. Military The Provisional Government of Missouri, faced a difficult task, dealing with Missouri secessionists who considered Union men traitors, and Federal troops from outside the state who tended to view all Missourians as potential rebels. Governor Gamble convinced President Lincoln that local units composed of Missourian, controlled by the (Provisional) State Government, would be the least disruptive way to deal with Missouri Guerrillas and would free out-state Federal regiments for other combat roles. This lead Lincoln to authorized the creation of the (new) Missouri State Militia, a military force with a legal status unique in U.S. history. It was paid and equipped by the Federal government, but ultimately reported the Governor of Missouri, and had a service obligation limited to Missouri, and operations related to Missouri security. To integrate the MSM with federal forces in the region Governor Gamble commissioned Major General Henry W. Halleck, the Federal commander of the Department of the Mississippi as the Major General of the Missouri State Militia. The Missouri State Militia, and the later Enrolled Militia and Provisional Enrolled Militia, did not fully suppress guerrilla activity in the state (neither could conventional Federal troops) but did contribute significant combat power (directly and indirectly) to Federal efforts in the Trans-Mississippi Theater Trans-Mississippi Theater. Due to its internecine nature, the Civil War in Missouri would be longer and more brutal than anywhere else in the U.S. However, the Provisional Government managed to keep the majority of Missourians from embracing secessionism, and played a vital role in holding the state for the Union.

Splicing is performed independently of the spliceosome by Ire1, a kinase with endoribonuclease activity. Exons are joined by a tRNA ligase. Recognition of the intron splice sites is mediated by a base-paired secondary structure of the mRNA that forms at the exon/intron boundaries. Splicing of the bZIP intron is a key regulatory step in the unfolded protein response (UPR). The Ire-mediated unconventional splicing was first described for HAC1 in S. cerevisiae. Consensus structure The secondary structure of the bZIP intron is very well conserved, and consists of two hairpins (H2 and H3) around the splice sites, and an extended hairpin (H1) that brings the splice sites together (see figure). The sequence of the intron is well conserved only around the splice sites. Non- canonical splicing motifs CNG'CNG in the loop region of H2 and H3 hairpins are conserved. The consensus intron is very short in Metazoa (20, 23 or 26 nt). However, yeast species have a long (>100 nt) intron in HAC1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the long intron pairs with the 5‚Ä≤ UTR and stalls the ribosomes on the mRNA. Mechanism of splicing Environmental stress can cause proteins to misfold and aggregate. To protect from these undesirable processes, a cell can activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Splicing of the bZIP mRNA by Ire1 is one of the highly regulated ways of activating the UPR in response to presence of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress activates the endoribonucleolytic activity of IRE1 proteins. IRE1 recognizes splice-site motifs in bZIP transcript and cleaves it. Stem-loop structures around the splice sites and IRE1-specific sequence motifs are both necessary and sufficient for splicing to occur. The joining of exons is performed by tRNA ligase (TRL1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Intron conservation Ire-mediated unconventional splicing of the bZIP intron has been confirmed experimentally in the following species: * Yeast: S. cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia pastoris, Candida parapsilosis * Animals: human, mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans, fruit fly, honey bee, carp, whiteleg shrimp *Other Fungi: Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora crassa, Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago maydis * Plants: Arabidopsis thaliana, maize. Computational methods predict a bZIP intron with its characteristic RNA structure in 128 out of 156 species studied. In Fungi a bZIP intron was initially found only in Ascomycota (in 52 out of 63 species analysed) but experimental studies showed it is also present in Basidiomycota and other Candida species. All 45 vertebrate genomes analysed, 19 of Arthropoda, 7 of Nematoda, 2 of Annelida and 2 of Mollusca contain a characteristic HAC1-like structure in an open reading frame.

Main provisions The Act gave extra powers to the Scottish Parliament, most notably: * The ability to raise or lower income tax by up to 10p in the pound. Any change is applied across all tax bands. * Devolving stamp duty and landfill tax to Scotland to replace them with new taxes specific to Scotland. * The Scottish Government to have borrowing powers, up to ¬£5 billion. * Legislative control over several more issues including limited powers relating to drink driving limits and air weapons * Creation of Revenue Scotland, a tax authority for Scottish devolved taxes while HMRC still collects taxes that are not devolved to Scotland Calman Commission The proposed legislation was based on the final report of the Calman Commission, which was established by an opposition Labour Party motion in the Scottish Parliament in December 2007, against the wishes of the Scottish National Party minority government. Professor Jim Gallagher, the civil servant who drafted the Bill, was appointed to advise the Scotland Bill Committee of the Scottish Parliament, convened by Wendy Alexander, whose parliamentary motion started the whole Calman process. Passage The Bill was presented to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, on St Andrew's Day (30 November), 2010, and received an unopposed second reading on 27 January 2012. The UK government stated that it would not pass the bill unless it had obtained a legislative consent motion from the Scottish Parliament, although the Parliament of the United Kingdom could have passed the Bill in any case.S. MacNab, \\"Scotland Bill: Parties split as SNP threatens to block transfer of powers\\", The Scotsman, (16 December 2011) The governing Scottish National Party indicated that it planned to block the bill. However, after a deal was reached between the two governments on 21 March 2012,BBC News, \\"Holyrood to be given new income tax and borrowing powers\\". BBC News Online, (21 March 2012) the Scottish Parliament unanimously passed a legislative consent motion in respect of the Bill on 18 April 2012.BBC News, \\"MSPs endorse new Holyrood powers under Scotland Bill\\", BBC News Online, (18 April 2012) Reaction and analysis The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, described the legislation as the largest transfer of fiscal powers from central Government since the creation of the United Kingdom. Although the Scottish National Party supported some parts of the Bill as introduced, it opposed others. In particular, it considered that the income tax proposals were flawed. However, the SNP agreed to support the Bill, after the proposals to return certain powers were dropped, and agreement was reached that the details of the income tax changes would be subject to approval by MSPs. After the Bill received legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament, the Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy, Bruce Crawford, MSP argued that, although the Bill would not harm Scottish interests, it represented a missed opportunity and had been overtaken by events, in particular the return of an SNP majority government in 2011 and the consequent independence referendum.\\"MSPs back Holyrood powers boost\\", Stornoway Gazette, (18 April 2012) Amendment There is a proposal to amend section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998, which provides that the Lord Advocate, as a member of the Scottish Executive, has no power to do anything in contravention of the European Convention rights. Given that, alongside being the adviser to and representative of the Scottish Government in Scots law, the Lord Advocate is head of the system of criminal prosecution in Scotland and every prosecution in a Scottish court proceeds with his/her authority, this provision effectively allows any human rights issue raised in any criminal proceedings in Scotland effectively to be appealed to the UK Supreme Court as a constitutional \\"devolution issue\\".The Law Society of Scotland, news statement The Supreme Court consists of two Supreme Court judges from Scotland and ten judges from other parts of the United Kingdom. When hearing appeals the Supreme Court sits with a bench of at least five judges, so even if both Scottish judges are present for a Scottish appeal, the majority of the bench will be judges who may not be especially well versed in Scots law and criminal procedure. According to Lord Hope of Craighead, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, non-Scottish judges will in practice defer to their Scottish colleagues in Scottish cases, and often simply concur with judgements written by the Scottish judges. However, the situation is seen by some, including the Scottish Government, as undermining the status of the High Court of Justiciary as the final court of appeal in criminal matters in Scots law, and even of undermining the integrity of Scots law. The Advocate General for Scotland asked an expert group, chaired by Sir David Edward, to consider this issue and make recommendations, which led to the amendments to the Scotland Bill proposed by the UK Government. The Scottish Government remains concerned that the amendments may not fully address the issue, particularly as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in Fraser v HM Advocate, and appointed their own expert group, chaired by Lord McCluskey, to consider the matter and report back.

NCIA is the largest cannabis trade association in the U.S. and the only organization representing state-sanctioned cannabis-related businesses at the federal level. Its mission is \\"to promote the growth of a responsible and legitimate cannabis industry and work for a favorable social, economic and legal environment for that industry in the United States.\\" The organization was founded in late 2010 and has been described as the \\"first national trade group for the cannabis industry\\" in the United States. As the cannabis industry has grown and matured dramatically in recent years, NCIA has grown with it. The group officially held its first board meeting on December 16, 2010 with a small handful of members. In January 2013, NCIA had 118 member businesses. In January 2014, NCIA had \\"nearly 400\\" member businesses. As of July 2017, NCIA had nearly 1,400 member businesses. In June 2019, NCIA reported nearly 2,000 member businesses. The NCIA has been negatively compared to the lobbying arms of the alcohol and tobacco industries, with activists worried that it could harm legalization efforts. In February 2020, the organization brought on five new board members; Canopy Rivers president and CEO Narbe Alexandrian, Law Offices of Omar Figueroa Inc. principal Omar Figueroa, Rocky Mountain Reagents Inc. VP Liz Geisleman, Copperstate Farms general counsel Ryan Hurley and Indica LLC and Stick Ypsi co-founder Chris Jackson. Work The NCIA promotes a multitude of virtues it sees in the cannabis plant and its trade, including how the plant may help heal the sick, how legalization adds much-needed tax dollars to government coffers on the local, state, and national levels, and how these and other benefits radiate out into communities.Goodman, Michelle \\"An MBA for stoners: Get ready for the next growth industry\\" Salon November 16, 2013Excellence in Philanthropy: Drug Donors The NCIA lobbies Congress to tax cannabis fairly and to allow cannabis businesses easier access to the banking industry.Saddiqui, Sabrina and Reilly, Ryan J. \\"Marijuana Industry Lobbies Congress On Taxes\\" The Huffington Post June 6, 2013 The trade group's work also extends to the local level; it helps marijuana and medical marijuana businesses navigate a patchwork of laws that differ by state and locality.Frosch, Dan \\"New Trade Group‚Äôs Focus Will Be Marijuana Industry\\" The New York Times November 22, 2010 NCIA also hosts educational and training events for members and others interested in learning about the cannabis industry. In June 2014, NCIA hosted the first national Cannabis Business Summit, a two-day event featuring more than 1,000 attendees and numerous discussions of regulations, banking, product lines, insurance, energy efficiency, human resources and other issues related to the burgeoning marijuana industry. Since then, the Cannabis Business Summit has been held annually, and the 2017 Cannabis Business Summit featured 4,500 attendees and a keynote address from former President of Mexico Vicente Fox. The 2019 Cannabis Business Summit hosted over 10,000 attendees and featured a blues-themed closing celebration with actor Jim Belushi. On August 29, 2012, leaders launched the National Cannabis Industry Association PAC to contribute funds to cannabis-friendly politicians and causes. In 2016 NCIA launched NCIA's Cannabis Industry Voice, a podcast covering the ever-changing legal and business landscape of cannabis in the United States. In 2018, NCIA spent $560,000 on political lobbying, roughly 21% of total U.S. cannabis industry lobbying spending of $2.7 million. In 2019, NCIA, the American Bankers Association, and the Credit Union National Association all came out in favor of the SAFE Banking Act, which would allow banks and credit unions to work with cannabis businesses in states where such businesses are legal. The National Association of State Treasurers, the National Association of Attorneys General, and all 50 state banking associations have also endorsed the SAFE Banking Act. On July 18, 2019, NCIA joined 4Front Holdings and more than 100 other signatories in submitting an open letter to the House Judiciary Committee, calling for the removal of cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and for efforts to address the racially disparate harm caused by federal cannabis prohibition. Members As of August 2019, the National Cannabis Industry Association has nearly 2,000 member businesses. Reception In a Huffington Post interview, Mark Kleiman, the \\"Pot Czar\\" of Washington state, said he was concerned that the NCIA would favor profits over public health. He also said that it could become a predatory body like the lobbying arms of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Kleiman said: \\"The fact that the National Cannabis Industry Association has hired itself a K Street suit [lobbyist] is not a good sign.\\" See also * Marijuana Policy Project * National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws References External links Ark Institute Website 2010 in cannabis Cannabis in Washington, D.C.

The parish house was also opened. In the years 1988 and 2003, three plots of land were bought, thus expanding the church grounds. In 2002, a parish census was taken by Fr. Augustine Wong, former parish priest. It was estimated that there are 2,000 Catholics residing around the Air Itam and Paya Terubong, an increase of the population here. At that period of time, the parish centre was launched. The parish centre, a 3-storey building with a hall and classrooms for functions and catechism classes were opened in January 2009. The bungalow located within the church grounds were also renovated and in August 2009, the priests residence and parish office were moved there. In September 2009, the old church was handed over to the contractor for renovation. The church was redesigned and in October 2010, the newly renovated church was ready. The dedication ceremony of this church was held on 1 January 2011, Bishop Antony Selvanayagam dedicated the newly renovated church. Currently, the parish priest post is held by Fr.

Ingleby was a descendant of Sir Thomas Ingleby, judge of the king's bench in the reign of Edward III of England. He was the third son of John Ingleby of Lawkland, Yorkshire. He was admitted a member of Gray's Inn in June 1663, and called to the bar in November 1671. He was a Roman Catholic, and in February 1680 was charged by the informers Robert Bolron and Moubray with complicity in the Gascoigne plot, and was committed to the King's Bench prison, but upon his trial at York in July he was acquitted. Upon the accession of James II he was promoted, and was made a baron of the Irish court of exchequer, 23 April 1686, but, refusing to proceed to Ireland, was made a serjeant-at-law in May of the following year, and on 6 July 1688 was knighted and made a Baron of the Exchequer. In November, upon the landing of William of Orange, his patent was superseded, and he returned to the bar. His is almost the only case in which a judge has resumed practice.

Description The forewing length is for males and for females. The forewing ground colour is dark brownish-black with strong purplish-bronze reflections. There is a maximum of five and a minimum of three shining white fasciae comprising: a short basal triangular streak, which is consistently present, in the centre of the wing, contiguous with the tegula. Secondly, a transverse band at mid-length, either as a continuous broad line or only partly represented in the form of either a bold triangular patch on the dorsum or triangular patches on both the costa and the dorsum. Furthermore, a much smaller costal patch and a few white scales in the apex present in all specimens. The fringes are long along the termen and largely dark brownish- black, white-tipped and wholly white around the apex. The hindwing is greyish- brown with bronzy-purple reflections. The fringes are grey-brown. The shiny white markings on the forewing of this species is variable. Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is known from the northern North Island of New Zealand, from Te Paki south to Puketitri, Hawkes Bay and including Poor Knights, Little Barrier and Great Barrier Islands. Ecology and Habitat Adults have been found between September and March. It inhabits a wide variety of moist indigenous forest types but usually with podocarps. Larvae have been sieved from rotten wood on the floor of a mixed podocarp/broadleaf forest or extracted from moss or from bryophytes on a ditch wall.

De Beer's work is located at the intersection of film, installation, sculpture, and photography, and she is primarily known for her large-scale film-installations. Background De Beer received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (BFA) from Parsons The New School for Design in New York in 1995 and a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) from Columbia University in 1998. Early life and education De Beer was raised in New England, and lives in New York City. She cites the aesthetic of 1700 and 1900 New England as an early influence on her work: Growing up in a rambling Victorian house with a widow's walk in Salem, Mass., which still exudes an air of its witchy past, she felt that mysticism was a kind of birthright, and it has been a more prominent element of her work in recent years.. Ms. de Beer has also borrowed from the dark, violent post- religious mysticism of the novelist Dennis Cooper. (From his novel \\"Period,\\" used in a 2005 de Beer video: \\"I could open the other dimension right now if I wanted. Or I could stay here with you. I'm kind of like a god.\\") Time itself is the most often repeated subject of de Beer's work, emerging from images and ideas related to the passage of time. Ghosts, haunting, adolescence, trace memory and erasure find a common ground within this theme. Ms. de Beer said that her fascination with ghosts is in one sense simply about finding a way to explore how we all must deal with the past and with loss as we grow older, a struggle that finds a metaphor in the artistic process itself. De Beer lived in Berlin, Germany between 2002-2008. She produced and shot three films in Berlin: 'Hans & Grete' (2003), 'Black Sun' (2005), and 'the Quickening' (2006).

Franz Rohleder; Ausf.) Research was done in 2008 by asking Baupolizei; MA 43 (Anfrage Gr√§berdatenbank; Grabprotokoll Zentralfriedhof, Wien 11); WStLA (Verlassenschaftsabhandlung)- According to wien.gv.at, he also did Gentzgasse 44, Hasenauerstrasse 57, Vinzenzgasse 30, W√§hringer Stra√üe 147, Hadikgasse 104. He also carried out some unspecified works in Hegelgasse 6, not far from the Opera; in Schwarzspanierstrasse 20, right behind the Votivkirche and hotel Regina; in Karolinengasse 23, near Prinz Eugen-Strasse and the Belvedere; and in B√∂rsegasse 2/4, where the Vienna Stock Exchange (Wiener B√∂rse) is. He was a contemporary of Austrian architect Joseph Maria Olbrich (1867‚Äì1908), co- founder of the Vienna Secession artistic group which was founded in 1897 by Gustav Klimt (1862‚Äì1918), Josef Hoffmann, and Koloman Moser. It is quite likely that Hattey and Klimt met, as Hattey and Olbrich were both architects in the same city and in the same period of time, but there is no evidence of any such meeting. He is mentioned in the 1925 book \\"W√§hring- Ein Heimatbuch des 18. Wiener Gemeindebezirkes\\". The photo in this page was taken by Ludwig Grillich (1855 - 21 May 1926). Some notables who appeared before his lens were Johann Strauss II, Johannes Brahms and Sigmund Freud. In December 2014 the Museum of the 18th District in Vienna (XVIII., Bezirksmuseum W√§hring, W√§hringer Stra√üe 124) put on display, thanks to its director Doris Weis, a little section that acknowledges the work of Johann Hattey. Hattey was of Czech origin. According to church books kept at the National Archives in Plzen, his father Josef, born in Klaster (Czech Republic) on 10 January 1818 as Josef Hatag, was the son of the locals Josef Hatag (same name) and Marie Svikova, who were born in the 18¬∞ century. Josef Hatag senior was the son of Simon Hatag and Magdalena Czyberova, whilst Marie Svikova was the daughter of Vojtech Svik and Anna Kuplova. Anna Borik, Josef Hatag's wife, was born in Zinkovy (Czech Republic) on 29 June 1815 and was the daughter of locals Frantisek Borik and Katerina Duchkova. Parents of Frantisek Borik were Vojtech Borik and Marie Horova, while parents of Katerina were Vojtech Duchek and Anna Hlavova. Five sons and daughters were born from his marriage to Josefine Fuhrmann (Josefa Stranner): (Johann, Josef, Bruno, Friederike, Mathilde). Bruno (buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery on 25 October 1968) married twice-from his first marriage Doris was born -children Ian and Christine Howard- and from his second he had Elfi; Johann also called Hans had two daughters; Frieda had two sons (Remo -children Frieda and Marina Pecoraro- and Irmo) and four daughters (Vera -children Laura and Franco Bacoccoli-, Elsa, Diana, Wanda -child Maririca Oliva-); Josef also called Pepsch had no sons or daughters and died in Buenos Aires; Mathilde died young during World War 1. Quite interestingly, Marianne Hattey, Ian and Christine's grandmother, had a brother called Oscar who had two children, Giorgio and Helga. Helga's grandmother, Flora Husserl Pfau, was cousin of philosopher Husserl because Helga's grandmother father (Sigmund Husserl) was brother of Edmund Husserl's father (Adolf Avraham Husserl). Josefa Stranner, Johann's wife, was born in 1870 in Vienna. Josefa was the daughter of an Austrian architect. His father, Josef (5 March 1825 ‚Äì 20 May 1884), who was born in Lieseregg in K√§rnten (his parents were Michael Stranner and Elisabeth ver. Stranner geb. Tandl), was in fact \\"Baumeister und Architekt\\".

Story arc The story is set in the isolated Outback, mainly Aboriginal town of Wala Wala, where an Aboriginal man is found dead in the local police lock up. The film explores the strained and complex relations between the people of the town in the aftermath, amidst growing tensions of forbidden love, sacrilege and murder. Bryan Brown plays the hardboiled local policeman and Ernie Dingo plays the idealistic local Aboriginal Christian pastor. Each of the characters is confronted with how to reconcile Aboriginal tradition with contemporary Australia. Production Nick Parsons wrote a script called Dead Heart based on the true story of an aboriginal who killed someone in the 1930s for traditional reasons. Parson was not happy with it but decided to rewrite the story as a play when he attended National Institute of Dramatic Art NIDA.

During the War of 1812, Cocke was a brigadier general of the Virginia militia. After his military service, he invested in the James River and Kanawha Company and helped Thomas Jefferson establish the University of Virginia. The family estate that Cocke built at Bremo Plantation is now a National Historic Landmark. Biography Early life and education John Hartwell Cocke II was born on September 19, 1780, at the Mount Pleasant plantation in Surry County, Virginia. With the exception of his younger brother Robert Kennon Cocke, who died in 1790, John was the only son of eight children born to John Hartwell Cocke I and Elizabeth Kennon Cocke. The elder Cocke had married Elizabeth Kennon, who grew up on her parents' plantation named Mount Pleasant, in Chesterfield County, Virginia. He became a colonel in the American Revolution. The younger Cocke was orphaned by the age of twelve; he inherited his father's plantation and slaves, which he took over after coming of age. At the age of fourteen, Cocke enrolled at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he stayed at the home of Colonel Champion Travis. Cocke graduated as part of the class of 1798. Upon his twenty-first birthday in 1801, he legally inherited the Mount Pleasant plantation. Marriage and family Cocke married Anne Blaus (or Blaws) Barraud in Norfolk, Virginia, on December 25, 1802. Her father, Philip Barraud, was a physician who practiced medicine in Williamsburg, where Cocke had studied. Anne stayed in Norfolk until March 1803, while Cocke renovated the plantation home in Surry County. The Cockes had a son, John Hartwell, in 1804 and a daughter, Louisiana Barraud, in 1806 at Mount Pleasant. In 1809, Cocke sold the plantation to his sister Sally and her husband Nicholas Faulcon. He moved with his family to Bremo Plantation, which he had built on the northern bank of the James River in Fluvanna County in the Piedmont. His wife gave birth at Bremo to another son, Philip St. George, in 1809 and another daughter, Ann Blaus, in 1811. War of 1812 Map of the Chickahominy River (highlighted) During the War of 1812, Cocke was commissioned as a brigadier general in command of the Virginia militia based out of Camp Carter and Camp Holly. His brigade was composed of companies of troops from Fluvanna County. From 1812 to 1813, Cocke led the defense of Richmond, Virginia along the Chickahominy River against British forces. Cocke was noted for being a distinguished officer; the strict discipline he enforced upon insubordinate soldiers was compared to that of Baron von Steuben. Cocke rode a bay stallion named Roebuck during the war. Post-war life Bremo Mansion After the war, Cocke returned to his estate at Bremo, where his wife had another son, Cary Charles, born in 1814. Cocke's wife Anne died in December 1816, a few months after the birth of their youngest daughter, Sally Faulcon. Anne was buried at Bremo Recess. In 1819, Cocke completed construction of a large plantation mansion at Upper Bremo with the master builder John Neilson, who had worked with Thomas Jefferson on Monticello. That year, Cocke was appointed by Virginia governor James Patton Preston to the first Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia. By the time Cocke retired from the board in 1852, annual enrollment at the university had reached 400 students. In 1835, Cocke joined the board of directors of the James River and Kanawha Company, which was established to develop canals to improve water transportation along of the James River. The river traffic became an important part of the local economy in the following decades, but a series of floods and the American Civil War brought an end to this era. A devout Christian, Cocke participated in several efforts to reform different aspects of society, including temperance and gradual emancipation. Cocke inherited a number of slaves and also was an important player in Virginia's domestic slave trade, helping professors at the University of Virginia buy slaves and renting slaves to the institution. Cocke expressed \\"continual hostility to slavery\\" and promoted using \\"education and skill training\\" to prepare slaves for freedom and colonization in Africa; as a result, he was once violently attacked by a pro-slavery neighbor. By 1848, Cocke started a second plantation in Alabama as a place for slaves to prepare to colonize Liberia. Though it was unpopular with abolitionists and the black population in general in the United States, he supported the colonization project by sending books and supplies over the years. In 1855, Cocke traded his mansion for the smaller home of his son Cary Charles on the plantation, where he retired for the remainder of his years. Legacy Bremo Slave Chapel John Hartwell Cocke's son Philip St. George Cocke was commissioned as a colonel in the Confederate States Army, commanding troops at the Battle of Blackburn's Ford and the First Battle of Bull Run. Promoted to brigadier general in 1861, he committed suicide that year before Christmas. He was described as \\"excitable\\" and \\"eccentric,\\" but no one really understood what made him take such action. In 1881, John's last surviving son, Dr. Cary Charles Cocke, along with William Cocke and Charles E. Cosby, purchased land nearby in Bremo Bluff to relocate a chapel which John Hartwell Cocke had built for his slaves on the plantation. Consecrated as part of an Episcopal Church, the Bremo Slave Chapel was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in December 1979 and the National Register of Historic Places in March 1980. Cocke's plantation was declared a National Historic Landmark as Bremo Historic District in November 1971. He also designed Glen Burnie near Palmyra, Virginia and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Collaboration with Thomas Jefferson Cocke in the 1850s Cocke was a longtime associate of former president Thomas Jefferson, and he sometimes traded for items grown at Jefferson's Monticello estate. Cocke collaborated with James Madison, James Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson's dream to establish the University of Virginia. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction of the new university. Cocke's conservative practicality occasionally clashed with Jefferson's creative aesthetics, such as his opposition to Jefferson's flat roof design, which he thought would compromise the durability of buildings for students. Jefferson's trust in the younger man was shown by his arranging for Cocke to take over executorship of the will of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, a Polish nobleman whom Jefferson had befriended during the American Revolutionary War. On a visit to the United States in 1798, Ko≈õciuszko entrusted his pension from the Army and other monies to his friend Jefferson, together with his will; he intended to have his American estate used to purchase the freedom of slaves, including Jefferson's own. After Ko≈õciuszko's death in 1817, Jefferson did not immediately act on this will, in part because of his advanced age (he would die in 1826) and in part because Ko≈õciuszko had written three subsequent wills, and had relatives and acquaintances claiming that they‚Äînot Jefferson‚Äîshould control his estate. Jefferson attempted to have the complicated legal affair, with its accompanying financial liabilities, transferred to Cocke, knowing that Cocke was also an opponent of slavery. However, Cocke also refused the task. The case of the disputed wills went before the Supreme Court of the United States three times, and in 1852 the Court finally ruled that Ko≈õciuszko had revoked his earliest will in 1816, giving his estate to his Polish relatives. Historians have disagreed over the correctness of Jefferson's actions, with some critics arguing that he passed up an opportunity to free all his slaves, and others pointing out that \\"Kosciusko screwed up,\\" since Jefferson knew that the will was \\"a litigation disaster waiting to happen.\\" Since the late twentieth century, Cocke's diaries have attracted the attention of historians because of his writing about Jefferson's slave mistress. The long debate known as the Jefferson- Hemings controversy has related to whether the president had an intimate connection with his slave Sally Hemings and her children. Most historians now believe that Jefferson had a long relationship with Hemings and four surviving children by her. He freed all of them, two informally and two in his will.Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: Paradox of Liberty, 27 January - 14 October 2012, Smithsonian Institution, Quote: \\"While there were other adult males with the Jefferson Y chromosome living in Virginia at that time, most historians now believe that the documentary and genetic evidence, considered together, strongly support the conclusion that Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings's children.\\" Accessed 15 March 2012 Cocke wrote of his knowledge that Jefferson had fathered children with his slave mistress. In keeping with the social demands for discretion among planters on such interracial liaisons, Cocke did not reveal his knowledge until years after Jefferson had died.

The genus currently contains two described species, Baltimartyria proavitella and Baltimartyria rasnitsyni. B. proavitella The first known fossil was originally studied and described by Hans Rebel of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, Austria. Rebel named the species Micropterix proavitella, thinking it belonged to the modern genus Micropterix. Rebel published his description of the species in 1936. The fossil was reexamined in 1995 by the Polish entomologist Andrzej W. Skalski, who recognized the species was not a member of Micropterix and moved the species to the new genus Baltimartyria. B. rasnitsyni The second species of Baltimartyria described from Baltic amber is B. rasnitsyni which, like B. proavitella, is known from a single specimen. The holotype is included in the paleoentomology collections of the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, as specimen MB.I 5950. The holotype specimen is a complete male moth, included in a transparent section of amber with its wings partly spread. Due to the positioning of the body the right antenna and right maxillary palps are not visible, while the top and inner sides of the genitalia are partly coated in a white coating. Overall the specimen has a body length of and has a fore-wing length of . B. rasnitsyni is distinguishable from B. proavitella by characters of the wing vein structure and the maxillary palps. While the R vein branches in B. proavitella all originate separately from the cell, whereas the R4 and R5 veins originate from a single vein that forks on the apex side of the cell. The species was described and named by Wolfram Mey in a 2011 paper published in the online and print journal ZooKeys. Mey notes that the type specimen had been sitting on his desk for a number of years prior to description. The generic placement was not recognized by Mey until Skalski's 1995 redescription of B. proavitella. Mey chose the specific epithet rasnitsyni to honor the eminent Russian paleoentomologist, Alexandr Pavlovich Rasnitsyn.

Sarkunam, directing his second film after Kalavani. It features Vimal and newcomer Ineya in the lead roles, with Bhagyaraj, Ponvannan and Thambi Ramaiah playing supporting roles. The film is a period piece set in the 1960s in a remote village in Tamil Nadu. The film released on 30 September 2011 to generally positive reviews. Subsequently, the film was honored with the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil for 2012.  Plot  The story is set in the 1960s. Veluthambi (Vimal) is a graduate aspiring for a government job. His father Annamalai (Bhagyaraj) advises him to work temporarily for a NGO that helps in educating rural children so that he will be given a priority for a government job. Velu, although uninterested, joins the NGO and gets appointed as a teacher in a small dry village which lacks basic facilities. The entire village works for a rich landlord named JP (Ponvannan), who owns a brick factory. Velu tries to convince the villagers to send their kids to learn, but in vain. Madhiarasi (Ineya) owns a tea shop in the village with her brother (Dhashwanth) and falls in love with Velu. Also, the village kids play pranks on Velu, which irritates him. Velu understands that the villagers are exploited by JP, owing to their illiteracy by not paying them properly. Velu tries to make the villagers understand JP's true colour, but they do not believe him as they see JP as their savior. Finally, the villagers understand that they are being cheated, and they demand proper payment for the bricks made by them. They also realize the value of education and send their kids to learn under Velu. Now, Velu gets a government job but turns down the offer as he prefers to continue working for the NGO, which gives him satisfaction. In a few days, he gets a letter from the NGO, stating that it is closing down due to financial difficulties. Velu worries as he is jobless and decides to work along with villagers in making bricks. The villagers come for the rescue and want him to continue as a teacher for their kids, and in turn, they agree to pay him. Velu also marries Madhi, and the movie ends with him feeling proud that the villagers understood the value of education.

N. Nambiar * Thennavan as Dhamo * Poovitha as Sivagami * Hello Kandasamy  Production  Shortly after the release of Kalavani, which emerged a sleeper hit, Sarkunam had informed that he had \\"a couple of scripts in mind\\" and was discussing with his team on which they should work next, while stating that it \\"most probably\\" will not be set in a village again. He started working on his next project in late 2010, which he had titled as Vaagai Sooda Vaa, roping in Vimal, who played the lead role in Kalavani, for the lead character again. The film was revealed to be a period piece, set in 1966, with Sarkunam describing it as a \\"romance drama sprinkled with humour\\", while also stating it would convey a \\"much-needed\\" message. Vaagai Sooda Vaa was Sarkunam's first script and his \\"dream project\\", which he had wanted to make his directorial debut with, but he had to drop the idea, since no producer was willing to produce a period film with a newcomer in the lead role. He dismissed reports that the film was based on a Hollywood film and clarified that it was based on a scheme introduced by the Government in the sixties. Vimal was identified to play a young man named Veluthambi, who had finished his PUC and aspires to become a teacher. The lead female role was that of a \\"tea tender\\" of the 1960s, a person working at a tea shop. Initially Amala Paul was signed up for the role, much before the release of her critically acclaimed Mynaa. However, Amala, who following the release became much sought-after, was soon ousted from the project, since she started adjusting her dates as per her wishes and refused to take rehearsals first, which Sarkunam did not agree with. She was replaced by a Malayali model-turned-actress Ineya, who had previously appeared in several Malayalam films and the 2011 Tamil film Yuddham Sei under her original name Shruthi. Ineya had been rejected at first, but was later approved by Sarkunam, when she visited his office during a Chennai trip and showed keen interest in the project and the role. Director-cum-actors K. Bhagyaraj and Thambi Ramaiah were signed to portray the fathers of the lead male and female characters, respectively, while Ponvannan would enact the antagonist's role and Elango Kumaravel would play a pivotal role as a \\"kuruvikaarar\\". Contrary to what Sarkunam had initially planned, Vaagai Sooda Vaa, too, was a story set in a village. Seenu, an assistant Sabu Cyril, took care of the art direction and erected a set of a village of 1 crore worth, near Aruppukottai. The team had further conducted extensive historical research to create an authentic portrayal of the 1960s. Programmes that were aired on Radio Ceylon, which most people during that time were listening to, were imitated, with mimicry artists being roped in to reproduce the voices of the broadcasters of that time.  Release   Reception  Vaagai Sooda Vaa released to mostly positive reviews from the critics. Sifys reviewer called it a \\"thought provoking film which is beautiful, complete and laced with social consciousness\\", further adding that it was a \\"bittersweet tale of human frailties, a small film with a very big heart and a subtle message\\". A critic from Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5, labelling it a \\"simple tale, beautifully narrated on screen\\", while citing that it was a \\"welcome trip back to the villages and to a time when success wasn't defined by wealth alone\\". Malathai Rangarajan from The Hindu wrote that the film was not a \\"run-of-the-mill entertainer, yet it entertains\\", summarizing it as \\"poignancy with an ample dose of healthy fun\\". Anupama Subramanian from Deccan Chronicle gave it 3 out of 5, citing that \\"though the pace suffers and in many places it gives you a docu-drama feel, Sargunam's intention of making a movie different from the run-of-the mill kind should be lauded\\". The critic from Behindwoods wrote that the film worked \\"big time due to the brilliant detailing of Sarkunam and team, art director Seenu, cinematographer Om Prakash and music director Ghibran\\" and that it \\"emerges triumphant bringing out the period feel with a simple love story and a noble message\\", giving it 3 out of 5. Indiaglitz reviewer described the film as \\"strikingly different\\" and an \\"interesting watch\\", while noting it was \\"more a docu drama touching up the economic struggles of the oppressed\\". Chennai Online's reviewer wrote that the film was a \\"must-watch for those looking for a clean movie sans bloodshed, gory violence and obscene dialogues. The script, cinematography, art work and appreciable performances by the lead actors make it a compelling viewing\\".  Soundtrack  The film's score and soundtrack are scored by debutant M. Ghibran, a friend of Sarkunam. Vaagai Sooda Vaa marks the film debut for Ghibran, who had been composing jingles before. The soundtrack, which was released on 1 July 2011, features 6 songs, with lyrics penned by Vairamuthu, Karthik Netha and Ve. Ramasamy. Ghibran had collaborated with the Lisbon International Symphony Orchestra for one of the songs.  Awards  ;National Film Awards * Best Feature Film in Tamil.

History The church was built in the Lombard Renaissance style about one and a half mile from city center, outside the medieval walls, on the road to Bergamo where a Marian apparition may have affected Caterina degli Uberti, a woman from Cremona. Legend holds that on 13 April 1490, after she was fatally wounded by her husband in a wooded area close to the town, and wishing to die in the Grace of God, she implored the help of the Virgin Mary who, it is said, ferried her to a nearby farmhouse. She was then moved inside the city walls where she died, after receiving the last rites and pardoning her husband. A simple wooden cross was placed where the murder came about. However prodigious phenomena continued to happen time and again transforming the site into a holy place to such an extent that the local authorities decided to build a sanctuary.Lombardy Tourism site Bramante made a model for the church, but the work was commissioned to his assistant Giovanni Battagio, who added the four outer circular structures. Battagio left the project around 1500, and was replaced by Giovanni Montanaro. The sanctuary, in an unfinished state, was damaged in the 1514 siege of the city by the Duchy of Milan. In 1694 the sanctuary was committed to the care of the Discalced Carmelites who, in 1706, began the construction of the annexed convent. In 1710 they also added a bell tower. In 1914 the original pavement, in cotto, was replaced with the current tiles. Santa Maria della Croce was named a minor basilica by Pope Pius XII in 1958. In recent years, the sanctuary was entrusted to the Congregation of the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit, a religious community of men who live a contemplative and apostolic life and currently serve also in Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Description Battagio designed a Greek cross plan, with a c. 35 m-tall central structure (circular externally, octagonal internally), to which four smaller units, with a height of some 15 m, are joined. The building's exterior consists of undecorated bricks. View of the interior. Externally the main central unit is divided into four rows, the lower having pilasters, the second a gallery with mullioned windows, while the third has triple arches forming double mullioned windows with decorated parapet. The original project for the uppermost gallery was modified by Montanaro along the lines of the Venetian gothic style; it has small columns, trefoil arches and a decorated parapet similar to that of the second gallery, with roundels in the shape of octagonal snowflakes, stars, sun rays and Greek crosses. The western side minor body houses the church's main entrance with a portal surmounted by a tympanum. The three other side bodies present analogous features. The upper part of the side bodies merges with the central loggia of the second row. The bell tower is decorated with rustication, and is divided into six levels, including the lantern at the top. One of the side bodies is built on two levels. In the lower level is the crypt and on the upper level the main altar, which comes from the city's cathedral and is highly decorated in lapis lazuli and bronze. The altarpiece is an oil on canvas by Benedetto Rusconi, nicknamed il Diana, depicting the Assumption of Mary among the twelve apostles. The presbytery has four statues of the Doctors of the Church, executed by Agostino de Fondulis. The side altars have a rich stucco decoration (1585) by Giovan Battista Castello. The altarpieces are by Antonio Campi, Bernardino Campi, and Carlo Urbino. Other artists active in the interior paintings and frescoes, include Benedetto Rusconi, Giovanni Battista Grandi, Aurelio Gatti, Angelo Bacchetta and the Torricelli brothers from Lugano.

Life Jervis was born in Ipswich on 13 January 1748. He was the son of William Jervis (d. 24 March 1797, aged 72), minister of the presbyterian congregation in St. Nicholas Street, Ipswich. He was educated for the ministry in London at Wellclose Square, under David Jennings, and at Hoxton, under Savage, Andrew Kippis, and Abraham Rees. In 1770 he became classical and mathematical tutor at the Exeter Academy, having also the charge of a presbyterian congregation at Lympstone, Devonshire. In 1771‚Äì2 he shared with James Perry Bartlett the charge of the congregations at Lympstone and Topsham, Devon. William Petty, second earl of Shelburne, engaged him in 1772, on the recommendation of Richard Price, D.D., as resident tutor to his sons at Bowood, Wiltshire, a situation which he filled till 1783. Here he associated with Joseph Priestley, who was Shelburne's librarian till 1780. Jervis, who was ordained in 1779, moved to London about 1783, and became minister of the presbyterian congregation in St. Thomas Street, Southwark. He was elected a trustee of Dr. Daniel Williams's foundations in 1786. On the death of Kippis he was elected his successor (1796) at Princes Street, Westminster. Up to this time his views were low Arian, and it is doubtful whether they underwent any further development. In the summer of 1808 he succeeded William Wood as minister of the unitarian congregation at Mill Hill, Leeds. He resigned this charge, and left the active ministry in 1818. Returning to London, he was re-elected to Dr. Williams's trust in 1823. His closing years were spent in literary leisure. He died at Brompton Grove on 31 August 1833, and was buried in the churchyard of Fryerning, Essex. He married Frances Mary, daughter of John Disney, D.D. Works Jervis published nineteen separate sermons and addresses (1784‚Äì1820), some of which are reprinted in (1) ‚ÄòSermons,‚Äô &c.;, 1811; (2) ‚ÄòRemarks in Refutation of ‚Ä¶ Story of a Supernatural Appearance related by the Rev. R. Warner,‚Äô &c.;, 1831; reprinted 1832. He wrote many biographies for The Gentleman's Magazine and Monthly Repository, and several hymns for the collections of Kippis and others. One of his hymns written in 1795, ‚ÄòSweet is the friendly voice,‚Äô is in Martineau's collections. Family John Jervis (1752‚Äì1820), younger brother of the above, was born at Ipswich in 1752. He succeeded his brother at Lympstone in 1773, was ordained in 1779, and held this charge till his death on 27 October 1820. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society, and a mineralogist. His religious views resembled those of his brother.

He was a relative of John Jones, Unitarian critic. He received his early education at Pencader and Abergavenny, and in 1783 entered Homerton College, London, with the view of preparing for the ministry among the Calvinistic dissenters, but, adopting Unitarian views, moved to Hackney College. There he became tutor and lecturer in experimental philosophy until, in October 1792, he took charge of the New Meeting congregation at Birmingham, as successor to Joseph Priestley, who had recommended him for the post. During his ministry there he delivered in 1794‚Äì5 ‚Äòsome admirable courses of lectures on the philosophy of the human mind, as connected with education, the theory of morals, and also on history.‚Äô Turning to the study of the law, he was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 1 May 1795, was called to the bar on 26 June 1800, and practised chiefly as a chancery barrister, but attached himself as well to the Oxford and South Wales circuits.

It lives in small colonies on rocky outcrops, and the males are very conspicuous for their bright blue heads. Description Study of Agama atra doing territorial display This rather sociable agama is normally found in small groups or colonies. It grows up to about 25 cm and has a thin dorsal crest that runs the length of its body. It typically has a short, plump body and a thin tail, with a triangular head. During the breeding season, the heads of the males become bright blue. The males also take to sitting on top of prominent rocks and are therefore a common sight in mountainous areas of South Africa. The females and young are a more uniform greyish-brown and are much more shy. These active, diurnal lizards normally hunt small insects such as ants and termites. They sometimes adjust to living near urban areas and can even live in rocky gardens. However, the increasingly dense populations of domestic cats being kept as pets in suburban areas have unfortunately led to a decline in population, as these introduced predators tend to kill all the agamas in the immediate area. Agama atra's natural predators in the wild include the fiscal shrike and various snakes. Agama atra is also easy prey for eagles and larger reptiles. Under attack the Agamas go into hiding and will only return once the danger is over. Some Agamas are kept as household pets and generally have a good relationship with their pet owners. A. atra has some ability to change colour, although not to the same extent as chameleons, of which the Agamidae are a sister group. When a male agama in breeding colouration is approached by a potential predator, it will lie flat against a rock and lose the intense breeding colours in favour of more cryptic colouration. A dominant male usually occupies a high point in the area and performs a pushup display and head nodding to warn off intruders. A male Agama atra in breeding season.

It defines foul play as \\"anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game\\". Under these laws dangerous play includes; punching or striking, stamping or trampling, and kicking. Process If a referee observes dangerous play they are obliged to penalise and admonish the perpetrator. This can result in a \\"temporary suspension\\" (yellow card) of 10 minutes or even a \\"sending off\\" (red card). If the offence is serious enough further action can be taken after the game, including bans from playing rugby and criminal charges. In some high-profile matches a citing commissioner is appointed, who can cite any player for dangerous play, whether they have been detected by the referee or not. In matches where there is no appointed citing commissioner the Unions involved can cite players for dangerous play. During the judicial process the severity of the incident is considered. This is assessed by judging if the offending was intentional, reckless, provoked or premeditated as well as what body part was used (fist, knee, boot etc.), how vulnerable the victim was, the effect of the actions had on the victim and disciplinary record of the offender. When handing out match suspensions for dangerous play the IRB recommends suspension periods based on the type and severity of the offence. For most incidences of dangerous play (punching, stamping, dangerous tackles etc.) they recommend suspensions starting from two weeks, up to a maximum of one year. The more serious offences include striking with the head (up to two years), making contact with the eyes (up to three years), testicle grabbing (up to four years) and biting (up to four years). Misconduct The law that deals with dangerous play also applies to misconduct. Misconduct is any conduct (excluding foul play during a match) that is unsporting, unruly, ill- disciplined or that brings the sport of rugby union into disrepute. Misconduct deals with violence or intimidation that occurs within the venue (i.e. changing rooms, tunnel, warmup area), abuse of match officials or spectators, discriminatory statements, bribery, betting on involved games or lying about past disciplinary records. The penalty handed down for misconduct cases could be a caution, fine, suspension (for a number of matches or time period), exclusion from Rugby Unions or grounds, suspension from Rugby officiating or a combination of the above. Verbal abuse of match officials can be punished by up to a year suspension, while threatening could result in five years and physical abuse of an official could see the offender banned for life. Racial or other discriminatory abuse could see a player banned for up to a year. if the player is banned he or she can go to the crown kings general court so that they can get the time on their ban reduced. History Early Rugby games were played under a code of conduct that varied between each school or club. As the popularity and number of clubs increased a set of standardised rules were developed. On 24 November 1863 a set of rules were developed by the Football Association (FA) that included the first law involving dangerous play. Law 10 stated that: \\"If any player with the ball should run towards his advisories' goal, any player in the opposition side should be at liberty to charge, hold, trip, or hack him, or wrest the ball from him; but no player shall be held or hacked at the same time\\". Hacking (tripping an opponent and kicking his shins) and carrying the ball were the most contested rules and they were soon scrapped by the FA. This caused some clubs to leave the Association and soon more games were played that involved hacking and carrying the ball than those that followed the FA's \\"official\\" laws. Concerns over hacking came to a head in 1870 when a surgeon published a letter in the times complaining about the number of rugby injuries he had dealt with that involved hacking, and chastised the schools for letting it continue. Punching and fighting During the 1974 Lions tour to South Africa, Lions captain Willie McBride devised a plan where on a set call every player would attack a South African player, reasoning that this would prevent the referee form penalising any one individual, as he could not send the whole team off. After French fullback Serge Blanco was bumped after taking a mark by Englishman Nigel Heslop during the 1991 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, flanker √âric Champ knocked Heslop out with a punch. In 1990 English lock Paul Ackford was unexpectedly hit by a haymaker from Argentine prop Federico Mendez after being mistaken for another player who made contact with Mendez's head. During the British and Irish Lions 2001 tour match against Australian state side the New South Wales Waratahs, fullback Duncan McRae punched Lions Fly half Ronan O'Gara multiple times as he lay prone on the ground. He received a red card and subsequent seven week ban for the offence, although as it occurred during the Australian off-season he didn't miss any games. In 2009 at a rugby derby involving two of Romania's top teams a mass brawl broke out involving most of the players and reportedly a few spectators. Two players received a red card at the time and nine players were later suspended by the Romanian Rugby Federation. Stamping and kicking In a 1927 match involving Quillan, the strongest team in France at the time, and Perpignan, the Quillan hooker Gaston Riviere received such a kicking that he died from his injuries. Welsh fullback JPR Williams was the victim of stamping by touring New Zealand prop John Ashworth in 1978. After receiving 30 stitches from his father he returned to the game. A player for Welsh club Pontycymmer was jailed for 15 months after stomping on an opposition player's head during a rugby game in 2005. In 2006 a South African rugby player from the Western Cape died after allegedly being kicked in the head during a rugby match. Biting South African prop Johan Le Roux bit New Zealand hooker Sean Fitzpatrick's ear during a scrum during a test in 1994, receiving an 18-month ban. After the disciplinary hearing he stated that \\"For an 18-month suspension, I feel I probably should have torn it off\\". Kevin Yates, an English international, was cited for foul play in 1998 by London Scottish after a player suffered a serious injury to his left ear and subsequently received a six-month ban. In 2008 an English club player was banned for eighty weeks following a biting incident that left a player with \\"a partial amputation of the right index finger\\". A Welsh club rugby player was jailed for a year in 2008 for biting an opponent's earlobe off. After a scuffle during a 2009 rugby match in the Cape Town suburb of Brackenfell, a player had to have his fingertip reattached after an alleged biting incident. Dangerous tackles New Zealand players Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu were involved in an alleged spear tackle on Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll at the start of the first test during the 2005 tour. The tackle dislocated O'Driscoll's shoulder, putting him out of the rest of the tour. Although cited, no suspensions were handed to either Umaga or Mealamu. Eye-gouging Eye-gouging is a serious offence where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as \\"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent\\" but such incidents are usually referred to as \\"eye-gouging\\" among players and in the media. The IRB has made special mention of eye gouging, describing it as \\"particularly heinous\\". Following two high-profile test match incidents, involving Schalk Burger and Sergio Parisse, during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence \\"in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated\\". On 2 October 2010, Gavin Quinnell of the Welsh regional team Scarlets suffered an eye injury 30 minutes into a game between Scarlets feeder club Llanelli and Cross Keys. The following Thursday it was confirmed that, despite the best efforts of surgeons, he had lost the sight in his left eye. The incident is currently being investigated by the Welsh Rugby Union and Gwent Police. Clarence Harding, an amateur player, lost sight in his right eye after an incident. On 24 November 2010 the player alleged to have been responsible was cleared of all charges due to lack of evidence.

Some sources use the alternative notation HPn for the homeprime, leaving out parentheses. Investigations into home primes make up a minor side issue in number theory. Its questions have served as test fields for the implementation of efficient algorithms for factoring composite numbers, but the subject is really one in recreational mathematics. The outstanding computational problem is whether HP(49) = HP(77) can be calculated in practice. As each iteration is greater than the previous up until a prime is reached, factorizations generally grow more difficult so long as an end is not reached. the pursuit of HP(49) concerns the factorization of a 251-digit composite factor of HP49(119) after a break was achieved on 3 December 2014 with the calculation of HP49(117). This followed the factorization of HP49(110) on 8 September 2012 and of HP49(104) on 11 January 2011, and prior calculations extending for the larger part of a decade that made extensive use of computational resources. Details of the history of this search, as well as the sequences leading to home primes for all other numbers through 100, are maintained at Patrick De Geest's worldofnumbers website. A wiki primarily associated with the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search maintains the complete known data through 1000 in base 10 and also has lists for the bases 2 through 9\\\\. The primes in HP(n) are :2, 3, 211, 5, 23, 7, 3331113965338635107, 311, 773, 11, 223, 13, 13367, 1129, 31636373, 17, 233, 19, 3318308475676071413, 37, 211, 23, 331319, 773, 3251, 13367, 227, 29, 547, ... Aside from the computational problems that have had so much time devoted to them, it appears absolute proof of existence of a home prime for any specific number might entail its effective computation. In purely heuristic terms, the existence has probability 1 for all numbers, but such heuristics make assumptions about numbers drawn from a wide variety of processes that, though they likely are correct, fall short of the standard of proof usually required of mathematical claims.  Early history and additional terminology  While it is unlikely that the idea was not conceived of numerous times in the past, the first reference in print appears to be an article written in 1990 in a small and now-defunct publication called Recreational and Educational Computation. The same person who authored that article, Jeffrey Heleen, revisited the subject in the 1996‚Äì7 volume of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics in an article entitled Family Numbers: Constructing Primes By Prime Factor Splicing, which included all of the results HP(n) for n through 100 other than the ones still unresolved. It also included a now-obsolete list of 3-digit unresolved numbers (The 58 listed have been cut precisely in half as of August 2012). It appears that this article is largely responsible for provoking attempts by others to resolve the case involving 49 and 77\\\\. The article uses the terms daughter and parent to describe composites and the primes that they lead to, with numbers leading to the same home prime called siblings (even if one is an iterate of another), and calls the number of iterations required to reach a parent, the persistence of a number under the map to obtain a home prime, the number of lives. The brief article does little other than state the origins of the subject, define terms, give a couple of examples, mention machinery and methods used at the time, and then provide tables. It appears that Mr. De Geest is responsible for the notation now in use. The OEIS also uses homeliness as the term for the number of numbers, including the prime itself, that have a certain prime as its home prime.

He died aged 74 on 28 March 2008 after a long battle with cancer.  Family  Fetterplace placed huge emphasis on family values and was father to 10 children and 26 grandchildren. He and his wife Barbara married in 1956, coming to Campbelltown in 1961 to open the Bus Stop Pharmacy in Queen Street. His children have gone on into the Civil Construction, industrial, veterinarian and educational work force, while many of his grandchildren such as Cameron and Evelyn Fetterplace are participating in important global community work such as Oxfam conferences and studying the importance of science and technology in the future.  Community work  Gordon was a strong supporter of rugby league and personally aided the development of the sport in the Campbelltown region, serving on the board of the Western Suburbs Leagues Club between 1994 and 1999. He was re- elected in 2002 and served a further five years in the capacity of director. Mr. Fetterplace was also the patron of the Campbelltown Show Society. Gordon became a well known personality in Campbelltown; volunteering his services in a variety of ways including to the local fire brigade and the Campbelltown Catholic Club. Mr. Fetterplace's community service also reached to St Gregory's Catholic College and charitable groups across the region. He retired from public life in 2007.  Political work  Fetterplace served on the Campbelltown City Council for 23 years, serving 7 terms as independent mayor of Campbelltown. On at least two occasions Gordon Fetterplace sought election to the Legislative Assembly, competing for the seat of Camden. Fetterplace led the move for more prestige housing in the area while also providing governmental support for community based initiatives. After suffering a heart attack in April 1992, he decided not to return and retired from the local government arena.  Recognition  In 1994 Gordon was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to local government and the community. In 2000 he was awarded the National Medal.

The memoir was written by Heda Margolius Kov√°ly and translated with Franci and Helen Epstein. It is now available in a Holmes & Meier, New York 1997 edition (), in a Plunkett Lake Press 2010 eBook edition and in a Granta, London 2012 edition (). Prague Farewell was the book title in the UK in previous editions. The memoir was originally written in Czech and published in Canada under the title Na vlastn√≠ k≈Ø≈æi by 68 Publishers, a well-known publishing house for Czech expatriates, in Toronto in 1973. An English translation appeared in the same year as the first part of the book The Victors and the Vanquished published by Horizon Press in New York. A British edition of the book excluded the second treatise and was published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson under the title I Do Not Want To Remember in 1973. The book is also available in Chinese (), Danish (), Dutch (), French (), German (), Romanian (), Spanish () and the original Czech editions (). Summary Heda Margolius Kov√°ly (1919-2010) was born in Prague. Of Jewish ancestry, she spent the years of the Second World War in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto and then in concentration camps Auschwitz and Gross Rosen sub-camps including Christianstad. After her camp was evacuated, she escaped from a death march and made her way back to Prague, where many of her friends refused to take her in due to the Nazis' harsh punishments for those sheltering camp escapees. Kov√°ly took part in the Prague uprising against the Nazis in May 1945. The only member of her family to survive the war was her husband, Rudolf Margolius. Kov√°ly's memoir describes in detail the continuing antisemitism that Jews returning from concentration camps faced. It also depicts the growing interest in communism among many Czechoslovaks, including her husband, who later became Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade. In January 1952 her husband was arrested and in November 1952, he was convicted in the Soviet-staged Sl√°nsk√Ω trial and executed on December 3, 1952. In the wake of her husband's trial, Kov√°ly became a social pariah, barely able to survive and stay out of imprisonment as few would hire her for work, as at that time unemployment was illegal under the Czechoslovak constitution. The book ends with the Warsaw Pact armies invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 as a response to the Prague Spring. After the invasion, Kov√°ly emigrated to the United States. Reception In his book Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts (2007), Clive James admired Kov√°ly's \\"psychological penetration and terse style\\" and stated: ‚ÄúGiven 30 seconds to recommend a single book that might start a serious student on the hard road to understanding the political tragedies of the 20th century, I would choose this one.\\" In their book Thinking the Twentieth Century: Intellectuals and Politics in the Twentieth Century (2012) Tony Judt and Timothy Snyder recommend Under a Cruel Star.Saul Austerlitz, The Boston Globe, February 12, 2012 Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Lewis said: \\"Once in a while we read a book that puts the urgencies of our time and ourselves in perspective, making us confront the darker realities of human nature.\\" San Francisco Chronicle-Examiner called Kov√°ly's memoir \\"a story of human spirit at its most indomitable ‚Ä¶ one of the outstanding autobiographies of the century.\\" Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω, a fellow Czech writer and expatriate, stated that the book was \\"written with the sophistication of a litterateur and the immediacy of a survivor.\\"  See also  * Cultural Amnesia (book) * Heda Margolius Kov√°ly * Ivan Margolius, Kov√°ly's son, who also wrote a memoir, Reflections of Prague: Journeys through the 20th century * Rudolf Margolius * Sl√°nsk√Ω trial  References  * Margolius Kov√°ly, Heda (1997): Prague Farewell, London: Indigo, (Kindle edition on Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk also available) * Margolius Kov√°ly, Heda (1997): Under A Cruel Star: A Life in Prague 1941-1968, New York: Holmes & Meier, (Kindle edition on Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk also available), in Czech: Na vlastn√≠ k≈Ø≈æi, Academia, Praha 2003 * Margolius Kov√°ly, Heda (2010): Under A Cruel Star: A Life in Prague 1941-1968, eBook * Margolius Kov√°ly, Heda (2012): Under A Cruel Star: A Life in Prague 1941-1968, London: Granta, * Margolius, Ivan (2006): Reflections of Prague: Journeys through the 20th Century, Wiley.

It has fat, grey leaves and large pink or white flowers. The natural habitat of the anemone vygie now lies beneath the urban sprawl of the city of Cape Town. Its last population in the wild was at Macassar on the Cape Flats but it was destroyed in 1992 to make way for housing. Consequently it is now extinct in the wild, although specimens have been preserved at botanical gardens such as Kirstenbosch. There is currently a project to reintroduce the plant to the grounds of a military base that is near to its original Macassar habitat.

Anti-apartheid activism  A lifelong activist, Russell, who died on 17 August 2014 after a long battle with cancer, was a friend of Steve Biko and many others fighting apartheid. His support assisted the Black Consciousness Movement in carrying out a number of projects, particularly those facilitated by the Black Community Programmes. Among Russell‚Äôs many acts of defiance was when on 8 August 1977 he laid down in front of trucks and bulldozers to protest against forced removals from Modderdam in the Western Cape, an area declared \\"whites only\\". He was forcibly dragged by police and arrested as an ‚Äúenemy of the state‚Äù. The apartheid regime served him with a five-year banning order in October 1977 restricting him to Cape Town. Defying these banning orders, and found in possession of a book ‚Äì Biko ‚Äì by Donald Woods, he was sentenced in 1980 to a one-year jail sentence. He denounced apartheid injustices and the arrests of anti-apartheid activists as vicious and pointed out that such kind of injustices filled people with ‚Äúrevulsion, bitterness and anger‚Äù. Later in life, Russell was a founding member of the Steve Biko Foundation‚Äôs Board of Trustees and served in this role from 1998 - 2009. In recognition of his contribution to the liberation struggle and ongoing pursuit of social justice, Russell was nominated for a national order by the Foundation, and subsequently conferred with the Order of Baobab in Silver by President Jacob Zuma. Russell contributed enormously to the South African liberation struggle and development at large. He will always be remembered for his role in fighting apartheid, and the memory of his contributions will continue to inspire coming generations Bishop Russell was an ardent advocate of human rights and his concern for the rights of women was an important aspect of his ministry.

While the term originally applied mainly to cottages, it may be loosely applied to any tied accommodation from a small flat to a large house. The concept is generally associated with agriculture, but may occur in a wide range of occupations. The concept has been in use at least since the 18th century. There has been considerable debate, particularly in the 20th century, over whether the system is \\"fair\\" to occupiers, and a number of laws have been enacted or amended to improve their security of tenure. The concept still exists, though in a substantially different form from the original idea. History Partly as a result of the Enclosure Acts of the 18th and 19th centuries, which denied hitherto free access by working-class people to common land, rural people became more dependent upon paid agricultural work. This was a key theme in Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Counterintuitively, the rise of tied accommodation made rural workers less secure. Tied accommodation became a common practice in 19th and 20th century rural England where the property owner, which might be an estate, a public or private institution or a farmer, could control who lived in the property. Rent was often minimal and considered part of the employee's remuneration or a \\"perk\\" of the job. Most large country estates had tied cottages for estate workers and parishes provided houses for incumbent clergy. Later the system extended to council workers, village police, services personnel and other occupations. The practice benefitted the property owner by providing accommodation to workers close to their place of work, but was open to abuse by using the threat of eviction to control workers' lives or even political affiliations. The benefit to tenants was a certain level of security in the knowledge that they had a place to live as long as they continued working. The advantage remained firmly in the hands of the employer for the best part of two centuries. 20th century Before World War I farm workers were seen by trades unions as effectively the property of the farmer, and tied cottages as a means for employers to hold down wages compared with other industries and to inhibit workers from joining unions. The issue was politicised as early as 1909. There was little change between the wars and in 1948 34% of farm workers were in tied accommodation. In 1976 this had risen to 53%. There followed a political struggle to end the system that was variously called servile, a system to maintain class power, or a relic of feudalism. A contribution to the decline of the tied cottage system was that fewer farm and estate workers were needed as a result of the rapid increase in mechanisation. In mid-century large numbers of tied houses such as those provided to village policemen or services personnel were sold off to reduce overheads, and council tenants (who may or may not have been council employees) under the \\"right to buy\\" movement were permitted to buy their rented properties at a discount. During a discussion on amendments to the Agriculture Bill in 1970, reference was made to the insecurity of tied tenants who, if they were no longer employed by the owner, could not expect to be automatically rehoused by the local council. The National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers had long campaigned for the abolition of the tied cottage system, supported by the TUC. In 1963 it had been stated that a Labour government \\"would ensure that no occupant of a tied cottage would be evicted before alternative accommodation had been provided\\" but the 1970 debate made it clear that this had not happened. However, members recognised that farming practices had changed and the tied accommodation system was not suitable, and legal protection was too weak, but that a six- month pre-eviction suspension period had helped to some extent. It was observed that it would be impossible to run a farm without tied cottages, one reason being that workers looking after stock would need to live very close by their work. In 1974 a Bill was presented to the House of Commons to abolish the system of tied cottages. The Bill was brought in by Bob Cryer MP in response to appeals from agricultural workers and other tenants of tied accommodation to \\"provide protection for tenants, yet preserve rights for farmers who can prove genuine need. It will ensure a cast-iron protection for those farm workers who have worked loyally in British agriculture so that they no longer need fear ill-health, injury or old age\\" and referred to the \\"evils of the tied cottage system\\". The Bill did not become law but prompted amendments to some existing laws in the ensuing years. Sixteen Agricultural Dwellings Housing Advisory Committees were set up in England under the Rent Agriculture Act 1976 to advise local councils on requests to rehouse former agricultural tenants when cottages were needed for employees. 21st century In 2001, following changes in the law in the 1970s and 1980s, protection of tenure was relatively secure for tied accommodation occupants; if they stopped working in the sector there was provision for the owner (in effect, landlord) to charge monthly rent at the market rate. With increasing numbers of people priced out of the housing market in the 21st century, the concept showed signs of being revived. The Agricultural Dwellings Housing Advisory Committees in England were closed in 2013. In a review of the modern state of tied accommodation, a Farmers Weekly columnist observed that, while it is complex and its appeal may have been undersold, in modern times it \\"generates more problems than it solves\\". With increasing legal and taxation implications, the issue of tied cottages was still an area of concern in 2014 in respect of farmers creating security of tenure and thus difficulty in evicting workers no longer employed by them. Agricultural tie Under planning regulations a property may be built on agricultural land for the purpose of housing agricultural workers. There are conditions attached which need to be fulfilled by any future purchaser of the property. The tie can be lifted if it can be established that there is no longer an agricultural need or that no one has worked in agriculture for 10 years, but breaches of conditions can attract fines. The advantage of an agricultural tie (to the purchaser) is that the property's value will be lower than the current market value.

Education and artistic influences Zebra, painted ca.1950, oil on board, 98x67cm Hedwig Frieda K√§the Marquardt was the daughter of Johann Friedrich Marquardt and Hedwig Franziska Marquardt. Her father was the village doctor in Biere, a village near Magdeburg, Germany. She initially trained as an art teacher in Kassel, but went on to study art at the Kunstgewerbeschule Magdeburg and then, under Professor Engels, at an academy in Munich in 1906‚Äì09. Very few of her pictures before the 1920s survive. The earliest show the influence of contemporary German landscape painters, particularly those of the Worpswede School, and, in her figurative painting, that of K√§the Kollwitz. By 1912 Marquardt was living in Berlin and studied for a time under Lovis Corinth. The art of the avant garde she saw here (in particular the work of artists such as Franz Marc, Wassily Kandinsky and Lyonel Feininger) allowed her to develop the artistic idiom that she followed, broadly speaking, for the rest of her life in her painting and graphic work. The figure of the horse, a symbol of energy and the free spirit, a recurrent image in her work, may derive from her country upbringing but also owes much to Marc. She exhibited in the Juryfreie Kunstschau (de) in Berlin in 1911 and 1913 and the Magdeburg Kunstschau of 1912. In 1914 she painted a large crucifixion for the village church at Biere.The painting no longer hangs in the church, but still survives, albeit in very poor condition. The painting is reproduced in Christel Marsh's memoir Ends and Beginnings (London: Tischler Press, 2004), p. 27. Ceramic work at Kieler Kunst-Keramik As for so many women artists, Marquardt found it hard to make a living from her art, particularly in the troubled period after the First World War. She turned to ceramics, leaving Berlin in 1921 and moving to Karlsruhe, where she worked at the Grossherzogliche Majolika Manufaktur as a ceramic painter, decorating the work of others, particularly the popular figurines of birds by Emil Pottner. In 1922 she met the sculptor and ceramic artist Augusta Kaiser, who called herself Gust Kaiser from 1922 onTheir lives together are documented in the collection of their letters to Lotte Boltze in Joachim and Angelika Konietzny, Hedwig Marquardt and Augusta Kaiser: Ein K√ºnstlerinnenpaar (Pansdorf, 2013) and see also the same authors' Augusta Kaiser ‚Äì die Gustl Kaiser der Kieler Kunst-Keramik ‚Äì und ihr Leben mit Hedwig Marquardt (Pansdorf, 2011) and who was also working at the time as a ceramics painter at the Karlsruhe factory. In 1924 she was invited by Philip Danner, who had himself left Karlsruhe factory to lead a new company producing ceramic art in Kiel, to join the Kieler Kunst-Keramik. Marquardt was only employed for a year at Kiel, but in this short time produced a significant body of original work that is well documented and regarded as very fine examples of ceramics produced at the height of the art deco period. However, her ceramic work owes as much to her background in expressionist painting as it does to the more purely decorative language of art deco.See B. Manitz and H.-G.. Andresen, Kieler Kunst-Keramik (Wachholtz Verlag, 2004); also Catherine Jones, Horses: History, Myth, Art (British Museum Press, 2006), which discusses the Marquardt vase in the museum‚Äôs collection. She was joined in this enterprise by her partner and artistic collaborator, the highly talented Augusta Kaiser (1895‚Äì1932).See Konietzny (2011) and Konietzny (2013), with illustrations of a number of works, also R. B.Parkinson, A Little Gay History: Desire and Diversity across the World (British Museum Press, 2013), pp. 96‚Äî7. Never a person who found personal relations easy, Marquardt fell out with her employers and, with Kaiser, left Kiel on 31 March 1925. The two tried for a time to survive as independent artists, producing small ceramics, embroidery and illustrative and commercial art, but in 1927 Marquardt accepted a teaching post at a school in Hanover, a position she held until her retirement in 1949. After the early death of Kaiser in 1932, Marquardt shared her life with the artist Charlotte (Lotte) Boltze (1881‚Äî1959), a close friend ever since they had studied together in Munich. Identifying and dating her work Apart from her ceramic work at Kiel, it is extremely difficult to date Marquardt's work. This is because her principal expressionist style remained remarkably consistent. Most of the work known to survive probably post-dates the Second World War. Whether more of her earlier work will be discovered remains to be seen. Her most typical work favours strong outlines and sweeping diagonals, often with stern, unsmiling faces.Die Stadt, coloured crayon on black paper, 35x23cm However, there are also gentler, more naturalistic depictions, particularly of trees, that look back to German Romanticism of the nineteenth century, also powerful woodcut-like pen and ink portraits that owe much to D√ºrer. She very rarely dated her work. On works where a date appears it is very likely that they have been subsequently added to make them appear earlier than they in truth are. Though some pictures are signed, many are not. There are paintings in oil, but most of her known surviving work is on paper, using a variety of media, often mixing coloured crayons with water colour. Reputation as a woman artist The paucity of German women artists from the earlier twentieth century who are today widely known is an indication of how difficult it was for women to succeed in a male-dominated art world. The few that did, for example Gabriele M√ºnter and Paula Modersohn-Becker, were often closely linked to successful male artists. Marquardt's need to turn to a teaching career to support herself, along with the repression of artistic freedom under the Third Reich, probably restricted her development as an artist. As a lesbian, she was also unable (and unwilling ‚Äì she had a low opinion of men in general, though she drew and painted men more often than women) to look for male support. However, the evidence of her work shows an artist of distinct character and originality. The best of her work stands up well when set beside that of the more illustrious exponents of German Expressionism.Konietzny (2013) contains an essay, with 8 illustrations, by Laurence Marsh, \\"The Art of Hedwig Marquardt: A Personal Reflection\\" (text in English and German). This publication coincided with an exhibition of the work of Marquardt and Kaiser at the Frauenmuseum Wiesbaden, November 2013 ‚Äì May 2014. Ceramic works by Marquardt and Kaiser form the major element of an exhibition of Kieler Kunst- Keramik at the Ost-Holstein Museum, Eutin, February‚ÄìApril 2015, catalogue by Joachim and Angelika Konietzny. Examples of Marquardt‚Äôs work are in the collections of the British Museum, London, and the Leicester City Gallery. The Stadtmuseum Kiel and the Keramik-Museum Berlin hold ceramic pieces. Her work appears on the art market in Germany, England and the United States.

Bonin 1988 page 153 Ferron was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2017. Life Ferron was born in Saint-Germain-de-Grantham, Quebec, as the tenth child of a large devoutly Catholic family which moved to Fall River, Massachusetts in 1906. It is said that she was six years old when she had her first vision of Jesus, as a child, carrying a cross. \\"He was looking at me with sadness in His eyes,\\" she once said.Souza, Kenneth A. \\"Seventy-five Years, Later Little Roses Devotees Still Pray For Sainthood Cause\\", The Anchor, Fall River Diocese, May 13, 2011 At the age of 13, Ferron was stricken with a mysterious paralysis and painful contraction of the muscles, forcing her to walk with crutches for several years until her twisted and clubbed feet confined her to a bed for the rest of her life. Because her muscles would sometimes painfully contract, making it very difficult to straighten once again, a flat board was placed on her narrow bed to which she was rigidly strapped. She also suffered an intestinal problem that made it difficult to digest solid food and contracted tetanus and pyorrhea. The family relocated to Woonsocket, Rhode Island in 1925, where, the following year, her stigmata first appeared. By Lent 1927 the wounds began to appear regularly every Friday. Ferron lived in constant pain until her death in 1936 at the age of 33. The number of mourners attending her funeral attest to her popularity in the Franco-American community.Kaell, Hillary. \\"‚ÄúMarie-Rose, Stigmatis√©e de Woonsocket‚Äù:The Construction of a Franco-American Saint Cult, 1930-1955\\", Historical Studies, Vol.73, The Canadian Catholic Historical Association, (2007) Her attempts at appearing to have stigmata (including a crown of thorns) were repeatedly photographed featuring what appears to be a stylized wire thorn pattern made from irritating the skin in the corresponding pattern.

It is an extremely notorious pest due to its severity and its widespread geographical distribution. Damage Description and ecology Eggs Synanthedon scitula eggs are a light chestnut brown color and are 0.4 to 0.6 millimeters across. They are marked with a hexagonal pattern of lines. The eggs are laid singly by the mother and take 8‚Äì9 days to hatch. Larvae Synanthedon scitula larvae are cream colored with a red head. They pass through six instars ranging in length from 1 millimeter to 15 millimeters or more at the last instar. Soon after hatching they burrow into the burrknot tissue or areas around bark scales. As the dogwood borer larvae feed red frass is pushed to the surface. It collects and is pushed to the surface and held together by silk. Larvae overwinter in their feeding tunnel, and resume eating whenever the temperature exceeds 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, or 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Pupae The larvae pupate in their feeding tunnel in a tough silken cocoon covered with bits of frass. The length of pupation varies from 8 to 20 days, depending on the temperature and other factors. Before its emergence, the pupa pushes out of its cocoon and emerges on the soft burrknot tissue. The amber-colored pupal case often remains on the burrknot after the adult emerges. Adults The average adult has a wing span of 18 to 22 millimeters. Both the fore and hind wings are mostly clear, and the thorax and the abdomen are navy blue or black with yellow markings. Female dogwood borer's 4th abdominal segment is entirely yellow, while the male's is black with a narrow yellow ring. In the Northeast, adult emergence begins in early June and continues into early September, peaking in mid July. The adult's emergence begins earlier further south. Control The most recommended method of control is to avoid the development of the burrknot. However, rootstocks without the tendency to make a burrknot have not yet been developed. Several types of fungi and parasitoids have been reported to attack the dogwood borer but have not been used yet effectively against the pest. Damage and diet The dogwood borer does damage to various trees and shrubs, including apple, bayberry, black cherry, blueberry, beech, birch, chestnut, dogwood, elm, hazel, hickory, mountain-ash, oak, pecan, pine and willow trees. There are three main feeding types that the dogwood borer has that results in various degrees of damage. *Type I - This is the most frequent feeding style. Feeding is confined to the burrknot. One or more larvae feed in tunnels below the root surface. At first, feeding is quite shallow, but subsequent feeding may extend as far as 3/4-inch toward the center of the trunk. This feeding type is the least harmful for the tree due to the confinement of the feeding. *Type II - This type of feeding usually happens because of heavy or repeated feeding of the burrknot. As the burrknot tissue is consumed, the larvae move outward to look for food and begin to feed on the cambium adjacent to the burrknot. This is more damaging than the first type. *Type III - This is the least frequent but most harmful of all the types of infestation. It usually occurs in the bark and in the main trunk of a tree. Feeding outside the burrknot is thought to be more harmful to the tree because healthy tissue is destroyed. These infestations have the potential to kill or girdle a tree but usually result in a slow decline and yield reduction for the tree.

Rawle's casting was announced in December 2010 and it was revealed that he would portray a serial killer. Rawle was approached by Hollyoaks and met with series producer, Paul Marquess, who explained the role of Silas and his storyline. Rawle found the storyline something which he would like to \\"have a crack at\\". The actor said that the role of Silas is \\"very interesting\\" for him as he had not played a murderer in his career before. He made his first on-screen appearance on 23 December 2010. Silas then made a surprise return on E4's first-look episode on 19 January 2016. He then made a guest appearance on E4's first-look episode on 5 February 2016. Silas left the show again on 18 May 2016. Silas was credited as \\"Mystery Man\\" in his first episode to keep his identity hidden. He is revealed to be Heidi Costello's (Kim Tiddy) father and the grandfather of Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), Seth Costello (Miles Higson) and Jason Costello (Victoria Atkin). Silas is a serial killer who is described as sinister, scary and complex. Marquess called him mild-mannered and likened him to a bogeyman. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy described Silas as a dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. Silas is \\"old-fashioned\\" and dislikes women with \\"loose morals\\"; believing his murders as a positive, cleansing service to society. Silas's storylines have mostly focused on his various murders. Silas murders India Longford (Beth Kingston) after using another identity on an internet dating website and arranging to meet her. Silas plans to murder India's sister Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove), but refrains. Silas targeting Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan).

On 18 May 2016, Silas murdered Lindsey himself after Mercedes informs him of Lindsey's adulterous past. Storylines Backstory Silas, born 17 March 1948, is the son of Nancy Blissett. Silas became a journalist and married a woman named Joan. They had two children, Heidi (Kim Tiddy) and Wendy. Silas told his family that Joan was murdered by an intruder she disturbed, and that he'd found her body, but it was later revealed that Silas had discovered that Joan was having an affair with her neighbour and Silas killed her, making it look as though she'd been killed by a burglar. Silas faked a heart attack after killing Joan, although it was later treated as a false alarm by the local hospital. 2010‚Äì2012 Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) joins an internet dating website, and starts corresponding with a man named Cameron. Texas' sister, India (Beth Kingston), makes contact with Cameron and they agree to meet. On her way to their arranged date, India meets Silas, who reveals that he is Cameron.

Silas meets Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) and prepares to strangle her to death, however he is interrupted by her boyfriend. Silas intends to strangle an intoxicated Texas to death, but refrains when she explains that she pressured India into internet dating. Silas is angry with Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) after hearing her give sexual health advice on the radio, and seeing her on the radio's webcam. Silas stops Lynsey from gaining a promotion by telling her place of work about the radio show. Silas attacks Lynsey but her screams alert her neighbours, causing him to flee. Lynsey realises that Silas was her attacker and confronts him on numerous occasions, but her allegation is ignored. Lynsey also accuses Silas of murdering India and his grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), begins to question Lynsey's allegations. Silas experiences a heart attack after Riley questions him. In hospital, Lynsey is assigned as Silas's nurse and withholds his treatment as she assumes he is feigning the attack. Silas later recovers. Silas sees Lynsey giving Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) weight loss drugs and secretly swaps them with his heart medication. Cheryl takes the medication more frequently to suppress her appetite. Whilst Cheryl is alone in her nightclub, she climbs upon the bar and becomes drowsy, causing her to fall. She is found unconscious by Lynsey and begins to recover in hospital. Lynsey is told by a doctor that tests showed a high amount of sedative in Cheryl's system. Silas makes Cheryl doubt Lynsey's state of mind when he tells her that he thinks Lynsey could be capable of swapping the drugs. Jenny (Daisy Turner) starts corresponding with a man named David Cox on a social networking website. Jenny meets David in the woods, where he is revealed to be Silas. They have a picnic and when Silas sees Jenny drugging his glass of wine, he secretly swaps them. Silas sees Jenny searching through his bag and threatens her, causing her to run away. She becomes drowsy and falls to the ground. Silas strangles Jenny to death and takes the ring from her finger, before burying her body in the woods.

Scanlan), sees Silas watching Lynsey and becomes suspicious of him. Brendan warns Silas to stay away from Lynsey. Silas plans to strangle Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) to death, but refrains after he learns that she has a daughter. Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) tells Silas that Brendan threatened to kill her. She annoys Silas by telling him she plans to use men for flings after being hurt by them. Silas brutally beats and strangles Rae to death and takes her necklace. He then frames Brendan for her murder. Lynsey arranges to meet a girl who has been sending Texas messages on an internet dating website, convinced that it is Silas. Lynsey confronts Silas in the woods and hits him over the head with a rock, leaving him unconscious. Lynsey returns to the woods with the police to find Silas gone. Silas is contacted by the police and tells them he is holidaying in France and denies any knowledge of the attack. Silas holds a heavily pregnant Mercedes captive in the basement of The Dog in the Pond after she confesses to having an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Mercedes' family assumes she has gone on holiday to Dubai. On Halloween, Silas tells Lynsey he is going to kill her, but she attacks him and escapes. Silas later sees a woman in the same Halloween costume as Lynsey and hits her over the head with a brick and strangles her to death. However, he realises that the woman is his daughter Heidi, leaving him devastated. Silas finds Lynsey and Riley searching through his belongings. Lynsey smashes an urn containing Joan's ashes. Amongst the ashes, Lynsey and Riley find jewellery belonging to the murder victims. Riley sees Mercedes' engagement ring, but Silas does not tell him where Mercedes is. Riley demands Silas admit to Jason and Seth that he murdered their mother and he is then arrested, however, he refuses to tell the police where Mercedes is. Silas tells Lynsey that she will have to play a game of chess in order to find Mercedes, but she refuses. Lynsey taunts Silas and he angrily tells her that Mercedes is in the gutter. Lynsey explains this to Riley, who finds Mercedes. Lynsey visits Silas one last time, telling him he no longer scares her. Silas is last seen in his jail cell, staring at a chess piece, accepting that he'll spend the rest of his life behind bars. Silas is not put on trial as he is moved to a mental institution when he is deemed insane. In July 2012, Lynsey is strangled by an unseen person in similar circumstances to Silas' victims. When Silas demands to see Texas in relation to possible information on Lynsey's murder, Texas visits him in the mental health institution where he is serving his sentences. Silas taunts Texas by explaining how he killed her sister India. He tells Texas that another young woman will die the following day. Texas visits him again a few days later, and tells Silas that she is no longer frightened of him. Silas warns her that another copycat killing will soon occur. He explains that to prevent this he will tell her the identity of the killer if she gives him India's ring. Texas agrees and he tells her that the killer is Will Savage (James Atherton). Texas snatches the ring back, angering Silas. When on a routine appointment at the hospital, Silas fakes a heart attack. He escapes and visits Lynsey's body in the mortuary. Silas sees an apparition of Lynsey who he compliments, telling her she played a good game. Lynsey taunts him saying his game is over as he did not get to what he most wanted as someone else killed her. Silas tells her his game is not over. Silas kidnaps Texas in her flat and leads Texas to believe he will kill her before telling her that he will bide his time and then kill her, this way she will be living in fear of him. Silas then boards a bus, full of young women who are going to a hen party. 2016 Silas returns to Hollyoaks in January 2016 as he visits Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison under the name Mr. E Mann (Mystery Man). It is revealed that Silas had been writing to Trevor as he heard about the Gloved Hand Killer who had murdered seven residents throughout 2015. As Silas asks Trevor disturbing questions, Trevor tells Silas to back off and never contact him again. Silas leaves but has a feeling that Trevor is innocent and is determined to find out who the real killer is. Silas returns to Hollyoaks again in February, this time for an appointment with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis), a nurse at Dee Valley Hospital. During the appointment, Silas tells Tegan he believes that the killer is one of the nurses or doctors who work at the hospital as medical equipment mysteriously disappeared during the time of the murders. Silas's interrogation about the murders makes Tegan uncomfortable and she leaves briefly, and once she returns Silas has already left. Silas visits Dee Valley Hospital again a few weeks later, this time imitating a human resources officer while visiting Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) in her office. After she confides in him about her feelings on her sister Kim Butterfield's (Daisy Wood-Davis) arrest for the murders, he leaves with the chilling parting words that he is a keen admirer of her good work and to keep it up, implying that he knows she is the real killer. In April 2016, Lindsey is finally exposed as the Gloved Hand Killer. When Lindsey tries to hide from the police, Silas contacts her and helps her escape. She recognises him from the hospital, and he reveals his true identity to her. Silas tells her that he wants to help her as he, \\"knew a Lynsey once before\\", and it is a beautiful name. He expresses a deep admiration for her work so far and offers her the chance to go into hiding with him as he feels that with the right tuition from him, the pair would make an unstoppable force. As Lindsey gives him a willing smile, the two serial killers drive off into the night. Lindsey later calls Silas in desperate need of his help after she attempts to convince Kim to steal her son, JJ from her ex-fianc√©, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Silas replies by saying that he knew she would return to him, and hangs up the phone with a sinister smile. Silas turns his attention to Kim, using a fake name \\"Edward\\" on social media, to lure her in. Believing that he has information on Lindsey's whereabouts, Kim inadvertently goes along with it. Silas tells her he is a retired policeman and uses her as a decoy so that the two killers can go ahead with their dastardly plans. Silas later meets Lindsey at a car park and tells her that he has Kim on side and that the plan is proceeding perfectly: that sooner or later, Lindsey will be reunited with her son and he will finally get another chance to claim the life of Mercedes. Kim meets Silas once again in the hospital while it is temporarily shut down. Silas and Lindsey put their plan into action and break into the Roscoe home but Mercedes is not there. Angered by this failure, Silas disowns Lindsey and tells her he will go after Mercedes alone. However, Lindsey's waters break and she goes into labour. Alarmed, Silas bundles her into the Roscoe garage, steals Joe's phone and abandons her. Later that day, Mercedes answers the door to find Silas. Meanwhile, Lindsey has managed to summon Kim for help and gives birth to a baby girl at the hospital with the reluctant help of Tegan and Celine McQueen (Sarah George). When Joe and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) arrive at the hospital to find Lindsey with the baby, they try to call the police, but Lindsey warns them not to as Mercedes is in danger. Silas plays a game of chess with Mercedes, while blaming her for Riley's death. Mercedes angrily demands where Silas was when Riley died and throws him into a rage when she reminds him of his part in Heidi's death. He tells her that she is to be his final victim and he will not be cheated this time as he was with Lynsey and Texas. Silas allows Mercedes to take JJ to bed, but she secretly hides a nail file in her pocket. When Silas guides her downstairs, Mercedes attempts to stab him with the nail file, but Silas easily deflects it. Lindsey then gives the order for Silas to kill Mercedes, which Mercedes criticises, as Silas is taking orders from a woman. Mercedes informs Silas of Lindsey's adulterous past who cheated on Joe with Freddie. When Silas sees a locket containing a picture of Mercedes' stillborn son, Gabriel, he criticises him and brands him as another one of her illegitimate children. Furious, Mercedes demands him to kill her so she can be with Gabriel and have the chance of being a mother to him. Silas is touched by this and noting that Mercedes has made significant effort to mend her ways over the years, he decides to spare her life. When Lindsey shows up at the Roscoe home, having managed to escape from the hospital with her baby, Silas feigns concern and asks to hold her baby. Silas then gives Mercedes the baby and asks her to ensure that the child grows up as pure and innocent as she is now. Silas then turns on Lindsey for cheating on the Roscoe brothers. Joe, Kim and Freddie arrive to find Lindsey's corpse on the couch. Silas is last seen looking on as a hysterical Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is led out of The Loft by Tegan and Celine. He then leaves the village, smirking. Casting and characterisation Jeff Rawle said that he accepted the role of Silas to highlight the dangers of online dating. In December 2010, it was announced that India Longford (Beth Kingston) would be murdered in a \\"dark\\" new storyline. It was announced that actor, Jeff Rawle, had been cast in the role of India's murderer. Rawle was best known as playing Amos Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. Rawle was approached by Hollyoaks and met with series producer, Paul Marquess, who explained the storyline. Rawle found the storyline interesting and something which he would like to \\"have a crack at\\". Rawle took on the role to highlight the dangers of online dating. Rawle said that the role is \\"very interesting\\" for him as he had not played a murderer in his career before. Rawle made his first appearance as Silas on 23 December 2010. Silas was credited as \\"Mystery Man\\" in his first episode to keep his identity hidden. He was revealed to be the father of Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). In 2011, Rawle revealed that he is delighted to be playing Silas, stating \\"It's the best role to have. Judy Garland once said, 'If you have to be in a soap, make sure you don't play the worst part'. She was talking about her own life being a soap, but she's right.\\" Rawle opined that the role of Silas is the \\"best part\\" and said that other cast members are jealous as they want to play a villain. Silas made his final appearance on 4 November 2011. Silas is described as \\"sinister\\" and \\"scary\\". Rawle said that Silas is \\"very interesting\\" and complex. Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, called him mild-mannered and likened him to a bogeyman. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy described Silas as a dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. Rawle explained that Silas is \\"old- fashioned\\" and dislikes women who have loose morals. Silas actually appeared to enjoy killing people and although he mockingly apologised to some of his victims, he clearly didn't mean those apologies. There are only two known murders that he actually felt regret for; murdering his own daughter and killing India but these instances have not stopped him from killing people. The official Hollyoaks website said of Silas: \\"Eep! Who knew that when Heidi‚Äôs cuddly dad Silas showed up in the village he would turn out to be the local serial killer with a penchant for strangulation?\\" They also call him a \\"killer grandad\\". Silas becomes more unstable and in October 2011, Rawle said \\"He's a psychopath and he has slightly lost the plot now. He's very dangerous. He thinks he hasn't got a lot of time left to live and feels he has nothing to lose.\\" Character development India Longford's murder In December 2010, it was announced that India Longford (Beth Kingston) would be murdered after an experiment with online dating goes \\"horribly wrong\\". Hollyoaks worked closely with the University of Central Lancashire's Cyberspace Research Unit on the storyline, in a bid to raise awareness of internet safety. Speaking on behalf of the Research Unit, Dr Jo Bryce commented: \\"If the storyline can remind one young person to protect themselves when engaging in online activity, then that can only be a positive thing. Too many youngsters think they are immune to online risks and this storyline is a reminder that you don't always know who you're talking to online.\\" Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, added: \\"This is a terrifying murder that highlights the dangers of meeting strangers online. The storyline, which launches at Christmas, will take us right through 2011 and audiences will be gripped to find out if the dangerous killer will strike again.\\" Marquess said he was surprised that the show had not done a big storyline about \\"stranger danger\\" on the internet before, branding it \\"absolutely key Hollyoaks territory\\". Hollyoaks writer, Steve Hughes, explained that the storyline was inspired by a real-life incident, where a friend had her identity stolen on social networking service Facebook. India's friends start a game to see who can get the most dates online. India is initially sceptical and writes up a rules list because she is aware of the dangers. But when Silas, calling himself Cameron, starts talking to India online she is intrigued. Silas then sends a photo of Cameron and India thinks he is gorgeous. Kingston stated that India is excited and agrees to meet him with her friends as chaperones. Cameron does not turn up to the meeting, but suggests they meet somewhere else. Kingston said that \\"[India] thinks, what the heck? So she goes off ... to a horrible end.\\" On her way to the meet Cameron, India is grabbed in a \\"dark and empty\\" alleyway and is murdered by Silas. In January 2011, India's sister, Texas (Bianca Hendrickse- Spendlove), ends up at Silas's mercy after taking drugs to help get through India's funeral. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained the situation to Inside Soap, saying \\"Texas has sex with Doug to get cocaine and a cocktail of tranquilisers. But she's in such a state that she misses the funeral.\\" Texas is a \\"complete wreck\\" and after she is thrown out of Chez Chez nightclub, Silas finds her and takes her to the woods. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that \\"It really looks like she's about to meet the same horrible fate as her sister\\". Silas eventually decides not to kill Texas. Commenting on Silas's decision, Hendrickse-Spendlove said \\"In her drugged-up state, Texas says it should have been her who died rather than sweet India. Silas feels a pang of guilt and tries to redeem himself by taking Texas to hospital.\\" The actress added that even though Silas has let her off this time, he could strike again. Jenny's murder It was reported that Silas sets newcomer Jenny (Daisy Turner) in his sights as his next victim in April 2011. Jenny is in desperate need of money and decides to use her skills as a con artist and starts talking to a \\"rich old man\\" online, wanting to arrange a meeting, drug him and steal his wallet and cards. Jenny has no idea that she is talking to Silas. Rawle called it a \\"tantalising game of cat and mouse\\". Jenny thinks Silas is a millionaire who she can get the better of, and Silas thinks she will be a \\"soft\\" target for him. Rawle explained that the Hollyoaks team are keen to keep educating viewers about \\"stranger danger\\" on the internet. He said \\"It's an ongoing message we're trying to put out that the internet can be a dangerous place. Silas could be grooming up to 200 girls, waiting for just one to let down their guard - and that's where Jenny comes in.\\" Jenny realises that Silas is not a \\"harmless pensioner\\" after she looks through his bag, which contains a rope, a knife and some gloves. Rawle opined that Jenny is a \\"very clever adversary\\" for Silas. Jenny is chased through the woods and realises that Silas has given her the drugged drink that was meant for him. Jenny starts to feel \\"woozy\\" and Rawle said that \\"there was no way that she could get away with drugging Silas\\". The actor added that Jenny would have to be \\"quite audacious\\" to outsmart someone who has been a killer for quite some time. Silas then murders Jenny. Jenny is revealed to be Rebecca Massey, the girlfriend of Doug Carter (PJ Brennan). Brennan hoped that Doug would be involved in Silas's downfall and said \\"I have my fingers crossed that Doug will be somehow involved, as I'd love him to be\\". Brennan also hoped that a \\"little bit of a Scooby Gang\\" would get together and solve the murders. Feud with Lynsey Nolan Silas sets his sights on Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) as his next potential victim. Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and Lee Hunter (Alex Carter) start their own radio show and recruit Lynsey to be their on-air agony aunt. Lynsey's advice to \\"sexually charged\\" young people does not go down well with Silas. Hassan said that Silas assumes the worst about Lynsey. Silas grows more furious when Lynsey dresses up in a sexy nurse's outfit for the radio's webcam. Lynsey is \\"horrified\\" as her flat becomes dark and Silas grabs her from behind. However, Silas is scared off as Lynsey's screams are heard by Silas's grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), who arrives to rescue her. Lynsey realises that it was Silas who attacked her and tells people, but they do not believe her. Discussing the plot, Bronagh Waugh (who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl Brady) explained that everyone thinks that Lynsey is crazy and making the allegation up. She said \\"Lynsey's really upset about it and asks Cheryl for some help. While she hates seeing her best friend in that kind of state, she thinks Lynsey's just being paranoid and Silas is a really upstanding member of society.\\" As no one accepts Lynsey's allegation, she wants to bring Silas down even more. Hassan stated that Lynsey is determined to find the evidence she needs to expose Silas. Riley realises that Lynsey is telling the truth and confronts Silas, who has a heart attack. Riley brings Silas into hospital, but Lynsey is not sure whether Silas is genuinely ill. Lynsey is assigned as his nurse and withholds his oxygen mask until he admits that he attacked her. Heidi walks in on Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and Lynsey calls for help. Norbury later told Digital Spy that he did not think Riley's suspicions of Silas would ever completely go and \\"everything that happened shook [Riley] up a bit\\".Karen Hassan plays Silas's nemesis, Lynsey Nolan In March 2011, Hassan revealed that Silas sees an opportunity to get even with Lynsey when he sees her handing over diet pills to Cheryl. Lynsey buys the pills for Cheryl off the internet, which Hassan told All About Soap is \\"completely innocent\\". Silas sees Lynsey giving the pills to Cheryl and sees an opportunity to get his own back. Hassan explained that Silas's \\"evil instincts kick in once again\\" and he swaps Cheryl's pills for his own medication. Cheryl takes the wrong pills and ends up collapsing. Lynsey and Cheryl's employee, Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), find Cheryl slumped unconscious. Hassan said that \\"It's a terrifying moment for Lynsey, who's overcome with guilt for putting her best friend in hospital\\". The doctors tell Lynsey that a high level of sedative has been found in Cheryl's blood, but Lynsey is completely flummoxed by how it could have got there. Hassan continued that it does not cross Lynsey's mind that Silas would want to hurt Cheryl, but opined that \\"the penny will eventually drop for her\\". The actress added that Silas is trying to \\"blacken\\" Lynsey's name. Discussing the storyline, Waugh later promised that there would be some \\"really good\\" stuff coming up. She told Inside Soap, \\"Silas will continue to run amok and that's going to build to a big crescendo. Lots of people in the village are involved with the storyline, so that's what we're working towards at the moment.\\" Lynsey gets back into Silas's \\"bad books\\" when he finds her looking at his hospital records. Silas then tries to scare Lynsey off with a menacing warning. In August 2011, Rawle confirmed that Silas would start terrorising Lynsey. Rawle explained that Silas is intent on discrediting Lynsey as she knows he is a killer. He said \\"[Silas's] job over the next few weeks, it's like a war of attrition - [He is] going to wear her down and send her mad.\\" Lynsey is determined to see Silas punished for his crimes as the investigation into India's murder gathers pace. Of this, Hassan told Inside Soap \\"When Silas realises that Lynsey is on his case again, he basically tells her to bring it on.\\" Silas \\"gets off\\" on the idea that Lynsey is trying to stop him from killing again and Hassan said \\"it makes the game a lot more interesting\\". Lynsey's suspicions are reconfirmed when she sees Silas among the press at a televised appeal about India's attacker. Lynsey frames Silas by planting India's necklace on him before ringing the police anonymously. Hassan said that Lynsey hopes Silas's \\"web of lies\\" will unravel. Lynsey's attempt to frame him backfires. Silas plots to discredit Lynsey by making it seem as if she is having a breakdown. Silas plans to send Lynsey mad so that no one will listen to her. Rawle said that Silas delights in the idea that Lynsey thinks she is good enough to play him. Silas puts a webcam in Lynsey's flat in order to watch her. He sneaks into the house and plays tricks on Lynsey by turning the gas on and writing a \\"sinister\\" message on her mirror with lipstick. Of this, Rawle explained: \\"Silas alters Lynsey's reality ‚Äì so when she insists that one thing is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute.\\" Silas sneaks into Lynsey's flat at night and moves her things around which Rawle said is \\"a subtle way of sending a person barmy\\". Lynsey's friends do not believe her accusations and question her state of mind, so she leaves the village. Lynsey's friend, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), sees Silas watching Lynsey as she is leaving and Hassan said that \\"[Brendan] starts to think there's something odd about him\\". In September 2011, Lynsey becomes intrigued when Texas tells her that she is receiving messages from a girl on the internet dating website that India used. Lynsey is convinced that Silas is posing as the girl and goes through Texas's phone to make contact with the girl. Lynsey arranges to meet with the girl and convinces journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) to come with her. However, Lynsey is left alone after Silas sends Nancy on a job at the last minute and the girl does not arrive. Lynsey arranges another meeting with the girl. Lynsey realises she is in the woods with Silas alone and Hassan said that Lynsey is \\"absolutely terrified\\". Rae Wilson's murder Alice Barlow plays Silas's third victim, Rae Wilson In August 2011, a video was leaked containing footage of Silas supposedly preparing to attack Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) at a night-time rave. This led viewers to believe that Theresa would become Silas's next victim. It was then revealed that Silas would feature in the fourth series of the Hollyoaks late-night spin-off, Hollyoaks Later. It was confirmed that Silas would line Theresa up as his next victim. Porter said it was \\"amazing\\" to be involved in the storyline. The storyline begins when Theresa's aunt, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane), inappropriately touches Silas and blames it on Theresa. This puts Theresa in danger as Silas targets girls who he is unhappy with because of their behaviour. Silas hates girls who are promiscuous and Porter opined that Theresa is \\"probably a prime suspect\\" as she enjoys receiving men's attention. Theresa signs up for an online dating website as she wants to find love. Theresa's love interest, Will Savage (James Atherton), learns of this and talks to Silas about it. Porter stated that Silas is being \\"clever\\" as he befriends Will while plotting against Theresa. Silas encourages Will to set up a fake profile on the website to check on Theresa. Will creates an online alter ego named Juan which Silas is involved with. Theresa makes contact with the profile online, not realising she is putting herself in danger. Porter said that it \\"scary and worrying\\" but would not confirm whether Silas kills Theresa. Hollyoaks series producer, Emma Smithwick, confirmed that the spin- off would feature the death of a regular character. When the episodes aired, Silas does not murder Theresa and in a dark storyline twist, Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) becomes his next victim. Viewers were not informed that Barlow was leaving the show and Rae's departure storyline was kept secret. Rae tells Silas that Brendan has threatened to kill her. She annoys Silas by telling him she plans to use men for flings after being hurt too many times. Silas realises he has an opportunity to frame Brendan. Silas brutally beats Rae and strangles her to death in an alleyway. In the months leading up to her exit, viewers began to speculate that Rae would become the Silas's next victim. Barlow had to attempt to discredit the rumours and denied speculation that she was leaving Hollyoaks. She did this because she wanted viewers to be \\"surprised and shocked\\" by her exit. Barlow said the fact that Rae's death aired in late night episodes of the serial made an opportunity to be creative with the content. There were \\"no limits\\" and they could \\"do whatever they wanted with it\\". The actress described Rae's death scene as \\"absolutely incredible\\" and said she loved working with Rawle. On-screen Silas plans to frame Brendan for Rae's murder and places her body in Brendan's car. Silas also plants the murder weapon in Brendan's bedroom. Brendan is arrested and charged for Rae's murder after evidence is found against him. Storyline climax In August 2011, Rawle revealed that Silas's storyline would soon come to a conclusion. He told This Morning \\"[...] We've been waiting a long time to see what's going to happen with Silas and over the next three months we've got some cracking storylines which end in an awful climax, which I can't say anything about.\\" The actor also opined that Silas's family would be \\"ripped asunder\\" after finding out that he is a killer. Marquess first mentioned the storyline's climax in January 2011. He told Digital Spy \\"I know what the ending of the serial killer story will be, when it is, and I know how brilliant it is. I'm hoping that story will have the audience jumping up and down and shouting at the telly, because it's got a really big 'look behind you' element to it.\\" Mercedes McQueen In May 2011, Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fianc√©, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), after he learns of her promiscuity. Silas attempts and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned. Metcalfe later hinted that Mercedes may have to watch her back in the future when it comes to Silas. She said \\"[Silas] is a tough cookie, isn't he? I think every girl in the village needs to watch their back where Silas is concerned...\\" In October 2011, it was reported that Silas would hold Mercedes captive in a vault. Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot \\"brilliant\\" and said it was \\"quite flattering\\" to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the \\"bare minimum\\" for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping her warm. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds \\"really dark\\" and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks are pushing the boundaries with it. Metcalfe revealed that \\"they are a little bit\\", saying \\"It's all shot in a very clever way, so it was fine when it came to compliance. But it was difficult and there was a lot of stuff that we had to be really careful about when we were filming it.\\" Metcalfe would not reveal whether Mercedes survives her encounter with Silas. Halloween In October 2011, Silas tells Lynsey that he is planning to murder again and that she has until midnight on Halloween to identify his next victim. He promises Lynsey that if she works out who his next victim is he will confess his crimes to the police, but if she fails another girl will die. Lynsey has to go along with Silas's mind game after everyone still refuses to believe her claims about him. Hassan explained that Silas does not care if he gets caught or perishes in the process. He reminds Lynsey of his plan by sending her clues and presents, such as a chess queen and a pumpkin containing the message \\"Tick tock, time is running out\\". Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas is doing. Silas picks out four potential victims: Lynsey, Texas, Theresa and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). He then marks each one of them with chess pieces which are planted in their homes or bags. Silas sends Lynsey a Catwoman outfit with an instruction to wear it at the fancy dress Halloween party at Chez Chez nightclub. Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas is planning and Brennan said he was \\"very, very happy\\" to be involved in the storyline again. Doug believes Lynsey, of which Hassan said \\"On one hand, she feels like she shouldn't be dragging [Doug] into this mess, but she knows that she needs someone on her side\\". The actress added that Lynsey cannot believe her luck as Doug show her kindness and friendship and she wonders why she did not confide in him months ago. Rawle revealed that nobody in the village is safe, saying \\"Theresa's already in his sights, Lynsey is a possible and so is Mercedes - he really doesn't like the McQueens!\\" He added that there are \\"lots of other women\\" whose morals Silas would find questionable. On-screen, Silas accidentally murders his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Silas reveals to Lynsey that she was his intended victim and vows to kill her. When Lynsey manages to escape from Silas, he follows her and confuses Heidi with Lynsey as they are wearing identical Catwoman costumes. Silas hits Heidi, who he mistakes for Lynsey, over the head with a brick, before strangling her to death. Silas is devastated when he realises that he has killed Heidi. The Daily Star had previously reported that Silas would kill Heidi, but this was not confirmed by Hollyoaks producers. Tiddy called the storyline \\"fantastic\\" and said the twist of Silas killing Heidi was \\"great\\". Tiddy opined that Heidi's death would affect Silas, saying \\"I think we'll see some remorse from him, as killing Heidi was a genuine mistake, and that's what is so great about the storyline. I hope we see some remorse!\\" Returns On 18 June 2012, Rawle was pictured on a night out with the cast, which started speculation that Silas would return. The following day a paparazzo travelled to the set of Hollyoaks where he managed to picture Rawle with reading scripts. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that the cast been celebrating Rawle's \\"shock comeback\\". It was later confirmed Rawle would return and a promotional video featuring his character was released. Rawle explained the reason for Silas's return to the serial saying that \\"there was still more to explore\\" and there were \\"unanswered questions\\" within the storyline. A week before Silas's return Lynsey was killed off in a whodunnit storyline with Silas becoming a suspect in the murder. It was later confirmed that initial scenes will feature Texas visiting Silas at the psychiatric hospital to try to find answers for Lynsey's murder after it is feared the case is related to Silas. Soon after it emerged Silas's later scenes will feature his escape from hospital. Rawle explained that Silas has accepted he is to be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a \\"nagging feeling\\" that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he could put it right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the \\"one that got away\\". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is \\"the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete\\". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to \\"play games\\". He is \\"delighted\\" to have an audience during the visits and begins to \\"make lots of threats\\". Rawle explained that Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is \\"symbolic\\" for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because \\"Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way\\". He said that Silas would \\"put quite a few people in the frame\\" for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is \\"manipulated\\" by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas \\"opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying\\". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is \\"never going to be safe again\\" regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but the door had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey. Reception For his portrayal of Silas, Rawle received a nomination in the \\"Villain of the Year\\" category at the 2011 British Soap Awards. In 2012 he received a British Soap Awards nomination in the category of \\"Best Villain\\". At the All About Soap Bubble Awards Silas won \\"Best Villain\\" and the scenes in which he murdered Heidi won the \\"Best Episode\\" award. Digital Spy readers voted the Silas storyline the \\"Best Soap Storyline\\" of 2011 in a poll run by the entertainment website. Kilkelly described India's murder episodes as \\"unmissable\\" and \\"two of the strongest episodes of the year\\". In a poll run by Digital Spy, Texas visiting Silas was voted the plot viewers were most looking forward to with 63.1% of the total votes. The following week readers voted Silas's escape as the storyline they were most looking forward to watching with 64.2% of the total vote. Norbury (Riley) opined that it was \\"unbelievable\\" to work with Rawle, saying \\"You can learn everything from Jeff - he's been there, done it and he knows everyone!\\" Kingston (who plays India) called Rawle \\"amazing\\" and said she was pleased upon learning that he would play Silas. Kilkelly of Digital Spy praised Rawle's performance, stating: \\"Jeff Rawle [...] does a fantastic job of portraying the dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. He should definitely be one to watch out for as he becomes a more permanent fixture in the village in the weeks ahead.\\" Rachel Shenton (who plays Mitzeee) described Rawle as \\"brilliant\\" and said the storyline is \\"really interesting\\". In September 2011, Porter (Theresa) praised Rawle, calling him a \\"brilliant actor\\". Barlow (Rae) said Rawle was \\"amazing\\" and a \\"dream come true\\" to work with. Hassan (Lynsey) praised Rawle, saying she really enjoyed working with him. She said \\"Jeff has the ability to turn any scene into a really great, gritty scene, so for me it's been like taking a masterclass, really.\\" See also * List of Hollyoaks characters (2010) * List of soap opera villains References External links * Character profile at the Official Hollyoaks website Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2010 Fictional serial killers Fictional kidnappers Fictional stalkers Male villains Fictional criminals on soap operas Fictional prisoners and detainees Male characters in television Fictional uxoricides ","title":"Silas Blissett"},{"id":"30033901","text":"NCX can refer to: * North Central Expressway, a section of the Central Expressway, Dallas * Sodium-calcium exchanger, a transport protein * ncx, the ISO 639-3 code for the Central Puebla Nahuatl dialect ","title":"NCX (disambiguation)"},{"id":"30033912","text":"La 1re, La 1√®re or La Premi√®re () may refer to: * La Premi√®re (Belgium), a Belgian French-language radio channel produced by RTBF * La Premi√®re Cha√Æne (Canada), Radio-Canada radio network (SRC Radio 1) * La Premi√®re (RTI), a terrestrial television channel in C√¥te d'Ivoire * La Premi√®re (France), a network of radio and television stations for the overseas departments and territories of France * La Premi√®re (Switzerland), a French-language radio network in Switzerland See also * Premiere (disambiguation), including \\"Premi√®re\\" * Premier (disambiguation), including \\"le Premier\\" (le 1er) masculine of \\"Premi√®re\\" * The First (disambiguation) * First (disambiguation) * Une (disambiguation), * Un (disambiguation), * 1 (disambiguation)       ","title":"La 1√®re"},{"id":"30033917","text":"I, Claudius is a six-part 2010 radio adaptation of Robert Graves' 1934 novel I, Claudius and its 1935 sequel Claudius the God.

It stands on Canberra Terrace near downtown Caloundra. The lighthouse was active from 1968 to 1992. It has a unique design resembling an airport control tower, the only surviving example of a lighthouse of this design in Australia. History Old Caloundra Light had stood on Canberra Terrace since its construction in 1896, marking the entrance to the North West Channel, a deep water channel into Moreton Bay and the Port of Brisbane. Changes in the shipping industry in the 1960s caused an increase in large container ships, which made the channel even more important. In May 1966 permission was granted for the construction of a modern structure comprising a combined lighthouse, signal station and radar station. The New Caloundra Light was erected in 1967, and was the second of a group of seven concrete towers erected between 1964 and 1979. By order of construction the lights were Cape Capricorn Light, New Caloundra Light, Point Danger Light, New Burnett Heads Light, Fitzroy Island Light, Point Cartwright Light and Archer Point Light. The light source was two stacks of sealed beam lamps, installed on a revolving table. It had red and green sectors. While the light itself was fully automatic, the station was manned due to the signal station. Four houses were constructed outside the station to accommodate the staff. The tower was constructed right next to the old lighthouse. By 1968 it became fully operational and the old lighthouse was deactivated. In 1970 the old lighthouse was relocated to avoid demolition. The lighthouse had a short lifespan as a coastal light. By 1978 the buildings in Caloundra had grown in height, obscuring it from some angles. In 1978 Point Cartwright Light was constructed, and the New Caloundra Light was downgraded to a harbour light.. states the downgrade was in 1974. The harbour light remained there until 1992,. states this as the date the signal station was demanned, and states the light was moved \\"In the late 1990s\\". when it was moved to Wickham Point, together with a radar/microwave link replacing the signal station, and the station was demanned. New Caloundra Light remained as backup, until it was finally shut off in 1997. The lighthouse's last display had a light characteristic of two white flashes every ten seconds (Fl.G(2).W. 10s). The light was a 1,000,000 cd, 200 Watt, sealed beam array fed from Mains electricity with a battery backup, visible for . It was displayed at a focal height of . Structure The lighthouse structure, totaling in height, is quite unique, resembling an airport control tower. It comprises a square tower carrying a semicircular D-shaped observation room, with the rounded side facing east, and a lantern room is mounted on the roof of the observation room. While a similar structure was constructed at Lytton Hill, in Lytton, Queensland, serving as an observation tower, it was demolished in the 1990s, leaving the New Caloundra Light as the only surviving example of this design. The tower base measures . The entrance is from the western side, and a spiral concrete staircase leads to the observation room. The stairs have a steel tubular handrail, and circle a service duct. One rectangular window is set in each of the four sides of the base, aligned with the staircase. Cantilevered reinforced concrete beams angle from the base to support the floor of the observation room. The observation room features windows on all sides. The eastern rounded side features a continuous band of windows, while the straight western side features four individual ones. The room includes an enclosed toilet in the northwest corner and central pillar with cavities linking to the roof level. A door in the southwest corner leads to a narrow balcony that wraps around the rounded part of the room. The balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebbledash on the exterior face. A steel ladder with safety grille on the northwest end leads to the flat roof. The roof is surrounded with a balustrade with fibre cement panels. The concrete constructed lantern room is located at the centre of the roof. It is a circular room with a flat concrete roof, wider at the roof than at the base. Trapezoidal steel frame window panes are set on the eastern side, the side facing the sea. The lantern can be accessed via a door on the southwest. A ladder on the northwest allows access to the roof of the lantern room, where radar and radio equipment is mounted. Another related structure is an orange brick generator shed just south of the lighthouse. It was built in 1967‚Äì1968 together with the lighthouse. Windows are set high on the wall, with a projecting brick window sill below. An overhanging concrete roof forms a narrow awning. Entrance to the structure is on the northern side. The inside is composed of two rooms, a larger generator room and a smaller room in the northwest with an internal door. Site operation and visiting The site of the lighthouse is accessible, but the tower is closed to the public. As of 2011, Friends of the Caloundra Lighthouses Inc are preparing for a license from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council to allow visitation to the 1968 Signal Station and Lighthouse. As of July 2012, the tower can be visited - contact The Friends of the Caloundra Lighthouses.

Having studied with Boucher and Le Moyne, he was one of the most appreciated painters of his time and enjoyed a huge success across Europe. His architectural drawings in the style of Piranesi contributed to his appointment in 1764 as Draftsman of the Chamber and the Cabinet of the King, charge for which he would produce many ephemeral architectures for parties and great royal funerals. He played a pivotal role in the transition between rococo and classical styles and was one of the essential contributors to the creation of aesthetics known as the Louis XVI style .  The first years (1718 - 1742)  Charles Michel-Ange Challe was born in Paris to a modest family from March 18, 1718. He first studied architecture with the Dominican friar Brother Andr√© before joining the workshop of Fran√ßois Lemoyne, then at the height of his glory. After the latter's suicide in 1731, he became a pupil of Fran√ßois Boucher, whose friend he became and whose technique would have a lasting influence on him. In 1738, he first runs for the Prix de Rome and came second. He will be a candidate again in 1740 and 1741, the year he receives the Grand Prize for his Tobit Healing. Among the members of the jury are Nicolas de Largilli√®re and Charles van Loo. His brother, Simon, won the second prize in sculpture the same year.  The Roman years (1742 - 1749)  He arrived in Rome on November 3, 1742, as a resident at the French Academy in Rome. Under the direction of Jean-Francois de Troy, he made copies of Raphael Stanze in the Vatican to send them to the Gobelins as cartons for tapestries. Challe copied in particular The Encounter between Leo I the Great and Attila. He took advantage of his stay to travel in Italy, from which he brought back a number of architectural drawings and landscapes. In Campania, he visits Herculaneum and ventured into the crater of Vesuvius, then active, which he will report in a scientific treatise. As part of the Academy of Rome, he also plays a leading role in the development of festive decorations, or farandoles, in the context of the carnival of 1748 and is brought to collaborate with the architects Louis-Joseph Le Lorrain, Ennemond- Alexandre Petitot and Charles-Louis Cl√©risseau who will reinforce his neoclassical way. The success of these initiatives will play a significant role in his appointment as head of Menus Plaisirs a few years later. He remains in Rome for seven years while the normal length of a stay was not supposed to exceed three years. But it is especially by his drawings of monuments in the style of Piranesi that this period will mark the work of Challe. The influence of the great draftsman on the Acad√©mie de France, near the studio where his works were engraved, is well known. Throughout his career, Challe will produce a large number of high quality drawings in the style of Piranesi and will work on the French translation of his theoretical works. He designs temples, triumphal arches, monumental sculptural groups, and bridges for which he uses a number of monumental motifs: columns, funerary urns, obelisks.  The Great Years (1749 - 1764)  Back in Paris in 1749, he enjoys a huge success and becomes one of the most prominent painters. In 1752, he is an accredited member of the Royal Academy of Painting and becomes a member two years later. In 1758, he is appointed professor of perspective to replace S√©bastien Leclerc. His reception piece at the Academy, The Union of Painting and Sculpture Arts by Drawing,At the Fontainebleau castle ornates the ceiling of the meeting room. A prolific painter, he produced many pieces, showing the influence of Fran√ßois Boucher and Nicolas de Troy (Les Charmes multipli√©s, The Crowned Shepard), which enjoyed considerable success in France but also in Prussia, in all German states, England and Russia. Many European courts invited him without success. The best of his works were engraved (Jupiter and Leda, engraved in 1761 by Jean-Baptiste Tillard). He exhibited at the Salon of 1753 and will continue to participate in the following years, alongside Jean Sim√©on Chardin, Etienne Jeaurat, Jean-Marc Nattier, Jean Restout, Louis Tocque, Louis-Michel and Charles van Loo. He displayed religious paintings (Saint Sebastien, Last Judgment, Ascension), history paintings (Lucretia and Brutus, Death of Cleopatra) and portraits (Mignot, sculptor of the king.) But his work for the Salon will earn him in 1763 violent criticism of Diderot after some praise on his Socrates on the Verge of Drinking Hemlock in 1761: > \\"It looks like being painted a hundred years ago; but it is much older for > the way than for the color. It looks like it's a copy after some ancient > bas-relief. There reigns a simplicity, a tranquility, especially in the main > figure, which is hardly of our time.\\" His Sleeping Venus is very much appreciated especially at the court: > \\"It is about this painting that Louis XV asked a lady of his court, famous > for her taste in the arts, what she thought of the Salon, she replied that > she remembered only the Venus from Challe.\\" In 1765, he presented a monumental painting: Hector Entering the Palace of P√¢ris which earned him unanimous negative reviews and dissuaded him from exhibiting the following years. Nevertheless, he continued to be very much in demand and became one of the most expensive painters of his time. He decorated many churches (Oratoire du Louvre, Convent of Feuillants, Saint-Hippolyte and Saint-Roch in Paris) and mansions (hotels of Palatine of Lithuania, of Soyecourt, of Malta, of Duke of Praslin, of Duke of Aiguillon.)  Draftsman of the King's Chamber and Cabinet (1764 - 1778)  After the death of the sculptor and ornamanist Ren√© Michel Slodz in 1764, he was appointed, by a royal decree of 23 February 1765, Draftsman of the Chamber and Cabinet of the King, a position he obtained thanks to the support of the Duke d'Aumont in competition with other brilliant candidates (de Wailly, Bocquet, G√©raud.) This charge is then important to the court: > \\"Machinist, composer of theater clothes and ballet costumes, organizer of > funerals, artificer, scenery painter, in a word, man of common taste and > easy elegance, such was the draftsman of the cabinet of His Majesty.\\" He will be particularly famous in the early years for the ephemeral architectures he creates for the great funerals at a time when the taste is in transition to neoclassicism \\"the greak way\\". Thus he conceives the monuments of the infant Philippe de Bourbon, Duke of Parma, of Louis-Ferdinand,, Dauphin of France, of Stanislas Leszczynski, King of Poland, of Elisabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain, of the Dauphine Maria Josepha of Saxony, of the Queen of France, of Charles-Emmanuel III of Savoy and finally of King Louis XV himself. The label of the moment wants indeed that great funeral > \\"Corroborate the elaboration of a rhetoric that attempts to compose a kind > of figurative eulogy that also obeys a precise geography\\" They constitute a graphic counterpart to the funeral oration. The king's draftsman also creates sets for other royal ceremonies: entrances, weddings, law courts, parties and entertainment. In 1770, he creates the ephemeral decoration of the marriage of the Dauphin, future Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette at Versailles and the Orangery with the assistance of Moreau the Younger who will succeed him: > \\"This palace of the Sun, raised at one end of the canal, whose waters > reflected torrents of light will remembered for a long time. These groves > and beds of fire, basins where the two elements seemed to be confused, the > variety of amusements and shows distributed throughout the park to share the > crowd.\\" He is the first to engrave his drawings, which allows us to rediscover today this less known part of French art of the seventeenth century, all the achievements of Menus Plaisirs having been dismantled after being used.  The last years  In November 1770, an aging Challe was named knight of the order of Saint Michel and ennobled. He is filled with honors and received at the Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts of Lyon. In 1762 he married Madeline-Sophie Nattier, the youngest daughter of Jean-Marc Nattier with whom he had no children. In the last years of his life, he worked on a project to expand the city of Marseille which was first approved by Turgot, Minister of the Navy, before being abandoned. His declining health did not allow him to participate actively in the decor of the coronation of Louis XVI in Reims in June 1775, which will be directed by his assistant Moreau le Jeune . He died on January 8, 1778 from a violent fever, at the age of 59 years. Beyond his painted and engraved work, he leaves many books, plays in verse, dramatic works, travel stories and translations of Piranesi, not to mention his scientific essay on Vesuvius but none has been published under his name and it is difficult to trace his aliases.

It is found from California north to British Columbia. Damage The wingspan is . Adults are on wing from May to early September. The larvae feed on various conifer species, including Douglas fir, pines and spruces. The larvae are dirty white, grayish or pink. They excavate a shallow cavity that penetrates the inner bark to the cambium surface of the wood. Pupation takes place in a dark brown pupa that is made in a silk-lined chamber within the pitch mass. Most individuals require two years to develop from egg to adult. The main effect of larval feeding is the production of large amounts of resin by the infected plants.

Dick, featured numerous fictional future technologies which have proven prescient based on developments around the world. Before the film's production began, director Steven Spielberg invited fifteen experts to think about technologies that would be developed by 2054, the setting of the film. Background TED conference, Minority Report's Science Advisor, John Underkoffler, demos a real life version of the \\"spatial operating environment\\" interface.alt=A man wearing a gray shirt, brow pants and black gloves stands in front of a screen, where scenes from Minority Report are being projected. After E.T., Spielberg started to consult experts and put more scientific research into his films. In 1999, he invited fifteen experts convened by the Global Business Network, its chairman Peter Schwartz, and its co-founder Stewart Brand to a hotel in Santa Monica, California for a three-day \\"think tank\\". He also invited journalist Joel Garreau to cover the event. He wanted to consult with the group to create a plausible \\"future reality\\" for the year 2054 as opposed to a more traditional \\"science fiction\\" setting. Dubbed the \\"think tank summit\\", the experts included architect Peter Calthorpe, Douglas Coupland, computer scientist Neil Gershenfeld, biomedical researcher Shaun Jones, computer scientist Jaron Lanier, and former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) architecture dean William J. Mitchell. Production Designer Alex McDowell kept what was nicknamed the \\"2054 bible\\", an 80-page guide created in preproduction which listed all the decided upon aspects of the future world: architectural, socio- economical, political, and technological. While the discussions did not change key elements in the film's action sequences, they were influential in the creation of some of the more utopian aspects of the film, though John Underkoffler, the science and technology advisor for the film, described it as \\"much grayer and more ambiguous\\" than what was envisioned in 1999. John Underkoffler, who designed most of Anderton's interface after Spielberg told him to make it like \\"conducting an orchestra,\\" said \\"it would be hard to identify anything [in the movie] that had no grounding in reality.\\" For example, Underkoffler conscientiously treated his cinematic representation of the gestural interface as an actual prototype, ‚ÄúWe worked so hard to make the gestural interface in the film real. I really did approach the project as if it were an R&D; thing.‚Äù McDowell teamed up with architect Greg Lynn to work on some of the technical aspects of the production design. McDowell said that \\"[a] lot of those things Alex cooked up for Minority Report, like the 3-D screens, have become real.\\" Product placement was used to depict the predicted lack of privacy and excessive publicity in a future society. The advertisements in Minority Report were handled by Jeff Boortz of Concrete Pictures, who said \\"the whole idea, from a script point of view, was that the advertisements would recognize you  not only recognize you, but recognize your state of mind. It's the kind of stuff that's going on now with digital set-top boxes and the Internet.\\" Nokia designed the phones used by the characters, and Lexus paid the producers $5 million for the rights to design the futuristic \\"Mag-Lev\\" cars. All told money raised through product placement accounted for $25 million of the film's $102 million production budget. Real world influence Spielberg described his ideas for the film's technology to Roger Ebert before the film's release: News sources have noted the future technologies depicted in the film were prescient. The Guardian published a piece titled \\"Why Minority Report was spot on\\" in June 2010, and the following month Fast Company examined seven crime fighting technologies in the film similar to ones then currently appearing. It summarized that \\"the police state imagined in the Tom Cruise flick feels a bit more real every day.\\" Other major media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal have published articles dedicated to this phenomenon, and National Public Radio (NPR) published an August 2010 podcast which analyzed the film's accuracy in predicting future technologies. Technologies realized Multi-touch interfaces Multi- touch interfaces, similar to Anderton's, have been put out by Microsoft (2007), Obscura Digital (2008), MIT (2009), Intel (2009), and Microsoft again, this time for their Xbox 360 (2010). A company representative, at the 2007 premiere of the then Microsoft Surface (later renamed to Microsoft PixelSense,) promised it \\"will feel like Minority Report,\\" and when Microsoft released the Kinect motion sensing camera add-on for their Xbox 360 gaming console in 2010, the Kinect's technology allowed several programmers, including students at MIT, to create Minority Report inspired user interfaces. Retina scanners Retina scanners, a form of biometrics, already existed by the time the film appeared in theaters, but media outlets have described the new advanced systems such as those by a Manhattan company named Global Rainmakers Incorporated (GRI) (2010), as similar to the movie's. GRI disputed the notion that its technology could be the threat to privacy it is in the film. \\"Minority Report is one possible outcome,\\" a corporate official told Fast Company. \\"I don't think that's our company's aim, but I think what we're going to see is an environment well beyond what you see in that movieminus the precogs, of course.\\" The company is installing hundreds of the scanners in Bank of America locations in Charlotte, North Carolina, and has a contract to install them on several United States Air Force bases. It still can't work as fast as it is in the movie, but with the progress of computer technology, it is predictable to reach that level before 2054. Technologies in development Companies like Hewlett-Packard (HP) have announced they were motivated to do research by the film, in HP's case to develop cloud computing. Autonomous cars In the film, Anderton uses vehicles which can be both driven manually and autonomously; in one scene the police remotely override the vehicle in order to bring him into custody. Spielberg commissioned Lexus to design a car specifically for Minority Report, resulting in the Lexus 2054, a fuel-cell powered autonomous vehicle which is seen being built in an automated factory in the film. Autonomous, or self-driving cars have been in development since 1984. As Artificial Intelligence and ground-sensing technologies like LIDAR began to improve in the 2000s, major automotive manufacturers such as Ford, Nissan and General Motors began developing self- driving prototypes. Google began developing a self-driving vehicle prototype, named Waymo in 2009 while Tesla Motors rolled out the autopilot feature on their Model S vehicle in 2015. In 2011, the State of Nevada became the first jurisdiction in the world to formally legalise autonomous vehicles on public roads. Countries such as the United Kingdom (2013) France (2014), Switzerland (2015) and Singapore (2016) passed laws which allowed the testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, with a view to further changes in legislation as the technologies improves. Insect robots Insect robots similar to the film's spider robots are being developed by the United States Military. These insects will be capable of reconnaissance missions in dangerous areas not fit for soldiers, such as \\"occupied houses\\". They serve the same purpose in the film. According to the developer, BAE Systems, the \\"goal is to develop technologies that will give our soldiers another set of eyes and ears for use in urban environments and complex terrain; places where they cannot go or where it would be too dangerous.\\" Gesture recognition Multiple gesture recognition technologies currently in existence or under development have been compared to the one in the film. Personalized advertising Most of the advertising to consumers in Minority Report occurs when they are out of their homes. The advertisements interact in various ways; an Aquafina splashes water on its customers, Guinness recommends its products to the downtrodden to recover from \\"a hard day at work\\", a cereal box from which Anderton eats has a video advertisement, and when Anderton is fleeing the PreCrime force, an American Express advertisement observes, \\"It looks like you need an escape, and Blue can take you there,\\" and a Lexus ad says, \\"A road diverges in the desert. Lexus. The road you're on, John Anderton, is the one less traveled.\\" The advertisements in Minority Report were handled by Jeff Boortz of Concrete Pictures, who said \\"the whole idea, from a script point of view, was that the advertisements would recognize you‚Äînot only recognize you, but recognize your state of mind. It's the kind of stuff that's going on now with digital set-top boxes and the Internet.\\" Although the advertising- oriented website ClickZ called the film's interactive advertisements \\"a bit farfetched\\" in 2002, billboards capable of facial recognition are being developed by the Japanese company NEC. These billboards will theoretically be able to recognize passers-by via facial recognition, call them by name, and deliver customer specific advertisements. Thus far, the billboards can recognize age and gender and deliver demographically appropriate advertisements, but cannot discern individuals. According to The Daily Telegraph, the billboards will \\"behave like those in...Minority Report,\\" uniquely identifying and communicating to those in their vicinities. IBM is developing similar billboards, with plans to deliver customized advertisements to individuals who carry identity tags. Like NEC, the company feels they will not be obtrusive as their billboards will only advertise products in which a customer is interested.

These campervans can be privately owned or company owned. Campervan hire is popular in the UK, especially for music festivals and there are several companies in the market. More recently, campervan rentals have become more popular in the U.S. Campervan hire is a category of vacation rental. Notable features Campervan hire agencies differ from motorhome hire agencies by stocking campervans instead of motorhomes. The differences between the two vehicle types is clear but the terminology has become cloudy over the years. Some agencies may use the terms \\"motorhome\\" and \\"campervan\\" interchangeably which may have led to consumer confusion. Campervan hire vehicles are generally smaller than their motorhome counterparts. The height, length and width of the vehicle will be smaller and the maximum mass will also be less. As a result, campervans will be easier to drive with some being almost like driving cars (especially campervans that are based on the Ford Transit or VW T series) and suitable for most driving licences. Contrastingly, motorhomes will offer more space and facilities. Insurance with campervan management companies is often cheaper and this results in an overall lower total hire cost. International market Campervan management companies are spread across the globe in response to the boom in the hire market. Campervan rental has become very popular in New Zealand, with many considering self- drive holidays to be one of the best way to the landscape on rural roads which are traffic-free compared to those found in other countries. In the UK, campervan management companies cater to festival goers by offering a solution to the traditional rain and mud-soaked tent environment.

Jones was born in July 1641 at Llwyn Ririd, near Montgomery, Powys. He was the son of Richard Jones, by Sarah, daughter of John Pyttes of Marrington. He was educated at Westminster School, whence he was elected in 1661 to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1664, and M.A. in 1668, and was made fellow of his college in 1667. Going to Ireland as domestic chaplain to the Duke of Ormonde, the lord-lieutenant, he was appointed master of Kilkenny College, where Jonathan Swift was his pupil. In May 1677 he was collated to a prebend in the church of Ossory, and was promoted to the deanery of Lismore in November 1678. Early in 1683 he was raised to the bishopric of Cloyne, but during Tyrconnel's administration, in James II's reign, hastily returned to England (1688). In November 1692 he was translated to St. Asaph as successor to Bishop William Lloyd.Le Neve, Fasti, ed. Hardy, i. 77 Jones's episcopate was distinguished by corruption, negligence, and oppression, and contrasts ill with the good administration of his predecessor. An address, signed by thirty-eight of the principal beneficed clergymen, was sent to Archbishop Tenison in March 1697, and in the following July the primate appointed the Bishops of Lichfield and Bangor and Dr. Oxenden, dean of arches, commissioners to receive the presentments of the clergy against Jones on 20 July 1698. The archbishop summoned Jones to answer the charges, but Jones's firm adherence to the court party led to delays in bringing him to trial,Burnet, History of his own Time, iv. 407, 450 and the formal hearing before the archbishop did not commence until 5 June 1700. Jones signed a written confession of his guilt in promoting to a canonry a notorious person \\"accused of crimes and excesses\\", in permitting laymen to act as curates, and in entering into simoniacal contracts for the disposal of preferments. The archbishop, in June 1701, pronounced sentence that the bishop be suspended for six months and thenceforth until he gave satisfaction. The deprivation was continued till 5 May 1702. He died on 10 May 1703 at his house in College Court, Westminster, and was buried at the parish church of St. Margaret's, without inscription or monument. He married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Kennedy, Baronet, of Wicklow, by whom he had six children. Jones published a few forms of prayer from the church catechism in Welsh (London, 1695), which was mentioned in his defence at the trial; and issued, probably after his restoration, visitation articles for the diocese, printed in London in 1702. Matthew Jones (1654‚Äì1717), prebendary of Donoughmore, was a younger brother of the bishop. He accompanied his brother to Ireland, and became vicar-choral of Lismore Cathedral in 1681, precentor of Cloyne Cathedral November 1683, and prebendary of Donoughmore in 1687. He died on 7 December 1717.

It has evolved into the \\"largest academic medical library in the world\\". Early history In 1875, the Society for Medical Observation, the Society for Medical Improvement, the Treadwell Library at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Public Library all had volumes of information that needed to be more accessible to physicians. This was the second attempt to create a medical library in the city; the first attempt was in 1805. This second library was incorporated with the first \\"as an independent institution under the control of the profession as a whole\\". James Read Chadwick, a gynecologist, collected books, pamphlets, and medical periodicals and make this material accessible to the practicing physician. It later became the later the Boston Medical Library (BML). Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Parkman Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard, served as the BML's first president and writer Librarian. The Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine In 1960, the BML and the Harvard Medical Library combined their collections. It was housed in a new building named for Lever Brothers executive Francis A. Countway, whose sister, after his death, gave $3.5 million of his fortune toward the library. Current developments In 1999, the Rare Books and Special Collections Department of the Countway Library assumed custodial responsibility for the Warren Anatomical Museum. Among its holdings is the skull of Phineas Gage, whose life after a traumatic brain injury contributed significantly to medical science. The department was renamed the Center for the History of Medicine in 2004. It hosts rotating exhibits about the history of medicine from the library collections. The displays are located in the lobby area and are open to the public. , however, exhibits are closed while the Library undergoes a renovation; the building is slated to reopen in 2021. According to the History of Medicine Division of the National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine, The Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine is the \\"largest academic medical library in the world, and its collections, which have been formed over nearly two centuries, sometimes through the medical holdings of other libraries, include rare and historical materials that can be numbered among the largest in the world.\\" The New England Journal of Medicine noted that The Francis A.

Early years Gillen was born in 1867 in Pittsburgh. His birth name was Samuel Gilleland. He adopted the name Gillen when he began his baseball career. Professional baseball career Gillen began playing professional baseball in 1890 with Erie in the New York-Pennsylvania League. From 1891 to 1893, he continued to play in the minor leagues, for teams in Davenport, Iowa, Elmira, New York, Macon, Georgia, and Quincy, Illinois. In 1893, he compiled a .343 batting average in 321 at bats for Macon. His strong performance in Macon drew the attention of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He made his major league debut in August 1893, appearing in three games with the Pirates. He had no hits in six at bats. Gillen returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Wilkes-Barre Coal Barons in 1894 and the Detroit Tigers in 1895 and 1896. He had some of his best seasons at Detroit. He had a career-high .344 batting average in 471 at bats for Detroit during the 1895 season. After a strong showing in Detroit, Gillen was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies for the 1897 season. As the close of spring training in 1897, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: \\"Gillen has demonstrated in many hard and trying plays that he is a natural infielder  an artist of the first water. He covers his ground, walks and throws almost precisely similar to Tommy Corcoran. He shows greater speed in handling hard grounders each game and his throwing improves as well.\\" He appeared in 75 games for the 1897 Phillies, 69 of those games as the team's shortstop. He compiled a .259 batting average but also drew 35 bases on balls to boost his on-base percentage to .353. In July 1897, Gillen was traded by the Phillies to the St. Paul Saints in exchange for Frank Shugart. He played for St. Paul in the last part of the 1897 season and throughout the 1898 season. Prior to the 1899 season, Gillen was traded by St. Paul to the Columbus Buckeyes with George Cross for Dan Lally. He played for Columbus for part of the 1899 season before being released. He signed in July 1899 with the Fort Wayne Indians. The Indianapolis News announced his arrival: \\"Sammy Gillen once touted as the fastest infielder in the Western league, and always, in the old days, a consistent hitter, has gone down the line until he has finally landed in Fort Wayne.\\" Gillen concluded his professional baseball career at the end of the 1899 season. Over the 10-year course of his career, Gillen appeared in at least 755 professional baseball games and totaled at least 513 runs scored, 795 hits, 202 extra base hits, and 105 stolen bases. Later years In May 1905, Gillen died suddenly from pneumonia at his parents' home in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. He was 37 years old.

He joined the anthropology faculty at the University of Arizona in 1946 and retired from teaching in 1976. Spicer contributed to all four fields of anthropology through his study of the American Indians, the Southwest, and the clash of cultures defined in his award-winning book, Cycles of Conquest. Spicer combined the elements of historical, structural, and functional analysis to address the question of socio-cultural change. He was a teacher, researcher, editor, and practitioner, who applied his perspective to address the issues confronting the people he worked with.  Early life: growing up and education (1906‚Äì1924)  Edward Holland Spicer was born on November 25, 1906 in Cheltenham, PA, the youngest of three children born to Robert Barclay Spicer and Margaret Jones Spicer. The Spicers' first son died several years before their second son, William, known as Bill, was born. Edward, known as Ned, was born several years later. In 1908, Robert, who was a Quaker, moved his family to Arden, Delaware where he took a job as editor of the Quaker journal, The Friends Intelligencia. Arden was founded in 1900 by a Quaker group as a single tax community based on the principle of Henry George; there, Ned and Bill were exposed to the liberal economic and political ideas of the community. They participated in the local Shakespearean Theater every summer. Arden provided a pleasant rural setting in which the boys absorbed the intellectual atmosphere of the town. Robert was fired from his editor's post because of his extreme liberal views. As a result, he turned to truck farming which introduced Bill and Ned to farming life. They helped with the daily raking and hoeing of the plants and vegetables. They tended to the animals of the farm, including goats and rabbits, and helped the household out by hauling firewood for the house and water from the town pump. In keeping with the local practice, Margaret homeschooled the boys. The mothers in the community took in their neighbors' children for schooling in their homes for a month at a time, each month switching off with another mother. During this period, he learned to read and developed a lifelong love for books and writing. From his father, Ned learned about philology. By the time he was 12, he was copying words and texts of the Algonquin (Delaware) language. Ned displayed interest and curiosity in nature and the environment in and around Arden. He spent time learning and memorizing the scientific names of local plants and animals. Ned was homeschooled until he was 13. Ned began his formal education when he was 13 years old. His parents enrolled Ned in the Friends School in nearby Wilmington. Ned commuted from home to the school by train daily for the next 3 years. His formal education continued in 1922 when his father moved the family to Louisville, Kentucky after Robert took a job with the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis. Ned was enrolled at the Louisville Male High School. While in Louisville, Ned developed an interest in sailing. He built a canoe and outfitted it with a sail, which he sailed and cruised in around the Ohio River. In February 1924, Ned graduated, left home, and enrolled in the Commonwealth College in New Llano, Louisiana. Commonwealth College was an experimental institution that featured classical and experiential training.  Wandering: A period of exploration (1924‚Äì1932)  After 2 months, Ned and his friend Vic dropped out and went to New Orleans to find work as seamen. Vic found a job on a merchant ship and left Ned on his own until he found a job as a \\"cook's helper\\" on the Aquarius, a merchant ship sailing to Germany. Ned's first international travel brought him to post-war Germany where he visited Bremerhaven, Stettin and Hamburg(Officer 1990:327) where he witnessed a different world. Upon returning to Louisville he found his father Robert dying of cancer. Following his father's death, he and his mother returned to Wilmington where they found employment at the Greenwood Bookstore. Louisville had been a mixed period in Ned's life: while he enjoyed his experiences on the river and building of the boat,(Officer 1995: 327) it was also a period of mixed emotions, introspection and self-doubt common to teenage boys.(RS: 1990:5‚Äì6) Ned turned 18 in November and continued to work at the bookstore until he found himself drawn back to the sea. In early 1925, Ned returned to the sea, first as a crewman on the banana boat, Metapan, that left New Orleans for Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. According to his wife, Rosamond, that experience ended Ned's interest in eating bananas.(RS 1988: xxiv) Upon return he signed on to the ore ship, John C. Coolidge, on the Great Lakes.(RS 1990: 8 ) A seaman's strike later that year ended Ned's career as a seaman. In the fall of 1925, Ned enrolled at the University of Delaware and planned to major in Chemistry. He had enjoyed the chemistry classes in Louisville and thought of a career as a chemist with Dupont, there in Wilmington. He changed majors to literature and drama, which Ned's mother had encouraged her son to explore after he found the chemistry being taught at the university was not what he expected.(Officer 1995: ) During his time at the university, Ned joined the Footlight Club and acted in several plays. He joined the compulsory ROTC program, despite his Quaker upbringing, and rose to the rank of cadet Captain. He also studied German during his two years there.(RS 1990: 8) While at the University of Delaware, he wrote a paper entitled \\"Is there Race Superiority?\\" that awakened an interest in the social sciences.(RS 1990:8) One of the courses he took was in economics.(Officer 1995:327) As a child, Ned and his brother, Bill, were raised in a socialist environment.(RS 1990: 4‚Äì5) He would later remark, \\"In my youth I had been strongly influenced ‚Ä¶ by Scott Netting, the radical economists at the Wharton School ‚Ä¶ who was a friend of my father.\\".(Officer 1990:33) During his sophomore year he heard about a new program at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, a Quaker institution. As part of the new program undergraduates were allowed to take graduate level courses before they had received their bachelor's degree.(Officer 1995:327) In the fall of 1927, Ned transferred to Johns Hopkins and switched to a social science major. While in Baltimore, he lived with two maiden aunts, sisters to his father.(RS 1990: 8) He chose to take some of his social science courses at the graduate level. He found the liberal environment at Johns Hopkins welcoming and helped found a student club, The Young Radicals, where he served as president of the club that brought together students who had socialist leanings. He contributed the paper, \\"Theory of Hours and Production\\" to a graduate level seminar based on his experience during the seamen's strike. At this time was also a period of introspection where he questioned his choices and goals, often expressing himself through poetry.(RS 1990:9) In his second year at Johns Hopkins, he became disinterested in political economics.(RS 1990:9) Despite a full scholarship, Ned dropped out of college in 1928 without completing his degree. Shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, spending most of the year at the Maryland State Sanatorium. While in the sanatorium, he worked in the hospital laboratory doing sputum analysis for all the patients of the sanatorium. He developed an interest in astronomy and spent nights in August and November charting meteor showers and sending his observations to the National Observatory in Washington, DC.(RS 1990:9) Years later he would have an asteroid (\\"2065 Spicer\\") named after him for his help in 1955 negotiations between the Tohono O'odham Nation and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in acquiring land for the Kitt Peak National Observatory on the reservation.(Officer 1990:340) Ned left the hospital in 1928 and questioned what to do next. Opening a map of the US and closing his eyes, Ned stuck his finger on the map, where it landed on Arizona.(R. Spicer 1990: 10) With help from his mother, he bought a bus ticket to Phoenix, where he found a number of jobs to support himself and a place to stay. Ned obtained a position with the Arizona Agricultural Inspection Service serving as an inspector in Yuma and in Salome, Arizona. Despite a diagnosis of \\"smallpox\\" which might have been \\"valley fever,\\" he was able to continue his job, though he was quarantined at the Yuma Pest House. Meanwhile, he had decided to complete his BA in economics and saved money to go the University of Arizona. During the Great Depression the bank where he had placed his savings failed, and the job would be a lifesaver despite the crash postponing his plans for a year. By the end of 1930, he had saved up enough to enroll at the University of Arizona.  Studying: University training (1931‚Äì1946)  In the fall of 1931, he enrolled at the University of Arizona and moved to Tucson. He learned that in order to complete his major in economics, only one advanced course in economic theory was needed. He completed his undergraduate course requirements and earned his BA degree with a major in Economics and Senior Honors.(Officer 1995: 329) While completing his BA course work, he enrolled in a course on southwestern Indians with Clara Lee Frapps (n√©e Tanner). Dr. Dean Byron Cummings headed the Department of Archaeology at the University at the time and invited Ned to go with him on explorations for sites on weekends. These trips reinforced Ned's interest and skills in archaeology. He collected pot shards on these trips and brought them home to be sorted, cataloged, and analyzed, skills that would lay the foundation for his Masters degree.(R. Spicer 1990:11) In the summer of 1932, Ned worked on the King's Ruin site and wrote his MA thesis on King's Ruin, analyzing the pottery specimens from the site. He found that the \\"black on gray\\" motif was similar to other material found in the Upper Verde Valley. However, there was enough difference to identify them as a sub-class that he named Prescott black on gray. Ned worked on the Apache Reservation at the Kinishba site later that year.(R. Spicer 1990:11) During the 1932‚Äì33 school year, an opportunity developed to excavate at the Tuzigoot ruins. The Great Depression caused many miners to be let go by the United Verde Copper Company, a major employer in Yavapai County. To offset the resulting unemployment, Grace Sparkes, Chamber of Commerce secretary, envisioned excavation of ruins at Tuzigoot in Clarkdale, near Prescott, AZ.(R. Spicer 1990: 11) Ned and Louis R. Caywood were hired for under the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (CWA), later known as the WPA. They organized the project with Ned as the dig's supervisor and Louis in charge of the lab. Ned's mother came out to help with the kitchen and housekeeping. Harry Getty later joined to help supervise the project. The project and partial reconstruction of the site was completed in 10 months, paving the way for the Tuzigoot National Monument.(R. Spicer 1990:11) When the Tuzigoot excavation was finished, Ned began working at the Museum of Northern Arizona. He collaborated with Drs. Harold S. Colton and Lyndon Lane Hargrave analyzing artifacts from Pueblo I pithouses in the San Francisco Mountains. In May 1933, Ned gave his first formal report on the pottery of the site at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Las Cruces, New Mexico (Watson Smith 1983: 76). At the time, Ned was deeply interested in an archaeological career, but not a Ph.D. In the 1932-33 school year, Ned took courses that were taught by John Provinse, who joined the faculty at the University of Arizona to begin his first teaching job. Among the courses were \\"History of Anthropology\\" and \\"Primitive Society\\" .(ASM Spicer Archive Box 1) Ned observed that \\"in the classroom [Provinse] radiated a deep conviction that the social sciences ought to be used practically, and at the same time, fostered skepticism and caution about facile claims for them.\\" (Edward H. Spicer 1966: 991) Provinse encouraged him to pursue a PhD, with Ned later writing \\"John Provinse ‚Ä¶ urged me to go to the University of Chicago. In an exploratory mood, I went and met [Alfred] Radcliffe-Brown and [Robert] Redfield. From then on I was under the spell of social anthropology.\\"(Quote from R. Spicer 1990:12) Ned applied to the University of Chicago for the 1934-35 school year, where he was accepted and given a full scholarship. He worked for Redfield by cataloging and managing Redfield's office library. In the winter of 1935, Ned suffered a hemorrhage and was taken to Flint Goodrich Hospital on the university campus. He remained there until the late fall of 1935 with a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Ros later remarked that the doctors believed it was \\"valley fever\\" acquired in his days as an agricultural inspector. Neither Ned nor his family had the funds needed to pay the hospital, although Department Head Dr. Fay-Cooper \\"Papa\\" Cole found the funds to pay for the stay.(R. Spicer 1990: 12 -13) Cole suggested that Ros take notes for Ned and take them to him while he was in the hospital so that he could receive credit for courses.(RS 1990:13, ASM Spicer Achieve Box 1, folders 25 - 38) While he was in the hospital, Ned delved into readings such as Elementary Forms of Religion by Emil Durkheim. When Ned was released from the hospital, Redfield, Cole, and Provinse provided financial support and arranged for him to return to Tucson and work at the Arizona State Museum analyzing Indian skeletal materials. (RS 1990: 13) In June 1936, Ned and Ros were married by her father in Chicago.(Officer 1995) They honeymooned in Tucson at the Yaqui village of Pascua and began their research on their respective theses.(R. Spicer 1988: ) Ned's research project was suggested by John Provinse. Ros described their experience of moving in, learning the language, and creating a place in the local community.(R.S 1988: People of Pascua \\"Fifty Years ‚Ä¶.\\" ) The Spicers completed their field work in 1937 after which Ned began searching for a job. His contacts at the University of Chicago found him a fall semester opening at Dillard University, an all- Black College in New Orleans. Here, over the next two years, they experienced a very different world from that of the University of Chicago. Among the courses Ned taught at Dillard during this period were: \\"Primitive Society\\", \\"Minority Peoples in the US,\\" and \\"The Concept of Race.\\" Between 1937 and 1939, Ned wrote a draft of his dissertation. After presenting the first draft to his dissertation advisor Redfield, he was devastated for weeks. According to Ros, Redfield observed, \\"This is fine as an ethnographic field report, but where is your thesis?\\" (R. Spicer 1990:13). Ned had to completely rewrite the dissertation, turning to Radcliffe-Brown for guidance in reshaping his dissertation. Ned was awarded his Ph.D. in 1939, and published his dissertation through the University of Chicago Press in 1940, as \\"Pascua, A Yaqui Village in Arizona.\\" He and Ros began writing on a second book, \\"The People of Pascua\\", which was not completed at the time. Later, Rosamond completed and published the book posthumously in 1988. . In the fall of 1939, Ned took an interim position at the University of Arizona to fill in for Harry Getty who had gone back to the University of Chicago to finish his PhD studies. During this time, he met Malinowski, who was visiting the University of Arizona.(Troy 1999) They discussed Ned's interpretation of the Yaqui ceremonials, which Malinowski memorialized in a letter to Ned (quoted in Troy). As a result, Ned's structural-functionalism tended to shift from that of Radcliffe-Brown toward the Malinowskian perspective. After acquiring his PhD, Ned completed his period of study and began his academic career. In the spring of 1940, he applied for a Guggenheim Grant to conduct research among the Yaqui in Sonora, Mexico. He received the grant and began his study in the fall of 1941. However, the study was cut short by the US joining World War II (WWII), as Mexico, declaring its neutrality, expelled all Americans from the country. 1941 to 1946 saw a period of transition for the Spicer Family. With the start of WWII, many US anthropologists became involved in the war effort. Ned became employed with the War Relocation Authority, charged with the removal and oversight of Japanese-American citizens and Immigrants from the U.S West Coast. For Ned, it was his introduction to \\"applied\\" anthropology. Like many social scientists and anthropologists, teaching and research activity was curtailed or redirected in the United States to serve the war effort. Ned served the war effort in the War Relocation Authority first as the community analyst at the Poston WRA Camp on the Poston Indian Reservation(?) under the leadership of Dr. Alexander Leighton.(Leighton 1946 Governing of Men) Later, the family would move to Washington DC where Ned served as head of the Community Analyst Program within the WRA.(Edward H. Spicer 1946) While in Washington, he helped to form the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA). The new organization was led by his former mentor, John Provinse, who served as the first President (1941‚Äì44?). With the end of the Second World War, many anthropologists returned to their academic careers. Others found new careers in the post-war world. Provinse tried to encourage Ned to seek a position in applied anthropology, however, when offered a faculty position at the University of Arizona, he accepted. This began his career for the next 37 years.  Working: Career achievements (1946‚Äì1983)  With his temporary appointment to the Anthropology Department at the University of Arizona, Edward H. Spicer began his career as a professional anthropologist. It was a career that would be broad in scope and influential on many fronts, as Ned was one of the last links between Boasian four-field anthropology and modern day theoretical and applied anthropology. Early on in his career, he joined the American Anthropological Association (AAA). While in Washington, Spicer also joined the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA) as a founding member while it was headed by John Provinse as its president. He would serve as Vice President of the Society in 1946(?). He served as Vice President of the latter in 1947-48 and in 1976 the Society for Applied Anthropology honored Spicer with its Bronislaw Malinowski Award. Spicer's acceptance speech at its meeting in St. Louis was entitled \\"Beyond Analysis and Explanation? Notes on the Life and Times of the Society for Applied Anthropology\\". Spicer viewed \\"applied anthropology\\" as a very serious and responsible activity throughout his working career. Unlike many of the \\"applied\\" anthropologists of the period he did not leave a behind a definitive school of thought followed by \\"students\\". Yet his impact is to be measured in the number of students that he trained in applied anthropology,(Officer 1990: p. ) in the number of situations he found himself involved in that called for an applied anthropological perspective, and the number of publications on the subject that he produced during his career from 1946 ‚Äì 1983. Among these were organizing and editing a series of symposia on the issue related to training in the application of anthropology to field situations. In the introduction to \\"Human Problems and Technological Change\\" (1952) he expressed his definition of applied anthropology in the following terms. > \\"Changing people's customs is an even more delicate responsibility than > surgery. When a surgeon takes up his instruments, he assumes responsibility > for a human life. ... The administrator of a program of technological change > carries a heavier responsibility. Whenever he seeks to alter a people's way > of life, he is dealing not with one individual, but with the well-being and > happiness of generations of men and woman.\\"(p. 13) The key concept that Spicer learned at the University of Chicago was the importance of \\"acculturation\\" in the study of societies and cultures and applying a structural-functional point of view. In \\"Perspectives in American Indian Culture Change,\\" (1962), and \\"Ethnic Medicine in the Southwest\\", (1977) among other works, he led and edited seminars that explored this concept. Spicer chose teaching and research as the basis for his career, despite Provinse's urging that he make applied anthropology his career. Once he joined the faculty of the University of Arizona, he found a home where he could pursue his many interests, applied and academic. His 100 publications show his commitment to the Yaqui tribe's history and socio-cultural dynamics. From his community study \\"Pascua: A Yaqui Village in Southern Arizona\\" (1940) asked questions that called for a broader perspective, which led to his most successful project ‚Äì Cycles of Conquest Spicer, E. H. 1962. Cycles of Conquest, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ. which won the Southwestern Library Association's 1964 award for Best Book on the Southwest. Cycles pointed to the complexity of the acculturation concept as it affected the contact between native peoples and different \\"conquerors\\". He was in the process of developing the ideas that came from that research at the time of his death. His wife, Rosamond published his thoughts on the subject in a paper entitled, \\"The Nations of a State\\" that appeared in 1992.boundary 2 's volume entitled, \\"1492-1992: American Indian Persistence and Resurgence\\" (Autumn, 1992), pp. 26-48) He served as Editor of the American Anthropologist from 1960-1963. He was elected president of the AAA in 1972 to serve as president for the 1973-74 term. He identified three major issues that the profession faced: first, \\"the old and possibly insoluble\\" problem of the integration of anthropology; second, the problem of understanding anthropologists in relation to the society in which they operate, particularly on the subject of jobs and the Committee on Ethics; and third, a widening of anthropology presences by international meetings that signified the internationalization of the discipline. In 1978, he served on AAA's Committee on Anthropology as a Profession (CAP). The CAP discussed, among other matters, the recent proliferation of specializations in anthropology and the resulting loss of a sense of common direction among anthropologists. Spicer was one of two members of the Committee along with Eliot D. Chapple to prepare brief statements on this theme, which were published in the AAA's October Newsletter. This set-in motion the reorganization of the AAA that would be completed in the 1980s. In addition to the AAA, Ned occupied a number of roles within the Department of Anthropology, in the Tucson Community (in particular the Fort Lowell neighborhood), the State of Arizona, and the national and international scene. According to the Worldcat.com in 2019, Spicer's contributions are represented worldwide by 102 works in 426 publications in 3 languages and 10,740 library holdings.  Marriage and family  Spicer enrolled in the PhD program at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1934 where he met Rosamond Spicer (n√©e Brown), a graduate student enrolled in the Masters program while working together on a departmental seminar on India in the basement of the main library.(R. Spicer 1990: 12) In June 1935 he married Rosamond in a service conducted by her father. They spent their honeymoon in Pascua Village in Tucson where they conducted their field work for their respective degrees. She became a noted anthropologist in her own right.(Rosamond Spicer 1988) Together they had three children (Barry, Penny, and Lawson) and four grandchildren. Spicer died in Tucson, Arizona on April 5, 1983 from cancer at the age 76.

The plot of the 2002 science fiction neo-noir film Minority Report, based on the 1956 short story of the same name by Philip K. Dick, includes a number of themes. The film's plot centers around a trio of psychics called \\"precogs\\", who see future images called \\"previsions\\" of crimes yet to be committed. These images are processed by \\"Precrime\\", a specialized police department, which apprehends the criminals based on the precogs' foreknowledge. The cast includes Tom Cruise as Precrime officer John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as the senior precog Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton's superior Lamar Burgess. The film is a combination of whodunit, thriller, and science fiction.Buckland. pp. 193‚Äì195. Spielberg has characterized the movie's story as \\"fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot.\\"Arms, Gary, & Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 13. The film's central theme is the question of free will vs. determinism. It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance. It also concerns itself with the role of preventative government in protecting its citizenry, which was apt at the time of the picture's release given America's debates over the government's expanding powers after 9/11. Minority Report presents a future of increasing electronic surveillance, personalized advertising, and it analyzes the role of media in a future state where electronic advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of the broken family. Spielberg's analysis of the familial aspect was motivated by his own parent's divorce when he was a child. Free will vs. determinism The main theme of Minority Report is the classic philosophical debate of free will vs. determinism.Higgins. p. 56. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C. A. Wolski commented, \\"At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?\\" However, there is also the added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, \\"is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way.\\" The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, \\"[h]ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, and there would be no question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act ‚Äì a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder.\\" Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.Kowalski. p. 231. The central theme of the movie is discussed in the film's fourth scene. Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division's staff. He believes that its main \\"legalistic drawback\\" is that it \\"arrests individuals who have broken no laws.\\" Jad responds, \\"But they will!\\"Kowalski. p. 232. When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion, he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises; that the precogs' prevent an event accepted as fact, but one which will never happen. To show him that people regularly use predetermination, Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer, who catches it before it lands on the ground. When asked why he caught the ball, Witwer says \\"Because it was going to fall.\\" Anderton replies, \\"But it didn't.\\" Then confidently tells him, \\"The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.\\" Kowalski feels this example is faulty in the sense that the ball has no free will; it merely acts according to the laws of physics, but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder, then it would hold.Kowalski. p. 232‚Äì233. Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws, Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs', whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science.Mulhall. p. 163. Another quandary is that if the precogs' visions are infallible then the future cannot be otherwise, while if they are incorrect people will be punished for crimes they will never commit.Kowalski. p. 242. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the \\"conditional future\\".Kowalski. p. 233. He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made.Kowalski. p. 234‚Äì235. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.Kowalski. p. 236. Philosophy professor Michael Huemer says \\"that the only way the otherwise predetermined future seen by the precogs can be averted, we are led to believe, is by the influence of the precogs themselves.\\"Huemer. p. 103. He argues that their \\"knowledge of their would-be future\\" enables them to make changes to prevent its occurrence. This means that Howard Marks, the arrested potential killer from the film's opening scene, is destined to his fate and no action he could undertake would change it. Individuals with minority reports however, have a chance to change their futures according to Huemer, and since there was no minority report (i.e.; no possible alternative fate) for Anderton, he could only change his future by having access to the precogs' visions.Huemer. p. 104. Huemer compares the humans situation to that of a robot; since a robot controls itself, but has a set number of programmed actions, its fate falls within those actions. It lacks free will in the sense that it cannot choose any action outside of its programming, even if one may exist. He also considers a decaying atom which has a 50% chance of survival within the next hour, since the atom has no actions which it can undertake to change those odds, its fate is pure chance. Thus he believes a person needs a set of options, the knowledge of those options, and the ability to choose between them to have free will. Political and legal Spielberg said that the arrest of criminals before they have a chance to commit their crimes in the movie had some real-world background in post-9/11 America, saying that \\"[w]e're giving up some of our freedom so that the government can protect us.\\" The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens.Kowalski. p. 239. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he believes that if it did exist, those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers.Kowalski. p. 240, 243. Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen \\"a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery.\\" Kowalski feels the isolation of the precogs ensures that they see their visions merely as facts, and removes them from having to justify them. The precogs' ignorance of the results of their visions prevents them from knowing the effectiveness of the program. He feels the PreCrime officers are thus more qualified to evaluate their efficacy \\"than the precogs themselves.\\"Kowalski. p. 237‚Äì238, 245‚Äì246. In the December 2003 edition of the academic journal Film Criticism, scholar Mark Garrett Cooper moved past that point by asserting that not only have the precogs \\"yet to fully understand\\" their visions, but that the process by which the images are interpreted makes it so that no one individual could understand them without the use of the apparatus. The machinery is so effective and precise according to Cooper however, that the \\"omnipresent system effectively makes capture more certain than the crime.\\" When the system targets Cruise, instead of fleeing, he remains in the vicinity in the belief that the system will, in its inexorable logic, correct itself. The apparatus is considered so infallible according to Cooper that Cruise knows once he is cleared by it, his life can immediately return to normal. In this respect, Cooper feels that \\"far from indicting a security state, the film legitimates one.\\" Gareth Higgins argues that \\"[t]he government is playing God, using an all-seeing eye to prevent murder.\\" The film presents a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the images from the minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges. The judges appear via video feeds, analyze the images, and according to Cooper, they view the images, listen to Anderton rattle off \\"a string of legalistic verbiage\\", then give it a \\"pro forma ratification.\\" Thus the accused is never present, is not allowed a defense, and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial. The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion, as in its tag line: \\"It works.\\"Vest. p. 131. Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama, the audience is treated as if it were the jury, but in this system, instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent, the audience seeks instead to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess. But to do so, Anderton has to disprove the system, which he does by proving the existence of the minority report. This renders the PreCrime justice system inoperable, as if there is doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images, or their ability to be interpreted, but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances, then the system of infallible guilt can not exist. Media Spielberg conceived of the idea of a future world permeated with intrusive capitalism and government surveillance after everyone at the \\"think tank summit\\" told him that \\"the right of privacy is a diminishing commodity\\" which will soon be thrown \\"right out the window.\\" According to film critic J. Hoberman, Minority Report \\"visualizes (as well as demonstrates) a future where the unconscious has been thoroughly colonized.\\" When the movie first appeared in theaters a common source of reviewers' complaints was the film's product placement, which they found intrusive. Film scholar Martin Hall says that the purpose of the advertisements Anderton runs into are \\"encouraging him to buy certain products and, by extension, affirm his place in society.\\" The personalized advertising is disconcerting partly because of the invasion of privacy, but also, argues Cooper, because it is cold, impersonalized, and insincere. Cooper discusses how he feels Minority Report emphasizes the future importance over the control of imagery. According to him, the images captured from the precogs' visions in the film bestow power on those who control their processing. He says the film warns viewers that those who control images must be carefully overseen so as to prevent the abuse of power, and that the film presents \\"governance as a problem of image arrangement.\\" The film also presents a future world where government probes use advanced media technology to monitor its citizenry. Cooper says the quandary arises when the film intimates that there were will be no way to escape the media industry's omnipotence in the future, while at the same time defending \\"the need for image manipulating institutions.\\" He feels that this logically raises another issue in that the same concern could be leveled towards image-makers such as DreamWorks, and he says the \\"film's virtue lies in provoking this question.\\" He notes that the film's tranquil ending concludes with the Andertons looking out into a peaceful exterior with only rain visible, and the precogs reading in their isolated, idyllic farm, and both families apparently free of electronic surveillance. Self- perception Writing in the academic journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self- contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At the beginning of the film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: \\"It's better if you don't think of them as human.\\"Vest. p. 123. Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son.Vest. p. 124. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely \\"echoes\\" i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins \\"searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer.\\" Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at \\"discordance with his own reality.\\" Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that \\"it is likely that errors have occurred\\" in the PreCrime system. When he escapes the building and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name not only because they will give away his presence, but also because they remind him of his lost place in society, and he begins \\"to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him.\\" Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. \\"He's dirtied by the fact that he doesn't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost ‚Äî and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball.\\" His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance \\"to reconstruct his past.\\" After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has \\"recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer.\\" Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. \\"Burgess has been left truly alone by events,\\" argues Hall. \\"His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture.\\" Broken family Minority Report also continues Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families.Arms, Gary & Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 17, 33. Vest. p. 136. In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While he is also trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children.Arms, Gary & Riley, Thomas. essay in Kowalski. p. 17. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann.Buckland. p. 206. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.Buckland. p. 207.

She was favoured by the Pre-Raphaelites. Early life Maria was a daughter of wealthy Anglo-Hellenic merchant Demetrios Cassavetti (d.1858) and his wife Euphrosyne (1822‚Äì1896) and niece of the Greek Consul and noted patron Alexander Constantine Ionides. Maria and her cousins Marie Spartali Stillman and Aglaia Coronio were known collectively among friends as \\"the Three Graces\\", after the Charites of Greek mythology. After inheriting her father's fortune in 1858, she was able to lead a more independent life and was known to go unchaperoned while still unmarried.Marsh, Jan, Pre-Raphaelite Sisterhood, (London: 1985), p. 271 Artistic life Maria dedicated herself to art, and studied at the Slade School under Alphonse Legros and under Auguste Rodin in Paris. She worked as a sculptor in the 1880s and The British Museum holds four of her medals that she donated, depicting the heads of young girls.MacCarthy, Fiona, The Last Pre-Raphaelite (London: Faber & Faber, 2011), p. 206 British Museum holdings: Museum numbers- Medal 1 1887,1207.1, Museum number 1887,1207.1 Medal 2 1887,0209.1 Museum number 1887,0209.1 and Medals 3 and 4 1887,0209.2.

Jiminez, Jill Berk, Dictionary of Artists' Models (London: Routledge 200), p. 575 She exhibited at the Paris Salon as well. British Museum - Maria Zambaco (Biographical details) Familiar within the circles of the Pre-Raphaelites for her dark red hair and pale skin, her most notable modelling was for artist Edward Burne-Jones. She also sat as a model for James McNeill Whistler and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Personal life In 1860, she frightened off her first admirer, George du Maurier, who called her 'rude and unapproachable but of great talent and a really wonderful beauty'. Instead she married Dr Zambaco in 1860, initially living with him in France. She had a son and a daughter by him. The marriage was not a success and she moved back to live with her mother in London in 1866. Burne-Jones first met her in 1866, when her mother commissioned him to paint her as Cupid and Psyche, and they had an affair which lasted until at least January 1869 and they stayed in contact after. In Georgiana Burne-Jones's The Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones, the affair is not mentioned but the years 1868‚Äì1871 are described as 'Heart, thou and I here, sad and alone' (from John Keats's poem: Why Did I Laugh Tonight?).Burne-Jones, Georgiana, The Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones, 2 Vol, (London: 1904) In 1869, Edward Burne-Jones attempted to leave his wife for her, which caused a great scandal. Maria entreated him to commit suicide with her by laudanum overdose by the canal in Little Venice and the police had to be called.Marsh, Jan, Pre- Raphaelite Sisterhood, (London: 1985), p. 273 After they broke up, Maria continued to appear in Burne-Jones' paintings as a sorceress or a temptress, such as in his last major work of her, The Beguiling of Merlin (1872‚Äì1877), and the controversial Phyllis and Demopho√∂n (1870), which was removed from display at the Royal Watercolour Society. Friends of the Burne-Jones family, such as Rosalind Howard, cut Maria socially.MacCarthy, Fiona, The Last Pre- Raphaelite (London: Faber & Faber, 2011), p. 217 Later life and death She died in Paris in 1914 and her body was returned for interment in the family sarcophagus at the Greek Orthodox necropolis of the South Metropolitan Cemetery at Norwood, where she is recorded under her maiden name.

Migration history The Nepalese community in Fiji are descendants of indentured labourers (known as Girmityas) brought in by the British colonial rulers of Fiji. These Nepali Girmityas came together with the Indian labourers from India under the indentured labour system.General Comment The Nepalis settled first in Suva, the capital of Fiji, and then moved around the island to Navua, another large town, and eventually to Kavanagasau, now home of the largest Nepalese community in the islands. Situated in the \\"Sand dunes of Singatoka\\", Kavanagasau is the one place in Viti Levu with mist-shrouded hills and valleys, a landscape which appealed to the Nepalis for its similarity to the Himalayan foothills. Ironically, like much of the Nepalis¬¥ home country, Kavanagasau is not favoured with large tracts of productive land. Here they lease farmland from the Native Fijians and grow sugarcane and vegetables for the market. Most children end their studies after getting a basic high school education and the majority follow in their parent¬¥s footsteps as peasant farmers. Culture Far from their country of origin, the Fiji-born Nepalis hold on to their way of life. They celebrate Dasain with particular gusto. The Nepalis of Fiji tend to be clannish despite considerable intermarriage with women from the Indian community in the country. The fact is that there were no Nepalese women in the early days, only men came as laborers. The Nepalese identity has nevertheless remained intact and traditional festivals continue to be observed. They have strictly segregated themselves from the native Fijians, feeling a greater kinship for their counterparts in the Indian population. Lately, particularly among third generation immigrants, the distinction between the Nepalis and Indians has begun to fade.

They were intended as sixth rates, which placed them in a category of ships with more than 24 but less than 36 guns, and commanded by an officer of the rank of captain. These ships were constructed of wood in traditional shipbuilding fashion, although iron braces and trussed were used for increased longitudinal strength. They were armed with a traditional arrangement of broadside, smoothbore muzzle-loading guns, and in common with contemporary Royal Navy practice for small ships, these guns were carronades (with the exception of a pair of small long guns on the focsle as chasers). Twenty 32-pounder carronades were mounted on the upper deck and a further six 18-pounder carronades were placed on the quarterdeck.

It was first published in 1524 in the . For centuries the chorale has been the prominent hymn (Hauptlied) for Christmas Day in German speaking Lutheranism, but has also been used in different translations internationally. It has appeared in hymnals of various denominations including the Catholic Church.  Text  Luther expanded a pre-Reformation stanza which is attested in Northern Germany in the 15th century, mainly in prayerbooks from the convent of Medingen, based on Grates nunc omnes, the Latin sequence of the midnight mass for Christmas, by six stanzas. Each stanza ends on the acclamation Kyrieleis. The hymn was published in Eyn Enchiridion in Erfurt in 1524.

Die Ikonographie des Wichmannsburger Antependiums im Kontext der Medinger Handschriften, in: Oxford German Studies 34 (2005), pp. 19-46. It seems likely that both Luther and Walter collaborated to modify an older melody. In the first verse, the highest notes accentuate important words such as Jesu, (man), (virgin), (angels).  Musical settings  Balthasar Resinarius's chorale motet based on \\"Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ\\" was printed in 1544. A setting of the hymn by Walter is dated 1551, Antonio Scandello's 1575. Lucas Osiander wrote a four-part setting in 1586, Erhard Bodenschatz in 1608, Samuel Scheidt wrote two settings in 1650. A five-part motet of Johannes Eccard was printed in 1597, one of Adam Gumpelzhaimer in Augsburg in 1618, Andreas Raselius wrote a five-part setting in 1610. Melchior Sch√§rer (1570‚Äì1602) set the hymn as a motet a cappella for three parts, and Michael Praetorius composed various settings. Johann Hermann Schein wrote a cantata for three parts in 1618, Johann Cr√ºger set it for four voices, two obbligato instruments (violins) and continuo. The hymn appears in several of Johann Sebastian Bach's Christmas cantatas. He inserted its seventh stanza in one of his church cantatas, Sehet, welch eine Liebe hat uns der Vater erzeiget, BWV 64, written for the Third Day of Christmas 1723. He used the complete chorale as the base for one of his chorale cantatas, Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ, BWV 91, composed in Leipzig for Christmas Day of 1724. He included the sixth and seventh stanzas of the hymn respectively in the first and third cantatas of his Christmas Oratorio (1734). BWV 314, one of his four- part chorale settings of the hymn tune, in D major, and appearing in the Dietel manuscript, was likely also written as part of a Christmas cantata.BWV 314 at Luke Dahn's website. Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel used the hymn's fifth stanza in the centre of his Christmas cantata K√ºndlich gro√ü ist das gottselige Geheimnis. Cantatas based on the hymn were also composed by Gottfried August Homilius, , and Kurt Hessenberg, whose Op. 9 is a chorale cantata based on the hymn, written in 1935 for mixed chorus, two solo voices, organ and orchestra. The hymn inspired organ settings by Protestant Baroque composers such as Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, Georg B√∂hm, Bach, Homilius, Johann Christoph Altnikol and Johann Philipp Kirnberger. It is used prominently in Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Trio No. 2 as the culminating melody of the finale. Robert Schumann used the chorale for the theme and variations in the third movement of his Violin Sonata No.2 in D minor, Op. 121, changing the meter to triple time.

COSA applies a pragmatic and collective approach for using scientific methods to develop indicators and tools to measure sustainability through performance monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment. These sustainability measurements assess the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices. COSA's approach and indicators have a basis in international treaties and normative references such as the International Labour Organization eight fundamental Conventions, the World Health Organization Guidelines for Water Quality and the International Finance Corporation. The indicators align with internationally recognized accords including the United Nations Global Compact, Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are benchmarked for consistency and shared use.  History  The concept for COSA was originally developed in 2005 as a project of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the United Nations International Trade Centre and was focused on the coffee sector. The COSA indicator development process was inaugurated through the International Coffee Organization whose Council unanimously endorsed it, making it the first sustainability assessment system to be formally adopted by a global commodity body. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development COSA project focused on developing a thorough and rigorous cost benefit analysis of sustainability practices in the coffee sector via two primary outputs: a tool for assessing costs and benefits according to COSA-defined criteria and indicators, and training to enable stakeholders to ‚Äúmeasure and understand the costs and benefits of undertaking sustainable practices and adopting different sustainability initiatives.‚Äù In 2008, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development COSA project published \\"Seeking Sustainability: COSA Preliminary Analysis of Sustainability Initiatives in the Coffee Sector\\". The report summarized the findings of the pilot application of the COSA tool to collect and analyze data to facilitate understanding of environmental, social, and economic outcomes associated with sustainability initiatives in the coffee sector. The six coffee sector sustainability initiatives included were: organic, Fair Trade, Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C), UTZ certified, Rainforest Alliance, and Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices. Three coffee growing regions were included: Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2012, led by its founder and President Daniele Giovannucci, the structure and constitution of COSA was formalized as an independent non-profit organization incorporated under United States law to advance research and training in the field of sustainability. It is as this globally-focused, independent non-profit that COSA continues its work today. Core support has come primarily from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the Ford Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank. COSA is supported half by public grants and half by its advisory services and impact assessment projects.  Working in partnerships  COSA supports institutions to adopt and integrate approaches to sustainability, and includes more than 40 public and private sector organizations. COSA partners with research and development institutions to adopt, integrate, and build local sustainability measurement and evaluation capacity in the countries where it works, as well as for bilateral learning. Local partnerships to conduct research have included the Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research at the University of Ghana, the Centro de Estudios Regionales Cafeteros y Empresariales in Colombia, the strategic think tank of the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, the Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute, and the CGIAR Consortium of research organizations. The COSA partnership with the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, in Kenya and Uganda, led to new processes with the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) for conducting field research to advance the understanding of the challenges faced by smallholder farmers and the roles of their cooperatives. The work, commissioned by the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance with support of the Ford Foundation, evolved methods for effectively assessing the impacts of multiple sustainability certifications on the lives of farmers, their organizations, and communities. COSA piloted the Grameen Foundation‚Äôs Progress Out of Poverty Index in coffee (Guatemala, Mexico, Peru) and cocoa (Nicaragua, Colombia), and adopted them into its suite of indicators. COSA works in development projects with sustainability labels such as Fair trade, Organic, UTZ Certified, 4C, and Rainforest Alliance. Private supply chains have utilized COSA to assess and measure the impact of their sustainability efforts, fostered by development agencies such as the International Finance Corporation, USAID, or the Swiss Government, and include firms such as Nespresso, Lindt and Sprungli, Mars Drinks, Cargill, ECOM Trading and Mondelez International.  Accomplishments  COSA indicators and tools have been widely incorporated, adopted, and adapted by institutions, corporations, and other organizations: * The Textile Exchange adapted COSA indicators to create the Organic Cotton Sustainability Assessment Tool to assess the sustainability impact of organic cotton farming.  COSA led the efforts to establish global metrics for small farmer sustainability for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which commissioned COSA, along with the Grameen Foundation and Soil & More International, to develop the metrics for its Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems Tool.  The International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Impacts Code is aligned with COSA indicators as is the Shared Framework for Performance Measurement of the Sustainable Food Lab and the Shared Approach to Performance Measurement: Common Indicators and Metrics‚Äù that was developed in partnership with Ford Foundation, IDH The Sustainable Trade Initiative, Seas of Change, MARS Chocolate, Root Capital, International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance, Nestle, Rainforest Alliance, and Centre for Development Innovation.  The International Cotton Advisory Committee's Expert Panel on the Social, Environmental, and Economic Performance of Cotton and the Food and Agriculture Organization Plant Production and Protection Division published a guidance framework for measuring the sustainability of cotton farming systems with indicators that were in part informed by COSA's decade of work in the field.  For the Ford Foundation, COSA designed simple assessment tools and guidelines for Ford Foundation grantees to utilize to improve the design and management of their food crop projects.  With the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) Inter- American Development Bank Sustainable Agriculture, Food, and Environment platform, COSA helps funded projects to establish or improve their measurement and evaluation systems to achieve greater levels of scalability and share lessons and knowledge across the funding Platform.  COSA also collaborates with multi-stakeholder industry initiatives such as the Sustainable Coffee Challenge led by Conservation International and the Global Coffee Platform led by the 4C Coffee Association. Since its creation, COSA's reach has expanded to seventeen countries: Colombia, Costa Rica, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Tanzania, Uganda, and Vietnam. In addition to coffee, COSA now also works with cocoa, cotton, sugar, and food crops.  Recognition  COSA has been recognized in the international development and sustainability communities for its \\"visible and impartial\\" assessments. Following the 2014 publication of the COSA Measuring Sustainability Report: Coffee and Cocoa in 12 Countries, the International Society of Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance called COSA a leader in the \\"alignment of standards and certification initiatives, showing the potential of harmonizing metrics.\\"  External links  * International Finance Corporation Environmental and Social Performance Standards * Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research at the University of Ghana * Centro de Estudios Regionales Cafeteros y Empresariales * Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development * Instituto de Estudios Peruanos * Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute * CGIAR Consortium * International Initiative for Impact Evaluation * The Textile Exchange * Soil & More International * ISEAL Impacts Code * Sustainable Food Lab * Sustainable Coffee Challenge * Global Coffee Platform  References  Impact assessment Sustainable agriculture Environmental impact assessment International sustainability organizations ","title":"Committee on Sustainability Assessment"},{"id":"30034653","text":"Markus Schatte (born 22 June 1956 in Frankfurt) is a German football coach.

Motivation In ensemble learning one tries to combine the models produced by several learners into an ensemble that performs better than the original learners. One way of combining learners is bootstrap aggregating or bagging, which shows each learner a randomly sampled subset of the training points so that the learners will produce different models that can be sensibly averaged. In bagging, one samples training points with replacement from the full training set. The random subspace method is similar to bagging except that the features (\\"attributes\\", \\"predictors\\", \\"independent variables\\") are randomly sampled, with replacement, for each learner. Informally, this causes individual learners to not over-focus on features that appear highly predictive/descriptive in the training set, but fail to be as predictive for points outside that set. For this reason, random subspaces are an attractive choice for problems where the number of features is much larger than the number of training points, such as learning from fMRI data or gene expression data. The random subspace method has been used for decision trees; when combined with \\"ordinary\\" bagging of decision trees, the resulting models are called random forests. It has also been applied to linear classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbours and other types of classifiers. This method is also applicable to one-class classifiers. Recently, the random subspace method has been used in a portfolio selection problem showing its superiority to the conventional resampled portfolio essentially based on Bagging.  Algorithm  An ensemble of models employing the random subspace method can be constructed using the following algorithm: # Let the number of training points be N and the number of features in the training data be D. # Choose L to be the number of individual models in the ensemble. # For each individual model l, choose n (n < N) to be the number of input points for l. It is common to have only one value of n for all the individual models. # For each individual model l, create a training set by choosing d features from D with replacement and train the model. Now, to apply the ensemble model to an unseen point, combine the outputs of the L individual models by majority voting or by combining the posterior probabilities.

It was first described by Alfred Nalepa in 1892. Aceria anthocoptes can be found on Cirsium arvense, the Canada thistle, and is a good potential biological pest control agent of this invasive weed. Description Aceria anthocoptes is considered to be a good potential biological control agent for the invasive weed Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) Female specimens have a somewhat fusiform shape, and range in colour. Depending upon the stage of development, both nymphs and adults can appear white, tan, pink, or yellow.Rachel Winston, Rich Hansen, Mark Schwarzlander, Eric Coombs, Carol Bell Randall, Rodney Lym (2008), Biology and Biological Control of Exotic True Thistles , USDA Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team They are approximately 170 ¬µm long and 65 ¬µm wide, and are thus almost invisible to the naked eye. Chelicerae are about 20 ¬µm long, and are almost straight. Distribution Aceria anthocoptes is a 'free-living' eriophyid. Because of its life history and its morphology, this mite is considered to be a vagrant species. This mite can be found in a number of European countries and in the United States. As of 2001, it is known to exist in 21 countries. It is the only species of eriophyid mite that has been found on Cirsium arvense throughout the world. In the United States This species is found in the following states: Also included in *California *Colorado *Delaware *Kansas *Maryland *Minnesota *Montana *Nebraska *North Dakota *Oregon *Pennsylvania *South Dakota *Virginia *Washington *West Virginia *Wyoming Behavior and life cycle These mites produce multiple generations each year, and probably overwinter on root or the root buds. This mite normally spends the winter as fertilized female adults, remaining under bud scales of the thistle. They emerge in the spring. They continuously reproduce during times other than winter, creating a new generation every two to three weeks. Aceria anthocoptes mite feeds by sucking the contents of the leaf cells. Use as a biological control agent Aceria anthocoptes is considered to be a good potential biological control agent for Cirsium arvense, the Canada thistle. It damages both the epidermal cells and deeper mesophyll layers, on both the upper and lower surfaces of this invasive weed. The result is visible deformation and folding of the leaf blade, with a curling of the leaf edges. The leaves become russeted and bronzed, and gradually dry out.

This article describes the history of Flanders. The definition of the territory called \\"Flanders\\" (), however, has varied throughout history. The historical county of Flanders is now split into different countries. It roughly encompassed Zeelandic Flanders in the Netherlands, French Flanders in France, and the Belgian provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders as well as part of Hainaut. The city of Ghent was the capital. The contemporary territory of Flanders (i.e., the Flemish Region as the Dutch-speaking part of the Kingdom of Belgium) contains within it the core of the old county, West Flanders and East Flanders, plus three more provinces to the east which were not originally part of Flanders. These are the provinces of Antwerp and Flemish Brabant which were historically part of the Duchy of Brabant, and the province of Belgian Limburg, which was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The city of Brussels, historically part of Brabant, is now politically part of the Flemish Community but not of the Flemish Region. Thus, the modern Belgian provinces of West and East Flanders have always been part of a political territory named Flanders, while the provinces Antwerp, Flemish Brabant and Belgian Limburg, though Dutch-speaking, have not.  Early history  Written records of the Flemish region begin in Roman times. Julius Caesar left his Commentaries of the Gaulish War about his time in the region. Caesar described \\"Belgium\\" or \\"Gallia Belgica\\" as the northernmost of the three distinct parts of Gaul, and all definitions of Flanders are within this large Belgic area. The inhabitants were collectively called Belgae. The boundaries were the North Sea, the Marne and Seine rivers in the southwest, the Ardennes in the southeast, and the Rhine in the north and east. Within the Belgic region, the old County of Flanders was inhabited by the Menapii (and possibly also some of the Marsacii and Morini) whose territory stretched from the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta to the modern Flemish coast. More inland, across the Scheldt, stretching from Brabant into modern France, lived the Nervii. The most eastern part of modern Flanders was inhabited by the Eburones, whose territory encompassed all or most of modern Belgian Limburg, and also stretched into neighbouring areas of Germany. The exact borders of these tribal groups are not known, but they were all part of a Belgian alliance which fought against Caesar. Later, under Roman rule, each of these tribal groups had its own \\"civitas\\" or state, each with a Roman administrative capital. For the Menapii, this was Cassel, and for the Nervii it was Bavay. Both of these are now in northern France and were within the Roman province of Gallia Belgica. The only civitas capital now in Flanders was Tongeren, the capital of the Tungri, who replaced the Eburones (or were the Eburones under a new name). To what extent these tribes were Celtic, or Germanic, or something else is still subject to historical debate. But as a whole, the Belgic area was certainly influenced by both Celtic and Germanic languages and culture. Caesar describes tribes and individuals who had Celtic names, but also recalls a story that the majority of the Belgae had ancestors who had come from east of the Rhine, some time before the migrations of the Cimbri and Teutones in the second century BCE. Caesar describes northern Belgic tribes such as the Menapii and Nervii as being particularly far removed from Celtic Gaulish norms found in what is today central France, and he specifically refers to their eastern Belgic neighbours, such as the Eburones, as \\"Cisrhenane Germani\\". He reported German ancestry amongst these tribes and by the first century BC Germanic languages may have already become prevalent amongst the northern Belgae. In late classical times, as the Roman empire came under increasing pressure from outside tribal groups, the coast of Flanders itself became a part of the \\"Saxon Shore\\", which was a militarized area under attack from seaborne \\"Saxon\\" raiders and invaders, coming from the direction of northern Germany. Inland parts of modern Flanders, Brabant and especially Limburg, came under pressure from the Frankish group of Germanic tribes, from across the Rhine. It is at this time that the fortifications underlying Oudenburg were built up. Eventually the inland Salian Franks converted to Christianity and came to rule what is now northern France, and the entire Belgian area. They were treated as successors of Rome, spreading their rule into Germany and even as far as parts of Italy and Spain. But problems continued with invasions and raids from more northerly Germanic Vikings until well into the Middle Ages.  Historical Flanders: County of Flanders  14th- century illustration of French knights charging Flemish footsoldiers (right) at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302. The County of Flanders was created in the year 862 as a feudal fief in West Francia, the predecessor of the Kingdom of France. After a period of growing power within France, it was divided when its western districts fell under French rule in the late 12th century, with the remaining parts of Flanders came under the rule of the counts of neighbouring Hainaut in 1191. Increasingly powerful from the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban communes were instrumental in defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300‚Äì1302), finally defeating the French in the Battle of the Golden Spurs (July 11, 1302), near Kortrijk. Two years later, the uprising was defeated and Flanders indirectly remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, however, owing to widespread European population decline following the Black Death of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War (1338‚Äì1453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to Worstead and North Walsham in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woollen industry. The entire area passed in 1384 to the dukes of Burgundy, in 1477, who eventually united it politically with their Duchy of Brabant within the Holy Roman Empire. By 1556 the Burgundian Netherlands were being ruled by their successors, the Habsburg kings of Spain. By this time Flanders had been removed from the territory of the Kingdom of France, except that some western districts of Flanders came under French rule under successive treaties of 1659 (Artois), 1668, and 1678. During the late Middle Ages Flanders' trading towns (notably Ghent, Bruges and Ypres) once again made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of Northern Italy. Ghent, Bruges, Ypres and the Franc of Bruges formed the Four Members, a form of parliament which exercised considerable power in Flanders.Philip the Good: the apogee of Burgundy by Richard Vaughan, p.201  Flanders in the Low Countries   Beeldenstorm  Relief statues in the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht, attacked in Reformation iconoclasm in the 16th century. In 1500, Charles V was born in Ghent. He inherited the Seventeen Provinces (1506), Spain (1516) with its colonies and in 1519 was elected Holy Roman Emperor.William Robertson, The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V (NY, 1874), p 116 The Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, issued by Charles V, established the Low Countries as the Seventeen Provinces (or Spanish Netherlands in its broad sense) as an entity separate from the Holy Roman Empire and from France. In 1556 Charles V abdicated due to ill health (he suffered from crippling gout).William Robertson, The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V (NY, 1874), p 456 Spain and the Seventeen Provinces went to his son, king Philip II of Spain. Meanwhile, Protestantism had reached the Low Countries. Among the wealthy traders of Antwerp, the Lutheran beliefs of the German Hanseatic traders found appeal, perhaps partly for economic reasons. The spread of Protestantism in this city was aided by the presence of an Augustinian cloister (founded 1514) in the St. Andries quarter. Luther, an Augustinian himself, had taught some of the monks, and his works were in print by 1518. The first Lutheran martyrs came from Antwerp. The Reformation resulted in consecutive but overlapping waves of reform: a Lutheran, followed by a militant Anabaptist, then a Mennonite, and finally a Calvinistic movement. These movements existed independently of each other. Philip II, a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the Counter-Reformation, suppressed Calvinism in Flanders, Brabant and Holland (what is now approximately Belgian Limburg was part of the Bishopric of Li√®ge and was Catholic de facto). In 1566, the iconoclasm (Beeldenstorm) began as protest against Philip II and promoted the disfigurement of statues and paintings depicting saints. This was associated with the ensuing religious war between Catholics and Protestants, especially the Anabaptists. The Beeldenstorm started in what is now the arrondissement of Dunkirk in French Flanders, with open-air sermons (). The first took place on the Cloostervelt near Hondschoote and the largest sermon was held near Boeschepe on July 12, 1562. These open- air sermons, mostly of Anabaptist or Mennonite signature, spread through the country. On August 10, 1566 at the end of the pilgrimage from Hondschoote to Steenvoorde, the chapel of the Sint-Laurensklooster (Monastery of Saint Lawrence) was defaced by Protestants. The iconoclasm resulted not only in the destruction of Catholic art, but also cost the lives of many priests. It next spread to Antwerp, and on August 22, to Ghent. One cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five cloisters, ten hospitals and seven chapels were attacked. From there, it further spread east and north, but in total lasted not even a month.  The Eighty Years' War and its consequences  Subsequently, Philip II sent the Duke of Alba to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the southern part of the Provinces, who signed the Union of Atrecht, which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the Union of Utrecht and settled in 1581 the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, but before the revolt could be completely defeated, a war between England and Spain had broken out, forcing Philip's Spanish troops to halt their advance. Meanwhile, the Spanish armies had already conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then arguably the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. On August 17, 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Dutch Revolt for the (from now on) Southern Netherlands. The United Provinces (the Netherlands proper) fought on in what came to be known as the \\"Eighty Years' War\\", until 1648 - the Peace of Westphalia. While Spain was at war with England, the rebels from the north, strengthened by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to Philips II's Spanish troops. They managed to conquer a considerable part of Brabant (the later Noord-Brabant of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary (Zeelandic Flanders), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front line at the end of this war stabilized and became the current border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to close off the river Scheldt, effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes. First the fall of Antwerp to the Spanish and later also the closing of the Scheldt were causes of a considerable emigration of people from the city. Many of the Calvinist merchants of Antwerp and also of other Flemish cities left Flanders and emigrated to the north. A large number of them settled in Amsterdam, which was at the time a smaller port, only of significance in the Baltic trade. In the following years Amsterdam was rapidly transformed into one of the world's most important ports. Because of the contribution of the Flemish exiles to this transformation, the exodus is sometimes described as \\"creating a new Antwerp\\". Flanders and Brabant, due to these events, went into a period of relative decline from the time of the Thirty Years War. In the Northern Netherlands however, the mass emigration from Flanders and Brabant became an important driving force behind the Dutch Golden Age.  1581‚Äì1795: The Southern Netherlands  1609 map of the county of Flanders Although arts remained at a relatively impressive level for another century with Peter Paul Rubens (1577‚Äì1640) and Anthony van Dyck, Flanders experienced a loss of its former economic and intellectual power under Spanish, Austrian, and French rule, with heavy taxation and rigid imperial political control compounding the effects of industrial stagnation and Spanish-Dutch and Franco-Austrian conflict. The Southern Netherlands suffered severely under the Spanish Succession war, but under the reign of empress Maria-Theresia these lands economically flourished again. Influenced by the Enlightenment, the Austrian emperor Joseph II was the first sovereign who has been in the Southern Netherlands since king Philip II of Spain left them in 1559.  1795‚Äì1815: French Revolution and Napoleonic France  In 1794 the French Republican Army started using Antwerp as the northernmost naval port of France, which country officially annexed Flanders the following year as the d√©partements of Lys, Escaut, Deux-N√®thes, Meuse-Inf√©rieure and Dyle. Obligatory (French) army service for all men aged 16‚Äì25 was one of the main reasons for the people's uprising against the French in 1798, known as the Boerenkrijg (Peasants' War), with the heaviest fighting in the Campine area.  1815‚Äì1830: United Kingdom of the Netherlands  After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo in Waterloo, Brabant, sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands ‚Äì Belgium minus the East Cantons and Luxembourg ‚Äì was given by the Congress of Vienna (1815) to the United Netherlands (Dutch: Verenigde Nederlanden), the state that briefly existed under Sovereign Prince William I of Orange Nassau, the latter King William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, after the French Empire was driven out of the Dutch territories. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was born. The Protestant King of the Netherlands, William I rapidly started the industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. The political system that was set up however, slowly but surely failed to forge a true union between the northern and the southern parts of the Kingdom. The southern bourgeoisie mainly was Roman Catholic, in contrast to the mainly Protestant north; large parts of the southern bourgeoisie also primarily spoke French rather than Dutch. In 1815 the Dutch Senate was reinstated (Dutch: Eerste Kamer der Staaten Generaal). The nobility, mainly coming from the south, became more and more estranged from their northern colleagues. Resentment grew both among the Roman Catholics from the south and the Protestants from the north and among the powerful liberal bourgeoisie from the south and their more moderate colleagues from the north. On August 25, 1830 (after the showing of the opera 'La Muette de Portici' of Daniel Auber in Brussels) the Belgian Revolution sparked off and became a fact. On October 4, 1830, the Provisional Government (Dutch: Voorlopig Bewind) proclaimed the independence which was later confirmed by the National Congress that issued a new Liberal Constitution and declared the new state a Constitutional Monarchy, under the House of Saxe-Coburg. Flanders now became part of the Kingdom of Belgium, which was recognized by the major European Powers on January 20, 1831. The de facto dissidence was only finally recognized by the United Kingdom of the Netherlands on April 19, 1839.  Kingdom of Belgium  In 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the splitting up of the two countries. Belgium was confirmed as an independent state by the Treaty of London of 1839, but deprived of the eastern half of Limburg (now Dutch Limburg), and the Eastern half of Luxembourg (now the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). Sovereignty over Zeelandic Flanders, south of the Westerscheldt river delta, was left with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was allowed to levy a toll on all traffic to Antwerp harbour until 1863.  Rise of the Flemish Movement  Flag of Flanders The Belgian Revolution was not well supported in Flanders and even on the 4th of October 1830, when the Belgian independence was eventually declared, Flemish authorities refused to take orders from the new Belgian government in Brussels. Only after Flanders was subdued with the aid of a large French military force one month later, under the leadership of the Count de Pont√©coulant, Flanders became a true part of Belgium. The situation with the province of Limburg remained unclear until 1839, when it was finally split between the Netherlands and Belgium. The French-speaking bourgeoisie showed very little respect for the Flemish part of the population. French became the only official language in Belgium and all secondary and higher education in the Dutch language was abolished. Belgium's co-founder, Charles Rogier, wrote in 1832 to Jean-Joseph Raikem, the minister of justice: In 1838, another co-founder, senator Alexandre Gendebien, even declared that the Flemish were \\"one of the more inferior races on the Earth, just like the negroes\\". In 1834, all people even remotely suspected of being \\"Flemish minded\\" or calling for the reunification of the Netherlands were prosecuted and their houses looted and burnt. Flanders, until then a very prosperous European region, was not considered worthwhile for investment and scholarship. A study in 1918 demonstrated that in the first 88 years of its existence, 80% of the Belgian GDP was invested in Wallonia. This led to a widespread poverty in Flanders, forcing roughly 300.000 Flemish to emigrate to Wallonia to start working there in the heavy industry. All of these events led to a silent uprising in Flanders against the French-speaking domination. But it was not until 1878 that Dutch was allowed to be used for official purposes in Flanders, although French remained the only official language in Belgium. A remarkable case happened in 1872. Jozef Schoep, a Fleming, presented himself at the town hall of Sint-Jans Molenbeek to declare the birth of his son. The civil servant noted the declarations made in Dutch by Schoep in French and also addressed him in French. Schoep didn't understand the language and left the town hall as a sign of protest, without having signed the necessary documents. The Brussels' court condemned him to a fine of 50 Francs plus tax. Schoep rejected this verdict, accompanied by two solicitors who both stated that they would plead in Dutch. The president of the court at first didn't allow this, but afterwards changed his mind. Eventually, the pleaders were allowed to use Dutch on the condition that their pleas would be translated into French by an official interpreter because the judges didn't know a single word of Dutch. Schoep's solicitors also demanded that the State would have its plea translated, but this was again rejected by the court. Eventually the case went to the supreme court, which ruled that pleading in Dutch would be forbidden. Its verdict was based on the so-called freedom of language and that no-one could ask from any judge to know any other language but French. Mr. Schoep's son had to wait until 1882 before he receiving a legal birth certificate (by which time his father had died). One year later, Dutch was again allowed in secondary schools; the first of which reopened in 1889. The Flemings had to wait until 1919‚Äîafter many Flemish soldiers died in the trenches of World War I‚Äîto have their language officially recognised and until 1930 before the first Flemish university was reopened. The first translation of the Belgian constitution in Dutch was not published until 1967.  World War I and its consequences  Flanders (and Belgium as a whole) saw some of the greatest loss of life on the Western Front of the First World War, in particular from the three battles of Ypres. Due to the hundreds of thousands of casualties at Ypres, the poppies that sprang up from the battlefield afterwards, later immortalised in the Canadian poem \\"In Flanders Fields\\", written by John McCrae, have become a symbol for lives lost in war. Flemish feeling of identity and consciousness grew through the events and experiences of war. The occupying German authorities took several Flemish-friendly measures. More importantly, the experiences of many Dutch-speaking soldiers on the front led by French-speaking officers catalysed Flemish emancipation. The French-speaking officers often gave orders in French only, followed by \\"et pour les Flamands, la m√™me chose\\" which meant \\"and for the Flemish, the same thing\\" (which obviously did not help the Flemish conscripts who were mostly uneducated farmers and workers who didn't speak any French). The resulting suffering is still remembered by Flemish organizations during the yearly Yser pilgrimage in Diksmuide at the monument of the Yser Tower.  Right-wing nationalism in the interbellum and World War II  Recruitment poster for the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen with the slogan \\"Flemish, onwards!\\" During the interbellum and World War II, several fascist and/or national-socialistic parties emerged in Belgium, of which the Flemish ones drew unto the feeling of discrimination by the Wallonians against the Flemish. Since these parties were promised more rights for the Flemish by the German government during World War II, some of them collaborated with the Nazi regime. Two SS formations, the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen and the 27th SS \\"Langemarck\\" Volunteer Division were formed of Flemish collaborators and served on the Eastern Front. Flemish volunteers for the SS were kept separate from Walloon ones who were made into a separate unit, the 28th \\"Wallonien\\" Grenadier Division. Nevertheless, many Flemish people were also involved in the resistance, joining local organizations like the Kempische Legioen (KL) in Limburg, and support from Flemish resistance members of the Witte Brigade and the Nationale Koninklijke Beweging (NKB) allowed the Allied armies to capture the vital port of Antwerp intact in 1944. After the war, collaborators (or people who were \\"Zwart\\", \\"Black\\" during the war) were prosecuted and punished, among them many Flemish Nationalists. As a result, up until this day Flemish Nationalism is often associated with right-wing and fascist ideologies.  Flemish autonomy  After World War II, the differences between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgians became clear in a number of conflicts, such as the question whether King Leopold III should return (which most Flemings supported but not the Walloons) and the use of Dutch in the Catholic University of Leuven. As a result, several state reforms took place in the second half of the 20th century, which transformed the unitary Belgium into a federal state with communities, regions and language areas. This resulted also in the establishment of a Flemish Parliament and Government. Several Flemish parties still advocate for more Flemish autonomy, some even for Flemish independence (see Partition of Belgium), whereas the French-speakers would like to keep the current state as it is. Recent governments (such as Verhofstadt I Government) have transferred certain federal competences to the regional governments. On 13 December 2006, a spoof news broadcast by the Belgian Francophone public broadcasting station RTBF declared that Flanders had decided to declare independence from Belgium. The 2007 federal elections showed more support for Flemish autonomy. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy increased their share of the votes and seats in the Belgian parliament. This was especially the case for Christian Democratic and Flemish party and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) (forming a cartel). The 2009 regional elections have strengthened the parties in favor a significant increase of Flemish autonomy: CD&V; and N-VA were the clear winners. N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the 2010 federal elections. These victories for the advocates of much more Flemish autonomy are very much in parallel with opinion polls that show a structural increase in popular support for their agenda. Since 2006, certain polls have started showing a majority in favor of Flemish independence. Those polls are not yet representative, but they point to a significant long-term trend. Several negotiators having come and gone since the federal elections of 10 June 2007 without diminishing the disagreements between Flemish and Walloon politicians regarding a further State reform, caused difficulties for the formation of the federal government and ultimately led to the fall of the government and new elections on June 13, 2010. These were won by the pro-independence party of the N-VA in Flanders. The long-lasting government formation of 2010 broke the previous record of 2007.

Along with American Human Rights attorneys, Anna Gallagher and Wallie Mason, Mr. La Rue is the founder of the Center for Legal Action for Human Rights (CALDH) and has been involved in the promotion of human rights for over 25 years. He was nominated for (but did not win) the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize by Mairead Corrigan, Northern Irish peace activist and 1976 laureate. Mr La Rue was previously the Executive Director of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Europe. He currently serves as Assistant Director-General for Communication and Information at UNESCO. Biography La Rue was born in Guatemala. Born legally blind, he nevertheless enrolled in and graduated from the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala with a law degree. La Rue served as legal adviser to the Central General de Trabajadores de Guatemala, the country's largest labor federation, from 1975 to 1980, during which time he had occasion to defend numerous labor union personnel and clergymen amid the country's worsening Civil War. He was consequently marked for death, and in 1981 he and his family sought exile in the United States. He served until 1989 as attorney and political analyst for numerous Guatemalan political exiles, including Rigoberta Mench√∫ (1992 Nobel Peace Prize laureate), and in 1990 co-founded the Center for Legal Action for Human Rights (CALDH). LaRue obtained a postgraduate degree in U.S. foreign policy from Johns Hopkins University in 1985. The 1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis, triggered by President Jorge Serrano's self-coup, prompted La Rue to return to his country in 1994, where he reestablished CALDH in Guatemala. CALDH became the first Guatemalan NGO to bring cases of human rights violations to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. La Rue brought the first genocide cases against former Guatemalan military dictatorships by filing charges against General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a in 2000, and against General Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt in 2001; these cases resulted in numerous threats and attacks against CALDH. He directed a news magazine Debate (1998‚Äì2004); hosted numerous radio programs in the U.S. and Guatemala on the subject of political rights; participated in the Migrant Workers Rights Program at the University of Chicago in 2002; served as Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala for President Oscar Berger (2004‚Äì08); as Human Rights Adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala; President of the Governing Board of DEMOS (the Central American Institute for the Study of Social Democracy); and as consultant to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Freedom of expression Frank William La Rue and Maina Kiai at the 26th Session of the Human Rights Council, June 2014 La Rue was appointed UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of expression in August 2008 and served until August 2014. In that capacity, he monitored and exerted his influence on notable civil liberties controversies of the day, including supporting proposed corporate limits on the number of media licenses in Argentina against the opposition of the country's largest media groups, and by indicating in May 2011 that unrestricted and undisturbed access to the Internet is a fundamental human right. He also drew on his personal experience to propose the enactment that November of an international Treaty for the Blind. La Rue later published a report on how state surveillance undermines freedom of expression and illegal monitoring of communication undermines human rights; this report was filed to OHCHR two days before Edward Snowden publicized NSA's warrantless surveillance program in June 2013. Several computers and documents belonging to the Special Rapporteur were stolen from his office located at the DEMOS Institute in Guatemala City on July 31 in as- yet unclear circumstances. In 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave La Rue a Pioneer Award in recognition of his work in support of free expression around the world. Following his term as Special Rapporteur, La Rue was appointed a member of the International Board of Trustees of ARTICLE 19, the Global Campaign for Free Expression in 2015. La Rue has lectured extensively in his fields of expertise, including teaching a seminar on freedom of expression at the American University Washington College of Law's Academy on Human Rights and Humanitarian Law as a visiting scholar in the summer of 2012. La Rue also served as Assistant Director-General of UNESCO, working on freedom of expression and, in particular, press freedom issues.

Vi≈°egrad, whose population according to the 1991 population survey was 62% Bosnian Muslim, was strategically located at a historic crossing point of the River Drina on the main road from Belgrade and U≈æice in Serbia to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. For much of its length the River Drina formed the border between Bosnia and Serbia. The \\"Six Strategic Objectives of the Serbian People in Bosnia\\" drawn up by the Bosnian Serb Presidency and adopted by the breakaway Serb National Assembly on 12 May 1992, envisaged the integration of the Drina Valley with Serbia and necessitated a change in the area's ethnic composition.http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/trans/en/100601IT.htm ICTY Karadzic case, testimony of Dr Robert Donia, transcript 1 June 2010, p. 3097.

The witness, under the pseudonym B-1505, told how forces of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) U≈æice Corps arrived in Vi≈°egrad in April 1992, under the command of Colonel Dragoljub Ojdaniƒá, one of Milosevic's top commanders, and on 13 April 1992 took control of the town before helping to prepare the expulsion of its Muslim population. The witness met Colonel Ojdaniƒá twice. The first time the witness overheard five JNA officers at army headquarters planning the ethnic cleansing of the town's Muslim population; he asked Ojdaniƒá to protect a very large group of refugees whom the JNA then proceeded to concentrate in an area of the town, under threat of being killed by units like Milan Lukiƒá's marauding White Eagles if they ventured outside that area. The second time, as B-1505 was waiting to see Col. Ojdaniƒá at the Vi≈°egrad Hotel, he saw the Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana Plav≈°iƒá arrive with Branimir Savoviƒá (wearing a military camouflage uniform) for talks with the JNA officers. Transcript, 10 September 2001, ICTY Case number IT-98-32-T, the Prosecutor versus Mitar Vasiljevic. The Campaign of Violence against the Bosniaks of Vi≈°egrad On 19 May 1992 the U≈æice Corps officially withdrew from Vi≈°egrad, handing over control of the town to the Serbian Municipality of Vi≈°egrad, under the presidency of Branimir Savoviƒá. The numerous acts of violence perpetrated against the Muslim civilian population in Vi≈°egrad by the Serb police, members of paramilitary groups and local Serbs increased with the departure of the U≈æice Corps. These acts of violence included unlawful arrests and beatings, abductions, rapes, theft and destruction of property, and arbitrary killings. The Drina River was used to dump many of the bodies. Looting and destruction of non-Serb homes and property was widespread and the town's two mosques were destroyed. The town's pre-war population of 21,000 included 13,000-14,000 Muslims. By 1993 there were none left. Atrocities perpetrated throughout the town and the surrounding area, including massacres such as the described by the President of the ICTY as horrific events ranking high \\"in the all too long, sad and wretched history of man‚Äôs inhumanity to man\\", without any sign that the civilian authorities made any sustained attempt to limit or condemn the violent lawlessness of groups such as Milan Lukic's. The ICTY Trial Chamber in the Lukiƒá case found that Milan Lukiƒá was an opportunist who took advantage of an environment in which he could commit crimes against Muslims with impunity. Milan Lukiƒá's allegations In 2005 the Banja Luka daily newspaper Nezavisne Novine announced that it had received a letter from Milan Lukiƒá, then still at large, in which he claimed that his brother had been killed by people who had committed crimes in Vi≈°egrad and were now \\"bosses\\" of Vi≈°egrad and Foƒça, Branimir Savoviƒá, Risto Perisiƒá and Radomir Njegus. Lukiƒá claimed that \\"all Muslims in Vi≈°egrad and Foƒça were killed on their orders\\". He had been working in the police at the beginning of the war under the command of Risto Perisiƒá while Perisiƒá‚Äôs chief was Branimir Savoviƒá. He also alleged that Savoviƒá and Perisiƒá had become rich selling information about mass graves of Muslims to foreigners which they knew about only because they were responsible for burying the victims in the mass graves during the war.

He made early studies of the birds of Pomerania, making collections, and was a staunch anti-Darwinian. Eugen Ferdinand von Homeyer was born in a family belonging to the Prussian nobility. He at first dedicated himself to agriculture on the family farm, with poor health forcing him to drop out of school in Rostock. While on his farm, he began to make scientific observations and establish a collection. In 1840 he married Philippine Ladewig and acquired in 1852 the property Warbelow where he built a landscape park. He sold this after the death of its wife in 1873 and then lived in Stolp, where he dedicated himself to the natural sciences and ornithology. He corresponded with many European ornithologists, and through further collecting and purchase built up an important collection of European bird species. He undertook several expeditions with Alfred Brehm to the Lower Danube. This was made possible through his acquaintance with the Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Homeyer was against the ideas of Charles Darwin and was a firm follower of Georges Cuvier's idea that species were created periodically and some destroyed in catastrophes. From 1883 he began to violently dispute the ideas of others and earned disrepute for his frequent polemics. Homeyer was a founding member of the German Ornithological Society and from 1876 to 1883 their president. On his death his collection of 20,000 bird specimens was given to the Braunschweig Natural History Museum. Eugen von Homeyer wrote over 150 articles on birds and was the first describer of the semi-collared flycatcher and the Cyprus wheatear. His cousin Alexander von Homeyer was also an ornithologist.

Opened in 1888, it forms a major break of gauge junction between standard gauge lines to Milan, Brig and Novara, and a metre gauge line to Locarno. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services on the line to Novara are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. The link with Milan is operated by both Trenitalia and Trenord. Train services on the line to Brig are operated by BLS AG and Swiss Federal Railways, and those on the line to Locarno by the (SSIF).

On 1 June 1906, Domodossola was extended to become an international facility, upon the opening of the Simplon Tunnel and the Brig‚ÄìDomodossola railway that passes through it. The metre gauge connection between Domodossola and Locarno entered service on 27 November 1923. Features The passenger building has a significant architectural fa√ßade, with a string course of Baveno granite and three cornices. Passenger movements The station has about 1.4 million passenger movements each year. Interchange From the bus terminal located near the station there are direct buses to the main municipalities in the Ossola valley, and inter-urban routes to Verbania, Omegna and Milan Malpensa Airport.
