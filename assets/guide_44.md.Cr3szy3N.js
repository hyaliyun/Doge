It was invented in 1958 by Edwin M. and William P. Turner. It is essentially a flat metal plate in a semi- circular or semi-elliptical shape with a wide end at one side and a narrow point at the other. Its shape makes it suited for use on aircraft or space vehicles. It was used for VHF communication on the Apollo command and service module. A U.S. patent was applied for on October 31, 1958, and granted on December 26, 1961. The inventors assigned the patent to the U.S. government, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force.  Use in Apollo Program  Apollo Command/Service Module scimitar antenna The Block II Apollo command and service module carried a pair of elliptical VHF scimitar antennas on the Service Module walls. The antenna's scimitar shape wasn't externally visible, since it had to be covered by a shroud for aerodynamic purposes. The antenna radiated and received signals in an approximately hemispherical pattern, therefore two antennas were necessary to provide full omnidirectional coverage. VHF communication was used for ship-to-ground communication in Earth orbit, and ship-to-ship communication with the Apollo Lunar Module. This was distinct from the unified S-band high-gain antenna used for communication with Earth at lunar distances. The earlier Block I design of the Apollo spacecraft carried the scimitar antennas inside two semicircular strakes attached near the base of the Command Module, which were intended to improve aerodynamic stability during reentry. However, the strakes were found to be unnecessary, and would have been ineffective at high lunar return reentry speeds. Therefore, the strakes were deleted and the antennas were moved to the Service Module in the Block II design used in crewed missions. Apollo 9 LM with forward scimitar antenna visible in the left foreground. The first two Lunar Modules to fly, Apollo 5 and Apollo 9, also carried a pair of VHF scimitar antennas for the transmission of Developmental Flight Instrumentation (DFI) telemetry data. One was located on the front face, just inboard of the right- hand side cockpit window, and the other was located on the left side of the aft equipment bay. Since the Lunar Module never operated in the Earth's atmosphere, no aerodynamic covering was necessary, and the scimitar shape was externally visible. After Apollo 9, the Lunar Module was considered operational, so the DFI and scimitar antennas were not present on subsequent flights.  VHF jamming  Antenna for the AN/ALA-15(V) jammer of a B-52 Military aircraft, typically long-range bombers in the 1960s, may use VHF jamming to disrupt the voice communications of interceptor aircraft. This jamming required broadband, omnidirectional antennas, such as the scimitar. Difficulties in developing the WCLG-3B design of antenna for the AN/ALA-15(V) voice jammer, by Dynalectron Corporation, led to both patented techniques in precision-forming PTFE as dielectric components, and also a notable lawsuit over the termination of the US Government contract to supply them.

It is a black, metallic-looking solid which is formed when silver oxide or silver nitrate, is dissolved in concentrated solutions of ammonia, causing formation of the diammine silver complex which subsequently breaks down to Ag3N. The standard free energy of the compound is about +315 kJ/mol, making it an endothermic compound which decomposes explosively to metallic silver and nitrogen gas. History Silver nitride was formerly referred to as fulminating silver, but this can cause confusion with silver fulminate or silver azide, other compounds which have also been referred to by this name. The fulminate and azide compounds do not form from ammoniacal solutions of Ag2O. Fulminating silver was first prepared in 1788 by the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet.See: * Berthollet (1788) \\"Proc√©de pour rendre la chaux d'argent fulminante\\" (Procedure for making fulminating silver chalk), Observations sur la physique ‚Ä¶ , 32 : 474‚Äì475. * Davis, Tenney L., The Chemistry of Powder And Explosives (Las Vegas, Nevada: Angriff Press, 1998), p. 401. (Originally published in 1941 and 1943 by Wiley of New York, New York.) Properties Silver nitride is poorly soluble in water, but decomposes in mineral acids; decomposition is explosive in concentrated acids. It also slowly decomposes in air at room temperature and explodes upon heating to 165 ¬∞C. Hazards Silver nitride is often produced inadvertently during experiments involving silver compounds and ammonia, leading to surprise detonations. Whether silver nitride is formed depends on the concentration of ammonia in the solution. Silver oxide in 1.52 M ammonia solution readily converts to the nitride, while silver oxide in 0.76 M solution does not form nitride. Silver oxide can also react with dry ammonia to form Ag3N. Silver nitride is more dangerous when dry; dry silver nitride is a contact explosive which may detonate from the slightest touch, even a falling water droplet. It is also explosive when wet, although less so, and explosions do not propagate well in wet deposits of the compound. Because of its long-term instability, undetonated deposits of Ag3N will lose their sensitivity over time. Silver nitride may appear as black crystals, grains, crusts, or mirrorlike deposits on container walls. Suspected deposits may be dissolved by adding dilute ammonia or concentrated ammonium carbonate solution, removing the explosion hazard. Other uses of the term The name \\"silver nitride\\" is sometimes also used to describe a reflective coating consisting of alternating thin layers of silver metal and silicon nitride. This material is not explosive, and is not a true silver nitride. It is used to coat mirrors and shotguns.

The 17th and final named storm of the season, Roslyn developed on October 15 to the south of Mexico. Its movement was initially guided by a ridge to its north, and it became a tropical storm on October 16 and a hurricane a day later. The hurricane reached peak winds of on October 19 before weakening and turning to the northeast. Roslyn ultimately moved ashore near Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa as a minimal hurricane, where it caused minimal damage due to the light population affected. It rapidly dissipated, although the remnants brought precipitation to Texas and other portions of the central and southern United States. There were no fatalities, and reported damage was minor. Meteorological history Hurricane Roslyn on October 19 The final named storm of the season originated from a tropical disturbance that crossed Nicaragua into the eastern Pacific Ocean. With warm waters and increasing cyclonic organization, it developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-Four on October 15 offshore Guatemala. The system moved quickly west-northwestward under the influence of a ridge over Mexico. Quickly intensifying, the depression attained tropical storm status early on October 16; it was given the name Roslyn by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center. An eye became visible on satellite imagery, and by October 17 the storm reached hurricane status, while located about south of Acapulco, Guerrero. As water temperatures remained very warm along its path, the hurricane was able to intensify quickly. Roslyn reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) 48 hours after attaining hurricane status, while located about southwest of Manzanillo, Colima; that made it the strongest hurricane of the season. Roslyn maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours, during which it turned more to the northwest in response to a powerful advancing cold front. On October 20, the hurricane curved northeastward as steady weakening ensued. After bypassing southeast of the Baja California Peninsula, Hurricane Roslyn moved ashore on October 22 at Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). The low-level center rapidly dissipated, although the upper-level circulation continued northeastward along the advancing cold front. A frontal low developed in the western Gulf of Mexico, which moved over southeastern Texas and later through the Mississippi Valley. The original upper-level circulation maintained its northeast movement, bringing rainfall to the southeastern United States. Preparations and impact Rainfall summary of Roslyn Prior to the hurricane's landfall in Mexico, officials in Mazatl√°n executed the evacuation of over 2,000 people in vulnerable coastal areas; such preparations prevented any deaths or injuries. Additionally, the owners of fishing vessels were advised to secure their properties by moving them to a safer area. As a result, only one yacht was sunk during the hurricane, and no major damage was reported by the fishing industry. Prior to moving ashore, Roslyn dropped light rainfall in extreme southern Baja California Sur. On the mainland, precipitation extended to the southeast and northwest of where the hurricane moved ashore; the peak total was to the southeast of Mazatl√°n. The brunt of the storm missed Mazatl√°n, instead affecting a sparsely-populated area. The highest reported winds from a land station were , with gusts to . Roslyn produced some flooding, but no serious damage. Impact was limited to flooded homes and factories, as well as some crop damage and beach erosion. The remnants of Hurricane Roslyn produced heavy rainfall across the central and southern United States. In Matagorda, Texas, a total of was reported, which was the highest rainfall total anywhere along Roslyn's path. The system dropped upwards of in isolated locations of Alabama, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. The outskirts of the remnants of Roslyn brought rainfall to areas still recovering from significant flooding, partially caused by the earlier Hurricane Paine. Clouds from Roslyn began affecting the southern United States a day before it made its original landfall. The storm prompted flash flood watches in southeastern Texas, and the resulting rainfall flooded roadways and streams.

The strikers, many of whom were children and of Irish descent, were seeking a reduction in daily working hours from thirteen and a half hours to eleven hours. Support from other workers in Paterson and nearby cities allowed the strikers to sustain their efforts for two weeks. Employers refused to negotiate with the workers, and were able to break the strike by unilaterally declaring a reduction in work hours to twelve hours daily during the week and nine hours on Saturdays. Many leaders of the strike and their family were blacklisted by employers in Paterson after it ended. Background As the Industrial Revolution got under way, the 1830s were a time of significant labor unrest in the United States. Workers throughout the country had over the previous decade sought to secure shorter working days and higher wages, but many of these efforts and strikes failed. The famous but unsuccessful 1834 Lowell Mill strikes in Lowell, Massachusetts, had garnered widespread public attention and were followed closely by workers in other mill towns. In 1835, construction workers in Boston struck seeking shorter hours. This strike failed as well, despite support from unionists in a number of other cities including Philadelphia, Paterson, and Newark. Inspired by Boston, workers in a number of trades in Philadelphia began a campaign to secure a ten-hour day, and after receiving support from professionals in the city, were almost universally successful. Strike Workers in Paterson hoped to achieve similar success to those in Philadelphia. Just before Independence Day, they began a strike demanding shorter hours. They also demanded an end to the use of fines to enforce discipline in the mills, wage withholding, and the company store system in the town. In support of the strikers, an organization called the Paterson Association for the Protection of the Working Class was established. They also received monetary support from workers in Newark and New York City. The strikers were mainly children, mainly female, and many of them were of Irish descent. Due to this last fact, debate around the strike quickly became infused with nativist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially from the Lowell Intelligencer, a pro-management newspaper. Management refused to meet with the strikers, and as a result workers at other mills began to walk out and join in. At its peak, 2000 workers from 20 mills were participating in the strike. In response, employers reduced hours, not to eleven as the strikers wanted, but to twelve on weekdays and nine on Saturday. This reduction broke the strike, and most of the workers returned to the mills. A few strikers continued to hold out for an eleven-hour day, but unsuccessfully. Strike leaders and their families were permanently barred from employment in Paterson, having been blacklisted by the mill owners. Although the strike was broken, it achieved a significant reduction in work hours. According to historians David Roediger and Philip Foner, \\"...the strike, which added a dozen hours to each worker's weekly leisure, must have been counted a success by the children initiating it.\\" See also * 1835 Philadelphia general strike * 1835 Washington Navy Yard labor strike * 1913 Paterson Silk Strike References Paterson Textile Strike, 1835 Category:1835 labor disputes and strikes Category:Textile and clothing labor disputes in the United States Category:History of youth Category:Child labor in the United States Category:History of Paterson, New Jersey Paterson textile Category:Labor disputes in New Jersey Category:July 1835 events Category:History of the textile industry in the United States ","title":"1835 Paterson textile strike"},{"id":"26162512","text":"Goby Lake is a marine lake located on Koror island in Palau.

As of June 2019, Patch operated some 1,227 hyperlocal news and information websites in 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Patch Media Corporation is the operator of the service.  History  Patch was founded by Tim Armstrong, Warren Webster and Jon Brod in 2007 after Armstrong said he found a dearth of online information on his home-neighborhood of Riverside, Connecticut. The company was acquired by AOL in 2009 shortly after Armstrong became AOL's CEO. Armstrong told AOL staffers that he recused himself from negotiations to acquire the company and did not directly profit from his seed investment. The acquisition occurred on June 11, 2009. AOL paid an estimated $7 million in cash for the news platform as part of its effort to reinvent itself as a content provider beyond its legacy dial-up Internet business. AOL, which split from Time Warner in late 2009, announced in 2010 it would be investing $50 million or more into the startup of the Patch.com network. As part of the acquisition Brod became President of AOL Ventures, Local & Mapping, and Warren Webster became president of Patch. On August 9, 2013, AOL announced it would be laying off staff at all levels. On an all-staff conference call, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong announced that the number of staffed Patch sites would be reduced from 900 to 600. Creative Director Abel Lenz was also publicly fired by Tim Armstrong at that time. On January 15, 2014, AOL spun off Patch and sold majority ownership to Hale Global. With the sale's closure, AOL laid off several hundred more staffers before turning control of Patch over to Hale. In May 2014, the company announced the first profitable quarter in its history. In 2014, Warren St. John became CEO and Executive Editor of Patch. Prior to its 2014 sale, Patch Media came under scrutiny from individuals and the media. Articles in the Los Angeles Times, Business Insider, Forbes and online bloggers pointed out apparent flaws in its previous business model. According to several sources that were published from 2010 to 2012, some of which quoted former employees, working conditions within the organization deteriorated and the company entered a period of consolidation. The sites also faced increased competition from independent blogs. Nonetheless, Tim Armstrong told the Columbia Journalism Review in March 2012 that he still believed in the company. When Editor-in-Chief Brian Farnham resigned in April 2012, Farnham said: \\"I've never worked for a company that has been as scrutinized, criticized, and coal-raked as this one ... You‚Äôd think we were creating toxic waste, instead of, you know, free useful information.\\" In February 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that Patch had 23 million users, was profitable and expanding into new territories. In 2018, Patch completed is third profitable year in a row, attracting an average of 23.5 million unique visitors monthly. Patch employs nearly 150 people, including 110 full-time reporters, many from the nation's leading newsrooms. Alison Bernstein was named CEO in September 2019. Charles Hale informed Recode in 2019 that his network of 1,200-plus hyperlocal sites was generating more than $20 million in annual ad revenue, without a paywall.  Operations  Patch.com sites contain news and human interest stories reported locally. Each site contains a mixture of local and national advertising. The latter includes a self-serve ad platform allowing users to communicate directly with targeted audiences.

Among the other members of this school were Boris Uspensky, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, Mikhail Gasparov, Alexander Piatigorsky, Isaak I. Revzin, and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the semiotics of culture. History The Tartu‚ÄìMoscow School of Semiotics developed an original method of multidimensional cultural analysis. The languages of culture are interpreted as secondary modelling systems in relation to verbal language. This method permits a productive understanding of the use of different languages of culture. This school is widely known for its journal, Sign Systems Studies (formerly published in Russian as –¢—Ä—É–¥—ã –ø–æ –∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–≤—ã–º —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞–º), published by Tartu University Press. It is the oldest semiotics journal in the world, established in 1964. In its first period, the 1960s and 1970s, TMSS followed a structuralist approach and was strongly influenced by Russian formalism. Since the 1980s, its approach can be characterized as post-structuralist (highly dynamic and complex), and is connected with the introduction of Juri Lotman's concept of semiosphere and its relation to organicism. From 1990s, TMSS has been succeeded by the Tartu Semiotics School, which is based in the Department of Semiotics of the University of Tartu and led by Kalevi Kull, Peeter Torop, Mihhail Lotman, and others. Semiotics of Culture The Semiotics of Culture is a research field within general semiotics founded by the Tartu-Moscow School. It originated in the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure, the ideas of Russian Formalism, and the Prague Linguistic Circle, alongside various individual theorists, although the theories developed in the Semiotics of Culture (especially its later iterations) depart radically from these influences. Juri Lotman is considered the main representative of the Semiotics of Culture. Terms central to the semiotics of culture include ‚Äútext,‚Äù ‚Äúmodeling system,‚Äù ‚Äúlanguage,‚Äù Lotman's conception of the ‚Äúsemiosphere,‚Äù and of course ‚Äúculture‚Äù itself. While its ideas were being formulated in the 1960s, an official birth year for the semiotics of culture could be marked as 1973, when Lotman alongside Vjacheslav V. Ivanov, Aleksandr M. Pjatigorskij, Vladimir N. Toporov, and Boris A. Uspenskij first published the manifesto Theses on the semiotic study of cultures (as applied to Slavic texts). The Text, considered the foundational tool of the School, is used to view the boundaries of a material creation, experience, occurrence, etc., particularly those things that are culturally integrated or artistic. With the boundary of content set, the interrelations between it and exterior texts can be more clearly examined. As the boundaries are variable there is no strict definition of how a Text can be made of subject matter, and instead it emphasizes the cultural signification seen in comparing the boundaries of the text to its use in society. A general statement of the research program of the semiotics of culture is that it aims to examine the entire aggregate of sign systems as united by culture, to ascertain their number, their hierarchy, their mutual influence, or their functional correlation, both synchronically and diachronically. Chernov 1988 Lotman 1977 Lotman et al. 1973 Eco Semiosphere The semiosphere is a concept of Juri Lotman's and one that is central to the later semiotics of culture, and as a concept it is given explicit characterization in an article of Lotman's first published in 1984. The semiosphere is the semiotic space outside of which semiosis cannot exist. The semiosphere precedes any individual text or isolated language, it is the ‚Äúgreater system‚Äù outside of which language does not only function, it does not even exist. The principal attribute of the semiosphere is the presence of a boundary, which translates external communications into understandable information.Lotman 2005 The division between the core (completely semioticized) and the periphery (partially semioticized, in constant flux with the asemiotic) is a law of the internal organization of the semiosphere. The semiosphere is an exceptionally dynamic mechanism with synchronic and diachronic dimensions and multiple codes engaging with each other. Chernov 1988 Eco Tartu-Moscow School In the early 1960s and as a result of various summer schools organized in Estonia, the Tartu-Moscow School was established. With Juri Lotman as its main representative, the Tartu-Moscow School developed the tradition of the semiotics of culture. In 1973, Lotman, Vjacheslav V. Ivanov, Aleksandr M. Pjatigorskij, Vladimir N. Toporov, and Boris A. Uspenskij first published the manifesto Theses on the semiotic study of cultures (as applied to Slavic texts), which laid the foundation for the semiotics of culture and represents a milestone for the school. The theoretical origins of the school lie in the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure, the ideas of Russian Formalism, and the Prague Linguistic Circle, alongside other individual theorists, although the theories developed in the semiotics of culture (especially its later iterations) depart radically from these influences. The school is considered one very distinct and innovative branch of general semiotics, and during its development a controversial one. Alongside the five authors mentioned, the school had a broad international membership, and amongst this decentralized constituency there is a great diversity in publications covering a wide variety of topics. A brief timeline may help contextualize: Late 1950s - Moscow mathematical linguistics paves way for cybernetic theories of culture 1960s - Semiotics born out of cybernetics and information theory. \\\\- USSR supported development in linguistics. \\\\- Yuri Lotman's associate Igor Cernov connects Moscow and Estonian intellectuals \\\\- Estonian interest in Structuralism, alongside Tartu support for Russian Studies, makes such crossover easy. The Taru-Moscow School of semiotics was formed when a diverse group of scholars joined informally from the 1950s to 1980s to provide alternatives to the regnant Soviet approaches to language, literature and culture. Their work develops the linguistics of Saussure, elaborated by Trubetzkoi and Hjelmslev. They subsequently came to treat art works and other cultural artifacts as the products of ‚Äòsecondary modelling systems‚Äô, that is, as elements arranged according to rules that could be seen as language-like and hence accessible to analysis by the procedures of structuralist linguistics. Opoyaz, the Moscow Linguistic Circle and the Prague Linguistic Circle the predecessors of TMS The group shared an interest in the Russian formalists and in contemporary linguistics, semiotics and cybernetics. During the 1970s prominent members of the group, such as Iu.M. Lotman and B.A. Uspenskii, turned from more theoretical and formalized work to historical studies of culture as a system of semiotic systems. Lotman: The alumni of Moscow University and Leningrad University formed the Soviet school of semiotics as a synthesis of these two traditions in the humanities. To them, a third tradition was added: the University of Tartu. It was not a mere chance: the University of Tartu had its own, well-established linguistic school, and, moreover, was always characterized by a high spirit of academic tolerance, an openness to all-Europe cultural trends.[ Lotman, Juri. 2016[1982]. Universitet ‚Äì nauka ‚Äì kul‚Äôtura [University ‚Äì science ‚Äì culture]. ‚Äì Lotman, Juri M.; Uspenskij Boris A. Perepiska 1964‚Äì1993. Tallinn: Tallinn University Press, 679‚Äì688.]Chernov 1988 A distinctive feature of TMS was the combination of structuralist and semiotic approaches to language, literature and culture. Salupere, Grishakova Shukman 1978 Lotman 1977 Eco Theses on the semiotic study of cultures (as applied to Slavic texts) Consisting of nine ‚Äútheses,‚Äù the manifesto Theses on the semiotic study of cultures (as applied to Slavic texts) laid the foundation for the semiotics of culture and represents a milestone in the legacy of the Tartu-Moscow School. It was Co-authored by Juri M. Lotman, Vjacheslav V. Ivanov, Aleksandr M. Pjatigorskij, Vladimir N. Toporov, and Boris A. Uspenskij, The first two theses describe the research program of the semiotics of culture, and the third through to the ninth describe various considerations and concepts relevant to culture and its study through the use of the Text as an analytic tool. An condensed and abridged summary could read as follows - Cultures can be studied through semiotic inquiry, as its building blocks are ‚Äútexts‚Äù. Texts are the qualitative tool used to analyze cultures, and many things can be a text. Culture can be considered as a series of texts, a supercode of textuality, or a memory storage pattern utilizing texts. Grishakova/Salupere Kull, Gramigna 2014 Kull 2001 Lotman et al. 1973 Lotman 1977 The paradigmatic shift in Lotman's works of the 1980s (from ‚Äúsigns‚Äù to ‚Äútexts,‚Äù from the binary understanding of meaning to the ‚Äúclusters of meanings‚Äù typical of complex texts) was just a further step in his permanent effort to illustrate tension between the individual-singular and the systemic-holistic. The notion of meaning- generation and amplification and the view on the artistic text as a device that performs a very important and complex work by activating linguistic, cultural, and psychological resources became a key topic in many TMS publications. In a work of art, the creative function of language, its ability to produce new meanings, is especially and intensely felt, thanks to which the text becomes a capacitor of cultural memory: an increase in complexity results from constant re-contextualization and re-reading that amplifies the text's informational richness. The TMS‚Äô initial impetus toward ‚Äúexact knowledge‚Äù in the humanities branched into a whole array of various approaches, developed by the school's participants: bright thinkers whose paths ultimately drifted apart. Their dialogue considerably increased reflection on their own theoretical premises, frameworks, and procedures, yet did not yield a general synthesis. Cultural semiotics Cultural semiotics has developed from linguistic semiotics via text semiotics towards the semiotics of semiosphere. 1st Phase Cultural semiotics started from the realization that in a semiotical sense culture is a multilanguage system, where, in parallel to natural languages, there exist secondary modelling systems (mythology, ideology, ethics etc.), which are based on natural languages, or which employ natural languages for their description or explanation (music, ballet) or language analogization (\\"language\\" of theatre, \\"language\\" of movies). The Soviet semiotics is rooted in tradition developed not by pure linguists, as it has been in Europe, and especially in United States, but also on ideas produced by literary scientists, especially in the OPOYAZ, Moscow Linguistic Circle and other formal and informal groups of the twenties combined both linguistic and literary interests. TMS that developed in sixties sought actively incorporate elements of formalists legacy, but as not a simple revival of formalist. Even in the first volume of Trudy po znakov√µm sistemam (Lectures on structural poetics 1964), Lotman was quite critical to pure formalist statement and methods. 2nd phase The next step is to introduce the concept of text as the principal concept of cultural semiotics (Chernov text as ‚Äúmain hero‚Äù of TMS), since as a term it can denote both a discrete artefact and an invisible abstract whole (a mental text in collective consciousness or subconsciousness). Text and textualisation symbolize the definition of the object of study; the textual aspect of text analysis means the operation with clearly defined sign systems, texts or combinations of texts. The processual aspect of text analysis presupposes definition, construction or reconstruction of a whole. Thus the analysis assembles the concrete and the abstract, the static and the dynamic in one concept‚Äîthe text. 3rd phase Yet the analysis of a defined object is static, and the need to also take into account cultural dynamics led Juri Lotman to introduce the notion of semiosphere. Although the attributes of semiosphere resemble those of text (definability, structurality, coherence), it is an important shift from the point of view of culture's analyzability. Human culture constitutes the global semiosphere, but that global system consists of intertwined semiospheres of different times (diachrony of semiosphere) and different levels (synchrony of semiosphere). Each semiosphere can be analyzed as a single whole, yet we need to bear in mind that each analyzed whole in culture is a part of a greater whole, which is an important methodological principle. It is an infinite dialogue of whole and parts and the dynamics of the whole dimension. See also *Copenhagen‚ÄìTartu school *Prague linguistic circle Literature * Andrews, Edna 2003.

The Hockanum Mill in Rockville / Vernon CT was originally constructed in 1814 by Bingham & Nash. They became a leading manufacturer of satinet. The Hockum Mills in Connecticut was formed in 1836 and constructed a larger mill to produce satinet, a finely woven fabric that resembles satin but is made from wool. They continued to produce satinet until 1869. Satinet was also an important commodity for the people of West Tisbury, MA, on the island of Martha's Vineyard Ma. The Old Mill Pond property in that town was purchased by David Look in 1809 and he converted what was once a grain mill to textile mill. He installed a carding machine to produce woolen yarn and looms for weaving that wool into fabrics called kersey and Satinet. Needing more power than the river itself could provide, Look installed a dam to raise the pond‚Äôs water level. His mill produced Satinet; a waterproof fabric used in whaling and sea-going outerwear. Thomas Bradley bought the property in 1845 and erected a new textile mill which prospered until the 1860s, largely due to the popularity of Satinet‚Äôs use in waterproofing Civil War military uniforms.

He was a reformist scholar who engaged in the modernist intellectual debates that resonated across Arab and Muslim societies in the early 20th century. Disappointed by the lack of education and prosperity of his community under Ottoman rule, he collaborated with other local scholars on interaction with reform movements underway in Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo. By founding the monthly magazine Al-Irfan, he is credited with bringing literary edification and news of scientific innovations to his community and others across the Arab-speaking world. He published a weekly paper, Jabal Amil for a year, wrote several books and established the first printing press in South Lebanon. He promoted education for both sexes in his conservative society and helped female authors by publishing their material under their real names or pseudonyms. He was a pillar in the national Syrian-Arab movement against Ottoman rule in the later years of the Sultanate and resisted the French mandate by advocating independence for Lebanon. He sought educational reforms and the reconciliation of Islamic values with Western ideas of liberty and democracy.  The early years  El-Zein was born in Shhur, South Lebanon on 10 July 1884 (16 Ramadan 1301 a.h.). There were no schools in his village so he was sent to a single-teacher school in a nearby village where he was taught reading, the Koran and basic writing skills. His family moved to Sidon (the third largest city in Lebanon) where he attended the Rushdiya public school for four years. At the age of 11, his father sent him to Nabatiya where he attended Al-Hamidiya religious institution and was schooled in the Arabic language. He was tutored in Turkish and Persian and later studied Islamic Jurisprudence with the scholar Sayed Abd-al-Hussein Sharaf-El-Deen. He returned to Sidon in 1904 where he continued his religious education and took French and English language instruction. He spent his professional life fighting for the rights of the under-privileged in his community and exposing Lebanon's Shi'a to the brewing reformist ideas of the era and the latest innovations in science and technology. He married his cousin Amira Ismail El- Zein in 1904. They had three sons (Adeeb, Nizar and Zayd) and five daughters (Adeeba, Selma, Fatima, May and Azza). He died 13 October 1960 (22 Rabi Al- Thani 1380) while on a visit to the shrine of Imam Ali Al-Rida in Kharasan, Iran. He was buried inside the holy shrine.  Literary Contributions   His Early career  El-Zein worked as a correspondent for several newspapers published in the Lebanese capital Beirut including Thamarat Al-Funoon, Al- Ittihad Al-Othmani, and Hadikat Al-Akhbar.  Al-Irfan  Copies from the collection are available at the Library of Congress and can be requested from the African and Middle Eastern Reading Room, call number: DS36.167 Arab On 5 February 1909, El-Zein published the first issue of Al-Irfan, an Arabic- language monthly \\"Scientific, Historical, Literary and Sociological Review.\\" This introduced the world to the Shi‚Äôa community in Lebanon and farther afield in Iraq and Iran and debated issues of concern to Shi‚Äôa and Arabs. The magazine was printed in Beirut for the first two years. In 1910 El-Zein commissioned his own printing press in Sidon where the monthly was printed until the 1960s. It was published 10 times a year until after the death of the founder‚Äôs son Nizar Al-Zein in 1981. Afterwards, it was published quarterly until 1987 and then resumed between 1992 and 1996. In his publication for the Center for Lebanese Studies at Oxford \\"Aspects of Shi‚Äôi Thought From the South of Lebanon,\\" Chibli Mallat says the magazine \\"epitomized an era and an area,\\" taking advantage of the 1908 Ottoman constitutional revolution and a \\"new atmosphere of freedom of expression started in Istanbul.\\" He posited that the contributors to the magazine and the debates played out within its pages \\"reflected, and to an extent shaped, history to come,\\" as Al-Irfan became the \\"point of convergence\\" for the Shi'a writers on politics and social affairs. Its influence can be seen in Lebanese Shi'a political and religious writings throughout the twentieth century.  Other publications  In addition to the numerous articles (literary, fiction, political and religious) and poetry that he published in his monthly journal and in a weekly paper Jabal Amil that he published from 28 December 1911 to 5 December 1912. He wrote: * A book: Tarikh Saida (The history of Sidon) in 1913. * A book: Mukhtasar Tarikh Al- Shi‚Äôa (A Brief History of the Shi‚Äôa) in 1914. * A short story, Al-Hub al- Sharif (Honest Love ‚Äì A Literary Ethical Love Story) in 1921. He also edited and published: * Al-Wasata Bayn Al-Mutanabi wa Khosomoh (The Mediation between Al-Mutanabi and his Opponents). * Majma‚Äô Al-Bayan Fi Tafseer Al-Quran (The Confluence of Knowledge in the Interpretation of the Quran).  His Struggle Against Occupations and Work for Independence  El-Zein participated in several underground Arab societies, such as Al-‚ÄòAhid, Al-Islah, and the Al- Shabiba Al-Arabiya, opposing Ottoman rule and working for the independence of Arab nations. He supported the first Arab Congress held in Paris in 1913 seeking to reform the Ottoman Empire and open Arabs under Ottoman rule to modern civilization. In October 1914, he was chosen as Sidon‚Äôs regional representative of Jami‚Äôyat Al-Thawra Al-Arabiya (The Society for Arab Revolution), which merged with Al-Jami‚Äôya Al-Lamarkaziya (Decentralization Society). He became responsible for recruiting members for the organization. His home and printing press became a hub for its activities, which led to his arrest and imprisonment by Ottoman authorities. He was released after a short detention but had to retreat to his farm in south Lebanon and abandoned Al- Irfan for a period of six years. El-Zein opposed the 1920 French mandate of Lebanon under the League of Nations and participated in a national conference in Beirut in support of the Syrian Revolt. In 1925, the French authorities detained him briefly for his support of the Syrian Revolt. Continuing his resistance to the mandate authorities, he participated in several anti- occupation conferences and demonstrations. On 3 September 1936 he received a two-month jail sentence after a peaceful demonstration in front of the Government House in Sidon. During the Second World War, he moved to his farm in the south of Lebanon and Al-Irfan ceased publication from 1942‚Äì1945.  His Reformist Ideology  Like Mohamed Abdou, the leading Egyptian intellectual reformist at the end of the 19th century, El-Zein rejected the prevailing practices that confined himself and his community to act within the limitations of religious and cultural views propagated by elites and believed in openness to other religions, cultures, and scientific ideas. Troubled by regional ignorance, political and administrative corruption, and the stagnancy of traditional religious thought, he sought to spread knowledge and promote natural sciences. He used his writings, his influence as a member in several cultural and political organizations, and participation in public forums to promote new ideas and trends in thought.  Education  El-Zein considered learning and training as the only route for the East to reach intellectual and political liberty. He called for the adoption of a free-thinking pedagogy instead of the approach of rote memorization prevalent in traditional Islamic culture and current French practices. He stressed the importance of training and sports and advocated \\"exploring the powers of the brain\\" and developing them through \\"scientific principles.\\" He preferred the Anglo-Saxon educational approach because of its promotion of the practical as opposed to the French.  Adoption of Western Values  El-Zein rejected blind imitation of the West but encouraged informed choices of those ideals and values that could fit easily with conservative Muslim society. He worked to overcome the weakness and ignorance that kept his community from adapting necessary innovations from the West.  Women‚Äôs Status  El-Zein believed that a major cause of backwardness and poverty in the Muslim community was tied to home life and the condition of women. He saw the cure in educating them especially since they were essential to making their children productive members of society. So Al- Irfan included a special-women‚Äôs corner that covered the lives and tribulations of accomplished women throughout history. He encouraged female writers, corresponding with them and publishing their works. He emphasized the importance of women participating in all disciplines of education including science and medicine. Favoring the moderate approach of covering the hair but not the face to the controversial issue of veiling, El-Zein devoted extensive space in his journal to its discussion. Paralleling the thoughts of other Muslim progressives of the time in their opposition to polygamy, he emphasized the condition set in Islamic jurisprudence of fair treatment that a man can never treat more than a woman equally.  Religious Reconciliation  Like other reformists of the era, El-Zein called for a return to the true spirit of religion with its teachings of good conduct and brotherhood. He considered all religions to be one in essence and origin even if they differed in presentation and practice. He supported the pan-Islamic movement of the era calling for unity among Muslim sects and encouraging Jami‚Äôyat Al-Taqrib Bayn Al-Mathahib Al-Islamiya (Association For Drawing Together Muslim Sects). At the time, his moderate and reconciliatory attitudes drew criticism from some Muslim and Christian personalities. Fiery media debates ensued between him and his supporters and the Local Jesuits (Al-Basheer newspaper and Father Louis Sheikho writing in Al-Mashrik), the Orientalist Jesuits (Father Henri Lammens in Al-Mashrik journal), and Sunni Muslims (Rashid Rida, a disciple of Muhammad Abduh, in his Al-Manar paper). These debates, often intense, reflected a changing social and intellectual environment as different thinkers sought to identify a common ground at a time when the region was undergoing major political and intellectual changes.  Economics and Politics  El-Zein stressed the importance of economic independence for Arabs and was conscious of the need of his country to build factories in order to achieve self- sufficiency and economic independence as shown in an article he wrote for The Ottoman Union newspaper entitled \\"Factories, Factories ‚Äì How Can We Be So Slow to Build.\\" To him, no society could prosper without utilizing all its national resources and stimulating the agricultural and industry sectors. Politically, El-Zein lived through three regimes: Ottoman, French mandate, and independence. He opposed the Ottomans and the French despite inducements by both to recruit him to their side. Reportedly, the French tried to lure him with offers of the position of education minister and modern printing equipment, which he refused. After independence as corrupting political power began influencing emerging leaders, he preferred to stay on the sidelines pushing for progress and helping the under-privileged in his community. He believed in Arab nationalism and belonged to several secret societies that opposed the Ottomans. He participated in conferences that propagated Syrian unity, which he believed would be a prelude to Arab unity as the \\"realistic and encompassing\\" future for Arabs. He strongly condemned the Balfour Declaration. He saw the 1948 Arab defeat and the establishment of Israel as severe blows which brought shame on the Arab nation with a loss of dignity rooted in the complacency of its leaders, and a lack of national awareness among its people.  Language, Journalism  El-Zein was adamant about the proper use of the classical standard Arabic language, calling for its proper use in all instances including poetry. His advocacy sprang from a nationalist belief that protecting the language was a prelude to advancing and protecting the Arab identity. He believed that nation that \\"did not take care of its language was putting itself at the risk of extinction.\\" Journalism to El-Zein was a mission of reform with political, educational, and religious aspects. His repeated confrontations with authorities underline his commitment to the critical and scrutinizing role of the press as he understood and practiced it.

It was called the fire community's \\"crystal ball,\\" by Tom Harbour, Director of Fire and Aviation Management for the USDA Forest Service.Address by Tom Harbour before the International Association of Fire Chiefs Conference, March 26, 2009 The QFR is not a policy or decision document, nor does it contain specific recommendations. Its purpose is to stimulate thought and discussion within the wildfire community about how the nation can best prepare for future wildfire seasons. According to the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), the QFR \\"was designed as a strategic evaluative process that develops an internal assessment of capabilities of current programs and resources in comparison to future needs for fire management.\\" Written by Don Artley, January 2009, in IAFC newsletter, article titled, \\"Quadrennial Fire Review.\\" The QFR is published every four years. The first QFR was completed in 2005 and the second published in January 2009 by the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho; and the National Advanced Fire Research Institute in Tucson, Arizona. It is modeled on the Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2009 QFR was developed by fire experts from federal, state local and tribal organizations, plus assistance from non-governmental organizations and the research and academic communities. The overall effort was coordinated through the Brookings Institution. The QFR is not reviewed or approved by any government entity. It is meant to be an independent and objective document, free from political or agency influence. The QFR's projections of future conditions extend to a 10-to-20 year time frame, while the strategies for how to prepare for those future conditions is defined in a four-to-five-year period. The QFR looks at trends and makes forecasts about what will need to change within the fire community to deal with future challenges. Among the notable forecasts in the 2009 QFR are: *Climate change will produce longer fire seasons, with the potential of burning in the United States by the year 2014. Also, wildfire will affect more geographic regions than in the past, specifically the Northeast and Great Lakes areas, which generally have been considered at low-risk. Alaska's fire vulnerability will increase, as well, as warmer temperatures dry out vegetation. *The current drought cycle might last another 25 years, creating more stress on vegetation and contributing to a higher number of fires and more volatile fire behavior. *Growth will slow in populated areas prone to wildfire (often called the \\"wildland-urban interface\\" or WUI), but they will still be at high risk from wildfires. *Fire agency budgets will be strained by increasing demands, rising costs and falling government revenues. *The concept of \\"protecting all communities at all costs\\" should transition to \\"fostering self-reliance and increasing resiliency.\\" The education focus should shift toward more self-reliance and accountability, producing \\"fire-adapted communities.\\" *Social networking will become the most effective means of informing and educating the public about fire, as traditional media and informational techniques continue to decline in popularity. The 2009 QFR also outlines an integrated fuels management plan that would help ensure that fuels treatment investments are tied more closely to land stewardship objectives. It also suggests that small-scale fuels treatments (prescribed burning, mechanical removal of brush, thinning, chemical treatments, and so forth) are not as effective as larger, landscape- scale treatments in terms of ecosystem health. The 2005 QFR was prescient. For example, it predicted a significant increase in the number and costs of wildfires, dramatic changes in weather, accelerated WUI growth, and continued fuel build-ups. All of these forecasts proved correct. More than 100 people participated in developing the 2009 version of the QFR. The next QFR is scheduled for publication in 2012.

Contents Swords of the Daimyo contains three adventures. The first adventure is for player characters (PCs) levels 6‚Äì10, and takes Western AD&D; characters on a sea voyage to Kozakura (the Oriental Adventures version of Japan). The adventure includes a system for calculating the chances of a crew mutiny. When the PCs arrive in Kozakura, the module states that \\"it is likely that one or more will be permanently slain\\", with the intention of replacing said characters with new Eastern characters. The other two adventures in the module are designed for Oriental Adventures characters, and revolve around the nefarious activities of the sohei (militant clerics) of the Black Temple. One of these adventures involves the defense of a village against bandits, and the other is a mission to take out the organizer of the bandits. These two adventures form a linked package, separated by time and a few character levels. This campaign and adventure pack provides an overview of the politics and climate of the lands of Kozakura. After a brief overview of Kozakura, the pack focuses on the province of Miayama, and its government, samurai families, temples and landholdings. The package also includes a list of names and maps of various residences found in the province. Swords of the Daimyo gives the continent map of the world presented in the original Oriental Adventures, and details an entire province and gives a background for one of the five major divisions of the world. Publication history OA1 Swords of the Daimyo was written by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook with Kelley Foote and published by TSR in 1986, and included a thirty two page gazetteer called Province Book of Miyama and a thirty two page \\"Adventure Book\\", with a large color map and an outer folder. The module featured cover and interior art by Jeff Easley.Cook, David \\"Zeb\\". Swords of the Daimyo (TSR, 1986) It was the first module made for use with Oriental Adventures. The Province book describes the Eastern continent of Kara-Tur, the province of Miyama, and the island of Kozakura. The module includes a historical timeline for Kozakura, as well as new monsters. Reception Ashley Shepherd reviewed Swords of the Daimyo for White Dwarf No. 80, and felt that the module provides more than enough material to run an Oriental Adventures campaign, and could easily be reworked for the Bushido role-playing game. Shepherd compared the sea voyage adventure to the novel Sh≈çgun, and suggested that dungeon masters (DMs) should borrow the crew mutiny system for sea adventures. He noted that several of the possible encounters in the adventure are too deadly for 6th level characters, and felt that the other two adventures were fine, although the link between them was nearly non- existent. Shepherd said the \\"real strength\\" of the module was the background material given in the Province Book of Miyama, forming a comprehensive location a DM can use as \\"a good starting point for any number of adventures\\". Shepherd also liked the random encounters system. Although he felt that there were weak points, such as the maps not being up to standard, the small number of adventures, and the frustration caused by their slightly disjointed nature, Shepherd concluded that Swords of the Diamyo was \\"a good module package\\". The module won a Gamer's Choice award. Michael Mullen reviewed the adventure in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 81. He felt that the module is necessary to running the campaign of the world presented in the original Oriental Adventures, and that the module \\"is worth looking at also for the method of approach to detailing a province\\". Mullen concluded that \\"The initial module, Swords of the Daimyo provides a large province and several other worth while items for the DM, and three loosely connected mini-adventures. The first is a means of getting a set of traditional characters to the new area of their world. The second is a raid on a peasant village (shades of the Seven Samurai) although there is some confusion as to how many bad guys are doing the raiding. The third adventure is for the characters when they gain more experience, presumably by exploring the rest of the province. [...] This gives the party a chance to avenge the village humiliated in the second adventure and explore a temple at the same time.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed Swords of the Daimyo for Dragon magazine No. 134 in June 1988. Bambra likened Kozakura to a fantasy version of feudal Japan, stating that it closely resembles \\"the war- torn period of Japanese history between the Kamakura and Sengoku periods, when rival daimyos engaged in bloody struggles for power\\".

The collection comprises 300 years of cuckoo clock-making history, since the very earliest examples made in the 18th to the 21st century.  Establishment and foundational reasons  The museum was set up in 1990 by brothers Roman and Maz Piekarski after bringing together a collection of antique Black Forest cuckoo clocks that has been continuously increased ever since. Both men were trained as clockmakers in Manchester from the age of 15, which is when their fascination with these timepieces began. It became apparent to them that an important part of European clock-making history was liable to disappear if surviving examples fell into irretrievable disrepair.Cuckoo Land saved in nick of time, Manchester Evening News, 9 January 2006. Their guiding principles have always been to purchase objects only of the highest museum quality and which held an important significance in the historical development of cuckoo timekeeping. In Roman Piekarski's own words: When we started collecting in the 1970s no one wanted them because battery and electric clocks were all the rage. We picked many up for next to nothing.Richard Webber, Meet Britain's most obsessive collectors, Daily Express, 6 April 2015  The collection  Antique cuckoo clocks exhibited in the museum. In the past, the exhibition also included other kind of timepieces such as longcase, wall and bracket clocks but now focuses on c. clocks especially.Thefreelibrary.com. It's the time to go cuckoo The museum also hosts a range of Black Forest cuckoo and quail clocks, trumpeter clocks, monks playing bells and other associated musical movements. Cuckooland has nowadays more than 700 cuckoo clocks on display of different styles, sizes, manufacturers and ages. Many of the timekeepers are very rare and the collection contains the best examples of the cuckoo clockmaker‚Äôs art: * They have a \\"cuckoo and echo\\" clock that emulates the whistles and bellows the bird makes in the wild and is thought to be one of only six in the world.Summer drives clock man cuckoo, BBC News, 28 March 2002. * The museum also displays many timepieces made by Johann Baptist Beha, one of the most reputed, innovative and creative Black Forest clockmaker of all times. * Examples in Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts and other unusual styles. * Other rarities include; picture frame cuckoo clocks, several timepieces with a life size automaton cuckoo bird on top of the case, models combined with paintings of people or animals with blinking or flirty eyes, etc. * Designer cuckoo clocks, a series of avant-garde 21st-century creations autographed by foremost international designers such as (in alphabetical order): Christie Bassil, Lorenzo Damiani, Mattia Cimadoro, Raffaele Darra and Riccardo Paolino & Matteo Fusi.  Research and conservation  Some of the clocks displayed at the cuckooland museum. Throughout the years, the attendance of the two brothers at clock fairs and auctions, the purchasing of specialized bibliography, trips, the internet, their own research, etc., have led them to acquire many of the clocks, gaining experience and knowledge on the subject. They document all of the aspects related to every piece of the collection in terms of: age, history, manufacturer, style, technical aspects and provenance. One of the aims of the museum is to restore and preserve the most unusual, outstanding and unusual exemplaries to be enjoyed by future generations, as well as to contribute to the appreciation and estimation of this timepiece through its importance in horology and historic significance in the Western culture.

Variations  There are different kinds of cosmetic primers such as foundation primer, eyelid primer, lip primer, and mascara primer. A foundation primer may work like a moisturizer, or it may absorb oil with salicylic acid to aid in creating a less oily, more matte appearance.What is a Foundation Primer? And Do I Need it? Some contain antioxidants such as A, C, and E, or other ingredients such as grape seed extract and green tea extract. There are water-based and silicon-based foundation primers. Ingredients may include cyclomethicone and dimethicone. Some primers do not contain preservative, oil or fragrance. Some may also have sun protection factor (SPF). Some foundation primers are tinted to even out or improve skin tone or color. Others give a pearlized finish to make the complexion more light reflective. There are also foundation primers which are mineral-based primers, which contain mica and silica. Eyelid or eye shadow primers are similar, but made specifically for use near the eyes. An eyelid primer may help even the color of the lid and upper eye area, may reduce oiliness, may add shimmer, or inversely may mattify. Eye primers aid in the smooth application of eye shadow, prevent it from accumulating in eyelid creases, and improve its longevity. Eye shadow primers are applied to the eyelid and lower eye area prior to the application of eye shadow. They even out the skin tone of the eyelids hide eyelid veins, and smooth out the skin of the eyelids. Eye shadow primers help with the application of eye shadows. They intensify the color of the eye shadows and keep them from smearing or creasing by reducing the oiliness of the lids. Some eye shadows even state in the instruction sheet, that they are recommended for usage over the eye shadow primer. There is a real difference in the eye shadow color and time of wear when it is used over the primer on bare skin. The effect of eye shadow primers is not limited to eye shadows. They also work for eye liners and eye shadow bases. Mascara primer is sometimes colorless. It usually thickens and/or lengthens the lashes before the application of mascara for a fuller finished look. It may also help keep mascara from smudging or flaking, and some claim to improve the health of the lashes. Lip primers are intended to smooth the lips and help improve the application of lipstick or lip gloss, although exfoliating the lips is often recommended before applying. They also are intended to increase the longevity of lip color, and to prevent lipstick from \\"feathering\\", that is, smearing past the lip vermilion, and especially from migrating into any fine lines around the lips.

It has a subsonic speed up to with a range of 1.6 km and carries a 106 mm HEAT warhead. Introduction In 1959, India started a feasibility study on a First Generation Anti Tank Missile (ATM). New General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQR) were issued and the task of preliminary study and wind testing was assigned to Department of Aeronautics and Institute of Science, Bangalore. Development In 1962, DRDO was granted to begin work on developing an Anti- Tank missile due to conflict with China in Ladakh. It has a range of 500 meters to about 2 km. After the first aerodynamic design was completed, a full-scale model of the complete configuration was tested in a wind tunnel at IISc Bangalore. At Bangalore, this model was tested for the force and momentum tests which were completed in 1961. Vibrating spoilers were used during these tests to determine control effectiveness. The ATM was designed to have a subsonic flight speed of about 90 m/s (300 ft/s). In 1963, the entire design was reworked for accommodating 106 mm HEAT warheads in the ATM. Propulsion Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), a DRDO lab, determined the propulsion motor requirement and designed the propulsion system. The propulsion motor was made of aluminium alloy. It had two compartments, one for the sustainer and the other for the booster. Explosives Research & Development Laboratory (ERDL), another DRDO laboratory, made the propellant compositions and also developed the SUK black propulsion grains. Molybdenum inserts were used as sustainer. The booster grain had star type hole for very fast burn and the sustainer was cigarette burning type for constant thrust. Control and Guidance The actuator and gyroscope were the main components of the control and guidance system of the ATM. The Actuators were spoiler type, (similar to Mosquito (missile)), which gave a response time of 10 millisecond with a stay time varying from 80-20 and 20-80 milliseconds. The gyroscope developed for the ATM was a three degree freedom gyroscope. Testing The missile was test-fired near Imarat, a village on the outskirts of Hyderabad, which held the reliability order of 65%. The test trials were attended by Gen Bewoor, then Deputy Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army. The missile was tested 16 times and hit its target 14 times. Two Indian army teams which were trained on European ATMs, Cobra and ENTAC, carried out the tests. These test did not reveal any significant difference between firing the European and indigenous ATMs. Work was still to be done on inhibition of the sustainer motor. Termination After waiting for more than 10 years without any results, in 1969 ATM project was terminated as the Indian Army revised its General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQR). The new GSQR extended the range of the missile from 1.6 km to 3 km. They also required the previously man-portable missile to be capable of being mounted and fired from a mobile-launcher. This led to production of SS11B1 at Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), Hyderabad under license from France.

Career Wulnikowski began with football in his hometown at the Polish club Zawisza Bydgoszcz. In 1990, he entered the youth division of the FC Schalke 04. In 1997, he was promoted to the second team of the club and played in the Oberliga Westfalen. In 1999, he joined the third division team 1. FC Union Berlin. At Union Berlin, Wulnikowski was initially substitute goalkeeper behind Kay Wehner (Saison 1999‚Äì2000) and Sven Beuckert (2000‚Äì2002). In 2001, Union was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga without Wulnikowski playing a single league match. In the 2000‚Äì01 DFB-Pokal quarter-final against VfL Bochum, Wulnikowski came on after 30 minutes for an injured Beuckert. Union Berlin won that match and succeeded in reaching the final (0‚Äì2 against Schalke 04). After the dismissal of longtime coach Georgi Vasilev in October 2002 and the commitment of coach Mirko Votava, Wulnikowski became first-choice goalkeeper For Union Berlin. By the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, after the club was relegated as next to last in the table again, Wulnikowski had completed a total of 54 second-division games for the club. Wulnikowski moved then to Rot-Weiss Essen for an unknown transfer fee. At the beginning of the season, Wulnikowski was in the starting squad, but made an error in the first match. From matchday three on, coach J√ºrgen Gelsdorf replaced him with Ren√© Renno. At the end of the season, Rot- Weiss Essen was relegated and the contract with the goalkeeper cancelled. In 2005, Wulnikowski subsequently joined VfR Aalen in the Regionalliga S√ºd. He completed two seasons as first-choice goalkeeper there. In April 2007, Wulnikowski announce his move to league rivals Sportfreunde Siegen. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, he was first-choice goalkeeper for Siegen. At the beginning of the 2008‚Äì09 season, he moved to the third division club Kickers Offenbach. In the 2009‚Äì10 winter break, he extended his contract for another three years until the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. On 27 October 2010, he became nationwide famous for his fantastic match in the 2010‚Äì11 DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund, in which he saved two penalties and single-handedly destroyed Dortmund's several other good goal chances. Offenbach won the match 4‚Äì2 after Penalty shootout and moved on to round three. He left Offenbach at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, after they were relegated from the 3. Liga. After six months without a club, he signed for RB Leipzig II for half a season, before joining W√ºrzburger Kickers in July 2014. In June 2017, Wulnikowski ended his professional career and became goalkeeping coach for W√ºrzburger Kickers.

The show took place on June 13, 2008 in Mexico City, Mexico. The show was available on pay-per-view (PPV) in Mexico, the first Tripleman√≠a show to be offered on PPV. The main event featured a singles match for the AAA Mega Championship. Champion Cibern√©tico defended against El Zorro. The show also featured the surprise return of Silver King, who teamed up with Chessman and La Parka, only to lose to La Legi√≥n Extranjera (Bobby Lashley, Electroshock and Kenzo Suzuki) in the semi-main event of the show. The show also included a hardcore match between Vampiro and El Mes√≠as, as well as a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", where sisters Faby Apache and Mari Apache both put their hair on the line for the match. The show include four additional matches. Production Background Cibern√©tico reigning AAA Mega Champion going into the event. In early 1992 Antonio Pe√±a was working as a booker and storyline writer for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to lucha libre. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for \\"Assistance, Assessment, and Administration\\"). After making a deal with the Televisa television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992. The following year Pe√±a and AAA held their first Tripleman√≠a event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's Super Bowl event, similar to the WWE's WrestleMania being the biggest show of the year. The 2009 Tripleman√≠a was the 16th year in a row AAA held a Tripleman√≠a show and the 21st overall show under the Tripleman√≠a banner. Up until Tripleman√≠a XVI, the Tripleman√≠a shows were taped for television broadcast, televised weeks after the show as part of AAA's regular television series. Tripleman√≠a XVI was the first AAA show to also be offered as a pay- per-view (PPV) service on Mexican PPV channels. While PPV broadcasts of major events was common in the United States, going back to the mid-1980s, Mexican wrestling promotions only intermittently offered PPV options for their major shows prior to 2008. In subsequent years Tripleman√≠a shows would be offered on PPV in Mexico and, for some events, outside of Mexico via internet or US PPV options. The 2008 Tripleman√≠a show ran live against Mexican rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) Infierno en el Ring (\\"Inferno in the ring\\") major event. Both Tripleman√≠a and Infierno en el Ring were held in Mexico City, Tripleman√≠a at the approximately 20,000 seat Palacio de los Deportes arena while Infierno en el Ring was held at the 16,500 seat Arena M√©xico. The special entrance set, complete with large video walls and decorations, constructed specifically for Tripleman√≠a XVI and the PPV production set up reportedly cost three million pesos ($290,000) and took 150 workers to prepare. Tickets for the event ranged from 150 pesos ($14.50) to 950 pesos ($92.02) for ringside seats. El Economista reported that 406 police officers, spread out over 52 units, provided security for the event. Storylines Bobby Lashley, brought to Mexico specifically for the show. The Tripleman√≠a XVI show featured a total of seven professional wrestling matches with where some wrestlers were involved scripted feuds. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. AAA Mega Champion Cibern√©tico and challenger El Zorro had been rivals for almost a year prior to Tripleman√≠a XVI, starting when both Cibern√©tico and El Zorro targeted then AAA Mega Champion El Mes√≠as. The championship feud build from the overarching AAA storyline featuring La Legi√≥n Extranjera (\\"The Foreign Legion\\") fighting against the Mexicans representing AAA. El Mes√≠as, from Puerto Rico, was one of the major figures in La Legi√≥n Extranjera, teaming with US representative Sean Waltman and Japanese wrestler Kenzo Suzuki in the main event of Tripleman√≠a XV. The trio lost to Los Hell Brothers (Cibern√©tico, Charly Manson and Chessman). In September 2007 Los Hell Brothers teamed up with El Zorro to wrestle against the Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Escoria, Dark Espiritu and Dark Ozz) in the main event of the 2007 Verano de Esc√°ndalo show. Zorro escaped early on in the match leaving his team at a disadvantage. After Los Hell Brothers won the match a man came to the ring wearing the \\"iron mask\\" but that turned out to be Konnan. When Zorro appeared on the scene moments later he turned on the tecnicos, attacking them with a kendo stick. After the show Zorro claimed that he was shown the light; he was actually a Spaniard, not Mexican, and was against the Mexican contingent in AAA. Joining Konnan's La Legi√≥n Extranjera. After Zorro's turn the story was that Konnan considered El Zorro his \\"main man\\", the two even turned on El Mes√≠as and La Secta del Mes√≠as when El Mes√≠as did not want to grant Zorro a title match. The storyline lead to a three-way world title match between Zorro, El Mes√≠as and Cibern√©tico at Guerra de Titanes (\\"War of the Titans\\"). During the match Cibern√©tico received second and third burns to his back after La Legi√≥n put him through a table on fire (Cibern√©tico was legitimately injured, it was not planned). A few weeks later, the storyline continued as El Zorro and the rest of La Legi√≥n Extranjera attacked and \\"injured\\" El Mesias during a show. The storyline was done partially to cover up the fact that El Mesias was returning Puerto Rico, as well as to help establish El Zorro as a top rudo in AAA. At the 2008 Rey de Reyes (\\"King of Kings\\") El Zorro won the Rey de Reyes tournament, while Cibern√©tico finally defeated El Mes√≠as to win the AAA Mega Championship. With his victory in the Rey de Reyes tournament El Zorro also earned a championship match at Tripleman√≠a XVI. The original plan for the main event was to have AAA promoter Joaqu√≠n Rold√°n at ringside for the match, but the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission would not allow it because he was not a licensed active competitor and the plan included Rold√°n getting physically involved. Another featured match of Tripleman√≠a XVI was a long-running \\"family feud\\" between sisters Mari Apache and Faby Apache that also included their father, Gran Apache, Faby's husbandBilly Boy their son Marvin \\"Apache\\". The storyline started out in 2005 with Billy Boy approaching the ring when Faby Apache was in a match. He usually carried flowers with him, and at times even carrying signs where he professed his love. The two had dated for years in real life prior to the storyline, and had in fact gotten married around the same time, writing their real life relationship into a storyline. The problems began when Faby Apache's father, Gran Apache, objected to the relationship and attacked Billy Boy because he was not \\"worthy\\" of his daughter, he was not tough enough for Gran Apache's liking. The Family feud stretched out for several years and even had the birth of Faby and Billy Boy's son Marvin incorporated into the storyline. The feud saw Gran Apache defeat Billy Boy in a match where he would be forced to not have anything to do with either Faby Apache or his son. Following the loss the storyline was that Billy Boy was so depressed that he caused his team Los Barrio Boys to lose several matches, this in turn, led to Alan and Decnnis turning on Billy Boy, taking Gran Apache's side in the storyline. On May 28, 2008 Faby Apache defeated Ayako Hamada and Mari Apache to win the 2008 Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, moving the storyline onto focusing on Faby and her older sister Mari Apache, who chose to side with her father in the storyline. The two sisters agreed to put their hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", at Tripleman√≠a XVI. One of the featured storylines that was supposed to culminate at Tripleman√≠a XVI focused on the internal struggles of a rudo group known as Los Vipers, initially between Los Vipers leader Abismo Negro and Black Abyss, a wrestler using a very similar ring character. Initially, it was believed that the Black Abyss character was introduced due to rumors of Abismo Negro jumping to CMLL or to cover several no-shows. During that time Mr. Niebla had begun challenging Abismo Negro's position as the leader of Los Vipers, backing Black Abyss in the feud. At the 2008 Rey de Reyes show Abismo Negro lost due to interference from Black Abyss. The tension led to Abismo Negro and Mr. Niebla physically fightighting each other over the leadership, wrestling in matches where the Los Vipers leadership was on the line. Abismo Negro won the matches, but each time AAA head booker Joaqu√≠n Roldan announced that the decision had been overturned for various reasons. After the second match the rest of Los Vipers turned on Abismo Negro and kicked him out of the group, making Mr. Niebla their leader instead. The storyline was supposed to end in a Luchas de Apuestas match between Niebla and Negro at Tripleman√≠a XVI. Later on the match was changed to a multi-man steel cage match including all of Los Vipers (Mr. Niebla, Black Abyss, Psicosis II and Histeria) and Abismo Negro with the last person in the cage being forced to unmask A few days before the show the steel cage match as canceled with AAA claiming that Abismo Negro had suffered a neck injury. Event Kenzo Suzuki, part of La Legi√≥n Extranjera For the opening match Laredo Kid was originally scheduled to be part of the match, but for unexplained reasons did not work the match, leaving his fellow Real Fuerza A√©rea (\\"Royal Air Force\\") members Aero Star, El √Ångel, and Super Fly one man short as they faced off against The Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Escoria, Dark Espiritu and Dark Ozz). Mr. Niebla was originally scheduled to compete in the second match of the night, but instead, he quit AAA, and made his CMLL return at Infierno en el Ring that same night. Later on Mr. Niebla later stated that he left AAA because the big mask vs. mask match he was promised fell through as Abismo Negro was unable to work the Tripleman√≠a match. Histeria replaced Mr. Niebla in the six-man tag team match where Los Vipers lost to Alan Stone, Octag√≥n, and Brazo de Plata when Octag√≥n pinned Histeria. In the fourth match of the night sisters Faby and Mari Apache squared off, fighting each other with their hair on the line. Billy Boy was on the corner of his wife Faby Apache, while Gran Apache was in Mari Apache's corner for the match. The match ended with Faby Apache pinning her older sister Mari Apache. A visibly emotional Gran Apache entered the ring before Mari Apache got her hair shaved off, pleading with the officials and the crowd to have HIS hair shaved off instead, pleading for his family to reunite. As Gran Apache had his hair shaved off the Apache sisters put their differences aside, hugging their father, with Billy Boy joining in moments later, calling a truce to the long- running feud. According to AAA, the fifth match of the night, a hardcore match, had a fifteen-minute time limit imposed on it by the Mexico City boxing and wrestling federation, despite such matches normally not having a time limit. The added stipulation allowed AAA to have Vampiro and El Mes√≠as, within having a conclusive winner of the match, allowing them to extend the feud. The two were fighting on the outside of the ring when the time expired, resulting in a draw. For the semi-final match a wheelchair bound Charly Manson entered the arena to introduce the luchador sorpresa (\\"surprise wrestler\\") that had been advertised and Chessman and La Parka's tag team partner. AAA played \\"Bad Medicine\\" over the PA system, normally the theme song of Dr. Wagner Jr. (who was wrestling for CMLL), as they introduced Dr. Wagner Jr.'s brother Silver King as the surprise wrestler, confirming rumors reported by newspapers earlier in the day. Silver King surprised everyone by wearing his wrestling mask, after not having worn it for over 20 years. In Lucha Libre it is normally not allowed for a wrestler to resume wearing a mask they have previously lost in a Lucha de Apuestas, but for this occasion Silver King and AAA ignored the tradition. The match ended when Suzuki hit Silver King with a low blow behind the referee's back and pinned him, winning the match for his side. In the main event Cibern√©tico had the odds stacked against him, starting with El Tirantes being named the referee, El Tirantes played the role of a crooked referee who supported La Legi√≥n Extranjera whenever he had a chance. During the match against El Zorro, El Tirantes was knocked out by accident, leaving the match unsupervised for a short while. When El Zorro covered Cibern√©tico, Konnan (El Zorro's corner man) took off his shirt to reveal a referee's shirt underneath. The ploy failed as Cibern√©tico kicked out before the three count. Moments later El Hijo del Tirantes (\\"Son of El Tirantes\\") came to the ring to officiate the match fairly and without bias. Moments later Cibern√©tico pinned El Zorro to retain the championship. Aftermath Chessman, the next challenger for the AAA Mega Championship. In the lead up to AAA's next major event Verano de Esc√°ndalo (\\"Summer of Scandal\\") Cibern√©tico's Los Hell Brothers teammate Chessman won an elimination match to earn a shot at the AAA Mega Championship held by Cibern√©tico. Cibern√©tico congratulated his partner for the victory but did not agree to a date for Chessman's title match. The tension came to a head in September after Cibern√©tico came to the ring to congratulate Chessman on a recent win. Charly Manson came to the ring to try and mediate between the two, trying to keep the peace, but when Manson could not pick sides, Los Hell Brothers disbanded. With the split of Los Hell Brothers, Chessman became a Rudo and the title match was scheduled for Verano de Escandalo. Cibern√©tico retained the championship in a very close match. Chessman was later given another match for the AAA Mega Championship, a match that also included El Zorro, which took place at the 2008 Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show, a match Cibern√©tico won by pinning El Zorro. The predominant storyline after Tripleman√≠a XVI featured the Konnan-led La Legi√≥n Extranjera group as they continued their efforts to take control of AAA. By winning the main event of the Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show the storyline was that La Legi√≥n Extranjera was now running AAA, completing their takeover. One of the storyline effects of the take over by Konnan and his group was that Cibern√©tico announced that he was leaving AAA, vacating the AAA Mega Championship in the process. The storyline was pushed as supposedly being real, something that was further enhanced by Cibern√©tico working on the independent circuit from December 2008, until returning to AAA in April 2009. As a follow up to the time-limit draw between Vampiro and El Mes√≠as, the two faced off in an extreme rules match on AAA's Sin L√≠mite television taping on July 25. That match ended in a 25-minute time-limit draw. The inconclusive ended lead to AAA booking the rematch between the two as the main event of the 2008 Verano de Esc√°ndalo show, making the match a steel cage \\"street fight\\" match, ensuring that there would be a winner. At Verano de Esc√°ndalo El Mes√≠as defeated Vampiro to end the storyline between the two. While the Apaches reunited at the show, the storyline didn't end there. Later in 2008 Billy Boy returned to AAA, wearing a mask to keeping his true identity secret as he wrestled under the name \\"Alfa\\". He used the ruse to try to gain Gran Apache's respect. The ploy worked to the point where Gran Apache stated that Alfa would make a good husband for Faby Apache. After hearing that Billy Boy unmasked himself and reunited with Faby Apache and Marvin. The ruse did not please Gran Apache, who still did not like Billy Boy. During the 2008 Guerra de Titanes show Billy Boy came to Faby Apache's aid after she lost a match. The frustration of the loss made Faby Apache slap Billy Boy, which in turn caused Billy Boy to attack her. During an in-ring celebration of Gran Apache's 50 years in professional wrestling Billy Boy attacked his father-in-law with a steel chair, reversing the roles of Billy Boy and Gran Apache at that point in the storyline. In the spring of 2010 Aero Star was brought into the family feud, portraying a new love interest for Faby Apache. To begin with, Billy Boy acted like he did not care, stating that he had moved on as well and found a new love in Sexi Star. During a show Aero Star came to the ring and asked Gran Apache's permission to ask Faby Apache out. When Gran Apache was about to say yes Billy Boy ran to the ring and attached Aero Star. This led to Faby, Sexi Star, Billy Boy and Aero Star being booked in an inter-gender Lucha de Apuesta steel cage match where the last person in the ring would either have their hair shaved off (Faby Apache or Billy Boy) or be forced to unmask (Aero Star or Sexi Star). The match came down to Faby Apache and Billy Boy in the cage with Faby Apache pinning Billy to win the match. Following the Apuesta loss the storyline has focused more on Faby Apache and Sexi Star than Billy Boy. With Joe Lider turning on the Mexican Powers and Nicho el Millonario turning on La Familia the two, along with X-Fly, formed a new group known as La Hermandad 187 (\\"The 187 Brotherhood\\"), fighting with both the Mexican Powers and La Familia de Tijuana. Nicho and Lider won a Ladder match at Verano de Esc√°ndalo defeating the Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy and √öltimo Gladiador), La Familia de Tijuana (Extreme Tiger and Halloween), and The Hart Foundation 2.0 (Jack Evans and Teddy Hart) to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship. Tripleman√≠a XVI would later be released on DVD through Televisa Home Entertainment.

The town's residents - predominantly African American - were relocated in 1990 to Morrisonville Estates in Iberville Parish and Morrisonville Acres in West Baton Rouge Parish by Dow. History The community had been founded during the 1870s by former slaves freed from a plantation near Plaquemine. A chemical factory producing vinyl chloride was set up on land adjoining the community by the Dow Chemical Company in 1958. Initially there was a green belt separating the factory from the town, but the plant bought land from the town in 1959 and then expanded to cover , filling all the intervening space, so much so that the plant's loudspeaker announcements could be heard inside people's houses. Pollution and relocation In the 1980s and 1990s, chemical pollution was discovered in the town's wells. To avoid lawsuits, Dow decided to buy up the town and move its residents away to create a buffer zone around the factory. In 1989, just before the release of a federal report into toxic emissions from the factory, Dow announced that it was going to buy up all the homes and land in Morrisonville, and that if the residents refused their property would be worthless. Although about twenty families refused to move at first, by 1993 the town was eventually abandoned. All that now remains is the graveyard of the former Nazarene Baptist Church and an open-sided prayer site, built of wood, provided by Dow for family members who return to visit the graves. The residents were transferred to newly built homes at Morrison Acres, but many died before they could settle in. The large number of petrochemical plants producing PVC in the surrounding area, an stretch between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, first led to it being known as the 'Chemical Corridor' and later as Cancer Alley, and many other communities in the area have been similarly affected by groundwater pollution and other toxic emissions.

History Until the early 19th century the Church of England church yards and burial grounds were the only major places available for burials. By that time these ancient burial grounds were becoming overcrowded, causing the burials to become shallower and the graveyards to be considered as unsanitary health hazards. Added to this was the massive increase in the population, particularly in the expanding urban industrial areas, which increased the demand for burial space. The situation was further exacerbated by the increased death rate during periodic epidemics such as cholera, occurring unchecked within these overcrowded urban environments. These burial problems were resolved with the development of ‚Äòpublic cemeteries for all‚Äô. This was initially not under the direction of local or central government, but under Joint Stock Companies for profit. For example, Key Hill Cemetery in Birmingham‚Äôs Jewellery Quarter, founded in 1834, was a local example of such a Joint Stock venture. However, these efforts by private enterprise could not, by themselves, solve the overall problem, and as a direct result of the cholera epidemics of 1831-1832 and 1848-1849 central government had to take action. Between 1852 and 1857 a series of Burial Acts were passed, which established a national system of public cemeteries under the direction of local Burial Boards. These Boards were responsible for the interment of the dead; could build and manage new cemeteries; and, charge the expenses to the Poor Rate. In the late 19th century, King's Norton Rural District Council was one of the largest administrative districts surrounding Birmingham. As Birmingham expanded in the 1880s and its population increasingly settled in this parish due to the new rail and tram routes, it created increasing pressure on the existing church burial grounds. These, like others across the country, were full and unable to expand. To resolve this problem using the new legislation, the Kings Norton RDC resolved to establish a cemetery, in the north of the district where population growth was greatest, but experienced some difficulty in finding a suitable site. In 1892, the first plan was to build a cemetery in Billesley, in the parish of Yardley, but this was abandoned due to objections by the Yardley authorities to the scheme. In 1895, an area of farmland was finally acquired for the purpose of building a new cemetery in Brandwood End, near Kings Heath, within the parish of Kings Norton. Brandwood End Cemetery was therefore one of the later Victorian Cemeteries, and was formally opened on 13 April 1899, by Mr George Tallis, the Chairman of the Local Cemetery Committee; the cemetery being subsequently incorporated within the City of Birmingham in 1911, under the Greater Birmingham Act, when the city expanded its boundaries. The two semi-detached mortuary chapels stand at the highest point in the cemetery grounds, and provide a dramatic central focus for the cemetery. The chapels are joined by a carriage entrance archway (a '), which is surmounted by a tower and spire. The twin chapels were designed by Mr J. Brewin Holmes, a Birmingham architect, and are built in the Gothic style with Art Nouveau details from red brick and terracotta. The mortuary chapel on the east was for Non-conformists and the chapel on the west consecrated for Anglican services. The chapels are mirror images of each other, containing: a chancel, a coffin chamber, a vestry and an underground heating chamber. There is also a Cemetery Lodge, built from red brick and terracotta, which contained the cemetery offices and living quarters for the cemetery Superintendent. The plans for the original cemetery, drawn up by the Birmingham District Surveyor, are a classic example of the Victorian grid plan design for a cemetery. It contained a grand tree lined central driveway running north to south through the cemetery ground, and passing beneath the carriageway arch between the two mortuary chapels. There are subsidiary pathways which run in an east to west direction, at right angles to the grand central driveway, and which divide the cemetery into its various Sections. Later extensions to the cemetery grounds: to the west in 1915; to the east in 1917, 1920 and 1950; and two further purchases of small parcels of ground in 1967 and 1996, continued to follow this original grid plan maintaining the original Victorian lay out. The landscape was a very important aspect in the design of a Victorian cemetery, and Brandwood End was planted with a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees which were popular in that period. Evergreens are concentrated within the original area of land obtained in 1885, and consist of avenues of: Scots pines; Cypress trees; and, Wellingtonia. The dark green foliage was deliberately planted to present a striking contrast to the red terracotta chapels. The deciduous planting included Horse-Chestnut, Beech, Hornbeam and Poplar, which were added to existing Oak trees. While this was a cemetery for everyone, the most impressive funerary monuments are those grouped around the mortuary chapels, where the local ‚Äògreat and the good‚Äô purchased their grave plots. These illustrate a range of early twentieth century styles including Edwardian Italian marble angels and the Art Deco memorials of the 1930s. In 1929, a ‚ÄòCross of Sacrifice' was erected in the main central driveway to commemorate those who died in the First World War, and below this, to the east of the drive, a Memorial Garden was laid out in 1952, in memory of the Civilian War dead from the Second World War who are buried in this cemetery. There are in all 206 British Commonwealth service war graves (108 from the First World War, 98 from the Second) in this cemetery, besides 2 Polish war graves. CWGC Cemetery report. For the local historian all these ‚Äònew‚Äô Victorian cemeteries, whether privately or publicly constructed, are not simply a new style of burial grounds constructed to answer a burial problem, but a reflection of the attitude of our Victorian and Edwardian predecessors to death, and their cherished memory of the departed. It is from this 'culture of commemoration' we gain these beautifully landscaped cemeteries, with their Gothic buildings and funerary monuments which are now treasured open spaces within our 21st century urban environment. Many of these Victorian cemeteries, including Brandwood End Cemetery are contained within English Heritage's, National Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England,English Heritage, 2004 and many of the Victorian cemetery buildings are contained within the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. Brandwood End Cemetery is listed as Grade II in both the above registers reflecting its historical value. It has been named by the Victorian Society as a heritage building at risk of disrepair.

He was on the Christchurch City Council from 1919 and Mayor of Christchurch from 1941 until his retirement in 1950.  Early life and family  Andrews was born in Brightwater near Nelson in 1873. His father was Thomas Andrews, who had come to New Zealand in 1842 and died in 1905. He received his education at Canterbury University College. Andrews married Caroline Maria Couzins (born 5 August 1872) on 14 March 1900. They had three children: Alpha Herbert (1901‚Äì2002), Pelham Winter (1904‚Äì1998) and Gwendoline Cynthia (1909‚Äì1999). Eveleyn Charlotte Couzins (1896‚Äì1945) was his first wife's niece. After university, Andrews was a teacher; he passed his teachers' examinations in early 1896. In his initial placement, he was a teacher aid at Kaituna on Banks Peninsula. He taught at Heretaunga School in Hastings from late 1896 until March 1899 and then at Riwaka School in the Tasman District until February 1907. He moved to Christchurch and founded a printing firm, Andrews and Sando. His business partner was his cousin Archibald Sando, whose mother was a sister of Thomas Andrews. The business partnership was dissolved in 1908 and Sando became manager of the Wellington Publishing Company, which owned The Dominion newspaper. Andrews played representative cricket from 1890 to 1907. In 1892, he was a founding member of the Ashburton Union Cricket Club and he became the inaugural secretary. While in Hastings, he played for the Hawke's Bay County Cricket Club. He was then a member of the Riwaka Cricket Club. Later, he played for the Canterbury Druids.  Political career  Samoan high chiefs Tupua Tamasese Mea ªole (fifth from left) and Malietoa Tanumafili II (second from right) welcomed to Christchurch in 1945 by Mayor Ernest Andrews (fourth from left) and Deputy-Mayor Melville Lyons (right) In August 1910, Andrews stood for election for the North Canterbury Education Board in the central ward, but was beaten by Dr. Charles James Russell. In April 1911, he was elected onto the school committee of St Albans School, for which he became secretary. In August 1912, Andrews was successful in standing for the North Canterbury Education Board. Andrews was elected as councillor onto Christchurch City Council in 1919. He was reported to be under consideration as a possible candidate for the Citizens' Association for the 1929 mayoralty, but he was not chosen. In 1941, he was elected as mayor, a position that he held for three terms until his retirement in 1950. He provided continuous service to Christchurch City Council for 31 years. Andrews' first wife died in 1937, before he became mayor, and so his niece, Eveleyn Couzins, acted as the mayoress from 1941 until her death in 1945. Couzins made a valued contribution to the community, especially through the organisation of parcels for dispatch to New Zealand servicemen abroad. Although she had suffered from some minor illnesses, she continued to carry out her duties as mayoress until she became seriously ill, two weeks before her death in June 1945. She is buried in B24P188 in Linwood Cemetery. Andrews' daughter Gwendoline then took over the role of mayoress. Andrews was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for social welfare and patriotic services in the 1946 New Year Honours, and a Knight Bachelor in the 1950 King's Birthday Honours, the first Christchurch serving mayor to be so honoured. He retired in October 1950, having had been mayor for longer than any other incumbent up to that time.  Later life  Andrews died in Christchurch on 9 November 1961. The funeral service took place at the Rugby Street Methodist church, with which Andrews had been long associated. He is buried at Bromley Cemetery, with his first wife. The simple Andrews grave states that Caroline Andrews lived from 1872‚Äì1937 and Ernest Andrews from 1873‚Äì1961. He was survived by his second wife, Florence May Emmett.  Honorific eponym  Andrews Crescent in the suburb of Spreydon is named in his honour.

He was born into a well-known local family of stonemasons and lived in Copleys Street in Cork city centre. McCarthy's uncle \\"Buddy\\" was a well-known dance promoter and had at one time a dancehall on nearby Union Quay. As a youth Joe joined the Cork Butter Exchange Brass Band and learned to play the French Horn but later became best known as a drummer. In 1954 Joe and two of his friends, Sean Lucey and Theo Cahill formed a dance band which they called The Dixielanders. This was later to be shortened to The Dixies and in the 1960s became one of the best known showbands in Ireland. During the 1960s a number of other musicians joined the band and some left but the most significant was the arrival of vocalist Brendan O'Brien in the late 1960s. In 1968 the band had their greatest success when their version of Leapy Lees \\"Little Arrows\\" shot to No.1 in the Irish singles chart. During the late 1970s the band broke up after lead singer Brendan O'Brien was electrocuted on stage and seriously injured due to a faulty microphone. McCarthy went solo and did relatively successful but tragedy struck in 1981 when his eldest son Aidan, and Aidan's wife Linda were killed in a car accident. Four months later Joe's mother died and he went out of the music business for over a year. However he returned and was instrumental in bringing the Dixies back together with a new line up in December 1982. He stayed with the band until 1990 before again embarking on a solo career. To this day he continues to play on an almost nightly basis at venues around Cork city and county.

After a six-month stint at the Pintsch Electro Radio Factory in Constance, Smith returned to Duisburg, where he met his wife. In 1960 the war office selection board sent him to Mons Officer Cadet School at Aldershot, and he received his commission as a lieutenant in 10th Signal Regiment, posted in Krefeld, in North Rhine- Westphalia, Germany. Here he was a Troop Commander using the same Pintch equipment he had studied in Constance. In 1961, he received a commission into the Royal Corps of Signals, and served in the British Army of the Rhine. While in service there, he studied German, and explored his growing interest in the military history of the old German states of the Holy Roman Empire.The Cultural Experience. Digby Smith . Smith's first foray into the realm of Napoleonic history occurred by chance at Bradbury Barracks in Krefeld. As a qualified linguist, he was asked to research the history of the Barrack's original German regiment, part of the Signal's 20th anniversary at the location. His research led him to the 2nd Westphalian Hussars, who in turn were descended from the green- and purple-clad Cheaveau Legers Uhlanen of Duchy of Berg. This colourful regiment had as its founder the equally colourful Joachim Murat, King of Naples and a Marshal of France under Napoleon. In 1965, he transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, where he worked in computers and logistics and the study of work. From 1970‚Äì1972, he had a stint at the German Armed Forces Command and Staff College, located at Blankenese, near Hamburg. Post-military After serving a brief stint at the Ministry of Defense, Whitehall, he retired from the military to start a new career, selling body armour to the German police, who were at that time combating the Baader Meinhof and other urban terrorist groups. In 1981, high tech logistics and customer services markets drew him into international computer and telecommunications companies located in Germany, Saudi Arabia and Moscow. During his assignment to Moscow, where he spent four years, he made several trips to the battlefield at Borodino, and continued developing the material for his compendium, Napoleonic Wars Data Book. Since 1995, he has concentrated full-time on the writing of military history, some of which he wrote for Osprey Military Publishing under the nom de plume of Otto von Pivka. Personal life He married Rita Prime in 1961, and they had three sons. He divorced in 1984, and married a second time to a nurse, Edna Bluck he had met in Saudi Arabia. Publications by Digby Smith Smith's work in the Osprey series, Men at War, already had received considerable interest from Napoleonic war enthusiasts, hobbyists and re-enactors when Greenhill published Napoleonic Wars Data Book. It was a 20-year project, about which Smith commented, \\"This is the largest and most complex book that I have produced to date and without having committed the last few years to full time, solid research and presentation this work would never have been written.\\"Digby Smith. Writing the Databook. Napoleon Series. Robert Burnham, editor in chief. 1998. Accessed 12 February 2010. In this massive volume (582 pages, large format, 264 x 204mm‚Äìnearly A4 size), Smith compiled the available statistics of nearly every exchange of gunfire of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, close to 2000 engagements, including those in Europe, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. The result was a highly specialised reference book that listed, in chronological order, the battles, skirmishes and actions of nearly 25 years of worldwide warfare, making it a standard starting place for Napoleonic War battle research.Martin Liechty, \\"Review of Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book. In Napoleon Series. Robert Burnham, editor in chief. 1998. Accessed 12 February 2010. It also includes the forces involved, the commanders, ranks, names and types of units, and the occasional comment on the battle.Robert Wilde, European history guide. Smith Databook. Accessed 12 February 2010. The Data Book cemented Smith's reputation as a Napoleonic enthusiast, although not necessarily as a scholar. His first foray into narrative historical writing, 1813 Leipzig, met with mixed reviews. On the one hand, Smith included interesting first-person narrative accounts of the four-day battle at Leipzig, and this was considered the main strength of his work. On the other hand, however, the contextualising of the first-person accounts was less accurate, and in particular the first two chapters were marred by frequent factual errors. Filled with absorbing accounts of the battle and people's responses to it, Smith's book was considered an interesting read for students of military history, but not necessarily a scholarly contribution to Napoleonic studies.Michael Leggiere. \\"Review of: Digby Smith, 1813 Leipzig.\\" The Journal of Military History, Vol. 65, No. 4 (Oct. 2001), pp. 1092‚Äì1093. Smith's more recent Charge adopted some of the same stylistic elements. After explaining how mounted units formed, trained, and operated, Smith focuses on 13 specific battles to illustrate how cavalry could and did turn the tide in several engagements such as Austerlitz, Eylau, Borodino, Albuera, Marengo, and Waterloo, Liebertwolkwitz and Mockern, and the Allied raids on France in 1813.David Lee Poremba. \\"Charge!: Great Cavalry Charges of the Napoleonic Wars (Review).\\" Library Journal.

Announced in January 2010 during an interview with one of the producers of the game, it was released April 27, 2010 in North America. 199 of the 204 teams that took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification are included in the game. Gameplay The method of taking a penalty kick was altered on the game. In the player's display in the bottom-left, the coloured bar below the name represents the accuracy, while the green bar above represents the power (PS3/Xbox 360 versions only). This feature was thereafter adopted for future FIFA titles, up until FIFA 17. Players choose a team from the 199 nations available and compete against the computer or against other players through online gaming services PlayStation Network or Xbox Live. All 10 official World Cup stadiums are available for play. EA has announced that there will be gameplay improvements over FIFA 10, such as a higher rate of player fatigue for matches at higher altitudes, with an advantage to a home team who plays at a higher altitude against an away team who does not. EA has also announced that players can get injured outside of international matches. EA has also announced that the \\"Captain Your Country\\" mode will return, similar as \\"Be a Pro\\" mode and that FIFA 10 owners can import their Virtual Pro for this purpose, and then earn CYC Accomplishments and attribute boosts. The game's penalty kicks have been changed in order for their outcome to better reflect the player's own composure, and the game's online multiplayer lobby system has been limited to unranked head to head matches. As in 2006 FIFA World Cup a \\"scenario\\" mode is included with 55 playable scenarios from past World Cup matches. In addition, scenarios from the 2010 World Cup are playable with an online update. The Wii version of the game features more stylized graphics and utilizes a nuanced physics system to allow for more casual, arcade-style gameplay. This version supports multiple control schemes, including the Classic Controller. Exclusively in this version, players are required to use quick-time events to save free kicks or penalty shots, or to win possession of the ball after it is punted or corner-kicked. It is also possible for multiple players to take control of one team in that version. The game includes Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend as the commentators, who provide insight into both sides during the match. Teams and venues The 199 national football teams included in the game shaded in green The included teams were confirmed by Electronic Arts on 17 February 2010. The game contains 199 of the 204 national teams that took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification process. Electronic Arts stated that they have included every team that FIFA have permitted them to use, with some others not being allowed for \\"various reasons\\". The five teams that were in the draw for World Cup qualifying but are not included in the game are African teams Central African Republic, Eritrea, and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and Asian teams Bhutan and Guam. All five withdrew from the qualifying stage before it began. Additionally, the game does not feature Brunei, Laos, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines who did not participate in World Cup qualifying. The game includes all 10 venues used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as stadiums from each qualifying region and a range of \\"generic\\" stadiums. Development 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa was in development for 12 months, and had two separate teams working on it: gameplay team and core team. The gameplay team was led by Gary Patterson, the creative director for FIFA games. Meanwhile, the core team designed the game modes and audio/visual presentation, among other things. EA Sports wanted to shape World Cup in a way that it would be able to match FIFA 10. They decided to release it as a standalone game, rather than downloadable content, citing the big size, scope and the uniqueness of the covered event. Because the game focused on a single event, EA Sports was trying to secure a complete authenticity by working with FIFA and the host nation. Several members went to South Africa and recorded the vuvuzela noise during actual football games, in order to capture the atmosphere over there. Adding to the variety, each nation got its own fully rendered crowd in-game. The developers were also influenced by African themes in other areas, such as the soundtrack and menus. Release The game was announced on January 26, 2010 in a GameSpot interview with the line producer of the game, Simon Humber, with a slated release date for April 27, 2010 in North America, and April 30, 2010 in Asia and Europe. A playable demo was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on April 8, 2010. It includes Italy and Spain as the playable teams, and the ability to upload video replays to EA Football World. Soundtrack The 2010 FIFA World Cup soundtrack comprises 28 tracks by artists from 21 countries. According to Electronic Arts it is intended to be a soundtrack that \\"celebrates the cultural vibrancy of the first FIFA World Cup to be held in Africa\\". The headline track is \\"Wavin' Flag (Coca-Cola Celebration Mix)\\" by K'naan. Reception The game was met with positive to mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 83.43% and 83 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 82.82% and 82 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 71.50% and 69 out of 100 for the PSP version; 69% and 70 out of 100 for the Wii version; and 62.50% for the iOS version. Sales As of May 2010, the game has sold nearly 2 million units worldwide.

It was formed in 1867, when four Cork distilleries, Daly's, the Green, North Mall, the Watercourse were amalgamated under one company to form the Cork Distilleries Company. In 1868, these were joined by another Cork distillery, James Murphy's Midleton Distillery. The company existed until 1966, when the Cork Distilleries Company merged with two other Irish distillers, John Powers & Son, and John Jameson & Son to form Irish Distillers. The company produced Paddy Whiskey, and Cork Dry Gin among other products.  History  In the mid-1800s, the Irish whiskey industry underwent a period of turmoil, with the temperance movement of the 1830s, and the Great Famine of the 1840s reducing domestic demand for whiskey. At the time, Cork was home to several distilleries, therefore, in the 1860s, James Murphy, the owner of the Midleton distillery, suggested amalgamating the operations of several local distilleries. The other distilleries agreed, so in 1867, Cork Distilleries Company (CDC) was formed, with Murphy at the helm. In 1867, CDC took control of four Cork distilleries: North Mall, The Green, the Watercourse and Daly's, and a year later Midleton Distillery also joined. The years that followed its formation saw some rationalisation, with distilling ceasing at Daly's Distillery in 1869, and at the Green in the 1870s. Though both continued to be used as warehouses by the Cork Distilleries Company for several years. The Watercourse Distillery was also mothballed in the mid-1880s, so that by the turn of the century, only two of CDC's five distilleries, the North Mall and Midleton -remained in production. In 1920, a fire broke out at the North Mall distillery, completely destroying its five-storey mill, and causing significant damage to most, if not all of the production buildings. Had the Irish whiskey industry not been in the midst of a crisis, with most distilleries enduring severe financial hardship, the distillery might have been rebuilt. However, facing an uncertain economic outlook, a decision was taken to concentrate production at Midleton, rather than to renovate the North Mall Distillery. In 1966, with the Irish distilleries still facing an uncertain future, CDC merged with two of the other remaining Dublin distilleries, John Jameson & Son. and John Powers & Son., to form Irish Distillers.

House numbers on that avenue were later revised; the current building on the lot is 1095 Avenue of the Americas. Known as Trainors' Hall at first, it was also called Lyric Hall. A well-known landmark of midtown Manhattan, the building was enlarged in 1840 and renamed Lyric Hall. From 1914 - 1934 its ground floor was occupied by a Horn & Hardart restaurant.

Remodeling The antiquated condition of Bryant Hall Building led to its remodeling and conversion into a single story structure in 1934. The upper floors, except for its walls and roof, were removed. Columns were then raised on the ground floor to support a new roof. Upon the columns the steel work for the roof and sign supports was installed. Steel girders and beams were run through the old walls, which were two feet thick in some places. Finally a terra cotta front was installed. The single story structure then measured twenty feet in height. The restaurant was kept open while the remodeling progressed.Sixth Av.

The character is usually depicted as a member of the Strikeforce: Morituri. The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Backhand (Greg Mattingly) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson. He debuted as a guest character in Strikeforce: Morituri #4 (March 1987). He re- emerged in Strikeforce: Morituri #13 as a superhero and member of Strikeforce: Morituri, with the codename \\"Backhand\\", thus joining the cast of the book, until his death in issue #22. Fictional character biography In 2073, Greg Mattingly was a successful character who was hired in a soap opera that would depict the adventures of Strikeforce: Morituri, an internationally hailed team of new superheroes who were assigned to defend the Earth from the regular attacks of the savage alien race known as the Horde. The members of the team had acquired their powers through a complex scientific process, albeit at a terrible price: their lifespan was significantly reduced, due to an inescapable flaw in the process, which ensured their death within a year after taking the process. Before the video series detailing the adventures of the Morituri debuted, the actors and crew of the series met the actual Morituri in a special party that took place in New York City. Mattingly introduced himself to the team member he would portray, unofficial team leader Vyking. Vyking immediately joked on how Mattingly should have landed a part that would last longer, hinting at his own brief time left on the Earth, due to the deadly Morituri effect. His attempt at black humor caused an awkward moment, which Mattingly managed to overcome.Strikeforce: Morituri #4 His meeting with the Morituri proved to be a turning point in Mattingly's life. Sometime later, Mattingly was tested and found genetically compatible to undergo the Morituri process, one of the precious few that met the biological criteria (about 5% of the entire population). This development, in conjunction with Mattingly being impressed by the self-sacrifice and cause of the Morituri and the inevitable death of Vyking, contributed in his making the decision to volunteer to become a Morituri. Through the process, Mattingly, ironically enough, developed an ability eerily similar to the one of Vyking, the Morituri he depicted in the series, namely, the ability to redirect energy. His control of energy rerouting was also more refined and focused than the one Vyking had in his own powers. In the first official mission of the new generation of Morituri, however, one of the new members, Wildcard suffered a horrible death, due to the Morituri effect. Witnessing this, Backhand freaked out and went screaming, arguing he no longer wanted to be a Morituri. However, he managed to eventually regain his calmness.Strikeforce: Morituri #13 Backhand went through many adventures with the team, being part of the third generation of Morituri. Months later, during an attack by Super Hordians (an evolved form of Hordians) against a TV station, the Morituri appeared to meet their match. Backhand himself was mortally injured by them. While dying, Backhand managed to will himself to the Morituri effect and exploded, thus killing several of the Super Hordians that were near him, and providing his teammates with a fighting chance.Strikeforce: Morituri #22 References Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987 Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Backhand (comics)"},{"id":"26163463","text":"Threshold is a 1981 Canadian drama/science fiction film directed by Richard Pearce and starring Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum.

The history of Ohio Public Works can be traced to shortly after the state was admitted to the Union in 1803, making it one of the older entities in state government. The manager of this office is generally an Ohio registered architect. The official mission of the State Architect's Office is \\"to effectively and efficiently lead capital planning, design, and construction of public facilities through quality service, expertise, and knowledge sharing.\\" History Public Works was originally a Board formed for the purpose of building and maintaining Ohio's canal transportation system. Created in 1921, the Office of the State Architect and Engineer was originally established in the Department of Highways and Public Works, located in the Ohio-Hartman Building, formerly the Hartman Hotel, at 275 South Fourth Street. It was listed as the Division of Public Lands and Buildings in the 1923 Columbus City Directory. In 1927, the Department was split between Highways and Public Works. In 1930, the office was listed as the Division of Architects and Engineers in the Department of Public Works, and in 1933 moved to the new Departments of State Building, now the Ohio Judicial Center, at 65 South Front Street.House Bill 249, Section 154-6, passed April 19, 1921. In 1974, Public Works was \\"demoted\\" to a Division when the departments of Finance, State Personnel, and Public Works were reorganized into the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and the Office of Budget and Management, and moved to the new State Office Tower, subsequently named for Governor James A. Rhodes, at 30 East Broad Street. It became an office in the General Services Division (GSD) of DAS in 1995, and the office moved to the General Services Center at 4200 Surface Road. After being located downtown since its inception, the office moved to the West side of Columbus just inside the I-270 outerbelt. For a short period of time in the late 1990s, it was known as the Office of Construction Management.Amended Senate Bill 174 of the 110th General Assembly, effective December 4, 1973. Prior to the establishment of the Office of the State Architect and Engineer in 1921, the individual state Boards engaged outside architects and contractors to serve their construction needs on an ad hoc basis. Consolidation of authority in one agency allowed for consistency of policy and procedure, as well as standardized contracts and conditions. The Administrative Act of 1921 provided an architectural expert employed by the state, which allowed centralized planning and administration. In 1921, the only agency exempt from central administration was the Adjutant General. Over the years, this authority has eroded significantly, and the institutions of higher education have had varying degrees of interaction with the office. On April 25, 2012, the Ohio House passed House Bill 487, the Governor's Mid-Biennium Budget Review Bill. On May 16, it was approved by the Senate. The House moved it to a Conference Committee on May 17, 2012. House Bill 487 will merge the State Architect's Office with the Ohio School Facilities Commission to form the Ohio Facilities Construction Commission.

Plot Captain Eddie Gordon, a top gun pilot of an Air Force academy, is a talented and aggressive pilot who proves too much for his fellow instructees to match. His flight instructor, Matt Ryan (Peter Strauss) tries to encourage him to practice restraint, but with little success. After his birthday party at his home in Las Vegas, Eddie puts a religiously motivated long-organized plan into action: He kills his brother (Rodney Eastman) and his parents (Ben Rawnsley and K. Callan). He then holds Captain Melissa Gaiter (Patricia Sill) of the Air Force base at gunpoint and forces her to arm his IAI Kfir C1 with live ordnance, a radar-jamming pod and a tactical nuclear weapon. Melissa refuses to co-operate further and is murdered. Later, Colonel Bill Douglas (James O'Sullivan) of the base's flight control is informed of the triple murder at the Gordons' residence while a training exercise involving Eddie is under way. Eddie takes this opportunity to shoot down his fellow instructees. Ryan manages to alert the base and tries to lure Eddie into the firing range of the base's surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Eddie however, destroys the SAMs, Ryan's plane, and the airbase runway. Eddie lands in Garrison, Utah to hide his jet in a deserted barn, but is accidentally discovered by a family on vacation, Richard (Michael Keys Hall) and Valerie (Michele Pawk) Dwyer and their baby. Before Valerie can raise the police on the CB radio, Eddie takes them hostage. While Eddie works on defeating the fail-safes on the tactical nuke, he is exposed to lethal radiation, and his health quickly deteriorates. The next day, he and Valerie leave for a hardware store in a nearby city to obtain tools. Valerie uses a traveler's check and writes their hostage location on the back, but the clerk (Scott Menville) does not notice. Valerie then persuades Eddie to go to a drug store to find a cure for his vomiting and nausea. She repeats the same practice; this time, the pharmacist (John D. Brancato) notices Valerie's notes on the check. Two police officers (George Fisher and Steven D. Simpson) arrive to investigate. Eddie kills one and engages the other in a firefight. Richard and Valerie try to flee with their baby; however, Eddie shoots the second officer, Richard and Valerie. Richard dies and Valerie is seriously wounded. Painstakingly, Valerie manages to collect her baby and crawl to the roadside, where she is picked up by a truck driver. Ryan is cross-checking police leads when the report of Valerie Dwyer comes in. She insists that she has seen Eddie working on a bomb. Just before a surgery, Ryan learns Eddie's target from Valerie: Las Vegas. Subsequently, Ryan convinces Douglas to concentrate on Las Vegas; he travels to Hill AFB to take an F-16 fighter plane to fly lead. An AWACS plane confirms what Valerie had said. It has been determined that although Eddie cannot launch the bomb, his jet fuel could detonate the bomb if he is fired upon. Ryan successfully talks Eddie into chasing him out into the desert by provoking Eddie into a duel to see if God made him \\"the one\\". After evading Eddie's last missile, Ryan orders the other pilots to clear away, and then fires on Eddie. Both pilots and 36 people on the ground are incinerated. A recovering Valerie receives sanitized TV news on the incident in her hospital bed with her baby in her arms. The report assert that the pilots were on a \\"training mission\\" in the area.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 11, 2010. In the episode, Leslie and her boyfriend Justin seek to reunite Leslie's mother, Marlene, with her teenage flame. Meanwhile, April's feelings for Andy continue to bloom, while Ann appears to be growing apart from Mark. The episode was written by series co-creator Michael Schur and directed by Ken Kwapis. \\"Galentine's Day\\" featured a guest appearance by John Larroquette as Frank Beckerson, the long-lost love of Marlene Griggs-Knope, who was played by Pamela Reed. It also featured the last in a string of guest performances by Justin Theroux as Leslie's love interest, Justin Anderson. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Galentine's Day\\" was seen by 4.98 million household viewers, which marked a continued improvement in ratings for the series. It tied a record set with the previous episode, \\"Sweetums\\", for the season's highest rating among viewers aged 18 to 49. The episode received generally positive reviews, and the fictional holiday has become revered and celebrated in the years after the shows airing. Plot summary Leslie (Amy Poehler) throws her annual \\"Galentine's Day\\" party for her female friends, celebrated the day before Valentine's Day. She asks her mother, Marlene (Pamela Reed), to tell the story about how she fell in love with a lifeguard that saved her from drowning in 1968, but the two had to break it off over objections from Marlene's parents. Leslie later tells the story to Justin (Justin Theroux), who is amazed by the tale and wants to unite the two. He tracks down Marlene's old flame, Frank Beckerson (John Larroquette), and convinces Leslie to go with him to Illinois and reunite the two on Valentine's Day at the Senior Center Valentine's Dance, which the parks department oversees. Leslie and Justin meet Frank, a strange and depressed man who has constant panic attacks. Leslie begins to have doubts about bringing him to her mother and tries to call it off, but Justin insists that they should \\"let this unfold\\". At the dance, where Andy's (Chris Pratt) band Mouse Rat is playing, Frank meets up with Marlene, who is repulsed by Frank's past, current unemployment and overall failure at life. She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. Ron (Nick Offerman) explains that Justin is a \\"tourist,\\" meaning that he takes \\"vacations in people's lives\\" and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist Duke Silver, but he denies it. Leslie later breaks up with Justin, which Tom (Aziz Ansari) takes especially hard, reacting as if his parents were getting divorced. Before the senior dance, Tom invites his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) to his office to finally disclose his romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him. Not satisfied with the outcome, he attempts to blackmail her into a date using an alimony lawsuit as leverage. Tom and Wendy are later shown hugging and presumably making amends, although their conversation remains inaudible. Meanwhile, April's (Aubrey Plaza) boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) mock the senior citizens, causing April to question why their interactions must constantly be \\"cloaked in like 15 layers of irony\\". They accuse her of \\"lameness\\", which they attribute to spending time with Andy, and provide her with several ultimatums. She breaks up with them in response. Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider), at the same time, celebrate their first Valentine's Day together. In an interview with the camera crew, Ann describes the relationship as \\"good\\", but her tone of voice and body language around Mark contradict her statements. She later becomes jealous when Andy dedicates a song to April, even going so far as to question April about the possibility of a budding relationship between April and Andy, to which April responds impatiently. Production John Larroquette portrays Frank Beckerson in this episode, \\"Galentine's Day\\" \\"Galentine's Day\\" was written by series co-creator Michael Schur and directed by Ken Kwapis. The episode featured a guest appearance by John Larroquette as Frank Beckerson, the long-lost love of Leslie's mother, Marlene Knope. When Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels announced the casting in January 2010, he described Larroquette's character as \\"He's the one who got away.\\" \\"Galentine's Day\\" also included an appearance by Pamela Reed, who has played Marlene Knope in several episodes, and the last of a string of slated guest appearances by Justin Theroux as Justin Anderson, a love interest for Leslie. The episode marked the return of Andy's band, \\"Mouse Rat\\", which was previously featured in the first season finale \\"Rock Show\\". His bandmates are played by Mark Rivers (drums), Andrew Burlinson (guitar) and Alan Yang (bass), the latter of whom serves as a screenwriter for Parks and Recreation. Cultural references At the dance, a senior citizen approaches Ron Swanson and asks for an autograph from Duke Silver. This is a reference to the previous second season episode, \\"Practice Date\\", which establishes Ron's secret identity as a jazz musician. Leslie referred to her Galentine's Day breakfast tradition as \\"Lilith Fair minus the angst and plus frittatas\\", a reference to the concert tour and traveling music festival. She also said the love story between Marlene and Frank makes the 2004 romance film The Notebook look like the 2008 horror film Saw V. Mark gets Ann a necklace similar to the Heart of the Ocean, the fictional jewelry given to Kate Winslet's character in the 1997 romantic drama film, Titanic. During one scene in \\"Galentine's Day\\", Leslie does a voice impersonation of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. When Tom mistakes the impression for that of the Arnold Schwarzenegger character Terminator, he prompts Leslie to do that impression as well. Among the songs performed by Mouse Rat in \\"Galentine's Day\\" were \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", originally performed by Fred Astaire in the 1936 film, Swing Time. Andy's bandmate suggests he sings the \\"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\\" more like jazz musician and trumpeter Louis Armstrong, who Andy admits he has never heard of. Andy and his band also performs \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\" and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\". At the end of the evening one of the senior citizens corners Andy and tells him that he \\"sounds like Dean Martin\\", who Andy has also never heard of. Leslie said reuniting Marlene and Frank would be like reuniting Romeo and Juliet, the protagonists of the William Shakespeare play of the same name, or reuniting actress Jennifer Aniston and actor Brad Pitt. She also warns to the camera for Aniston to \\"stay away from John Mayer\\", the musician who previously dated Aniston. In the days prior to the original broadcast of \\"Galentine's Day\\", Mayer publicly apologized for a number of explicit sexual and racial comments he had made in the past months, which prompted news outlets to praise Parks and Recreation for the timeliness of their Mayer joke. In May 2011, Jennifer Aniston started dating Justin Theroux, who guest starred in the episode, and they later married. Frank made a reference to a recurring gag from Arrested Development when, after being rejected, he announced to Marlene, \\"take one last look...because you'll never see this body again.\\" Reception In its original American NBC broadcast on February 11, 2010, \\"Galentine's Day\\" was seen by 4.98 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. This marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series. \\"Galentine's Day\\" was seen by more viewers than the previous week's episode \\"Sweetums\\", which drew 4.87 million viewers and was an itself an increase from previous episodes. \\"Galentine's Day\\" drew an overall 3.1 rating/5 share, and a 2.3 rating/6 share among viewers between 18 and 49, the latter of which tied with \\"Sweetums\\" as the highest of its age group for the series. The subsequent episode, \\"Woman of the Year\\", would also tie the two episodes for a series- high rating in that 18 to 49 age group. \\"Galentine's Day\\" received generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, \\"The show managed to cram more character development into 22 minutes than I thought possible. Almost every couple had a major milestone of sorts last night.\\" Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the \\"touching moment\\" between Ron and Leslie when she realized she had to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a \\"poignant backdrop\\" for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star- Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were \\"a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship\\", but found it \\"frustrating\\" that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in \\"Galentine's Day\\". Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the episode for displaying some of Leslie's stronger and more competent aspects, which he said makes audiences \\"much more willing to put up with her many, many eccentricities\\". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little \\"taken aback\\" by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between \\"the sweet and the absurd\\", and that some of the character moments \\"played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this\\". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the \\"hilariously whacked-out\\" performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song \\"Sex Hair\\", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted. Public reception \\"Galentine's Day\\" has transcended the television screen and become established in everyday culture. On February 13, Galentine's Day, a nonofficial holiday, is celebrated as a day for \\"ladies celebrating ladies.\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/each-day-is- galentines-day/516408/ Businesses such as Sprinkles Cupcakes, Lyft, Shari's Berries, and Target promoted the holiday on Twitter in 2017, with Target even selling Galentine's Day themed products.http://www.target.com/p/be-my- galentine-purple-gift-bag-spritz/-/A-51360444 Awareness of the holiday spread thanks to social media, with #GalentinesDay trending on Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr on February 13, 2017, seven years after the original episode aired. DVD release \\"Galentine's Day\\", along with the other 23 second-season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

He is president of the Scurfield Company in Sacramento, dealing in property investment and commercial development and management.http://chrb.ca.gov/press_releases/PRDec41998.htm Scurfield also served as an officer of the Association of Racing Commissioners International from 1994, becoming president of that organization in 1998 and serving one term as chairman in 1998-99. Scurfield was first appointed to the California Horse Racing Board in 1991 by Governor was George Deukmejian, and was twice re-appointed to the Board by Governor Pete Wilson.http://www.chrb.ca.gov/press_releases/PRDec051997.htm Scurfield was first named Chairman in 1992 and retained that post with the unanimous support of his colleagues until his term as CHRB commissioner expired September 26, 2000. As chairman of the CHRB Scurfield lead the board through a decade that brought enormous change to the California horse racing industry as it faced unprecedented competition from other forms of gambling and entertainment. Scurfield was influential in bringing about license-fee relief to the horse racing industry, personally appearing before legislative committees to explain the importance of the industry in terms of jobs, revenue, and its impact on the overall economy. During Scurfield‚Äôs reign as chairman of the CHRB he directed his efforts to abolish substance abuse among industry workers. He influenced support for the Winners Foundation, the employee assistance program for persons in the California horse racing industry with problems related to drug or alcohol abuse, and created the Human Substance Abuse Advisory Committee, which brought medical experts and industry leaders together to deal with the problem. Scurfield was also responsible for establishing a voluntary program that enables trainers to test their employees and new-hires for drugs. John Van de Kamp, president of the Thoroughbred Owners of California, praised Scurfield saying \\"Ralph Scurfield‚Äôs tenure on the CHRB was distinguished by dedication to duty and to his obligations, his availability, his willingness to listen, and a real commitment to the industry as a whole. His service provides a good example for others who will follow in his footsteps.\\" Ken Maddy, former California State Senator said of Scurfield: \\"As chairman, Ralph came before the Legislature and pointed out what horse racing means to California economically, and he explained what the industry needed from its elected officials. He played a vital role in gaining license-fee relief for the industry. To me, his leadership role in supporting that legislation was his most significant accomplishment.\\" Scurfield is currently heading the newly formed Sacramento Harness Association. http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/26627/capitol-racing-near-deal-for-les-bois-park  References  Category:1928 births Category:Living people ","title":"Ralph M.

By 1948 he had relocated to Detroit, and in 1952, he watched Eddie \\"Guitar\\" Burns performing and played along with Burns' backing group. He impressed the proprietor and ended up with a three-year residency with the band. Working full-time washing cars for a living, he decided to name his own musical ensemble, Washboard Willie and the Super Suds of Rhythm, working off of the name of a once-popular laundry detergent! He graduated from just playing the washboard to incorporate a bass drum and snare and, in 1955, gave Little Sonny his first booking.

Landfill is a Superfund site located in Monterey Park, California at 900 N Potrero Grande Drive.EPA. \\"Region 9: Superfund Operating Industries Inc. Landfill\\" Last updated January 2010 From 1948 to 1984, the landfill accepted 30 million tons of solid municipal waste and of liquid chemicals.Benson, Benny. \\"Liquids Collection, Management and Landfill Gas Impact at the OII Landfill\\" Accumulating over time, the chemical waste polluted the air, leached into groundwater, and posed a fire hazard, spurring severely critical public health complaints.EPA. \\"In California, Many Hands Make Greener Work Operating Industries Inc. Landfill\\" Last updated June 2009 Recognizing OII Landfill's heavy pollution, EPA placed the financial responsibility of the dump's clean-up on the main waste-contributing companies, winning hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements for the protection of human health and the environment.  History  The Monterey Park Disposal Co. first utilized the landfill in 1948, later selling business rights to OII in the 1950s. Two decades later, the construction of the Pomona Freeway split the OII landfill into two parts: the North Parcel (45 acres) and the South Parcel (145 acres). Out of the North Parcel's , only served landfill purposes and collecting primarily construction and debris (C&D;) waste such as: wood, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, brick, asphalt, concrete, and plastic. Shouldering the majority of wastes, the South Parcel received industrial and residential refuse, liquid chemicals, and hazardous materials.  Contamination  Close to 4,000 companies disposed of millions of gallons of waste during the landfill's operation time. Roughly 300 million gallons were liquid industrial wastes. The culmination of these wastes led to contaminated air, groundwater, and soil as well as a fire risk. All of these factors caused great concern for the well-being of nearby residents. According to the 2000 US Census, 2,151,372 people lived within of the landfill, while 23,000 people drank water from wells from the landfill.ScoreCard. \\"Superfund Site Report: Operating Industries, Inc., Landfill\\" Last Updated 2005The Center for Public Integrity. \\"Operating Industries Inc., Landfill\\" In January 1984, the State of California placed the OII landfill on the California Hazardous Waste Priority List, shutting down the landfill within the same year. In May 1986, EPA officially listed OII Landfill on the National Priorities List for remediation. Conducting studies, the Los Angeles County Sanitation District, the California Department of Health Services, South Coast Air Quality Management District and OII discovered carcinogenic chemicals such as tetrachloroethylene, benzene-type compounds, chloroform, lead, and toluene leaching into the groundwater. Tests also confirmed the presence of methane and vinyl chloride in subsurface soils and the air surrounding the landfill. Overall, the EPA cited 61 contaminants, earning the OII Landfill an Hazard Ranking of 30 to 40 percent higher than the national average.  Remediation  The EPA identified 195 companies as waste contributors, labeling them as Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs). In 1989, the PRPs signed a Consent Decree with EPA, agreeing to clean up the contamination. In 1991, 178 PRPs agreed to contribute $130 million to $150 million towards OII landfill clean- up, making the largest settlement in the history of federal environmental remediation.Hudson, Berkely. \\"Firms, Agencies to Pay for Dump Cleanup Superfund: The settlement, which may total as much as $150 million, is the largest of its kind in the program.\\" Los Angeles Times Written Dec 1991 In 2002, EPA won another settlement -the eighth since 1986 -with 161 PRPs for $340 million.OH Editorial Staff. \\"$340 Million Settlement Reached for Cleanup of California Superfund Site.\\" EHS Today Written January 2002 To date, the total cost of remediation (settlements between EPA and PRPs) runs over $600 million. More than 60 of the PRPs are required to implement the final remedy for cleanup of the OII site, which includes the following components: *Monitor landfill liquids: Using monitoring wells or extraction wells to measure landfill liquids at the perimeter of the site. When levels are too high, they are extracted and treated at the leachate treatment facility. *Clean up groundwater: Natural processes will be relied on allow the groundwater to return to normal levels. If these processes fail, the water will be extracted and treated. *Operate and maintain the environmental control systems: The leachate treatment facility and the gas control and cover systems must be maintained properly. The gas control and cover systems include the landfill gas control system, the cover system, and the surface water management system. Site security must be provided. *Establish control mechanisms: The control mechanisms are to guarantee that the site will be used for appropriate purposes in the coming years and to ensure no one is exposed to contaminated groundwater. In 1992, a landfill cover system was designed to prevent rainwater from seeping into the landfill and gas from seeping out. About 6 million cubic yards of earth was removed and replaced with a geosynthetic clay liner and a six-foot-thick cover of clean soil and vegetation. Grass and other vegetation that was planted above the liner are native to the region and blend in with the surrounding land. Construction for the south parcel cover was completed in 2000 while a final cover design for the north parcel was completed in the summer of 2009.  Landfill collection systems  alt=The OII landfill gas system.Remediation efforts require continuous collection and treatment of landfill gases and liquids. Potentially injurious gases rise from decomposing garbage and organic matter; while water, seeping from trash, mixes with toxic compounds and creates leachate. The gas collection system extracts gas from deep inside the landfill and burns it. In 2002, EPA installed micro- turbines which convert landfill gases into electricity for operating site systems. Environmentally friendly, the micro-turbines send their emissions towards the gas treatment system, destroying all contaminants. For landfill liquids, a series of wells and pipes captures leachate, directing it towards a leachate treatment plant. After the treatment, the liquids filter into the sanitary sewer.  In-Home Air Monitoring  The project to monitor the air inside residences near the OII site began in 1993 to make sure harmful gas migrating underground from the landfill did not accumulate in homes. This project involved bi-annual monitoring of the air inside some homes adjacent to the South Parcel. A few homes were found to have landfill gas problems, and remediation systems were installed following the initial 24-hour testing. With the increased gas collection system and capping that occurred on site, the gas in the landfill became far more controlled. For several years prior to ending the in-home monitoring program in 2001, EPA saw no evidence of an indoor air problem in any of the homes tested. Subsequently, gas collection systems were removed from homes and periodic random sampling was terminated.

Accounting for overall mortality, cancer, liver disease, and pregnancy complications, the results showed no major medical problems arising from consistent exposure to the landfill. However, landfill-neighboring residents reported more incidences of headaches, eye and throat irritation, nausea, insomnia, and fatigue than non-neighboring residents, spurring the county and state health services to pinpoint strong OII odors as the culprit. Designed for short-term assessment, the study recognizes that its method of evaluation lacks insight in possible long-term health problems. Huie, S. \\"Operating Industries, Inc.

Hilgendorf's research on fossil snails from the Steinheim crater in the early 1860s became a palaeontological evidence for the theory of evolution published by Charles Darwin in 1859. Life and work Franz Hilgendorf was born on 5 December 1839 in Neudamm (Mark Brandenburg). Between 1851 and 1854 he went to a gymnasium in K√∂nigsberg (Neumark) and later to the Gymnasium Zum Grauen Kloster (Grey Monastery) in Berlin where he graduated in 1858. In 1859 he started studying philology at the University of Berlin. After four semesters he changed to the University of T√ºbingen. In the summer of 1862 he joined an excavation by Friedrich August Quenstedt in the Steinheim crater. In 1863 Hilgendorf received his Ph.D. for work related to this excavation. He finished his research on the fossils during his time at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin. In 1868, Hilgendorf became director of the aquarium of the Zoological Garden of Hamburg and in 1870 and 1871 he worked as librarian at the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1873 Hilgendorf was appointed lecturer at the Imperial Medical Academy Tokyo. He stayed in Japan from 1873 till 1876 and published articles and collected several specimens of Japanese fauna. He returned to Germany with his collection and worked in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin. He was first responsible for the worms and snails section and from 1896 the fish section. In 1890 Gustav Wilhelm M√ºller identified a new species of ostracod crustacean in the collection of Hilgendorf and named it Cypridina hilgendorfii. This name changed to Vargula hilgendorfii in 1962. Another fish named after Hilgendorf is Helicolenus hilgendorfii of Japan, described in 1884 by Ludwig D√∂derlein. He proposed 36 new species of Japanese fish, 25 of these are valid today. Hilgendorf suffered from a gastric illness. He stopped working in 1903 and died from that illness on 5 July 1904. Evolution Hilgendorf took his doctoral degree in May 1863. His thesis included information on the phylogeny of Planorbis multiformis, a gastropod. He suggested that these organisms had evolved, however, his thesis was never published.Reif, Wolf-Ernst.

His 1866 publication which described the phylogeny of Planorbis multiformis in detail has been described as \\"one of the most important contributions of paleontology to early Darwinism\\". Darwin acknowledged the findings of Hilgendorf and referred to his research in the sixth edition of On the Origin of Species, 1872.

It was built in 1905. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1939The Times, 4 August 1939 and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished, it survived and as of 2010 it was in use by Antler Luggage. The Mill is currently occupied by Baum Trading Ltd and Metzuyan Ltd (an online fashion clothing and accessories company)they have opened a retail outlet with an on site cafe. Location Bury is a town in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Irwell, east of Bolton, west- southwest of Rochdale, and north-northwest of the city of Manchester. Bury is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, of which Bury is the largest settlement and administrative centre. Bury has a total population of 60,718. Historically a part of Lancashire, Bury emerged during the Industrial Revolution as a mill town centred on textile manufacture. Pilot mill is on Alfred Street, close to the centre of the town adjacent to the River Roch and the railway and junction 2 of the M66. History Probate evidence from the 17th century and the remains of 18th century weavers' cottages in Elton, on the west side of Bury, indicate that domestic textile production was an important factor of the local economy at a time when Bury's textile industry was dominated by woollens and based upon the domestic production of yarn and cloth as well as water-powered fulling mills. Development was swift in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The establishment of Brooksbottom Mill, in Summerseat north of the town, as a calico printing works in 1773 by the family of Sir Robert Peel marked the beginning of the cotton industry in Bury. By the early 19th century cotton was the predominant textile industry with the River Roch and River Irwell providing power for spinning mills and processing water for the finishing trades. Development was further promoted when the town was linked to the national canal network by the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal, fully opened in 1808. The canal is provided with water from Elton Reservoir, fed by aqueducts from a weir on the River Irwell, north of what is now the Burrs Country Park. The Burrs is also the site of another mill developed by the Peel family, first founded in 1790. The remains are displayed for the public. There were seven cotton mills in Bury by 1818 and the population grew from 9,152 in 1801 to 58,029 in 1901. Following this, railways opened, linking the town from Bury Bolton Street railway station to Manchester, Radcliffe, Rawtenstall and Accrington and from the old Knowsley Street railway station to the neighbouring mill towns of Bolton, Heywood and Rochdale. As well as the many cotton mills other industries which thrived included paper‚Äìmaking, calico printing and some light engineering. The town expanded to incorporate the former townships of Elton, Walmersley and Heap and rows of terraced housing encircled the town centre by the turn of the 19th century. Districts such as Freetown, Fishpool and Pimhole were transformed from farmers' fields to rows of terraced housing, beside the factories and mills. Pilot Mill is one of the classic late 19th-century spinning mills that were such a feature of other Lancashire towns. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Pilot Mill, Bury was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. After cotton, it lost its chimney and the decorative top to the water tower. Architecture Pilot Mill was a late mill. It had an ornate pyramidal water tower, and its name was displayed on the western side.

The plot revolves around a woman who has to find her brother who has gone missing in Mexico City. Plot The movie begins by showing how the Mexican president's doctor is kidnapped and finally murdered. The reason given is for his opposing political party trying to embarrass him. Mitch Cobb and her brother, Sam, are on their way to Oaxaca to do some exploring. Mitch is not happy in Mexico City; we see in a flash-back why she is with her brother. Here, Mitch confides with Sam the truth about why she is divorced and how her two children were killed in a car wreck. Mitch hates the city and just wants to go back to the Hotel Majestic, near the Zocalo, and sleep until they fly down to Oaxaca the next day. Sam leaves her at the hotel and decides to go visit some bars and drink a little before going to bed. The next morning he has not come back to the hotel. She begins a frantic search. Nobody will help her except Pedro, a taxi driver, who offers to help her look for $100 a day. They finally find the bar where Sam had gone; eventually they even meet his killer, a drug lord, who still has his orange baseball cap and camera. When the US embassy finds out about his camera with film in it, they suddenly take a personal interest in Mitch and now try to be nice to her. The reason is that the president's doctor was murdered behind the same bar where Sam met his murderers, and on the same night. They suspect that he may have photographed the murder scene. He had done just that, and the photographs were strong evidence of the truth. But now Mitch's life is in danger too, because the evil doers want her dead and the pictures. Pedro volunteers to drive her to the Texas border so she will be safe. At 10 kilometers from the border and Mexico City police car stops them. In the ugly exchange that follows Mitch shoots the officer. As she walks across the border she is arrested for that murder. She is forgiven when the photos are finally given to the Mexican president. In an epilogue scene at the end of the movie, she has taken Pedro's advice to start another family; she became a mother to Sam's orphan son; she had found happiness again.

Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was a Boeing 737-260, registration ET-AJA, delivered new to Ethiopian Airlines. At the time of the accident the aircraft was less than a year old. Accident description On , the aircraft was scheduled to operate the second leg of a domestic Addis Ababa‚ÄìBahir Dar‚ÄìAsmara passenger service with 98 passengers and 6 crew members on board. Both engines of the aircraft ingested a flock of speckled pigeons as it took off from Bahir Dar Airport, and subsequently overheated. One of the engines immediately lost thrust, while the other did so on the emergency return to the departure airport. During a gear-up landing, the aircraft caught fire. There is some discrepancy over the death toll depending upon the source, as this number is claimed to be 35 or 31. The discrepancy likely arose because four bodies could not be recovered. All of the fatalities were among the passengers.

The drama features Phyllis Thaxter and Edmund Gwenn.. Plot The story is told as a flashback: It is late at night, and Dr. Bergson (Edmund Gwenn) is dictating case notes to his secretary. He suggests pausing but she is so intrigued by the case that she asks him to continue. On the night of a lovely party celebrating her engagement to Bob Arnold (Harry H. Daniels Jr.), a demure young woman named Joan Ellis (Phyllis Thaxter) at last succumbs to the voice in her head (Audrey Totter) and flees her Midwestern home to New York City, leaving behind a loving family and circle of friends who are shocked, bewildered and frightened for her. She leaves a note asking her parents (Addison Richards, Kathleen Lockhart) not to search for her. Going by the name Joan Smith, she builds a new life in the city and falls in love with Eric Russell (Horace McNally), an attorney. The voice, which calls itself Karen, approves of this mature man, and when Karen emerges, briefly, while they are on a river cruise, she kisses him with a fiercely devouring, possessive passion that is unnerving. When Joan regains control, she asks ‚ÄúWhat did I do?‚Äù and bursts into tears. Eric is very worried, but she won't talk to him about it. (Joan's inability to tell anyone about what she is experiencing adds greatly to the tension and suspense in the film. Repeatedly, the story reaches a point where she might be expected to confide in someone, but the moments always pass.) At last, after a long search, loving, loyal Bob finds her. He is thrilled, but while he is helping her pack, Karen takes control of Joan's right hand and compels her to pick up a pair of scissors and stab him in the back. She is put on trial for murder, a capital offense. Dr. Bergson is brought in as an expert witness; he says that Joan is not insane. She remains silent, and Eric uses this silence to convince the jury that there is more to the story and, whatever the truth may be, she is innocent of murder. After a long deliberation, the jury returns, smiling; clearly they have found her not guilty. In Joan's mind, Karen exults: She will have Eric now, and when she tires of him, he will meet the same fate as Bob. Joan leaps to her feet screaming over and over ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guilty!‚Äù In prison awaiting execution, Joan refuses to explain to anyone. Lying on her cot in utter misery, she weakly murmurs to Eric ‚ÄúI want to die. When I die, she dies.‚Äù This sets Dr. Bergson thinking, and, with the execution imminent, he persuades the governor (Minor Watson) to listen to his theory‚Äîthat here are two women living in one body, one guilty and one innocent. He takes a book from the governor's library shelf that addresses this very subject, but it is unread, and he has to ask the governor's wife (Virginia Brissac) for a paper knife to slit some pages. Eric is also present. Saying grimly ‚ÄúThere will be an execution tonight,‚Äù Dr. Bergson hypnotizes Joan. In the film, Joan and Karen emerge‚Äîtransparent, in the classic photographic representation of spirits‚Äîand stand on each side of Joan's seated form. Karen wears heavy make up and her expression is a feral smile. Neither entity speaks. Dr. Bergstrom tells Joan that she is getting stronger and Karen that she is getting weaker‚Äîdying in fact. Under his repeated assaults, the image of Karen fades and disappears. Joan slumps forward into Eric's arms and then straightens, smiling.

It opens and closes with a voice over that justifies the telling of Joan's story at such a time. According to Jeremy Arnold at TCM.com, the film ‚Äúhad an extremely low budget. But Oboler's radio expertise made the most of it, and he filled the picture with stylistic flourishes that came from radio. The use of sound effects, editing, stylized dialogue, and heightened, punchy music all reveal the radio influence. The music, in fact, was so important to Oboler that he fought to get a good composer who was actually scoring 'A' movies - Bronislau Kaper, who had just finished scoring Gaslight(1944) and Without Love (1945). Finally, Oboler gave Thaxter's evil personality its own voice, well supplied by an unbilled Audrey Totter, a film noir fixture (Lady in the Lake (1947), Tension, 1950) whose career began in radio in 1939.‚Äù Critical reception When the film was first released, the staff at Variety liked it and wrote \\"Produced on a low budget, with a sterling cast of actors' actors, this picture just oozes with class because of the excellent adaptation and direction it has been given by radio's Arch Oboler, author of the story \\"Alter Ego\\", on which the film is based. Climax follows climax, strong performance follows strong performance in this thrilling psychopathic study of a girl obsessed by an inner voice that drives her to murder.\\"Variety.

Referred to as the \\"father of Bulgarian graphic design\\" and the \\"master of the trademark\\", Kanchev authored around 1,600 logos, including logos for the National Palace of Culture, National Art Gallery, National Opera and Ballet, Bulgarian National Television, Union of Bulgarian Artists, TZUM, International Fair Plovdiv, and Petrol AD. Early life Kanchev was born 6 August 1915 in Kalofer, a town in the sub-Balkan valleys of south central Bulgaria (then the Kingdom of Bulgaria). The son of an icon painter, he enrolled at the National Academy of Arts in the capital Sofia when he was 25, where he studied mural painting in 1940‚Äì1945 under Dechko Uzunov. Career After leaving the National Academy of Arts shortly before graduation, Kanchev took part in exhibitions and biennales in Bulgaria and abroad over the next 22 years, including Belgrade, Budapest, Berlin, Moscow, Warsaw, Brno, Ljubljana and New York City. During this time, individual exhibitions of his work were organized in Sofia, Moscow, Prague, Berlin, Warsaw and Budapest, among other cities. In 1967 when he was 52, Kanchev participated in an AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) international exhibition in which he presented 23 of his logos, including his Petrol AD trademark. Fifteen years later, in 1982, Japanese magazine Idea ran a 16-page feature on Kanchev and his work. At the age of 79 in 1994 he was named among the world's top ten trademark artists along with Paul Rand and Saul Bass. Kanchev died on 22 August 2001. In June 2009, the premier Sofia Design Week featured an exhibition dedicated to Kanchev's logos. Themes and styles Kanchev's work spanned most varieties of applied art, though he was most productive in his trademark and logo work and as a designer of book covers, posters, greetings cards, print advertisements, stamps, product labels and packaging. As a designer, Kanchev was often inspired by traditional Bulgarian art and folklore. Reception According to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Encyclopedia of Fine Arts in Bulgaria, Kanchev's work \\"was distinguished by rich imagination, even and clear composition, successful relation between type and image, clean shapes [and] original artistic ideas that entirely fulfill the content of the work\\". In the words of artist and critic Ivan Nenov, \\"[Kanchev's] trademarks are entirely new, modern without being merely fashionable...

Berenberg as he appeared in 1932. David Paul Berenberg (March 17, 1890 ‚Äì March 7, 1974) was an American socialist teacher, editor, and writer. He is best remembered as a founder and editor of The American Socialist Quarterly, the theoretical magazine of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) during the 1930s. Biography Early years David P. Berenberg was born March 17, 1890, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Bernhard Berenberg, a real estate broker.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 15. Berenberg attended public schools in Brooklyn before going on to attend City College of New York, from which he graduated in 1912. Upon graduation from City College, Berenberg was employed as a public school teacher, a vocation which he continued from 1913 until 1918, when he resigned his post under fire for his socialist political views. He was not relicensed as a teacher in New York state until 1923. At the end of the 1920s, Berenberg went into partnership with a friend named Clifford Hall and purchased a college preparatory school in New York City called The Franklin School, an academy which specialized in helping to place Jewish boys from less-than-elite families into Ivy League colleges. The pair ran the school together until Hall's death in the late 1940s. Political career In 1918, Berenberg was named the manager of the correspondence department of the Socialist Party's Rand School of Social Science, which was in charge of conducting correspondence courses with adults around the country interested in taking courses in the social sciences. He remained in this position until 1921, working after that date as a teacher on site at the Rand School, conducting classes in English, History, and various topics related to Socialism. Berenberg remained an employee of the Rand School continuously until his firing early in 1936, an action resulting from Berenberg's factional affiliation in the rough and tumble internal Socialist Party politics of the day. Berenberg was a candidate for public office on the Socialist Party ticket on a number of different occasions, running for office each year from 1918 through 1924, inclusive. In 1918 and again in 1923 he stood as a candidate for the New York State Assembly. In 1919 and again in 1921 he ran for New York City Council. In 1920 Berenberg ran for New York State Senate, while in 1922 and again in 1924 he ran for U.S. Congress. A factional war swept the Socialist Party in 1919. The battle pitted an organized Left Wing faction ‚Äî headed by Alfred Wagenknecht, L.E. Katterfeld, C.E. Ruthenberg, Alexander Stoklitsky, and Nicholas Hourwich ‚Äî against an equally organized faction of \\"Party Regulars\\" led by Executive Secretary Adolph Germer, James Oneal, and Julius Gerber, Berenberg found himself solidly in the latter camp. When well known Left Wing adherent John Reed launched a weekly newspaper called The New York Communist in April 1919, Berenberg was not long in launching a counter-voice, The New York Socialist. In The New York Socialist Berenberg allowed the Regulars to present their side in the factional debates. This new rival proved to be too tempting a target for the sophomorish Reed to ignore. On May 17, The New York Socialist appeared as usual at the Rand School. It was not until several thousand issues had been distributed that it was discovered that the document being distributed was an exact replica of Berenberg's publication created by Reed and his partner in crime, Eadmonn MacAlpine. The parody issue prominently featured a speech purported to have been delivered by Louis Waldman, a prominent leader of the Regular faction on April Fool's Day. In this mock speech, Waldman was portrayed as attacking the Left Wing with the words: > So evident is their intention to disrupt the party that it has been > necessary to expel all Left Wing branches and exclude the members from any > vote on party affairs. If this is not disrupting the party, what > is?Granville Hicks with John Stuart, John Reed: The Making of a > Revolutionary. New York: Macmillan, 1936; pg. 350. The complete parody issue > appears in the Greenwood Reprint Corporation's bound reprint of The New York > Socialist, published in 1969. Following a series of suspensions and expulsions by the Socialist Party's governing National Executive Committee which tilted the playing field, the 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party resulted in a resounding victory for Germer, Oneal, and the Regulars. Outmaneuvered and split over tactics, the Left Wing exited the SPA to form not one, but two organizations ‚Äî the Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party of America. The victory proved costly, however. The Socialist Party lost a large percentage of its membership in the factional war, the number of its dues-payers plummeting from more than 100,000 to barely a tenth of that number, and the organizationation entered into a decade of decline. The Socialist Party began to rebound in the late 1920s, with an influx of young and energetic members entering the party under the inspiration of the party's Presidential candidate, Norman Thomas and through the solid organizing efforts of new National Executive Secretary Clarence Senior. January 1932 saw the launch of a new publication, the realization of David P. Berenberg's dream ‚Äî The American Socialist Quarterly. The publication's debut issue noted that, while not an official publication, the ASQ was published by three members of the Socialist Party who believed that: > * the Marxian theories are the philosophic basis of the Socialist Movement; > * that Socialist activity should always be predicated on the class struggle; > * that by democratic methods, and not by methods of cabal and dictatorship > will Socialism be attained; * that work among the unions, that the > industrial organization of labor, is of equal importance with political > action; * that political action is necessary...for the establishment of the > Socialist Commonwealth; * that the mere winning of votes and of office is > meaningless...unless the Socialist objective is always before the movement; > * that the Socialist Party should not enter into fusions or coalitions with > groups that do not accept the Socialist philosophy; * that Russia is not > sacrosanct; that the theories and the acts of the Soviet Republic are as > properly subject to critical comment as are the theories and acts of other > governments.\\"The American Socialist Quarterly,\\" The American Socialist > Quarterly, vol. 1, no. 1 (January 1932), pg. 4. David Berenberg in his early seventies. Such an orientation seems to have been broadly reflective of the views of others in the party and The American Socialist Quarterly, was named the official organ of the Socialist Party by the National Executive Committee in the fall of 1934.David P. Berenberg, \\"Support the Socialist Monthly,\\" Socialist Party 35th Anniversary Journal: 1936 National Convention, Cleveland, May 23-May 26, Chicago: Socialist Party, 1936; pg. 29. Berenberg was a frequent contributor to The Socialist Call, the weekly newspaper established by the Left Wing opposition to the Old Guard in 1935. He launched a periodic column in this publication late in 1935 entitled \\"What Does It Mean?\\" making use of the pseudonym \\"David Paul.\\"Jeffrey B. Perry, \\"Pseudonyms: A Reference Aid for Studying American Communist History.\\" American Communist History, vol. 3, no. 1 (June 2004), pg. 93. Later years Berenberg seems to have been discouraged from radical politics by the bitter factional struggle and series of splits which decimated the Socialist Party in 1936 and 1937. His last political pamphlet was published in 1934 and his name was removed from the masthead of The American Socialist Monthly effective with the May 1937 issue.David P. Berenberg, \\"Five to Four,\\" American Socialist Monthly, vol. 6, no. 1 (May 1937), pp. 23-25. He did contribute a book review to the successor to the ASM, a larger format publication called Socialist Review, as late as the January 1938 issue. Berenberg ran The Franklin School in New York City until Clifford Hall's death at the end of the 1940s. Thereafter, Berenberg retired and moved to Long Island, where he stayed intellectually engaged by conducting literary book clubs. His wife, Rose, died in 1970, at which time Berenberg moved to Pennsylvania to be near a daughter who lived there. David P. Berenberg's died on March 7, 1974.

The technological evolution of the instrument led to increased interest in its capabilities and sound among such composers as Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, and Hector Berlioz. Initially used only outdoors, the instrument underwent modifications in the 16th and 17th centuries that led to its incorporation into chamber ensembles. During the 18th and 19th centuries, modifications in its design and construction, and rising interest in the symphony orchestra led to changes not only to the ensemble's size, but also to composers' use of specific instruments within the orchestra. These new and challenging compositional demands influenced the design of the timpani, how timpanists play the instrument, and also helped to raise the standard of playing to a whole new level. The combination of composers' and players' interest in the timpani during the 18th and 19th centuries helped to make the instrument what it is today. Pre-18th-century timpani construction and use 13th‚Äì15th-century timpani use and development A drawing depicting Medieval Nakers The timpani is considerably older than other melodic percussion instruments, such as the marimba and xylophone. Music historians trace the instrument's history to ancient times when the drums were used in religious ceremonies. During the 13th century, timpani began to be used in pairs and were called Nakers, or Nakirs. These drums were small, usually between , and were used primarily by the military.Edmund A. Bowles. \\"The Double, Double, Double Beat of the Thundering Drum: The Timpani in Early Music.\\" Early Music. 19, no. 3 : August 1991, pp. 419‚Äì435 The construction of these drums was composed of a shell made of either metal or wood and a head, which was connected directly to the shell of the drum and did not allow for the drums pitch to be altered at all. The drums themselves were tuned to fixed pitches and were usually tuned to an interval of a fourth or a fifth.G. Finger. \\"The history of the timpani.\\" Percussionist. 11, no. 3: Spring, 1974: pp. 101‚Äì111 These drums were used until the 15th century, when cavalry such as the Mongols, Muslims and Ottoman Turks would mount timpani-like drums on horseback. These drums were much larger than those previously used and were very similar to the drums that would be later used in the orchestra.James Blades. Percussion Instruments and Their History. London @ Boston: Faber and Faber, 1984, pp. 226‚Äì230 The instrument itself was made of a large metal or copper bowl and had an animal skin, usually goat, pulled tight across the bowl. Europeans added a system of screw-tension to allow for more precise tuning of the heads. Combined with the development of the so-called Counter hoop, the system created greater resonance and more precise pitch. A \\"Counter Hoop\\" is a hoop that is placed over the head of the drum and uses some type of screw or rod mechanism to connect the hoop to the bowl. This allowed for the head itself to not be directly attached to the bowl and thus provides a way for the head to vibrate more freely as well as be fine-tuned more easily. Early European use of timpani A modern representation of horse mounted Cavalry Timpani A Fresco from Our Lady's chapel in Altenmarkt depicting the pairing of the timpani and trumpet The horse-mounted timpani of the Ottoman Empire was sure to be one of the sources of inspiration for the European adoption of timpani into their cavalry. Having timpani in the cavalry was rare and the drums were only awarded to the most elite of groups. The drums were paired with trumpeters and announced the arrival of the armies.Henry W. Taylor. The Timpani. London: John Baker Publishers Ltd., 1964, pp. 22‚Äì24 Both the trumpeters and the timpanists were highly regarded and were often placed close to a commander when in battle. This relationship between the trumpet and timpani continued for many centuries. As empires in Europe gave way to royal courts, the timpani and trumpet pairing continued to be used, but they were now used as more of an image-builder for the nobility. It was common for emperors, dukes, lords and others of high rank to travel with a timpanist and trumpeter to emphasize the importance of their social rank.Finger, pp. 109‚Äì111 Those who possessed timpani were an exclusive group. This meant that timpanists themselves were only allowed to be employed by nobility and were not to interact with other instrumentalists, who were considered to be household employees of an inferior rank. As a result, guilds were formed by timpanists and trumpeters and members were treated as an elite group.Edmund A. Bowles. The Timpani: A History in Pictures and Documents. Hillsdale, NY: Pendragon Press, 2002, pp. 16‚Äì17 Timpani move indoors A 17th-century timpani Although the timpani was still considered primarily an outdoor instrument, it started being used during indoor concerts to provide rhythmic support for trumpet fanfares. Most of the time, players would not have written music to follow because parts were handed down from generation to generation and were learned by rote. By the 17th century, the timpani moved indoors for good and composers began to demand more from timpanists than ever before. The timpani was first introduced to the court orchestras and opera ensembles as well as in larger church works.P.A. Browne. \\"The Orchestral Treatment of the Timpani.\\" Music & Letters. October 1923, pp. 335‚Äì336 Due to this move indoors, a much more formalized way of playing and approaching the timpani was developed. The old practice of learning parts by rote gave way to written music and composers began writing more regularly for the timpani. More notes were written than just two simultaneous pitches and as a result, timpanists were faced with the issue of how to actually play their parts on the equipment that they already had.P.A. Browne, pp. 338‚Äì339 One possible solution was for timpanists to add more drums to their set-up, but this also created a problem: During this time, performances often took place in courts or at smaller theaters that had limited stage space and large timpani set-ups did not fit very well. Timpanists at this time were faced with a problem; using a large, cumbersome set of timpani to play their parts would not be possible due to space restraints. However, a solution was found, and with the help of technological advancements during the 18th century in Europe, devices were developed and added to the drums to change the pitch. These changes allowed for a single drum to play more than just two notes. This provided a way for timpanists to not only play their parts more easily but also use fewer drums. Technological developments in the timpani First advancement in rapid tuning Around this time, Europe was beginning to enter an era of industrial revolution, and new technological breakthroughs helped provide timpanists with possible ways to alter the pitch on one of their drums. The first major advancement is believed to have been made by Gerhard Cramer in 1812. The new orchestral works required faster tuning of the timpani. He worked with a court locksmith and the royal armorer to make his first set of drums.Edmund A. Bowles. \\"Nineteenth-Century innovations in the Use and Construction of the Timpani\\" Percussionist. Vol 19 n2, Official Publication of The Percussive Arts Society. 1982 pp. 38‚Äì41 Although no diagrams or drawings of what the drums actually looked like exist, there are several rough descriptions of how the drums worked. The kettle of the drum was attached to a wooden base. Rods curved down along the kettle and connected the counter hoop to a threaded hole at the bottom of the bowl. There was a bolt inside of the threaded hole that allowed for the entire mechanism to be raised and lowered. In order for the bolt to be turned and the drum to move, there were several levers that led to a larger vertical lever that came out of the wooden base and when moved would either raise or lower the bowl, thus changing the pitch. Rotating timpani The next breakthrough in rapid tuning came around 1815 when Johann Stumpff, a musician and inventor from Amsterdam invented a way for a drum's pitch to be changed by physically rotating the instrument. Similar to Cramer's design, rods attached the counter hoop to a metal ring below the bowl. Unlike Cramer's design, Stumpff added a second metal ring that was attached to the legs supporting the kettle.Edmund A. Bowles. \\"Innovations\\", pp. 41‚Äì44 The bottom ring was threaded and a long bolt extended from the base of the drum up through the threaded ring and attached to the second ring. As the bowl and counter hoop rotated, the counter hoop would move up and down but the bowl would remain stationary. This allowed for different levels of tension to be placed on the counter hoop and, as a result, produced different pitches. This invention was popular because it was cheap to manufacture, worked well, and was easy to transport, which made these drums ideal for traveling orchestras.Bowles, \\"Timpani, pp. 42‚Äì43 However, the fact that players had to put down the mallets before rotating the drums was a major drawback. First suspended kettle In 1836, Johann Kasper Einbigler designed a drum that not only was easier to tune than previous models, but also provided a far superior tone quality.James Blades. Percussion Instruments and Their History. London & Boston: Faber and Faber, 1984, p. 277 He was able to improve the tone quality by suspending the kettle with struts that were attached to the top of the kettle. This differed from previous models on which the rods were actually attached the side of the kettle. The struts on Einbigler's drum were directly connected to the support system under the drum and this allowed for the kettle to resonate more freely.Robert Bridge. \\"Timpani Construction paper.\\" Retrieved 12 February 2010 The tuning mechanism of these drums combined aspects of both Cramer and Stumpff's designs. There were rods that attached the counter hoop to a ring, or what is known today as a spider, which was located under the kettle. The spider was connected to an arm under the base which was raised and lowered by a vertical tuning crank to change the pitch of the drums. There were many reasons why these drums were so successful. Besides the already mentioned more freely resonating kettle, this system of tuning was much quieter than the previous designs, allowing timpanists to change the drum's pitch during quiet parts of the music. First foot-activated tuning system In 1840, August Knocke, a gunsmith who lived in Munich designed the first set of drums where the tuning was done using the player's foot rather than hands.Blades, Percussion History, p. 278 He used a similar two-ring design where one ring remained stationary and the other moved up and down to alter the pitch. Gears were attached to the rings and another separate ring was connected that would be turned by the player's foot to alter the pitch. This foot-activated tuning ring replaced the vertical lever which was previously used to change the pitch. These drums also utilized the suspended kettle to provide the best tone quality possible. These drums were commonly used in German orchestras at the time and one of the most notable groups to use these drums was the court theater in Munich. These drums received numerous accolades during the mid-19th century. They received honorable mention at The Great Exhibition (1851) in London as well as receiving a medal of honor at the 1854 German Industrial Exhibition in Munich at the Glaspalast.Bridge. \\"Timpani Construction.\\" Retrieved 12 February 2010 Pfundt/Hoffmann drums A drawing of timpanist and designer Ernst Pfundt playing his newly developed drums These drums came about as a result of several modifications that were made to the Einbigler drums. The changes were suggested by timpani virtuoso of the time Ernst Gotthold Pfundt, as well as Carl Hoffmann and Friedrich Hentschel. The changes they made to the drum included a much larger fork- shaped support for the kettle which was attached the very rim of the kettle as well using heavier iron for the assembly of the drum to provide much more support.Edmund A. Bowles. \\"Innovations. pp. 55‚Äì58 These drums also replaced the previously thin spider with a solid disk that was attached to the rocker arm under the drum by a very strong vertical axle. This stronger base and spider allowed for fine tunings to be done with much more ease. Timpani scholar Edmund Bowles summarizes the changes by saying, \\"Their contribution was a single, threaded crank acting upon a threaded lever that controlled the armature to which the tuning rods were attached. More significant was the fact that this simple device multiplied the force transmitted to the base plate by the tuning crank, making for a far more efficient and powerful mechanism.\\"Bowles, \\"Innovations, pp. 60‚Äì64 These drums were also very highly regarded, as they received honorable mentions at both the Vienna World Fair in 1873 and the Dresden Trade Show in 1875. Dresden model A modern example of the \\"Dresden\\" foot pedal The last great development in timpani construction during the 19th century came in 1881 when Carl Pittrich, the Kapelldiener (German: Chapel Servant) in the Royal Saxon Orchestra, developed a foot pedal mechanism that could be attached to a timpani and made quick tuning changes much easier.Bowles, Timpani, pp. 53‚Äì56 This system was first developed to be an addition to the Pfundt/Hoffmann drums and was manufactured by Ernst Queisser. Later, Paul Focke manufactured the complete drum and pedal system in Dresden, Germany, thus giving it name of the \\"Dresden Model\\". The system worked by having a pedal that had a heavy counter weight at the top which was then connected to a rod at the bottom of the pedal. Using a series of gears and couplings, this rod was attached to the rocker arm underneath the kettle. The pedal had a clutch on it that allowed for the player to disengage the pedal when they desired to change the pitch. When the pedal was disengaged and moved up or down, the rod connecting to the rocker arm would be moved in either direction and as a result, the tension on the timpani head would be altered, providing a change in pitch. Once the desired pitch was reached, the player could re-engage the clutch and the pedal as well as the pitch would stay stationary.Bridge. \\"Timpani Construction,\\" Retrieved 12 February 2010 This new pedal system not only allowed for the drums' pitches to be changed faster, easier, and more accurately, but it also allowed for the hands of the timpanist to remain free to play and not be bothered with changing the drums pitch during a performance. Changes in timpani composition Haydn's timpani writing Haydn was one of the first composers to write a pitch change as well as a written out solo for the timpani in a symphonic movement. Until the late 18th century, written music for the timpani consisted of very simple rhythms with the drums usually only being played at major cadence points in the music. It was rare if the timpani were not playing along with the trumpets, and composers would often use the drums to add dramatic effect to trumpet notes and brass chords. However, this compositional pattern began to change as Austrian composer Joseph Haydn started utilizing the timpani in new ways. Haydn had learned the instrument, and performed on it in public, while he was a child attending boarding school in Hainburg, Austria. He remained interested in the timpani and new effects for them throughout his career.Reference, with extended discussion of timpani in Haydn: Blades (1992:259-261) In Haydn's Symphony No. 94, one of the earliest examples of the timpanist being required to change the pitch of a single drum within a symphonic movement is found. In measures 131‚Äì134 of the original autographed score, Haydn writes for a change in the timpani part from G and D to A and D.Joseph Haydn. London Symphonies Nos. 93‚Äì98 in Full Score. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc. 1997, p.58 In order to allow for the timpanist to change the pitch of the drum, Haydn left plenty of measures rest in between the last G and the first A, and then did the same for when the drum is to be tuned back down to the G again. Another example of Haydn's progressive writing for the timpani can be found by looking at his Symphony No. 100, also known as the \\"Military\\" Symphony. Previous to this symphony, it was a rarity for the timpani to play a solo passage in a symphonic work. In the \\"Military\\" symphony, Haydn separates the timpani from the trumpet and horn and actually writes out a solo passage for the timpanist. In measure 159 of the second movement, the entire orchestra drops out and only the timpani plays with two measures of sixteenth notes. Haydn uses a crescendo through these two measures to help build up intensity before the entire orchestra erupts into a loud, driving passage.Joseph Haydn. London Symphonies Nos. 99‚Äì104 in Full Score. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1999, p. 92 In measure 122 of the final movement, Haydn again has the entire orchestra drop out and writes another measure solo for the timpani. Before this solo, Haydn has the orchestra playing quite softly which makes the timpani's loud entrance come as a surprise and helps to set up a loud entrance by the orchestra.Haydn. London Symphonies Nos. 99‚Äì104, p. 110 Haydn's use of writing specific solos for the timpani can also be seen in the very opening measure of his Symphony No. 103. This entire symphony begins with a timpani solo, and because of this, it has received the nickname of the \\"Drum Roll\\" symphony.Joseph Haydn. London Symphonies Nos. 99‚Äì104 in Full Score Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1999 p. 251 Beethoven's timpani writing Beethoven played a crucial role in advancing timpani writing by not only extending the written range of the timpani, but also including more extended techniques like double stops. Like Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven began one of his famous works, his Violin Concerto, with a timpani solo. Unlike in the Drum Roll symphony, Beethoven's solo actually forms the opening theme; the same notes when they reappear in the recapitulation section (m. 365) are played by the full orchestra. Beethoven had a reputation for composing the music that he wanted to hear, and was not much concerned with the instruments' limitations in his writing. This can be seen in his writing for the timpani. In his Symphony No. 7, he requires the timpanist to tune the drums for the first time ever in a symphonic work to an interval larger than a fifth. In the third movement of this symphony, Beethoven has the timpanist tune the drums to a minor sixth of F and A.Ludwig van Beethoven. Symphonies Nos. 5, 6, and 7 in Full Score, Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1989, p. 209 He continued to expand the range of the timpani when writing his 8th symphony. In the final Allegro vivace movement, Beethoven writes for the timpani to play octave F's, something that had not been required of a timpanist in a symphonic movement until this time.Ludwig van Beethoven. Symphonies Nos. 8 and 9 in Full Score Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1989, p. 36 In his Symphony No. 9, Beethoven presents some of the most advanced timpani writing to be seen by any composer yet. In the second movement of the piece, he again writes for the timpani to be tuned to octave F's, but also writes numerous loud solo passages throughout the movement for the timpani to play.Beethoven, Symphonies Nos. 8 and 9, p. 119 The third movement of this same symphony also presents a new challenge for timpanists, as Beethoven requires that two drums be played at the same time for the last five measures of the movement to make the sound of a double stop.Beethoven, Symphonies Nos. 8 and 9 in Full Score, p. 164 Berlioz's timpani writing Hector Berlioz (pictured in 1863) helped to continue to expand the timpani's compositional possibilities in the orchestra with his radical timpani writing in his Symphonie Fantastique and Grande Messe des Morts. Hector Berlioz further expanded the timpani's abilities in his compositions. In the composing of his great programmatic piece Symphonie Fantastique, Berlioz actually wrote for two individual sets of timpani to be used. At one point during the piece, starting two measures after rehearsal number forty-nine in the third movement to be exact, Berlioz even writes a timpani part to be played by four timpanists.Hector Berlioz. Symphonie Fantastique and Harold in Italy in Full Score. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1984, pg 75 The last two movements of the piece also utilize two timpanists throughout, with each player using a set of two timpani and having to play challenging rhythms and make several tuning changes. Berlioz also employed unusual timpani scoring in his Grande Messe des Morts. For the Dies Irae, Berlioz requests 8 pairs of timpani, 2 of which have two players (for double-stop rolls). They are tuned for the diatonic notes of the E major scale, plus G and A. This permits a continuous and harmonious timpani roll starting a bar before rehearsal number 20 for 16 bars. The timpani have multiple notes available no matter what the underlying harmonies may be. Similarly, in the Lacrymosa, he calls for 16 timpani in three doubled pairs (12) plus two single.http://imslp.eu/Files/imglnks/euimg/b/b6/IMSLP109081-PMLP41675-NBE_- _Grande_messe_des_morts_-_VI._Lacrimosa.pdf They are tuned to the diatonic scale of G major, from low F to E, with an additional D. (This is along with 4 choirs of brass instruments.) Again there is a continuous timpani roll from shortly after rehearsal number 58 to rehearsal number 59. In the final movement, the Agnus Dei, 8 players play pairs of timpani tuned to nearly all the diatonic notes of G major from low F to D (E is missing). Starting just before rehearsal number 102, all 8 players play the same rhythm on the G major triad. Berlioz's radical use of the timpani in Symphonie Fantastique and Grande Messe des Morts demonstrated how much the compositional practices of the instrument had progressed from that of Mozart and Haydn, but composers continued to challenge timpanists as they wrote more and more difficult passages in their compositions. Schumann's timpani writing Schumann was one of the first composers to write for three timpani rather than just two. When composer Robert Schumann revised his Symphony No. 1, he made the timpani part considerably more difficult that required three timpani rather than the standard two-drum set.Bowles, \\"Timpani. pp. 55‚Äì57 The first movement of Schumann's Symphony No. 1, demonstrates how the composer utilized the three different drum pitches to support the harmonies and orchestration.Robert Schumann. Complete Symphonies in Full Score Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1980. p. 39 Some music historians conclude that Schumann's cousin-in-law Ernst Pfundt, the main timpanist in Leipzig and a prominent figure in timpani development, suggested the use of three machines. Regardless, Schumann understood the harmonic possibilities of three drums and realized that the score would not require as many rests to allow the timpanist enough time to re-tune the drums. The use of three timpani quickly became the standard configuration. With the invention of the \\"Dresden\\" foot pedal system, composers writing for the timpani had nearly limitless compositional possibilities. Impact of the \\"Dresden\\" timpani on compositions Richard Strauss utilized the invention of the Dresden foot pedal in his music to write more melodically for the timpani. The impact of the Dresden timpani on composers could be seen in Giuseppe Verdi's opera Otello (1887). The timpani part in Act 1 would not be possible to play without the use of at least three pedal timpani.Giuseppe Verdi. Otello in Full Score. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1986. p. 24 Verdi required the timpanist to quickly change the pitch of the drums while also sustaining a roll, demonstrating the composer's understanding of how the pedal timpani worked. It would not be possible for the timpanist to play a sustained note and simultaneously change the pitch of another drum without using a set of pedal timpani. As time went on and word got around as to how well the new foot-pedal timpani worked, more and more orchestras purchased Pittrich's \\"Dresden\\" style timpani, and it was not long until almost all timpanists were playing on foot-tuned drums.Bowles, Timpani. pp. 70-73 The rapid increase in popularity of these new drums sparked the start of a new era in composing for the timpani. Gone were the old ways of timpanists only playing the tonic and dominant. Composers began to write increasingly involved parts for the timpani and sought ways to challenge the timpanist, both technically and melodically. Richard Strauss's compositions included timpani parts with very difficult rhythmic passages and challenging tuning changes that could only be played using a set of pedal timpani. For example, in the final waltz in Act 3 of his opera, Der Rosenkavalier, Strauss wrote for the timpani the way he wrote for the bass, with a long, walking melodic line. He accomplished this by requiring the timpanist to make many quick and challenging changes in the drums pitch that imitated the walking bassline that occurs throughout the entire waltz.Richard Strauss.

It was the first documented strike in North America. Skilled craftsmen were sent by the Virginia Company to Jamestown to produce pitch, tar, and turpentine used for shipbuilding. When the colony held its first election in 1619, many settlers were not allowed to vote on the grounds that they were not of English descent, and they went on strike. Due to the importance of the skilled workers in producing valuable naval stores for the colony, company leaders bowed to labor pressure and gave full voting rights to continental workers. History John Smith first encountered and was impressed with the talents of Polish craftsmen when he traveled through Poland in 1602, fleeing the Turks who had imprisoned him. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was then the largest kingdom of Europe, covering the present territory of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldavia and parts of Russia. Craftsman glassblower in Jamestown, Virginia, circa 1608. Early in Jamestown's history, Smith and the Virginia Company began recruiting workers from mainland Europe to come to their new colony. The first of these foreign workers came with the second group of settlers who arrived in the colony in 1608; two of these workers would later save Smith's life in an attack by Native Americans as noted in Smith's writings. Contemporary historical accounts refer to this first group of foreign craftsmen as Dutchmen and Poles. The foreign craftsmen began producing glassware, pitch, and potash soon after their arrival in 1608. These goods were used in the colony, but were also important as they were the first goods exported from the colony to Europe. Later more skilled workers arrived and continued to produce tar, resin, and turpentine, and clapboard and frankincense as well. When the first elections in the colony were held in 1619, the colony did not allow any continental settlers to vote. They were denied the right to vote on the grounds that they were not of English descent. The craftsmen in response, refused to work unless they were given the right to vote. Under this labor pressure, the Virginia Company's Council reversed the decision to disenfranchise the craftsmen, and simultaneously struck an agreement with the craftsmen to apprentice young men from the colony. The company leaders feared not only the loss of income and labor, but that the colony might gain a reputation for not being welcoming to further settlers not of English descent, especially skilled craftsmen.

He quickly is attracted to Beth Dixon, a switchboard operator and a former personal assistant to lodge owner Edmund Parry. The murder of playgirl Marsha Morgan, her throat cut, disrupts the peace and quiet. Sheriff Holmes begins the investigation, starting with the wheelchair-bound Parry, who admits to hating the dead woman, and Parry's possessive sister Julia, who helps him run the lodge. It turns out David once dated Morgan as well. A new guest, Joseph Felton, checks in. The sheriff's suspects also include guests Norman Grant, a drunken actor, and his ambitious girlfriend, Harriet Ames. A missing kitchen knife believed to be the murder weapon is found by Indian Joe, who works at the lodge. Beth eavesdrops on a phone call Felton makes from his room. Felton is later found killed by a gunshot, and it turns out he was a private detective. David becomes more and more convinced that the Parrys are behind all this. Ames is seen kissing Edmund Parry, which does not please Edmund's sister or Grant.

Accident Shortly after takeoff, as the aircraft reached an altitude of 29,000 feet during its climb, one of its main wheels failed catastrophically inside the undercarriage bay, exploding and creating a hole in the fuselage and cabin floor. An emergency descent was initiated, followed by a successful landing at Qatar's Doha International Airport. Two passengers were killed when they were ejected through the hole in the cabin floor. Probable cause The probable cause of the incident was determined to be a fatigue failure of a flange on the hub of one of the main landing gear wheels. This failure had resulted in one of the tires blowing out. The debris from this explosion had penetrated the cabin of the airplane, causing the explosive decompression. B.F. Goodrich Co. and Lockheed were found to share responsibility for their failure to assess safety hazards associated with this particular wheel design. In addition, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was found to have had inadequate oversight of the manufacturers.  Aftermath  The aircraft involved in 1996, 16 years after the accident. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service with Saudia.

Floyd, once a large and powerful hurricane, made landfall in North Carolina and weakened as it tracked northward along the U.S. East Coast. By September 17, 1999, the storm, downgraded in strength to a tropical storm, was situated over New England. It produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds throughout the entire region, leading to widespread downing of trees and extensive power outages before it moved away later that day. In Danbury, Connecticut, Floyd triggered severe flooding, considered the worst in 40 years, that damaged hundreds of homes. Precipitation in some areas amounted to , with wind gusts approaching hurricane force in Massachusetts. Background Floyd's origins are traced back to a westward-moving tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression on September 7, 1999, while centered east of the Lesser Antilles. The system moved west-northwestward, and intensified into a tropical storm on September 8. Continuing to intensify, Floyd attained hurricane strength on September 10. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale as it struck the Bahamas. The storm turned northwestward and soon northward, brushing the coast of Florida and the southeast United States. On September 16, Floyd made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane in North Carolina, and moved northeastward along the Eastern Seaboard. It passed through the Mid-Atlantic States as it deteriorated into a tropical storm, and lost its tropical identity over southern Maine. Preparations On September 15, an existing tropical storm watch was extended northward to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. The next day, a tropical storm warning was extended northward to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but was soon replaced by a hurricane warning. The watch stretching to the Merrimack River was then replaced by a warning. By 0900 UTC on September 17, all tropical cyclone advisories were lifted. In Connecticut, utility companies readied supplies and emergency crews in advance of the hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with the anticipation of heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught. The storm disrupted many residents' travel plans in the state, while people evacuated from certain coastal communities. The threat of Hurricane Floyd forced schools, malls, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst to close. Impact Southern New England In Connecticut, the storm caused one casualty: a man drowned after boating in the swollen Quinnipiac River. The storm caused extensive flooding and serious damage. Wind gusts exceeding , combined with the saturated ground, brought down many trees and triggered severe power outages in the area. As Floyd tracked up the Connecticut River Valley towards Massachusetts, it dropped heavy precipitation. The heaviest rainfall occurred in a southwest‚Äìnortheast orientated swath from northern New Jersey to southwestern Connecticut, including southeastern New York. At the Danbury Airport, of rain was reported. Rainfall rates of per hour occurred at Bethel and Danbury. Numerous rivers overflowed; for example, the Still River and its tributaries triggered severe flooding. The worst of the flooding‚Äîconsidered the worst in 40 years‚Äîtook place at Danbury. Hundreds of homes, two car dealerships, several roads, and other structures were damaged there. At Greentree Motors, all 200 vehicles were declared a total loss. Parts of the city were submerged with of water. However, throughout the state, roads were closed and basements were inundated. The flooding inflicted at least $1.3 million in monetary damage within Fairfield County. Portions of the state were declared a federal disaster area. Rainfall in the United States and Canada Floyd brought intense winds and heavy rain to Rhode Island. The strongest winds were confined to Washington and Providence counties. The winds brought down numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines. Rainfall typically ranged from , with a report of at North Smithfield, Rhode Island. The Pawtuxet River reached flood stage on September 16, and crested the next day. Although it surpassed its banks, no flood damage was reported. The storm's effects in the state were mostly minor. In Massachusetts, the storm produced wind gusts of , reaching at the New Bedford Hurricane Barrier. The strongest winds were concentrated over two sections of the state‚Äîthe western mountains terrain and Cape Cod. The winds brought down trees and power lines in these areas, particularly around Pittsfield. In terms of rainfall, the storm dropped in many locations. The heavy precipitation caused rivers to swell, and in some cases flow over their banks. Storm surge at the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier reached . Northern New England By September 17, Floyd was located over southwestern Maine, dropping heavy rains. The entire state received precipitation, with the highest totals confined to southern areas. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for two-thirds of the state. The storm was described as \\"tame\\", and damage was generally minor. In much of Androscoggin County, rainfall amounted to between 7 and 8 in (180 and 200 mm); Poland reported . Several rivers approached or exceeded flood stage due to rainfall from Floyd and Hurricane Dennis less than a week earlier, causing minor flooding. Floyd helped to alleviate drought conditions in Maine. Some roads in susceptible areas were submerged, and a few basements were flooded. Wind gusts of blew down trees and snapped branches, especially in the area surrounding Baxter State Park. Around 15,000 residents were affected by power outages as a result. Following the event, five counties--Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec Oxford, and Somerset--were declared disaster areas, making federal aid available to those areas. Rainfall in New Hampshire generally ranged from , although a few higher totals were recorded. At Mount Washington, of precipitation fell. The rainfall swelled rivers, pushing them above flood stage; the Saco River at Conway crested at , surpassing the 9-ft (2.7 m) flood stage. Along the Saco and Pemigewasset rivers, minor flooding took place, though only in low-lying terrain. Strong winds also impacted the state, with gusts often exceeding . The winds brought down several small trees in Jaffrey, and triggered power outages that affected 10,000 residents. A federal disaster area was declared in the state. In Vermont, for the first time in years, the Tunbridge World's Fair was canceled due to the storm. One woman sustained injuries after a tree crashed on her vehicle. Floyd produced high winds and heavy rain throughout the state, leading to widespread downed trees and powerlines. Thousands of residents in the state lost power after winds impacted the area. Rainfall totals of were common, although there were localized higher reports. The rainfall was offset by persistent drought conditions, however. Numerous tributaries overflowed their banks, and significant flooding was reported. In Weathersfield, part of U.S. Route 5 was washed away. Some schools were closed and events canceled in the region. The downed trees caused structural damage, blocked roadways, and affected hiking trails. The high winds also damaged buildings and some apple orchards, Waves of occurred on Lake Champlain, damaging numerous watercraft along the shore. The hurricane caused one death. Most of Vermont was declared a disaster area after the storm.

The band combines a wide range of European folk music with modern street punk. In late 2011 they announced an indefinite hiatus. However, they followed this by playing shows occasionally, such as annual Vancouver shows, a two-week European tour in January 2014, and two March gigs with Guttermouth in 2014. On November 11, 2017 they released their fourth full-length album Foreign Skies. They followed this up with the album Into The North on November 15, 2019. The band has four full-lengths and two EPs on various labels and has played around 500 shows in around 30 countries. Their performance peak was in 2010, when 180 shows were played. History The Dreadnoughts formed in 2007 in the Downtown Eastside area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. A week-long portion of their 2009 European tour is documented in the book This Place Is Awesome () by Vancouver-based photographer Adam PW Smith. Sound and influences Noticeable influences in their sound include acts such as The Pogues, Gogol Bordello, Goran Bregovic, and Rancid. The band commonly record and perform Sea Shanties, polkas and klezmer songs, and are also strongly influenced by English West Country folk music - in particular the Bristol folk band The Wurzels.

It was named in 1953 after John J. Bowlen, a native of Prince Edward Island, successful Alberta rancher, honorary chief of the Blackfoot, and a Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. Its former name was \\"Yamnee\\", which translates to the number 3 in the local Nakoda (Stoney) language. Geology The mountains in Banff Park are composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, the mountain has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 C with wind chill factors below -30 C in the winter.

Two prototypes were ordered for the Royal Flying Corps but were not completed and the project was cancelled. In 1923 the type was retrospectively designated the Type 7. Development The company was invited to bid for the production of two prototype escort and anti-Zeppelin fighters, using two 250 hp Rolls-Royce engines made available by the Admiralty. The design was based on the company's twin-engined local defence fighter, the T.T.A., and was required to have a patrol endurance of seven hours. The company received an order on 16 May 1916 to build two prototypes for the Royal Flying Corps. The type used many TTA components including the wings, rear fuselage and tail unit. The two gunners were each accommodated in a nacelle on the top wing with a forward- and rearward-firing machine gun. With the availability of aircraft with synchronising guns the programme was cancelled and the two aircraft were not built.

It was adapted from Winston Graham's 1947 novel of the same name. It was shot at Pinewood Studios and on location at York railway station. The film's sets were designed by the art directors John Bryan and Wilfred Shingleton Plot Nicholas \\"Nicky\\" Talbot attends the London debut of his wife, opera singer Philippa Shelley, at Covent Garden. After her successful performance, Nicky runs into former girlfriend Elizabeth Rusman backstage, a musician in the orchestra, who asks for his help. She gives him her address (and keeps his personalised pencil) before Philippa appears. At home, Nicky and a jealous Philippa quarrel over Elizabeth. When Philippa throws an object that strikes her husband in the forehead, he leaves in a huff. The scene then shifts to a courtroom, where the prosecuting counsel reveals that Nicky is on trial for the strangulation of Elizabeth that night. A flashback shows the murderer setting fire to the body. When the killer leaves the flat, he conceals his face from a man using a handkerchief pressed to his forehead, leading the police to assume he has been injured there. Also, the pencil is found at the scene of the crime. The police take Nicky into custody. Philippa goes to see Elizabeth's mother in Holland, then to an employment agency and Elizabeth's acquaintances, without any progress. Inspector Archer does, however, let her examine the dead woman's possessions and copy a bit of music. When Philippa plays it at home, she discovers that her nephew is already familiar with it. She sets out for a school in Scotland, having ascertained that one of the masters may be the composer. Mr. Fleming, the headmaster, is disturbed to recognise her from her photograph in the newspaper. He takes her on a tour of the school. She notices that the school group photograph for the previous year is missing. When she plays the tune on the chapel organ, she sees in a mirror that he is perturbed. Philippa obtains a copy of the photograph the next morning and sees Elizabeth in it. Fleming becomes aware of this and follows her aboard the train. He confronts her in her compartment. They are interrupted when a man enters, but when the newcomer reveals that he is deaf, Fleming confesses to the crime, though it was unpremeditated. Elizabeth had threatened to divorce him for cruelty, which would have ruined him. After the deaf man leaves, Fleming destroys the incriminating photograph and tries to throw Philippa from the train. The deaf man returns just in time. Fleming then jumps to his death. When Philippa goes to see Inspector Archer (still without proof), he introduces her to Detective Sergeant Hawkins, the \\"deaf\\" man who is not deaf at all and therefore heard Fleming's confession.

Known for her distinctively clear vocals, she has worked as a singer-songwriter across many musical genres, including acoustic-folk, indie pop and hip hop.  Early life  Jaffe was born in Lufkin in Angelina County, Texas to parents Roger Jaffe, a women's high school basketball coach, and Malea Jaffe (n√©e Jackson), an art teacher. She has a sister. After a period during Jaffe's childhood when her family moved around Texas frequently, the family settled in Red Oak, Texas, outside of Dallas, where she grew up. Jaffe's mom bought her a used acoustic guitar when she was 9 or 10 years old. She began playing music and performing when she was in high school in Dallas. She said that her family was musical, with her dad bringing influences of folk music and her mother that of the church choir. During this time, a local musician named Doug Burr was a mentor.  Career  Jaffe played shows in Dallas, then moved to Los Angeles for a year, where she had cousins who were musicians. After her time in L.A., Jaffe relocated permanently to Denton, Texas, which has a vibrant music scene with local musicians from North Texas University's music program that Jaffe connected with as well as other musicians in the community that she began playing with on a regular basis. In 2008, Jaffe self-released a six-song EP called Even Born Again. The record has been described as singer-songwriter gothic-folk, and features Jaffe on guitar accompanied by a cellist as well as another guitarist. Even Born Again featured the first release of her song, \\"Clementine,\\" which is one of Jaffe's most well-known songs and was featured on NPR's Song of the Day. Jaffe said that she wrote the song quickly during a tour with a band she was playing with in Arkansas. The song, which she wrote in 10 minutes, was meant as filler because the band didn't have enough songs. Jaffe said the audience had an immediate positive reaction to the song. In late 2009, she was signed to Kirtland Records (Bob Schneider, Toadies), the Dallas-based record label co- owned by Deep Blue Something drummer John Kirtland and his wife, The Polyphonic Spree's Jenny Kirtland. In May 2010, Jaffe released her first full- length album Suburban Nature, which was recorded in December 2008. The record feature layers of vocals and incorporates ambient music, with live performances often including a cello, a violin and/or violinists (sometimes a quartet), an additional guitar, a string section, keyboards, and a drummer, a big departure from Jaffe's initial EP, which was more stripped down sounding. The song \\"Clementine\\" appears on Suburban Nature, and a video of the song, which was shot in the summer in Texas, was made by Jon Todd Collins. In 2011, she released an EP called The Way Sound Leaves a Room that included a DVD video performance at the Wyly Theatre in Dallas from February 2011. This record included a cover of Drake's song, \\"Shut it Down\\". It also included a live cover of the Robyn song, \\"Hang With Me.\\" Jaffe said the EP started with the song, \\"A Sucker For Your Marketing,\\" and was meant to be a lo-fi quick project to explore music beyond her initial acoustic work. She bought a second-hand bass guitar and drum set and learned how to play them, using the new instruments to explore this new musical direction. On April 21, 2012, she released her second full-length album called The Body Wins, which was produced by fellow Texan John Congleton. When writing the record, Jaffe heavily incorporated the bass guitar and drum set she had bought for the prior EP, using the instruments to add rhythm, drums, and melodies, which fit with Congleton's approach to producing. The Body Wins continues a movement away from Jaffe's early acoustic guitar singer-songwriter sound and expansion into electropop tunes. As part of the promotion of the record, Jaffe performed \\"Talk\\", a single from that album, on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on December 11, 2012. In 2012, Jaffe met fellow North Texas-based producer Symbolyc One also known as S1 (Beyonc√©, Erykah Badu, Jay-Z, Madonna, Talib Kweli) during a session where the music producer collective The Cannabinoids was remixing Jaffe's ‚ÄúGlorified High,‚Äù a track from her 2012 record, The Body Wins. S1 and Jaffe ended up forming a group called The Dividends. The name came from the idea of distribution of profits. The Dividends project resulted in an EP called Far From Away. Jaffe has said that she was a big hip hop music fan, but her music up until the collaboration with S1 had not explored beyond Americana and indie pop yet. The work with The Dividends removed the concept of genre and incorporated a diverse mixture of R&B;, jazz, electronica, rock, and pop. Jaffe said helped her move past writer's block and into more creative genre- busting directions. This collaboration with the South Dallas-based S1 led to Jaffee contributing vocals and lyrics to Eminem's song \\"Bad Guy\\" off his 2013 album The Marshall Mathers LP 2. S1 produced the first half of the song with M-Phazes, with the second track produced by StreetRunner. In 2013 for Record Store Day, Jaffe sang a cover of PJ Harvey's \\"Down by the Water\\" on a 7-inch recording with The Toadies, an alternative rock band from Fort Worth, Texas. The track was recorded live at the 2012 Dia de los Toadies Festival. In 2014, Jaffe released her third full-length record, Don't Disconnect. The record marked a big stylistic shift into what has been described as pop-rock. Don't Disconnect was produced by Midlake drummer and producer McKenzie Smith at Redwood Studio in Denton, Texas, which Smith owns with fellow Midlake bandmate, guitarist Joey McClellan. The song, \\"Some People Will Tell You,\\" was listed as a Songs We Love by NPR. In 2015, Jaffe released a remix EP called Visions. Visions features the single, \\"Vision,\\" with Sam Lao and Zhora. The record has mixes by Mystery Skulls, S1, and Blue, The Misfit. As part of the promotion of the record, Jaffe performed with some of the artists on Visions, recreating the music live on stage at Trees in Dallas. In 2017, Jaffe released her fourth full-length record, Bad Baby. Bad Baby opens with the track \\"Synthetic Love,\\" which is over six minutes long. The album artwork is by the Los Angeles-based photographer Lindsey Byrnes and Brooklyn-based illustrator John Lisle.  Soundtracks  The 2011 film, Life Happens, features Jaffe's song \\"Clementine\\" during the end credits. In 2013, Jaffe sang vocals on \\"The Blue Umbrella Suite\\" by Jon Brion, which was featured in The Blue Umbrella, a short film for 2013 Pixar movie Monsters University. In 2015, Jaffe appeared in the film, Some Kind of Hate, singing her song \\"Before You Go,\\" which is on the soundtrack to the film. In 2016, the Irish comedy TV series Can't Cope, Won't Cope used the song \\"Glorifyed High\\" from Jaffe's 2012 record The Body Wins on its soundtrack. Oculus Story Studio's short virtual reality film, Dear Angelica, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2017, featured a new version of Jaffe's song, \\"All That Time.\\" Dear Angelica stars Geena Davis and Mae Whitman. Jaffe knew the director, Saschka Unseld, from her experience working on The Blue Umbrella. Also at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival is Augustine Frizzell's feature film, Never Goin' Back, which Jaffe contributed some original songs. Never Goin' Back stars Camila Morrone and Maia Mitchell (The Fosters).  Touring  In 2012, Jaffe performed as an opener on the New Multitudes tour, a Woody Guthrie tribute album with a band made up of Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James. Jaffe has toured with Lou Barlow, Norah Jones, Blitzen Trapper, Astronautalis, The Polyphonic Spree, Why?, and Chelsea Wolfe, as well as fellow Texas-based bands Midlake, Old 97's and Centro-matic.  Band  Jaffe frequently plays with and has collaborated with multi-instrumentalist Robert Gomez on electric guitar. Becki Howard contributed violin on many of Jaffe's records. Her core band is made up of Don Cento on guitar, Scott Danbom (Centro-matic) on keyboards, and Matt Pence (Centro-matic) and sometimes Roberto Sanchez on drums. Pence often produces Jaffe's records.  Activism  In 2017, Jaffe signed a letter of protest and performed \\"Clementine\\" with St. Vincent in protest of the proposal of Texas Legislature's Bathroom Bill, which discriminates against transgender people using bathrooms that don't match their gender identity.

At the caf√© in the town he meets Anna, a young Frenchwoman who with her brother Max had moved to North Africa during the wartime German occupation of France.

Made in Eastman Color, it is set during the Malayan Emergency. Premise Dr Alec Windom is a British doctor who works in a village in Malaya. He is visited by his estranged wife Lee.

Tinn as Patrol Leader Original novel The film was based on a 1952 novel by James Ramsey Ullman, which was reportedly inspired by Dr. Gordon S. Seagrave, who was imprisoned for allegedly helping the Karen people. The novel was set in the fictitious island state of Papaan. Ullman says he wanted to tell the story how \\"in between man ‚Äì call him the liberal ‚Äì can get caught between the rollers of fanaticism or authoritarianism on either side; the case of a man trying to do his job and be a human being among other human beings and how hard this is in the twentieth century.\\" Ullman admitted the story of Seagrove \\"was somewhere in the back of my mind\\" when he wrote the book. The book was a Literary Guild choice and became a best seller in the US. Ullman wrote a first draft of a play based on the book. Production Film rights to Windom's Way were bought by Carl Foreman, who wrote the script. He sold the rights to this and two other properties to Earl St John of Rank Film Productions, who in January 1955 announced it as part of its schedule for that year (but it would not be made for another two years). The script was rewritten and 'Anglicized' by Anthony Perry. Perry's draft was considered too \\"political\\" and was rewritten by Jill Craigie to be softened. However, the resulting work was considerably more left-wing than Rank's other colonial war films of this time such as The Planter's Wife and Simba.British Cinema of the 1950s: The Decline of Deference by Sue Harper, Vincent Porter Oxford University Press, 2003 pp 43-45 Ronald Neame had just left The Seventh Sin (1957) during production. He was contacted by his old producing partner John Bryan who suggested Neame make Windom's Way with Peter Finch. Finch made the film immediately after returning from Australia where he made Robbery Under Arms. Part of the location shoot took place in Corsica. The rest was filmed at Pinewood. Neame says Corsica was a \\"difficult location\\".Neame p 156 Reception Box Office \\"It was not a successful picture, I'm afraid\\", said Neame later. \\"I think it fell between two stools, neither politically profound nor exciting enough as an action film. John just liked the book very much and I would have directed anything to get back to the studios again.\\"Brian McFarlane, Autobiography of British Cinema p 433 \\"The finished film may have had too many messages for people to stay interested\\", Neame later wrote. \\"It was neither a hit nor a disgrace.\\" Critical Variety called it \\"a slowish but well-made intelligent drama\\".Review of film at Variety The New York Times said the film was \\"without any topical teeth\\" in which Windom's \\"political sympathies, like the geography, are so vague that one need have no fear of being subverted by associating with him in this film.

In 1992 during the ethnic cleansing of Vi≈°egrad that took place in the early days of the Bosnian War she was raped in the Vi≈°egrad police station by Bosnian Serb soldiers, members of the Army of Republika Srpska, and then taken elsewhere where she was raped by a soldier from Serbia. Her sister died in a detention camp. Her experience led to her becoming one of the most prominent human rights activists in Bosnia, working with organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. She campaigns to secure justice for the women victims of the Bosnian War in national and international courts, in particular the victims of rape and sexual abuse. She is President of the Association of Women Victims of War (Udruzenje ≈Ωene-≈Ωrtve Rata), based in Sarajevo. Her organisation campaigns for the rights of women who were the victims of rape and similar crimes during the war, gathering evidence and information about war criminals and rapists hiding in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia with a view to securing their prosecution. The association has provided key testimony in rape and sexual abuse trials linked to the conflict and has helped obtain justice and financial and psychological aid for many of its thousand-plus members. At the trial of Zeljko Lelek for crimes against humanity committed in Vi≈°egrad during 1992, including murders, deportation, forcible detention and rape committed jointly with the Beli Orlovi paramilitary group commanded by Milan Lukiƒá, Lelek's allegations that Bakira Haseƒçiƒá was responsible for his detention led judge Paul Melchior Brilman to observe that Lelek's allegations implied that \\"Haseƒçiƒá is a very important person\\". The trial was the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina's first trial for Visegrad rapes. Lelek was subsequently found guilty of rape at Vilina Vlas and other crimes. Haseƒçiƒá has led efforts to encourage Muslims to return to Visegrad but she told Human Rights Watch that by 2005 she had resigned herself to the fact that \\"the return has failed, because war criminals continue to live freely there. Almost nobody returned to the town.\\" Haseƒçiƒá's work has been featured in documentary programmes produced by the BBC and Al-Jazeera. Background Vi≈°egrad is a town on the Drina River in close proximity to the border with Serbia. The town was strategically important in the early days of the 1992-1995 Bosnian War. In early April 1992, in a pattern repeated elsewhere in Bosnia, the town came under artillery bombardment and eventually fell under the control of the U≈æice Corps of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA). On 19 May 1992 the JNA officially withdrew and local Serb leaders established the Serbian Municipality of Vi≈°egrad. Soon after, local Serbs, police and paramilitaries began one of the war's most notorious campaigns of ethnic cleansing, aimed at eliminating the Bosniak population of Vi≈°egrad and the surrounding area. A group of local paramilitaries, referred to variously as the White Eagles (Beli Orlovi), the Avengers or the Wolves and with ties to the Vi≈°egrad police and Serb military units, played a prominent role in the ethnic cleansing, committing numerous crimes including murder, rape, torture, beatings, looting and destruction of property. The group's leader was Milan Lukiƒá. Lukiƒá established his headquarters at the Vilina Vlas Hotel on the outskirts of Vi≈°egrad, one of the various locations where local Bosniaks were detained. Vilina Vlas became notorious as a rape camp, one of several in Vi≈°egrad documented by a UN Commission of Enquiry report in 1994. At the same time it was, on Lukiƒá's own admission, his unit's command post. One woman survivor reported Lukiƒá raping her several times while she was a prisoner at the hotel. Up to 200 women were reported to have been detained there of whom only a handful survived ‚Äì fewer than ten according to the Association of Women Victims of War. Most of the women prisoners were either killed or took their own lives. The bodies of most of the victims have not been located and are alleged to have been buried in concealed locations and then reburied. International human rights organisations and refugees reported on the atrocities in the town in 1992. Amnesty International published an extensive report on rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina, mentioning Vi≈°egrad as a prime example, and a 1994 UN report on rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina specifically identified Vilina Vlas as one of the locations where the rapes occurred. Nevertheless, rape charges were not included among the Vi≈°egrad crimes prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Campaigning against the ICTY's failure to prosecute rape charges against Milan Lukiƒá Bakira Haseƒçiƒá campaigned prominently to have rape charges included in the indictment against Milan and Sredoje Lukiƒá (cousins) before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at The Hague. She challenged the ICTY's Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte's assertion that the prosecution did not have evidence for such charges when it drew up the indictment as no witnesses would come forward. She insisted that she and other women had previously made statements to officials that were available to Hague investigators. Del Ponte's special advisor and spokesperson acknowledged that the failure to bring charges lay with the Office of the Chief Prosecutor. He claimed there was plenty of information about the rapes in Vi≈°egrad but tribunal prosecutors had been \\"unable to reach the witnesses\\" before the indictments were completed. The UN's \\"completion strategy\\" for the Tribunal ruled out prosecutors bringing new charges or amending existing ones unless a case was transferred to local courts elsewhere. Del Ponte suggested that the Tribunal might transfer the Lukiƒás' case to the War Crimes Chamber in Sarajevo and urged Women Victims of War to work with state prosecutors to have the indictments changed there. On 12 June 2008, less than a month before the trial started, the Prosecution filed a motion for a new indictment, adding rape and sexual slavery to the charges. The proposed new indictment charged the Lukiƒá cousins with involvement, individually or together with others, in planning and/or the abetting of rape, keeping in slavery and torture of persons in detention centres and other locations in Vi≈°egrad town and its vicinity. One day before the start of the trial, the Trial Chamber rejected the Prosecution's submission, ruling that such an amendment to the indictment would prejudice the right of the accused to have enough time to mount a defence.

S. (2006). Phylogeny and Taxonomic Revision of the Endemic Malagasy Genus Ptychochromis (Teleostei: Cichlidae), with the Description of Five New Species and a Diagnosis for Katria, New Genus. American Museum Novitates 3535. This critically endangered fish is threatened by habitat loss and competition from introduced species; after the last-known female was killed during a breeding attempt, its conservation received significant international attention as London Zoo launched a media campaign to identify any remaining individuals. A remnant population was discovered by aquaculture entrepreneur Guy Tam Hyock in 2013, and breeding programs in Madagascar and at Toronto Zoo have resulted in thousands of successful hatchlings.  Description  The Mangarahara cichlid was first described as a new species in 2006 from the Amboaboa and Mangarahara Rivers near Mandritsara in northern Madagascar. Prior to its official description, it was sometimes known as Ptychochromis sp. nov. \\"Joba mena\\" or Ptychochromis sp. nov. \\"Mangarahara\\". \\"Joba mena\\" translates to \\"red girl,\\" identifying the long, ragged, red-bordered fins of the male fish. This species can reach a standard length of . It was given the species name insolitus (the Latin word for 'queer' or 'unusual') in part because of its peculiar appearance, featuring long tooth- or comb-like structures called cteni on many of its scales. This name was also chosen because after identifying a wild-caught holotype specimen, researchers investigated two captive-raised individuals that strangely lacked several of the defining characteristics for which the species was described. Researchers suggested this could, among other possibilities, indicate an unrecorded hybridization event or the existence of an additional, similar species or subspecies. Status It was originally listed as Critically Endangered in 2006 when they were first described, but on further research they concluded that they were in fact Extinct in the Wild. It is listed as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN, but until its rediscovery in 2013, it was feared that the last remaining wild population had disappeared as a result of ongoing habitat loss and competition from introduced species. Two cichlids from another genus, Paretroplus nourissati and P. gymnopreopercularis, along with a round herring, Sauvagella robusta, are restricted to the same region as Ptychochromis insolitus, and may be facing similar risks.Stiassny, M.L.J. (2002). Revision of Sauvagella Bertin (Clupeidae: Pellonulinae: Ehiravini) with a description of a new species from the freshwaters of Madagascar and diagnosis of Ehiravini. Copeia 2002(1): 67-76. Although captive breeding programs have met with some success, and although it continues to occur in the wild, the habitat of this species remains under significant threat, and thus, opportunities for reintroduction remain unclear. Conservation effort In the 1990s, a French ichthyologist collected several specimens of the fish from its wild habitat. An anonymous hobbyist couple bred those specimens, and in 2002, the couple donated a dozen juvenile Mangarahara cichlids to London Zoo. At the time, little was known about the condition of the species' native habitat, and Brian Zimmerman, Chief Curator of the Zoological Society of London, believed that other institutions housed the species as well. Territoriality and rivalry among the maturing siblings contributed to several cichlid deaths, and by 2005, only two male individuals remained in the zoo's collection. In 2006, London Zoo contacts in Madagascar reported that the Mangarahara River had dried up as a result of dam construction and water diversion for rice farming in the area. The fish was declared extinct in the wild. As the only institution with a female specimen of the cichlid in its care, Aquarium Berlin attempted to breed its male cichlid with its female cichlid in 2012. Approximately ten days after the two individuals were moved to a spawning tank, Aquarium Berlin announced that the male cichlid had killed its would-be mate. In 2013, only three specimens were known to exist in captivity - two males in London Zoo and one male in Aquarium Berlin. Those in London Zoo were at least eleven years old, and little was known about the life expectancy of the species. London Zoo published an appeal in May 2013, asking for any information about potentially suitable female Mangarahara cichlids in private collections. After leads from collectors in Venezuela, China, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere did not surface any living cichlids, Zimmerman was contacted by hotelier, tilapia farmer, and \\"Fish Whisperer\\" Guy Tam Hyock. Guy Tam Hyock offered to show representatives from London Zoo to a small pond near Marotandrano where he believed a population of the fishes remained. In late 2013, Toronto Zoo and London Zoo confirmed that a remnant population existed in the wild at the location Guy Tam Hyock specified. The last 18 wild individuals, including some females, were caught and moved to Guy Tam Hyock's conservation aquaculture facility in Andapa, Madagascar. Successful captive breeding was observed at said facility shortly thereafter, and in September 2014, several individuals were brought to Toronto Zoo. On Thursday, September 15, 2016, Toronto Zoo announced the cichlid had successfully bred at their facility, issuing at least 20 hatchlings. References 9\\\\.

The greater part of this set of roads is numbered R21 and is about 30 km long, compared to 8 km for the small ring and 80 km for the main ring. It crosses two highways (A12 and E40-east) and offers a connection to the A10/E40-west at Basilique/Basiliek via Avenue Charles Quint/Keizer Karellaan, to the A12 at Gros Tilleul/Dikke Linde, to the E19-north and N22/A201 at Leopold III via Boulevard L√©opold III/Leopold III-laan, to the A3/E40-east at Reyers, to the E411 at Arsena(a)l via Boulevard du Triomphe/Triomflaan and to the E19-south at Paepsem via Boulevard Industriel/Industrielaan. This road passes through tunnels (Boileau tunnel, Montgomery tunnel, Georges Henri tunnel), on bridges and viaducts (e.g. Diamant viaduct, Teichmann bridge and Van Praet bridge) and under bridges and viaducts (e.g. Luttre bridge). Among those bridges, 7 are used to cross railroads and 2 are used to cross the Brussels‚ÄìScheldt Maritime Canal. Tunnels and the Diamant viaduct are used to avoid crossroads. The greater ring runs along many parks: the Royal Domain, the Josaphat park, the Forest park, the Astrid park, the Scheutbos park, the Elisabeth park, the Jeugdpark and the Laeken park. It also crosses the Bois de la Cambre. The road goes through 14 municipalities out of the 19 which form the Brussels Capital Region: City of Brussels, Schaerbeek, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Woluwe-Saint- Pierre, Etterbeek, Ixelles, Uccle, Forest, Saint-Gilles (only when riding clockwise), Anderlecht, Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Koekelberg, Ganshoren and Jette.  Crossroads The greater ring counts 15 main crossroads with other main roads in Brussels. Starting from the north and going clockwise, those crossroads are: * Gros Tilleul/Dikke Linde: where motorway A12 starts, leading to Antwerp via Willebroek * Van Praet: crossroad with the Quai des Usines/Werkhuizenkaai (the road along the Brussels‚ÄìScheldt Maritime Canal) and the Avenue de Vilvorde/Vilvoordselaan (N1 road leading to Antwerp via Mechelen) * Josaphat: crossroad with Avenue Chazal/Chazallaan located at the eastern end of the Josaphat park * Meiser: crossroad with the Chauss√©e de Louvain/Leuvensesteenweg (N2 road) as well as the Avenue Rogier/Rogierlaan and the Avenue Eug√®ne Plasky/Eug√®ne Plaskylaan * Reyers: where motorway A3, leading to E40, starts; connecting to Germany via Leuven and Li√®ge, this is also the crossroad with Avenue de Roodebeek/Roodebeeklaan, Avenue des cerisiers/Kerselarenlaan and Avenue du Diamant/Diamantlaan; the Belgian national radios and televisions (RTBF and VRT) are also located next to this intersection * Montgomery: crossroad with the Avenue de Tervueren/Tervurenlaan (N3 road) and the Avenue de Broqueville/De Broquevillelaan * Arsenal/Arsenaal: crossroad with the Chauss√©e de Wavre (N4 road) and the Boulevard du Triomphe/Triomflaan * Couronne/Kroon: crossroad with the Avenue de la Couronne/Kroonlaan * La Cambre/Ter Kameren: crossroad with the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan, where the greater ring enters the Bois de La Cambre/Ter Kameren Bos * Vanderkindere: crossroad with Avenue Brugmann/Brugmannlaan and rue Vanderkindere/Vanderkinderelaan * Albert: crossroad with Chauss√©e d'Alsemberg/Alsembergse Steenweg * Paepsem: crossroad with Boulevard Industriel/Industrielaan * Dupuis: crossroad with Boulevard Sylvain Dupuis/Sylvain Dupuislaan * Prince de Li√®ge/Prins van Luik: crossroad with Chauss√©e de Ninove/Ninoofsesteenweg (N8 road) and Boulevard Prince de Li√®ge/Prins van Luiklaan * Basilique/Basiliek: crossroad with Boulevard Leopold II/Leopold II Laan next to the Basilica  Road names  The roads that form the greater ring are the following, starting from the Gros Tilleul/Dikke Linde crossroad and going clockwise: * Avenue Van Praet/Van Praetlaan (going southeast) and Avenue des Croix du Feu/Vuurkruisenlaan (going northwest) * Boulevard Lambermont/Lambermontlaan * Boulevard G√©n√©ral Wahis/Generaal Wahislaan * Boulevard Auguste Reyers/Auguste Reyerslaan * Boulevard Brand Whitlock/Brand Whitlocklaan * Boulevard Saint-Michel/Sint- Michielslaan * Boulevard Louis Schmidt/Louis Schmidtlaan * Boulevard G√©n√©ral Jacques/Generaal Jacqueslaan * Avenue du Congo/Congolaan * Avenue Lloyd George/Lloyd Georgelaan * Avenue de Flore/Floralaan * Avenue de Diane/Dianalaan * Avenue de la Lisi√®re * Avenue Winston Churchill/Winston Churchilllaan * Avenue Albert/Albertlaan * Avenue Besme/Besmelaan and then Avenue Reine Marie-Henriette/Koningin Maria-Hendrikalaan (going northwest) or Avenue des Villas and then Avenue du Mont Kemmel (going southeast) * Avenue Wielemans Ceuppens/Wielemans Ceuppenslaan * Avenue du Pont de Luttre/Luttrebruglaan * Rue du Charroi/Gerijstraat * Boulevard Paepsem/Paepsemlaan * Avenue Frans Van Kalken/Frans Van Kalkenlaan At this point the greater ring is discontinued but can be joined via Boulevard Briand Aristide/Briand Aristidelaan, Avenue Eug√®ne Ysa√øe/Eug√®ne Ysayelaan and Avenue Th√©o Verbeeck/Th√©o Verbeecklaan. Then the greater ring resumes: * Rue Ren√© Henry/Ren√© Henrystraat * Rue de la Comp√©tition * Boulevard Maria Groeninckx De May/Maria Groeninckx De Maylaan * Boulevard de la Grande Ceinture/Grote Ringlaan * Boulevard Louis Mettewie/Louis Mettewielaan * Avenue Emile Bossaert/Emile Bossaertlaan * Avenue Jacques Sermon/Jacques Sermonlaan * Avenue de Laeken/Lakenselaan * Boulevard de Smet de Naeyer/De Smet de Naeyerlaan * Avenue des Robiniers/Witte Acacialaan * Avenue du Parc Royal/Koninklijk Parklaan  Public transport  The greater ring is extensively used by public transport. Between Boileau and Diamant, 4 underground tram stations (Boileau, Montgomery, Georges Henry and Diamant) are connected by a tunnel for trams, which lies under the greater ring. This tunnel is used by tram routes 7 and 25. Albert underground tram station is also located under the greater ring at the Albert crossroad, where the tram routes 3 and 4 join the greater ring, route 3 stopping 3 stops later at Churchill whereas route 4 leaves the ring two stops later at Vanderkindere. Tram route 7 (previously 23/24) actually starts at the Vanderkindere crossing and follows the greater ring up to Gros Tilleul (De Wand stop), only to leave the greater ring after having crossed the Royal Domain to end at Heysel. This makes it the route which drives the most along the ring. Old route 24 also started at Vanderkindere and ran up to Princesse Elisabeth stop only to terminate at the next stop at Schaerbeek railway station. Route 25 joins the ring at Buyl stop coming from Boondael railway station, follows it up to Meiser stop and terminates at Rogier metro station. Bus route 49 follows the ring on two occasions, first as it joins the Rue du Pont de Luttre at stop Wiels, coming from Brussels South railway station. It then leaves the ring at stop Veeweyde metro station, to come back at stop Peterbos up to stop Leopold I.

This is done by using different formations that allow a team to use a variety of volleyball attacks. A team on offense will try to increase the probability of winning a point on a hit by confusing the opposing blockers and disguising the setter's intended receiver as much as possible. This is done keeping in mind that the goal is to score a point and that running a successful offense is executed differently for every team. Teams use offensive systems in whatever way suits the team best. Preview Volleyball offense is how a team can attempt to score a point by causing the ball to land on the opposing teams side of the court. Generally, this is done by first receiving the ball from the other side in the form of either an attack or serve, having the ball set to an attacker, and then having a player jump and attack the ball. Once the ball is received, the goal is to get the ball where it can be hit most effectively. This is usually close to the net where an attacker can jump and hit the ball. Based on a teams skill level, they will be able to run their offense smoothly with a unique arsenal of attacks and formations. Attacks Basic The basics sets are used by teams that do not yet have the experience to run more complicated plays. Any more advanced set, relative to the team skill level, should be used sparingly so the opposing block is tricked by thinking the set is merely a basic set. 10: A 10 is a high set to the back row antennahttp://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/rules/fielddiagrams/volleyball.pdf NCAA volleyball rules, accessed February 2, 2010 where a back row attacker may hit it. 5: A 5 is a high set to the left antenna where an outside attacker may hit it. 4: A 4 is a quick (Shoot) set, to the left antenna where an outside attacker may hit it. 3: A 3 (also referred to as a 32 or 33) is a nice high set between the middle hitter and outside hitter. 7: A 7 is a high set that goes right behind the setter (essentially a backwards 2) 6: A 6 is a quick, low set (very similar to a 1) to the right side hitter. BS: A BS (Back Shoot) is a quick, low set to the right side antenna. This set is very similar to a 4. 1: A 1, also called a quick, is a fast, low set that is set straight up at the middle of the net. 2: A 2 is set in the same spot as a 1 but is about three times as high above the net. 9: A 9 is a high set to the right side antenna where a right-front attacker may hit it. Advanced These more complicated sets are meant to fool the opposition and get your attacker with 1 blocker or less. At higher levels, teams will use a basic set if it is a last resort, meaning that the ball was received poorly. Shoot: A shoot or Go-ball is a quick, low set to the left-front hitter near the antenna.http://www.strength-and-power-for-volleyball.com/volleyball- offense-terms.html, Volleyball terms, accessed February 2, 2010 32: A 32 (pronounced three-two) is a set to the left-front hitter halfway in between the middle of the net and the antenna about the height of a two ball. Flare: A flare is when an attacker uses an inside-out path to attack an outside set. A teammate commonly runs a quick fake to trick the opponents, then the attacker flares out to attack. Slide: A slide is a set to any attacker who runs parallel to the net and jumps off of one foot. Iso: An isolation play is a play where you use an attacker, usually the middle, as a decoy to leave another attacker with a weaker opposing block. Tandem: A tandem is when one attack follows another and hits the ball right after the first one lands, using the first attacker as a decoy. Double quick: A double quick is when two attackers take an approach towards the setter so that he or she may set either a 1 or a back 1, which is a 1 set over the shoulder of the setter. X: An x is when a middle goes up for a 1 and the right side attacker comes from the other side to hit a 2, making the two paths of the hitters cross. Formations In volleyball, teams must have their players in a specific formation.http://www.bluewalrus.org/volleyball/4-2-general.pdf Blue Walrus formation specifics, accessed February 2, 2010 The players then rotate around the court clockwise whenever the team performs a side-out. There is a penalty for being out of rotation and the opposing team receives a point. There are three formations that are widely used in the sport, each having advantages and disadvantages. 4-2 This offense takes its name from the fact that it uses 4 attackers and two setters.strengthandpowerforvolleyball.com This is a basic formation generally used by less experienced teams to avoid confusion on the court. At any given time, one of the setters is front row and the other is back row. They are always opposite of each other on the court. This allows for 2 attackers front row at any given time, and the setter is able to dump the ball as the setter will always be in the front court. This basic offensive formation allows for any of the basic sets to be run, as well as a 32, shoot, or possibly a tandem. Teams that use a 4-2 will rarely set anything other than the basic sets. The positive aspects of the 4-2 include its simplicity, so a team can gain experience and later move on to a more complicated formation. The negative aspect of using a 4-2 is its limits regarding your offense. Some think that having two setters takes away from your team as the setter is generally the team leader. Some coaches opt to start their team out running a more complicated system and just having the players adopt it.http://www.isfsports.org/sports/default.asp?id=350 isfs formations, accessed February 2, 2010 5-1 A 5-1 takes its name from using 1 setter and having 5 attackers on the court. The secondary setter is replaced by an opposite hitter who is always opposite the setter on the court. This formation allows the setter to be able to dump the ball for half the rotations and have 3 front row attackers to set the ball to on the other three rotations. This system allows the setter to set any possible set he or she wants to depending on whether he or she is front row or back row. Many coaches prefer this system, having one setter as the team leader. It also helps having only one setter so that the setting does not change. One setter may set the ball differently from another giving a different feel for the attackers. It helps when the attackers are used to one setter in particular. The negative points of this offense are that the setter needs to transition from defense to set the ball. This creates situations where the setter has the first contact and someone else has to set the ball. 6-2 A 6-2 is similar to a 4-2, but has 6 attackers and 2 setters. This is possible by having the back row setter always set the ball, making the setter only a hitter when he or she is front row. This formation allows any possible set to be made not including a dump by the setter because he or she is always back row when setting the ball. This formation is good for a team in which the setters are also very good attackers where coach does not want to waste that talent. Some young teams also use it so that the player can increase a broad range of skills and not be sentenced to being a setter for his or her career. Unfortunately, this formation has the problems of 5-1 and 4-2. Having two setters, and always having one of them be back row. The setter always has to transition from defense and the leadership is lacking. Most teams at the highest level, including the USA Olympic team use the 5-1 rather than this for leadership purposes. A 6-2 offense is very common when a team has two setters of equal ability and at a younger age.

She photographs the entire American vista (including landscapes, architecture, urban and rural life, and people in their work environments) in all fifty U.S. states as a record of the early 21st century. Highsmith donated her life's work of more than 100,000 images, royalty-free, to the Library of Congress, which established a rare, one-person archive.Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Online Catalog, accessed August 4, 2012. Early life and studies Childhood Carol Louise McKinney was born to Luther Carlton McKinney and Ruth Ragsdale Carter in Leaksville, North Carolina near the large tobacco farm owned by her maternal grandparents, Yancey Ligon Carter and Mary Elizabeth Morton. Her mother's family were planters descending from the colonist Thomas Carter. Her father was a manufacturer representative and her mother worked for Billy Graham. She is a first cousin of the journalist Linda Carter Brinson and the visual artist Benny Carter, as well as a niece of Lieutenant-Colonel J.P. Carter.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/highsm.14192/?co=highsm In an hour-long interview with C-Span founder and host Brian Lamb on July 17, 2011, Highsmith spoke extensively of her childhood in Minneapolis and her summers spent in the South. She and her sister Sara would spend the first half on her maternal grandmother's North Carolina tobacco farm and the second half as part of the high society of Atlanta, Georgia. Her paternal grandmother, also named Sara McKinney, was a friend of Margaret Mitchell and other society women, she told Lamb. \\"We'd spend every day at someone's pool or country club,\\" Highsmith said. \\"Opera played on the radio. Grandmother taught us manners and etiquette‚Äîto sit up straight, eat with our mouths closed, hold the soup spoon just so.\\" Wentworth, where Highsmith's grandfather was born. Actually, Highsmith continued, her rural \\"granny\\" in North Carolina was wealthier than her refined grandmother in Atlanta. \\"Granny and Granddad owned a large and successful tobacco farm,\\" Highsmith said. \\"Grandmother and grandfather, had lost everything [including his furniture business] in two fires and the Great Depression. But grandmother's friends made like nothing had happened. They'd have her to dinner, play bridge and canasta, even take her on cruises to Europe and have their chauffeurs drive her as if she were still part of the aristocracy.\\" Highsmith told C-Span that the influence of her father, a traveling salesman, and her own annual travels through several states to reach her grandmothers imbued her with a fascination about America, \\"especially roadside America. The old car in which my mother would drive Sara and me South would break down every year, it seemed, in little towns. We'd have to stay overnight in little motels and above the kinds of old gas stations I love to photograph today.\\" In February 2012, Carol Highsmith returned to her birth city in North Carolina to record a tape about her childhood experiences that would be played four months later at the opening of the Museum and Archives of Rockingham County (MARC) in Wentworth, North Carolina. The museum's newsletter called it \\"the journey of a hometown girl.\\" Highsmith's summer trips to her granny's farm \\"left an indelible memory of carefree days, delicious food, and wonderful times with family and friends,\\" it continued. Highsmith's experiences in rural Rockingham County were chronicled in a lengthy feature story about her life and career in the Greensboro, N.C., News & Record on August 5, 2017. The article, by Dawn DeCwikiel-Kane, included Highsmith's reflection on the significance of her (then) 25-year donation of more than 42,000 images to the Library of Congress: \\"'It's my legacy,' she said. \\"But it's our [nation's] legacy.'\\" The story, entitled \\"America's Photographer,\\" won a 2017 first-place award in the Profile Feature category in an annual contest sponsored by the North Carolina Press Association.http://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/ncpress/files/9eb554fc04.pdf Carol Highsmith (then McKinney) graduated from Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis in 1964, then spent a year in college at the now-defunct Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa. In a 2013 profile of Highsmith, the Minnehaha Academy alumni magazine, the \\"Arrow,\\" quoted Highsmith: At Parsons College, Carol McKinney met Mark Highsmith, an artist from Queens, N.Y., who soon graduated and enlisted in the Army. The couple married in Minneapolis, then moved to Columbus, Georgia, where Mark Highsmith was stationed at Fort Benning. Upon his deployment to Vietnam in 1966, Carol Highsmith moved to Queens after securing a position at Peters Griffin Woodward, a national radio \\"rep\\" firm in Manhattan. As an assistant traffic manager at its Park Avenue offices, she logged advertisements for radio stations across the country. It was Highsmith's introduction to her first career in the broadcasting business. Early marriage and career When Mark Highsmith returned from Vietnam in 1967, he was assigned to Fort Bragg, and the couple briefly moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Mark Highsmith was discharged from the Army, and the Highsmiths relocated to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Carol Highsmith worked at WPHL-TV, the home of the \\"Summertime at the Pier,\\" a teenage dance show hosted by Philadelphia disc jockey Ed Hurst on Atlantic City's Steel Pier in nearby New Jersey. Highsmith wrote promotional copy and produced shows. One of her jobs was to assist Bill \\"Wee Willie\\" Webber on his children's show, the Wee Willie Webber Colorful Cartoon Club, Highsmith was pictured in a Philadelphia Inquirer advertisement for the station, strumming a guitar. \\"Take Over a TV Station (for 50 seconds),\\" the ad copy read. \\"TV 17 doesn't care who you are. How old you are. Or how you think. As long as you or your group can write and sing music.... So if you really care, stop griping. And start writing.\\" In 1969, Highsmith heard on the radio, at a time when stations were reporting such events, that her husband had committed suicide in his art studio. Mark had returned from Vietnam with posttraumatic stress disorder. Determined to get her college degree, she moved to KYW-TV in broadcast sales. KYW paid for more college coursework at the University of Pennsylvania, on nights and weekends. Early career Broadcasting In 1976, Highsmith moved to Washington, D.C., and spent six years as a senior account executive for radio station WMAL while taking classes at American University. She served on boards of directors including that of the Greater Washington Board of Tradehttp://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms2029.xml By 1979, Highsmith won a national contest initiated by the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York for the nation's most unusual sales effort. This stemmed from broadcasts from London and the Oktoberfest in Germany that she had devised and organized. She traveled with the broadcast team on both trips. ABC ran a full-page ad in The New York Times promoting one of the broadcasts from London. One year at Oktoberfest in Munich, she recalled in a portfolio of her life's \\"experiential learning\\" that she would submit for college credits at American University, \\"we broadcast from a different beer tent each night from a table with 6,000 drunk Germans singing around us. Since we had a language barrier, we could not easily interview people as we had [on another trip] in London. However, we did arrange some interesting interviews with Germans who spoke English. We interspersed the live cut-ins with German tunes, and our loyal listeners joined in back home.\\"Meyer, Ed, and Frank Harden, Jackson Weaver, \\"On the Radio With Harden and Weaver,\\" self-published, 1983, p. 82. Soon photography would rise to the forefront of her life. The career change began in 1980, when she was named WMAL's Employee of the Year. Highsmith decided to apply the $1,000 prize award toward a trip to the Soviet Union. A longtime client gave her an inexpensive Pentax K1000, a small, manual-focus single-lens reflex camera that shoots 35-millimeter film. Highsmith snapped photographs from Kiev to eastern Siberia. Beginning of photography Back in the States working as a senior account executive in broadcasting, Highsmith was determined to further explore photography while completing an undergraduate degree. She studied photography at American University under Professor Anne Zelle and took night-school photography classes, taught by photographer Frank DiPerna, at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. DiPerna assigned each class member to photograph a model in an unusual location in metropolitan Washington. Highsmith chose the crumbling Willard Hotel, which had been closed since 1968.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/highsm/item/2011635197/(77 other Highsmith photos from this period at loc.gov Her mostly black-and-white photos taken there reaffirmed her eye for detail and solidified her interest in photographic art. Carol M. Highsmith photograph of model in Willard Hotel Carol M. Highsmith and Frances Benjamin Johnston It was at the Willard that Highsmith first learned of Frances Benjamin Johnston, and where she began her photography career. The once-opulent hotel was deserted, stripped of its furnishings and fixtures, and slated for demolition. \\"[The Willard's] main tenant was a bum who was setting fires on the sixth floor,\\" Highsmith told the New York Times when the newspaper recounted the hotel's long history in 2006. \\"There were rats the sizes of cats. If I didn't take pictures, what would it look like in a few more years?\\" In its Winter 1995 issue, Old House Interiors magazine also quoted her: \\"I started to think, if this can happen to America's Main Street, what other buildings are decaying that we don't even know about, and who's documenting them?\\".Old House Interiors, Vol. 1, No. 4; Home Buyer Publications; ISSN No. 1079-3941 Frances Benjamin Johnston became Highsmith's professional inspiration. Johnston, too, had done a full study of the Beaux- Arts hotel in 1901, when it expanded from 100 to 389 rooms. When the decrepit Willard was finally saved through the efforts of a spirited \\"Don't Tear it Down\\" campaign, and then restored for its reopening in 1986, the only record available to those who re-created many of the hotel's lavish features were Johnston's faded, black-and-white images. Not a single blueprint or artist's drawing had survived the gutting of the historic hotel. \\"I was sucked into a moment of history,\\" the Washington media quoted Highsmith in a 1988 profile. \\"I didn't care if I got paid. I didn't care if I ate. I had to take those photographs. When the Willard opened, people called me from all over the world. I was the only one who had any images of the famous hotel.\\" For a year after the grand hotel re-opened, it displayed an extensive exhibit of Highsmith and Johnston's work in an alcove off the \\"Peacock Alley\\" corridor. That exhibit remains as a permanent collection in smaller form. In 2006, the American Institute of Architects would mount a four-month comparative exhibit of Highsmith and Johnston's work called \\"Two Windows on the Willard.\\" Like another AIA one-person exhibit of Highsmith's work, titled \\"Structures of our Times: 31 Buildings That Changed Modern Life\\" in 2002, the \\"Two Windows\\" study traveled to several locations across the country. By that time, Highsmith was well into her photography career, having left radio behind in 1984. She had pieced together a small, primarily architectural, photography practice. In a 1987 Washington Post story headlined, \\"Doing What Comes Naturally,\\" Don Oldenburg wrote of Highsmith's mid-career change: \\"'You just sit and stare into space and think about what you'd really like to be doing,' the 41-year- old District resident recalls of her final months at WMAL radio five years ago. That was before she quit to make her dream career come true. She wanted to be a photographer.... \\"Ironically, those dreams of the ideal occupation that now and then distract most people from the workday grind, have traditionally been derided as detours from the American Dream. Those few individuals who actually act on their career fantasies have long been considered ne'er-do-wells, malingerers and daydreamers. Until they succeed. . . . 'It carved out a niche for me,' says Highsmith from her studio at 13th and G streets NW, where she employs seven assistants and charges up to $1,500 a day. The Willard photographs already are destined to become part of the photographic archives of architecture at the Library of Congress. Highsmith says she still gets goose bumps to think she's a professional photographer. \\"Bob Swain believes that people like Highsmith, who make their fantasies their business, are 'the wave of the very near future.' The chairman of Swain & Swain Inc., a New York outplacement firm, bases that prediction partly on a recent survey he conducted of his clients‚Äîpredominantly midlevel managers and professionals who have been 'displaced' by their corporations and sent to Swain for career counseling. \\"'Eighty-two percent of them admitted wanting to do something like that ... there is clearly a tendency to fantasize,' says Swain. 'Eighteen percent actually do it.'\\" Asked her personal motto by the Washington Times in 1989 in one of the newspaper's periodic profile of \\"doers,\\" Highsmith replied, \\"A little hard work never hurt anyone.\\" Various projects Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City Highsmith landed a contract to photograph another building on Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a turreted building called Sears House, where Mathew Brady had operated the studios in which he and his assistants photographed Washington luminaries during and after the Civil War. Her work at Sears House would lead to Highsmith's first photographic honor, a 1985 Award of Excellence from Communication Arts magazine.Communications Arts Magazine \\"Design Annual,\\" Issue 180, November 1985, pp. 6‚Äì7 In 1987, Highsmith's tie to \\"The Avenue of Presidents\\" solidified when she was hired by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Commission to document its wave of renovations on the avenue. Pennsylvania Avenue: America's Main Street, published by the American Institute of Architects' AIA Press in 1988, became the first of her dozens of books. Detailing the transition of the avenue's south side into the \\"Federal Triangle\\" and the methodical redevelopment of its shoddy north side, the book was augmented by historic photographs and a text by Ted Landphair‚Äîwho had been WMAL's news director in the 1970s but barely knew Highsmith before leaving the station to work in other markets. When Landphair returned to Washington to join the Voice of America in 1986, he and Highsmith reconnected, and they married two years later as the Pennsylvania Avenue book was going to press. Carol M. Highsmith had added a collaborator husband and four stepchildren to her busy life. \\"As you both know, it took forty years, eight presidents, and a great succession of Congressional enactments\\" to \\"revive the Avenue,\\" U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had spearheaded Pennsylvania Avenue's renovation since his days as an aide to President John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, wrote Highsmith and Landphair in 2000. \\"And you deserve a considerable share of the credit.\\" In 1992, the Library of Congress accepted 500 of Highsmith's photographs as the first installment of her continuing work to document architectural transitions in the nation's capital. The collection would grow and become nationwide as Highsmith began to travel to other states to produce photographs for her books on American cities, states, and regions. That same year, 1992, the D.C. Preservation League exhibited Highsmith's cibachrome photos of Washington historic landmarks. \\"Her camera peers into dark, shaded porches in a shot of turn-of-the-century houses ... then glances down the clapboards of spare, wooden row houses build a decade before,\\" the Washington Post reported. \\"With the exception of a canal boat gliding along the C&O; [Canal], there's nothing touristy here. It's Washington as the locals know it.\\" And in 1992 as well, the National Endowment for the Arts presented Highsmith with its largest individual grant, a $20,000 Design Arts fellowship and individual project award. The award funded her and Landphair's travels to the western United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, to photograph examples of historic restoration for the America Restored book. Neon sign of the Lollipop Motel in North Wildwood, New Jersey Highsmith deepened her affinity for architecture by documenting various stages of buildings' renewal for contractors, architects, and developers. \\"Shooting enormous spaces in uncertain lighting conditions, her large format images reveal high quality and fine detail, capturing the splendor of the subject matter, be it a building in the midst of destruction or the elegance of a formal room,\\" American Photographers magazine commented in 1989. From 2000 to 2002, a three-year grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation enabled Highsmith to photograph disadvantaged families in 22 cities where the foundation is active. Later, the library's online Prints & Photographs Catalog description of the growing Carol M. Highsmith Archive noted that, \\"starting in 2002, Highsmith provided scans or photographs she shot digitally with new donations to allow rapid online access throughout the world. Her generosity in dedicating the rights to the American people for free access also makes this Archive a very special resource\\". In March 2009, the Library of Congress profiled four women, including Highsmith, during Women's History Month. The others were suffragist leader Susan B. Anthony, early-20th-century magazine illustrator Elizabeth Shippen Green, and retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.http://womenshistorymonth.gov/profiles/sandradayoconnor.html Big Tex at Fair Park in Dallas Highsmith's travels took her to more remote destinations, capturing covered bridges from Vermont to Indiana, murals and neon figures, classic cars and old motor courts and a giant blue concrete whale along U.S. Route 66, \\"doo wop\\" motels on the New Jersey shore, a mining tipple in Wyoming and shuttered gas stations in Southside Virginia, abandoned steel mills and plantation ruins in Alabama, kudzu-covered barns in the Carolinas, roadside curiosities such as a four-story donut and a giant \\"Aunt Jemima\\" that is now a gift shop, storefront churches and drive-in theaters and brick sections of the old National Road alongside a modern interstate highway. From this work, she developed a subspecialty that she calls \\"Disappearing America.\\" \\"After interviewing Highsmith as she was photographing the Torrey Pines Golf Course in 2013, San Diego Union-Tribune reporter John Wilkens wrote: \\"She ... has a passion for things that are disappearing, which made the tree the golf course is named after an appealing focal point. The Torrey is the rarest pine in the U.S.\\" \\"I work every day with a heartfelt commitment to document the living history and built environment of our times,\\" Highsmith told officials of the This is America! Foundation, which is raising funds to send her on yet another 50-state photographic exploration. \\"I consider my work an indestructible record of our vast nation, including sites that are fast fading, even disappearing, in the wake of growth, development, and decay.\\" Photography career According to C. Ford Peatross, director of the Center for Architecture at the Library of Congress, \\"The donation of Carol Highsmith's photography is one of the greatest acts of generosity in the history of the Library of Congress.\\" In 2013, Peatross told the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper, \\"[She] is not only taking photographs but creating a permanent record of the country and its people for the common good.\\" On April 28, 2013, the CBS television news magazine \\"CBS This Morning\\" featured Highsmith's work in a lengthy segment titled, \\"Saving America for Posterity at the Library of Congress\\". CBS Correspondent Martha Teichner told in her report: \\"Highsmith is at work on a decades-long project photographing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Her pictures, thousands of them, are going to the Library of Congress and are being made available free for anyone to use.\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saving-america-for-posterity-at-the- library-of-congress/ The CBS Sunday Morning report continued, \\"Highsmith's images also capture a disappearing America. Two weeks after she photographed Big Tex, the mascot of the Texas State Fair, he burned down. Her photograph of the New York skyline, just before 9/11, is also in the Library of Congress.\\"\\"Saving America for posterity at the Library of Congress\\", CBS News, 28 April 2013. CBS included more than 30 of Carol's images in the online version of its report. In its December 2007 issue, the Library of Congress's Information Bulletin included a \\"Conversation with Carol Highsmith.\\" In the article, Jeremy Adamson, the director of Collections and Services at the library, said, \\"Highsmith's color images are certainly of the highest technical and artistic quality. But more importantly, she has the uncanny ability to identify, focus on and capture for posterity the essential features of our social landscape and physical environment, both natural and man-made. A photograph by Carol Highsmith is a document of rare precision and beauty, revealing with exacting clarity the look and feel of people and places across our great nation.\\" Professional photography and publishing Houston, Texas Skyline image is part of the Lyda Hill Texas Collection at the Library of Congress Her work has been featured in more than 50 hardback coffee-table books, most published by Crescent Books, an imprint of Random House in New York, and by Preservation Press, the publishing arm of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Highsmith also photographed, and her publishing company, Chelsea Publishing, Inc., published six additional books: Forgotten No More, about the Korean War Veterans' Memorial; Union Station: A Decorative History, about Washington's historic train terminal; Reading Terminal and Market: Philadelphia's Gateway and Grand Convention Center; The Mount Washington: A Century of Grandeur; and Houston: Deep in the Heart. Early in her career, Highsmith photographed interior and exterior architecture. But as she and her writer-husband, Ted Landphair, traveled the country to every state and major city to work on the Random House \\"Photographic Tour\\" and smaller \\"Pictorial Souvenir\\" book series, her scope broadened to be a photographic documentarian. She photographed ordinary people and everyday sites as well as soaring architecture, natural landscapes, national parks and monuments, Civil War battlefields, and engineering marvels. (and 14 additional \\"Photographic Tour\\" books published by Crescent). Horse in field in Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park in Johnson City, Texas Her book subjects included the cities San Francisco, New Orleans, Washington, and Chicago; New York's five boroughs; the states of Florida, Colorado, and Virginia; the Pacific Northwest and New England Coast; as well as lighthouses, barns, Amish culture, and the Appalachian Trail.\\"Highsmith (Carol M.) Archive: Selected Bibliography\\", Library of Congress. Yosemite National Park is part of the Jon B. Lovelace Collection at the Library of Congress In 1998, Random House sent Highsmith and Landphair to Ireland, where they photographed every county of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, for Ireland: A Photographic Tour, their only book set outside the United States. In early 2002, Crescent Books published World Trade Center: Tribute and Remembrance, about the 2001 September 11 attacks in New York and exclusively featuring Highsmith's photographs. She had taken aerial photographs of the Twin Towers two months before they fell. That same year, Highsmith and Landphair collaborated on Deep in the Heart, a book about Houston, Texas, financed by that city's International Protocol Alliance. They also produced The Mount Washington: A Century of Grandeur, on the White Mountains resort. Highsmith collaborated with architectural writer Dixie Legler on Historic Bridges of Maryland, published by that state's department of transportation. In 2007, Highsmith photographed, and author Ryan Coonerty described, 52 monuments and other public sites in a National Geographic book Etched in Stone. Having previously privately produced a 265-page coffee-table book for the funder of her photographic excursion to the state of Alabama in 2010, Highsmith in 2013 produced a similar book, with a foreword by Librarian of Congress James Billington and short text by California historian Kevin Starr, about the Golden State. Entitled \\"California,\\" it was published by Chelsea Publishing, Inc., and publicly sold. Library of Congress Electric City sign in Scranton, Pennsylvania Old red barn near Muscle Shoals in northern Alabama Young cowboy in Fort Worth, Texas In 2009, the Library of Congress acquired Carol Highsmith's 21st Century America \\"born digital\\" collection (photographs that originated in the digital format rather than as film transferred to digital) and expect it to grow to the largest photographic born digital collection at the Library of Congress. This archive, \\"Carol M. Highsmith's America: Documenting the 21st Century\\", includes 1,000 images taken across the country. The collection emphasizes what Highsmith calls \\"Disappearing America,\\" including 200 shots taken along U.S. Route 66 in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. \\"The more she travels across the country, the more convinced she is about the need to capture in photographs a rapidly changing America,\\" noted a Library of Congress bulletin. The America I knew is disappearing at lightning speed,' [Highsmith] observed.\\" Highsmith also produced a visual study consisting of more than 400 color digital photographs of the Library of Congress's own, iconic Thomas Jefferson Building, which opened in 1897, toward the end of America's \\"Gilded Age\\" of ornate architecture. In February 2010 Highsmith began a journey to photograph every state in the United States‚Äîstate by state in months-long studies, all in her lifetime in a series to be called \\"This is America,\\"‚Äîalso donating these images, free of royalties, to the Library of Congress. \\"She acknowledges that getting all 50 is going to take a while‚Äî15 more years, by her estimate,\\" would write CityLab magazine, the online publication of The Atlantic magazine, five years later. \\"But Highsmith's not deterred, nor will she narrow her scope. 'Everywhere is important,' she says. 'You tell me I don't need to go to Joplin, Missouri? Things happen. Things change. I will work on this until I die. Highsmith is sometimes called \\"America's Photographer,\\" most recently in a banner headline in an August 15, 2017 story about her career in the print edition of the Greensboro, North Carolina, News-Record newspaper. \\"So far, Highsmith has donated about 42,000 photographs to the Library of Congress,\\" the newspaper reported. \\"She aims to donate 100,000 images before she's done. 'It's my legacy,\\" she said. \\"But it's our [nation's] legacy.'\\" The first state in Highsmith's \\"This is America\\" study Alabama became the George F. Landegger Alabama Library of Congress Collection. George F. Landegger also donated funds to the Library of Congress to document Washington, D.C. neighborhoods and the state of Connecticut. The Connecticut study, intermingled with Highsmith's examinations of the two states (California and Texas) that followed Alabama. The Connecticut work, completed in 2015, culminated in both an archive of Highsmith images in the Library of Congress collection and a coffee-table book, simply titled Connecticut, published by Chelsea Publishing Inc. the same year. On two photographic expeditions over a six-month period, first in late 2012 and then in early 2013, Highsmith worked in California, producing images for her Library of Congress collection. This body of work, titled The Jon B. Lovelace California Library of Congress Collection, was donated in honor of Lovelace, who died in 2011. Lovelace managed the Capital Group and was chairman of the J. Paul Getty Trust. In an April 16, 2013, news release from the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Jenan Saunders, California's deputy state historic officer, wrote of Highsmith's work in the Golden State, \\"Highsmith's efforts produced glorious views of California's lush valleys and rocky shores, forbidding deserts, remarkable buildings, bountiful fields and stunning state and national parks. Her eye fell often on California's state parks. There are images from more than 35 California State Parks included in the visual compilation, from Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park on the north coast to Salton Sea State Recreation Area in the south.\\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/712/files/2013highsmith%20exhibit.pdf Also in 2013, Artepublishing, a division of the fine-art book publisher Hugh L. Levin LLC, produced an electronic book, \\"Great Photographs From the Library of Congress,\\" that included more than 700 images from the library's Prints & Photographs Division. Most were black-and-white historical photos, going back to the Civil War work of Mathew Brady, but 22‚Äîmore than any devoted to any other photographer‚Äîwere chosen from Carol M. Highsmith's archive of late-20th- and early-21st-century photographs. In June 2015, Highsmith began work in her fifth and sixth states‚ÄîColorado and Wyoming‚Äîto be visually studied in depth. The plan for this work calls for return working trips to these states in January 2016 and again in June 2016. These photographic explorations are underwritten by the Gates Frontiers Fund, a private, Colorado-based charitable organization. Upon her return to her Washington, D.C.-area home in October 2015, Highsmith was the keynote speaker in the first of several planned online seminars (or \\"Webinars,\\") organized by the Library of Congress's Education Division. She described her career and answered online attendees' questions about possible applications of her collection to the classroom. Inspiration Carol M. Highsmith was directly influenced by two female photographers: Frances Benjamin Johnston and Dorothea Lange. Johnston produced studies of southern plantations, African-American and American Indian schools, national parks, and studio portraits of prominent Americans from the 1890s to 1950s. Highsmith became aware of Johnston's work in the early 1980s, following her first significant photography commission that took her into Washington's Willard Hotel in the early 1980s. There, she learned not only that Johnston had photographed the Willard at the time of its grand reopening in 1901, but also that her photos were the only available record from which artisans could recreate its early grandeur when the hotel was once again restored after nearly falling to the wrecker's ball during Highsmith's time there nearly a century later. It was during this time that Highsmith was told about Johnston's donation of her lifetime body of photographic work to the Library of Congress; she immediately informed the Library's Prints & Photographs Division's curators that she intended to do likewise. Lange is remembered for her fieldwork for the federal Farm Security Administration among migrant workers and other dispossessed families during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Decades after Lange's work, Highsmith photographed surviving shacks in the Weedpatch \\"Okie\\" camp in Kern County, California, that was the setting for much of John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath. \\"Two hundred years from now, people might want to study what types of screws were sold, and they will be able to study my images and find detail to understand how things have changed,\\" Highsmith said in 2008 \\"These photos can tell a million and one stories. That's what sets still photography apart. With such tremendous quality, you can sit for hours and study a photo.\\" Milestones 90-year- old Kate Carter in North Carolina log cabin Yosemite National Park Frank Gehry's Disney Concert Hall Siegfried & Roy by Carol M. Highsmith The Jefferson Memorial at dusk In 2007, the American Institute of Architects marked its 150th anniversary by inviting the public to vote on the AIA Web site for their favorite 150 U.S. architectural sites. Once the winners were selected‚Äîthe Empire State Building finished first‚Äîthe AIA used existing Highsmith photographs for more than 100 of the sites and commissioned her to photograph all but two of the remaining ones. One of the two‚ÄîNew York's Penn Station, no longer stood, and the other, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on Hawaii Island, had been badly damaged in an earthquake; historical photographs illustrated those sites. Enlargements of Highsmith's photos for the \\"AIA 150\\" appeared in an exhibit at the Institute's headquarters at the Octagon House in Washington, DC, and remain on the AIA 150 Web site. In April 2009, Highsmith was one of four women included in the Library of Congress's Women's History Month Profiles on its web site. Each year since 1999, Highsmith has photographed monumental federal buildings across the nation for a unit of the General Services Administration, and has separately photographed art in federal buildings, including works commissioned by the Treasury Department and Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Highsmith has photographed several National Trust for Historic Preservation properties, including architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in Illinois, Philip Johnson's Glass House in Connecticut, the Drayton Hall plantation house in South Carolina, and the Shadows-on-the-Teche manor home in Louisiana. For the Trust's Preservation Press in 1994, Highsmith and Landphair produced their first national book, America Restored, as well as a book on Washington's foreign embassies. America Restored detailed two restoration projects in each state, including the extensive renovations of the Fordyce Bathhouse in Hot Springs, Arkansas; the Sheraton Palace Hotel in San Francisco; Rockwood Manor House in Wilmington, Delaware; Georgia's Jekyll Island Historic District; the covered bridges of Rush County, Indiana; Parlange Plantation in Louisiana; Broome County, New York's, carousels; and the Battleship Texas in Houston. On commission from the National Park Service, Highsmith photographed homes, personal belongings, and collections of four presidents (Lincoln, Eisenhower, Truman, and Theodore Roosevelt) as well as poet Carl Sandburg, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Confederate commander Robert E. Lee, African-American businesswoman and teacher Maggie Walker, the pioneer American nurse, Clara Barton, and the Nez Perce American Indian Nation. The Park Service produced a \\"virtual multi-media exhibit\\" of Highsmith's presidential collection photographs. In 2016 and 2017, Highsmith was the featured photographer in a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History exhibit of national park images saluting the National Park Service's 100th anniversary. In a story, \\"Renowned Photographer Captures America's Natural Treasures,\\" the Voice of America displayed side-by-side photos of Highsmith's inspiration, photographic pioneer Frances Benjamin Johnston and Highsmith perched in the same location beneath a rock formation in Yellowstone National Park, a century apart. \\"'Do I not get that there are millions and billions of photographs being taken every day?'\\" Highsmith asked rhetorically,\\" the VOA story quotes the photographer. \\"'I do. But unfortunately, most of those won't be around over time.'\\" In 2002 the U.S. Postal Service chose Highsmith's photograph of the Jefferson Memorial as the image for its new Priority Mail stamp. Eleven years later, in 2013, the USPS selected another Highsmith image, a close-up, black-and-white image of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, for a new issue of its \\"second ounce,\\" meaning 20-cent denomination, stamp. According to the postal service announcement, \\"In designing the stamp, art director Derry Noyes chose to work with a photograph of a sculpted portrait of Lincoln rather than a more traditional illustration or painting. Carol M. Highsmith's photograph of this iconic Lincoln statue offered a fresh take. Noyes selected a detail of the image in order to highlight the President's features most effectively.\\" \\"America is ever changing and the people and places that shape our everyday lives must be captured to tell the important stories of our present and our past to future generations,\\" Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, wrote. \\"I can't think of a better photographer to undertake [the] immensely important task of documenting America than Carol Highsmith.\\"  Getty Images/Alamy lawsuit  In July 2016, Highsmith instituted a $1.35 billion lawsuit against two stock photography organizations, Getty Images and Alamy, and their agents, over their attempts to assert copyright over, and charge fees for the use of, 18,755 of her images, after Getty sent her a bill for one of the images, which she used on her own website. includes a copy of the lawsuitText of Highsmith v Getty and others In November 2016, after the judge hearing the case dismissed much of Highsmith's case on grounds that she had relinquished her claim of copyright when she donated much of her work to the Library of Congress (and thus to the public domain), the remainder of the lawsuit was settled by the parties out of court. On August 18, 2016, Creative Commons, a nonprofit American organization that issues \\"public copyright licenses\\" enabling the free distribution of otherwise copyrighted work, said of the photographer on its website, \\"Highsmith's project predates our work as Creative Commons, but her work is very much in the spirit of our community. By removing copyright restrictions from her photographs, Highsmith is engaged in the important work of growing a robust commons built on gratitude and usability; her singular archive at the Library of Congress is a testament to one woman's passion and generosity.\\"  Annenberg Space for Photography Exhibit  In 2018, Carol M. Highsmith's work was featured in a six-month-long exhibition at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, California‚Äîassembled by American photography curator Anne Wilkes Tucker‚Äîshowcasting images selected from more than 14 million visual items permanently housed at the Library of Congress. Of the 440 photographs in what was called \\"Not an Ostrich: and Other Images from America's Library,\\" 48 were Highsmith's.https://www.annenbergphotospace.org/exhibits/not-an-ostrich/ For a documentary movie that accompanied the exposition, a crew followed Highsmith \\"on the road\\" in Clarksdale, Mississippi and elsewhere a year earlier, in 2017.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/highsm/item/2017883654/ Motel neon in Arizona The exhibit's title was borrowed from a 1930 photograph in the national library's collection of a rare, fluffy-feathered goose held by an actress at a Madison Square Garden poultry show, thought to be taken by an unnamed photographer in the employ of the Underwood & Underwood Co. that produced stereograph views.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2016646294/ In what the Annenberg museum described as \\"a captivating conversation,\\" Highsmith was the featured speaker at an \\"Iris Nights\\" lecture series presentation, conducted by curator Tucker, of \\"the beauty, humor, and humanity of America.\\" They discussed Highsmith's \\"decades-long project to photograph America with images from all 50 states. The conversation also covered her decision to donate all of her images from the project to the Library of Congress, her experiences 'on the road,' [she had just completed a study of Arizona and was headed to the states of Washington, Oregon, New York, and Rhode Island], and the influence of other trailblazing women photographers, such as Dorothea Lange and Frances Benjamin Johnston, both of whom have inspired Highsmith.\\"https://www.annenbergphotospace.org/video/carol-m-highsmith-anne- wilkes-tucker-the-beauty-humor-and-humanity-of-america/ Horse jingle in rural TexasIn a review of the exhibit by the online LensCulture contemporary- photography magazine, Gena Williams wrote, \\"Juxtapositions are an important part of Not an Ostrich.

Later I learned that the Pasaje Seaver was a street steeped in the more Bohemian traditions of Buenos Aires. My piece Pasaje Seaver symbolizes the systematic destruction of memory in the name of progress - a destruction that may or may not be justified, which is just a question of definition. Musically speaking, tango fragments are brought together with greater or lesser continuity. Pasaje Seaver does not follow a narrative, but paints a static picture of total desolation and ruin. This work is dedicated to my father in memoriam.\\"Solare, Juan Mar√≠a, 2010, Tango Monologues Liner Notes Marginalia * Pasaje Seaver has been recorded in the sessions for Solare's previous CD, \\"Tango N√≥made\\" (with Eduardo Kohan) but must be discarded due to lack of place on the cd. * Pasaje Seaver has been conceived in order to be \\"deconstructed\\" and using its fragments in an electroacoustic piece by Solare, \\"Tango Oubli√©\\" (that ended up been composed several years later, in 2007).

Established in 1932 in Aba, APU is one of the earliest and most enduring organs of community development set up by an Igbo clan in colonial Nigeria. The youngmen of Arondizuogu who laid the foundation for APU left their homes for the first time in the 1920s and early 1930s to seek a better life in the emerging urban centres of colonial Nigeria. They found themselves in social, economic and political environments different from the life they knew at home. Refusing to be intimated or alienated, they held on to that deep feeling of love for the community with which they grew up. They assembled at Aba on October 8, 1932 to aggregate ideas on how best to convey the concomitants of modern development with which they were surrounded in the city (such as wide roads, schools, hospitals, post offices, portable water, electricity, court rooms, etc.) to their village community. Objectives The objectives of APU since 1932 have since expanded to include the changing concerns of its massive membership spread around the world. Over the years, APU, at the national level, has been led by a succession of twelve Presidents General: Rev Chima Nwana who served from 1933 to 1947 with a succession of secretaries that included John Okereke, Louis Nwakire Obioha and Egboo Nwankwo; Mazi David O. Mbadiwe (who had served as the President pro tempore of the Oct. 1932 inaugural convention) and was elected to serve as APU President from 1947 to 1949 when the National College dispute created an impasse between Ndianiche (from where the president hailed) and APU; Mazi Albert Nwosu Igbo \\"Ogbuanukwu\\" from Ndiukwu who was appointed to serve as President of APU from 1950 to 1953; and Mazi D.T. Okoro took over as APU President and served from 1953 to Jan 15 1966 when all ethnic unions were proscribed by military decree. Between 1966 and 1974 APU was in limbo. However, the leadership role of APU during this interregnum was carried out by other organisations. First, (between 1967 and 1970) by the Arondizuogu War Emergency Council, one of the impromptu bodies formed in various clans at the instance of the authorities of the short-lived Republic of Biafra. Second, (between 1971 and 1974) by the 1st Arondizuogu Community Council set up in consequence of the Divisional Administration Edict passed ion 1971 by the Government of the old East Central State. Mazi R.O. Ikoro served as chairman of both the Arondizuogu War Emergency Council and the Arondizuogu Community Council. Present After the Nigerian Civil War, Mazi Ben Ozonede Onwuka became the Union‚Äôs President following the resuscitation of APU in 1974 and served till 1976; Mazi Remy Nwafor Unegbu who was nicknamed the \\"Perfect Peacemaker\\" served as President - General of APU from 1976 till he died in office in 1981, Mazi Reuben O. Egbuonu, who served under Unegbu as 1st Vice President, succeeded him and served as President till 1984 when he lost the APU Presidency to an Aba based business mogul Chief Clement Moore Obioha who was succeeded in 1991 by Dr. Chukwuma Nkemdi Obioha. In 1993, Chief Joel West Umeh took over from Chukwuma Obioha and served as President till 1996; Chief L. Iheanyi Okoro took over in 1996 and served first as Chairman of a Caretaker Committee of the National Executive of APU and, later, as President General by acclamation; and Mazi Oguguo Okereke served as President General of the union between 2000 and 2008. Hon. Barr.

The flight crew succeeded in restarting one engine in time to safely land the aircraft at Miami International Airport. Aircraft The incident aircraft was a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar 1, registration N334EA, msn 1141. The aircraft had been manufactured in 1976. It was powered by three Rolls-Royce RB211-22B turbofan engines. Background On May 4, N334EA had flown into Miami where it underwent overnight maintenance, which included a check of the magnetic chip detectors inside the jet engines. This involved removing the master chip detector from each engine and replacing it with a new one. Each chip detector had two O-rings, which served as oil seals. The replacement chip detectors were not fitted with O-rings, a fact which escaped the mechanic who fitted them. After the chip detectors were fitted, each engine was motored for 10 seconds to check for oil leaks. None were found. The aircraft was signed off as serviceable and returned to service. Incident Eastern Air Lines Flight 855 took off from Miami International Airport at 08:56 on a flight to Nassau International Airport in the Bahamas carrying 162 passengers and 10 crew. On board was a veteran flight crew, consisting of Captain Richard Boddy (58), Captain Steve Thompson (48) and Flight Engineer Dudley Barnes (44). Captain Boddy had more than 12,000 hours of total flying experience, although he was new to the L-1011, having logged just 13 hours in the aircraft type. On this flight, Captain Thompson served as a supervisory check airman. He had accrued close to 17,000 flight hours throughout his career, with 282 hours in the L-1011. Flight Engineer Barnes had more than 9,000 hours of total flying time, with 2,666 hours clocked in the L-1011 cockpit. At 09:15, while descending through 15,000 feet (4,572 m), the low oil pressure indicator on the TriStar's number 2 engine illuminated. The flight engineer noted that the oil pressure on the #2 engine was fluctuating between 15 and 25 psi; the minimum pressure required for normal engine operation was 30 psi. The captain ordered the flight engineer to shut down the engine. By this time, the plane was about 50 miles (80 km) from Nassau. The crew elected to return to Miami to land. Flight 855 received a clearance back to Miami, as well as instructions to begin a climb to FL200 (20,000 ft, 6,096 m nominal altitude). En route back to Miami, low oil pressure lights for engines #1 and #3 illuminated, and the oil quantity gauges for all three engines read zero. At 09:23, Flight 855 informed Miami ARTCC of the engine gauge readings but stated, \\"We believe it to be faulty indications since the chance of all three engines having zero oil pressure and zero quantity is almost nil.\\" At 09:28, at an altitude of 16,000 feet (4,877 m), the #3 engine failed. Five minutes later, the #1 engine flamed out while the crew was attempting to restart the #2 engine. Cabin lights went off and flight deck instruments stopped working. The aircraft descended without power from about 13,000 feet (3,962 m) to about 4,000 feet (1,219 m), at a rate of descent of approximately 1,600 feet (488 m) per minute. The crew successfully restarted the #2 engine on the third attempt and executed a one-engine landing at Miami at 09:46. After the landing the power from #2 engine was insufficient for the aircraft to taxi; a tug had to be used to tow it to the airport terminal, where the occupants disembarked normally. None of the 172 passengers and crew aboard were injured in the incident. Cause The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the incident was as follows: It was subsequently established that the engines needed to be run for at least 30 seconds with no O-rings fitted before an oil leak would become apparent. Awards Barnes, Boddy and Thompson were each presented with an Award for Outstanding Airmanship by the Airline Pilots Association.

The species is known from a single 5th instar female nymph exuvia found in Hymenaea protera amber from deposits in the Dominican Republic. The holotype, deposited in the Oregon State University as specimen number He-4-73, was mined from the La Toca Dominican amber mine. The specimen was first mentioned in a 1995 paper describing the extinct tick Ornithodorus antiquus. Though mostly complete the exuvia is missing the right foreleg, the left middle leg, a small section of antenna and the anteocular region. Triatoma dominicana is the first extinct Triatominae species to be described from the fossil record. Included in the amber specimen are two fecal pellets from the insect which contain preserved flagellates of the extinct Trypanosoma antiquus. This association is the oldest known example of the vector association between Triatoma and Trypanosoma. T. dominicana lived in an environment similar to modern moist tropical rain forests. Though similar to the modern genera Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Eratyrus several physical characters in the specimen are distinct to Triatoma, the size, at being smaller than Eratyrus nymphs, and the head and thorax being granulose. Modern Hispaniola does not have an endemic population of Triatominae species and only the human introduced T. rubrofasciata. Of the three endemic Triatominae species found in the Greater Antilles T. dominicana resembles some features of T. obscura found on Jamaica. Based on the contents of the amber specimen including three hematophagous insects, it is likely to have been formed in a tree cavity. Associated with the insects are several mammal hairs from an unidentified Chiropteran, the likely host for T. dominicana.

Biography Born Robert Bartow Lubbers in 1922, he began as an illustrator for his school newspaper. In his teens, he played trombone in a big band five nights a week while studying during the day with George Bridgman and other instructors at the Art Students League. He entered the comic book field when he was 18 years old, as he recalled: :My pal Stan Drake and I left Bridgman's life class one day and marched down to Centaur and sold the comic mag features we'd created. Before long I was doing features at Fiction House until the War. For Centaur (aka the Comics Corporation of America), Lubbers drew such features as the Arrow, Reef Kincaid, Red Riley and the Liberty Scouts. After Centaur folded in 1942, he signed on as art director at Fiction House, where he drew Firehair in Rangers Comics, Camilla in Jungle Comics, Se√±orita Rio in Fight Comics, Captain Wings in Wings, plus such features as Space Rangers, Rip Carson, Flint Baker and Captain Terry Thunder. Remembering his first, pre-World War II employment at Fiction House, Lubbers recalled \\"a young teenager who'd come in now and then to show a little sample book he'd made up called Panther Lady. We could see this kid had the right stuff. He had no luck selling it to Fiction House, but it was just as well. Frank Frazetta has become a glittering star in the world of fine art.\\" After World War II, he returned to comic books. Fiction House \\"welcomed me back and features and covers poured out until 1950, when my mentor Ray Van Buren led me to UFS and Tarzan and NCS membership.\\" Comic strips The Saint (October 4, 1959) In 1950, he began his association with Tarzan, continuing on that strip for the next four years. In 1954, he first did work at the Al Capp studio and entered, as he put it, Capp's \\"star-studded world of movers and shakers\\". He began drawing The Saint in 1959, and he also worked on Big Ben Bolt. Frank Godwin's Rusty Riley was running in more than 150 newspapers when Godwin died of a heart attack in 1959 at his home in New Hope, Pennsylvania. The final Rusty Riley strips were drawn by Lubbers, who recalled, \\"In 1959, Frank Godwin, the artist who did Rusty Riley, died. Sylvan Byck at King Features asked if I'd do the last two weeks in Godwin's style to end the series. I admired his book illustrations and was honored to have the privilege to do it.\\" Frank Godwin, by Mark Radcliffe, at American Art Archives; published no later than September 27, 2007 (earliest version on archive.org); retrieved June 3, 2019 In 1960‚Äì1967, he drew Secret Agent X-9 (as \\"Bob Lewis\\"), and he contributed to Li'l Abner during the 1970s. Lubber's own strips were Robin Malone (for NEA from 1967 through May 1970) and Long Sam, created by Al Capp and syndicated by United Feature Syndicate from 1954 to 1962. Initially written by Capp, who soon turned the duties over to his brother, Elliot Caplin; Lubbers eventually assumed the writing duties himself in the strip's final phase. Long Sam was, like Li'l Abner, a hillbilly strip, though based on a female character. The title character, Sam, was a tall, voluptuous, naive mountain girl who had been raised in a hidden valley away from civilization by her Maw, who hates men and wishes to protect her daughter from them. The stories deal with Sam's inevitable discovery of the world and its discovery of her. Lubbers concluded Robin Malone in an ambiguous manner that left the survival of the protagonist unresolved. Comic books In addition to DC Comics' \\"The Vigilante\\" feature in Action Comics, he drew Westerns for Pines (Standard/Nedor) comics in the 1950s. He briefly drew comic books for Marvel Comics including work on The Defenders #61 (July 1978) and The Human Fly #16‚Äì17 (December 1978 ‚Äì January 1979). Lubbers is sometimes mistakenly said to have drawn for DC Comics during the 1980s. A young inker named Bob Lewis did work for DC during that period, but he was not Lubbers using a pseudonym. Reprints In 2001, when his work was collected in the 100-page Glamour International: The Good Girl Art of Bob Lubbers, comics historian Paul Gravett reviewed: :Bob Lubbers is not the celebrated cartoonist he should be, but thanks to a legion of Italian admirers, he is now getting his day in the sunshine in his 80th year. The latest edition of the long- running Italian magazine Glamour International No. 26 (2001, $34.95) pays tribute to his Good Girl Art in a deluxe, bi-lingual 100-page, 12\\" x 12\\" inch square showcase, edited by the respected authority Alberto Beccattini. Lubbers himself writes the commentary tracing his fascinating life and 40-year career in comics, accompanied by photos, sketches, a host of brand new colour illustrations and covers, plus some specially colored panels of his Firehair, Camilla and Captain Wings comic books from his Fiction House days in the Forties and from his string of newspaper strips, Tarzan... Long Sam, The Saint, Secret Agent X9, Robin Malone and L'il Abner. Bob credits being in the right place at the right time for keeping him busy, jumping from one series to the next or juggling several at once. But this modesty overlooks his constantly fresh and lively draughtsmanship, his crisp storytelling skills and his particular lifelong love affair with the female form, qualities that have kept him in constant demand... Writing about his experiences in the comics industry, his encounters with stars, presidents and models, his passions for playing music and golf, and his current success at devising crossword puzzles, Lubbers comes across as a genial, big-hearted man, who has always enjoyed his life and developing a variety of talents. This book concludes with the most thorough checklist of his work to date, 11 pages meticulously compiled by Beccattini with help from many experts. Awards and exhibitions In 1998, Lubbers was honored with the at Rome's Expo Cartoon Festival. Lubbers received an Inkpot Award in 2002. Sunday strips by Lubbers were displayed in 2003 at the Tarzan! exhibition at the Mus√©e du quai Branly in Paris. In 2016 he was inducted into the National Cartoonist Society‚Äôs Hall of Fame, one of only 16 cartoonists to receive that honor. Lubbers died on July 8, 2017 at the age of 95.

Board chair John Christou said in 2009, \\"Being a documentary filmmaker is a privilege, not a right. If you want to create a documentary, you have to fight, scrape, beg, steal, sell, borrow and perform other innumerable unpleasant acts. But when it works, it's pure and wonderful.\\"  History  The Documentary Organization of Canada is the collective voice of independent documentary filmmakers across Canada. It is a member driven organization dedicated to promoting, supporting and developing the art form of documentary filmmaking. In 2008, DOC celebrated its 25th anniversary. It was founded by a dozen independent filmmakers who were invited and brought together by Cinema Canada magazine to a round table discussion of the film production scene.A new generation poised for action, Cinema Canada, July 1982, p 11-13. The following year, in 1983, a different group of filmmakers began meeting on their own in Toronto. These documentarians got together to discuss collective benefits (such as a dental plan), but it was a vital need for political representation and advocacy that inspired the group to create an organization of independent documentary filmmakers. They founded what would later be called the Canadian Independent Film Caucus (CIFC), which was subsequently incorporated as the Documentary Organization of Canada (DOC) in 2003. Today, DOC has more than 875 members across the country with chapter organizations in British Columbia, Alberta, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa- Gatineau, Quebec and the Atlantic region.  Advocacy  DOC actively advocates on behalf of documentary filmmakers to obtain representation in forums where decisions are made about the production and distribution of documentary films and videos. Specifically, DOC seeks to strengthen institutions, funders, broadcasters, distributors, co-ops, and exhibitors which contribute to the production of independent film and video in Canada. DOC also attempts to eliminate conflicts between different sources of funding for documentary film. DOC and its member organizations across the country also promote access to broadcast windows across the whole range of television outlets and promote increased distribution opportunities for documentary films through theatrical release, television, and non-theatrical and home video markets. DOC also works to ensure that broadcasters and government institutions make all documentary archival material available to independent filmmakers freely, efficiently, and at a reasonable cost. Today, DOC's advocacy efforts concentrate around three major policy issues: the licence renewals of the private conventional television stations, the arrival of the Canadian Media Fund (CMF), and copyright consultations with the federal government.http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5650/125/ Getting Real In 2011, DOC released a report examining the state of the documentary film industry from 2006 to 2009: Getting Real 4: An Economic Profile of the Canadian Documentary Industry. According to one media commentator, the report reveals, \\"a dire period in the Canadian documentary landscape...the industry is in distress.\\"http://rabble.ca/news/2011/04/six-see-hot-docs While there's been a positive 77% increase in attendance at documentary film festivals across Canada, production in documentary films dropped to its lowest level in six years and English-language sector production dropped by a whopping $52 million. The report reveals that one of the main obstacles is distribution: broadcasters are increasingly turning to lifestyle and reality shows for their programming and it is increasingly difficult for point of view documentaries to get air time.http://rabble.ca/news/2011/04/six-see-hot-docs As another media outlet put it: \\"The industry is still reeling from the effects of declining funding from broadcasters and sources such as the former Canadian Television Fund, now the Canadian Media Fund.\\"http://www.timescolonist.com/story_print.html?id=4559925&sponsor;=  Programs   Giving Voice  In 2010, DOC with CBC‚Äôs documentary (TV channel) announced the establishment of a documentary masters apprenticeship program, Giving Voice: Filmmakers Working with Filmmakers. The program is the extension of DOC‚Äôs widely attended public Masters‚Äô Speaker Series, Filmmakers Talking to Filmmakers. Giving Voice is designed for documentary professionals transitioning to the next stage of their career. The program offers the apprentice the opportunity of in-the-field training with a veteran master of the documentary craft. The chosen apprentices work with the masters for a period of four months during production and have the opportunity to learn from an established and recognized documentary filmmaker while witnessing their creative process. DocSHIFT DocSHIFThttp://www.doctoronto.ca/docshift is a program that facilitates new creative partnerships and helps develop innovative digital and interactive documentaries through mentorship, prototype development, project incubators, training workshops, interviews with innovators in the field, case study research and networking opportunities. It also includes the docSHIFT Index,http://www.doctoronto.ca/docshift-index a comprehensive library of digital documentaries. DocSHIFT is an initiative of chapter organization, DOC Toronto, and is made possible with the support of the Ontario Media Development Corporation on behalf of the Ministry of Culture, in partnership with the CFC Media Lab, Hot Docs, the National Film Board of Canada, Ryerson University, and the Bell New Media Fund.  Allan King Memorial Fund  In 2009, a documentary film giant, Allan King died and the documentary community came together to mark the loss with the creation of the Allan King Memorial Fund. The purpose of the commemorative fund was not only to honour their colleague, but to put money into the hands of the independent documentary filmmakers of the future. The fund was established by DOC with the filmmaker's family for the benefit of the Canadian documentary community. Point of View Point of View, also known as POV, is a magazine on documentary film. First established in 1990 by the DOC under the editorship of Wyndham Wise, it became independent in 2010 but remains in close collaboration with the DOC. The magazine publishes feature content in paper form twice annually, but publishes news, reviews, interviews, and feature articles more regularly on its website.

It was one of the most popular films at the British box office in 1948. The film's subject was what The New York Times described as the \\"heroics of that valiant legion of women who stood, but did not wait, through the long war years and the now dreary post war years.\\" Plot Set near Portsmouth, one of the main bases for the D-Day invasion fleet, the film portrays life on the British home front during World War II. During the run up to D-Day, widowed Martha Dacre (Ursula Jeans) tries to keep house and home together for her two daughters and two naval servicemen billeted on her. Although her two daughters serve as Wrens, and her son is away in the Navy, she has chosen to stay at home as a housewife (although she also participates in fire-watching and works in a canteen). When she learns that her son's ship was damaged during the landings, she experiences regrets about not taking a more active role in the war. Using occasional footage of actual events and with frequent reference to contemporary newspaper and wireless reports, the story moves forward from D-Day to VE-Day, the 1945 general election and on to 1948 when the film was made. Martha eventually re-marries to naval officer Geoffrey (Cecil Parker) who was one of the men billeted on her and has by now become a father-figure to her son and daughters. Cast * Ursula Jeans as Martha Dacre * Cecil Parker as Geoffrey Radcliffe * Joan Hopkins as Helen * Derek Bond as Nigel * Lana Morris as Lolly * John Stone as Roddy * Digby Wolfe as Benjie * Thora Hird as Mrs. Gaye * Bill Owen as Soldier * Marian Spencer as Harriet Lessing * Kynaston Reeves as Captain Dishart * Eleanor Summerfield as Clippie * Dorothy Bramhall as Mrs. Maling * Gladys Henson as Woman in Fish Queue * Merle Tottenham as Woman in Fish Queue * Vi Kaley as Old Woman On Sea Front * Marjorie Gresley as Shop Supervisor Production  The film was shot at Denham Studios with location shooting taking place in Margate, Portchester Castle and the village of Denham in Buckinghamshire. The film's sets were designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky. It was adapted by Esther McCracken from her own 1944 play No Medals, with additional material added to continue the story until the present day in 1948. Box Office The film was popular at the British box office. According to Kinematograph Weekly the 'biggest winner' at the box office in 1948 Britain was The Best Years of Our Lives\\" with Spring in Park Lane being the best British film and \\"runners up\\" being It Always Rains on Sunday, My Brother Jonathan, Road to Rio, Miranda, An Ideal Husband, Naked City, The Red Shoes, Green Dolphin Street, Forever Amber, Life with Father, The Weaker Sex, Oliver Twist, The Fallen Idol and The Winslow Boy. Critical reception Critical reception was lukewarm, but the film had some defenders. A critic for The News of the World wrote, \\"I see that according to my fellow critics The Weaker Sex ... is riddled with faults. Therefore I ask your indulgence for being incapable of detailing these grave weaknesses. I must have missed them because I was enjoying myself so much\\". The New York Times wrote, \\"a thoroughly professional cast and an adult script make the drama genuine and trenchant. Ursula Jeans is excellent as the beleaguered mother who minimizes her work and sacrifices by remarking \\"one is given no choice ‚Äî just a little extra strength from somewhere.\\" Cecil Parker is equally adept in his restrained portrayal of the commander she eventually marries. The wonderful Thora Hird contributes a superbly droll bit as a Yorkshire servant and Joan Hopkins, Lana Morris, Digby Wolfe, Derek Bond and John Stone add solid characterizations as the children and sons-in-law\\" ; and Sky Movies wrote, \\"the best reviews of the period were saved for Thora Hird as Mrs Gage [sic], the 'daily' with a dry sense of humour\\", and concluded, \\"good, solid drama told convincingly ‚Äì if a trifle over-sentimental today.\\" References Bibliography * Murphy, Robert.

Plot  A composer, Richard Morton experiences blackouts and cannot account for his actions. He seems to recall a woman's screams and a conversation with his wife, Emily, but it's all a blur. Morton goes to see his friend John Harkness and is introduced to a film actress, Julie Bannon, and is attracted to her. He also apparently has made a date with Lisa Muller, who is angry when Morton shows up two hours late. He loses his temper and threatens her. Julie goes out with Morton and attempts to seduce him, but something in him resists. He returns to Lisa and begins to menace her again, only to suffer another blackout. When he wakes up, Morton is in his own home by himself and isn't sure where he has been or what he has done. He phones Lisa and learns she is all right. Concerned, he contacts Julie as well, but she also has not been harmed. Morton is glad that his violent temper did not cause him to lose control and that the woman's screams are all in his mind, until he goes to his own bedroom for the night and finds his wife there, dead.

Plot Captain Lucky Ryland (Peter Finch) is about to retire. There is a flashback of several years to a voyage on a ship he was captaining from South America. He is forced to give a lift to a British governess, Ruth Elton (Diane Cilento), who is returning home. Both Ryland and his second mate, Vosper (Anthony Steel), fall for Ruth. Ryland proposes to Ruth and when she turns down his offer he tries to rape her in his cabin but she is rescued by Vosper. The ship, crew and Ruth survive a very severe storm in which Vosper saves Ruth's life outside on deck after which Ruth and Vosper first realize that they are in love with each other. After the voyage Ruth and Vosper are married and do not meet Ryland again until his Retirement Function. Ryland finally leaves his Retirement Function in a Taxi. The film ends with Ruth looking at Ryland in tears because she still has feelings for Ryland after all of the years and despite him once trying to rape her. There is a subplot about the dissatisfaction of the ship's crew with the supply of rotten potatoes which Ryland has bought cheaply simply to save money. The potatoes are dumped overboard and Ryland is determined to find out who is responsible by offering the crew ¬£5 for any information as to who did it. It turns out this was done by Shorty (Bryan Forbes) but Ike the bosun (Geoffrey Keen), who later dies and is buried at sea, covers for him saying that he did it because although always pretending to be a very hard bosun he actually cares very much about his crew.

Baker's biographer would later write \\"although he [Baker] was disappointed in the eventual result Passage Home was the quintessential 1940s and 1950s Baker film - classical in style and melodramatic/generic in its basic structure... it conveys a quiet, pervasive sense of despair in its storyline, involving melancholy and sexual repression.\\" The script was by William Fairchild who had written Morning Departure, alo directed by Baker. The director called it \\"a bomb in the bomb locker story... all pretty formula stuff. It's not very good... The whole film should have been set in 1885 on a sailing ship. It was sort of a Victorian film. It just didn't work as a modern day film.\\" Baker felt the \\"only interesting thing about\\" the movie was it used a new form of back projection. Diane Cilento's casting was announced in September 1954. She was cast after producer Julian Wintle had seen 60 people. Cilento had only recently appeared on stage in The Big Knife and signed a five year contract with Alex Korda. Her co star was Peter Finch, a fellow Australian. The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in November 1954. It was the first film Finch made under a new five year contract with the Rank Organisation.

While Archbishop of Paris, he was elected deputy of the clergy to the Estates General of 1789. Early life He was the son of Samuel-Jacques Le Clerc de Juign√© and Marie Gabrielle Le Cirier de Neufchelles (1706‚Äì1763), and younger brother of the Marquis de Juigne. Leclerc de Juign√© was descended from an old Maine family. He was barely six years old when he lost his father, Colonel of the Regiment of Orl√©ans, killed in 1734, at the Battle of Guastalla. The young Leclerc studied the Humanities and Philosophy at the College of Navarre, and entered the seminary of Saint-Nicolas-du- Chardonnet, from there he joined the Society of the Theologians of Navarre, where he made his licentiate and acquired his degrees. Armand Bazin de Bezons, Bishop of Carcassonne, who was his relative, appointed him as his vicar- general. Leclerc de Juigne soon had another career; he was appointed general agent of the clergy in 1760. The agency was attached to the care of all ecclesiastical interests and affairs. This management lasted five years but ceased if, during his course, the agent was appointed to a bishopric. It was not long after his appointment when, on 16 November 1763, the Diocese of Comminges was proposed to him to replace Antoine de Lastic, who had been transferred to the Diocese of Ch√¢lons. He declined, preferring to continue his honorable work. Bishop of Ch√¢lons Owing to the sudden death of Antoine de Lastic, he was appointed Bishop of Ch√¢lons. On arrival, he found difficulties occasioned by the ascendancy which Jansenism had taken under his predecessor, \\"he thought himself obliged to forbid and even to expel\\" some dyscole priests. After reconstructing the major seminary, he established a lesser seminary to accommodate children of the countryside who aspired to study for the ecclesiasty. > He knew all the ecclesiastics of his diocese, received them with > benevolence, was always ready to listen to them, and to enter with them in > the minutest details on what concerned the good of the parishes, the > salvation of souls, and the relief to be carried where it was needed. His > alms immortalized him in the diocese of Chalons, and his memory will long be > blessed. > ‚Äì Michaud, Ancient and Modern World Biography, 1843, 2nd Edition In 1776, in the middle of the night, a town distant from Ch√¢lons of twelve or fourteen leagues broke out in flames. Leclerc rushed towards the blaze and found Saint-Dizier heavily burned. In hopes of saving some of the victims, he charged into the flames with little precaution and was thought to have suffocated. Upon news reaching Ch√¢lons, consternation persisted until his return. These accidents, much too frequent in Champagne, moved the charitable prelate to establish at Ch√¢lons an office of relief, one of the first assurances against fires. Persuaded that a considerable increase of revenue was not in the spirit of the canons, a motive for changing his post, he refused the Archdiocese of Auch. Archbishop of Paris The death of the Archbishop of Paris left this seat vacant. The Bishop of Autun, who was then in possession of the \\"profit sheet,\\" wished to nominate the Archbishop of Toulouse, Lomenie de Brienne, but Louis XVI objected, \\"The Archbishop of Paris should at least believe in God\\", and on 22 December 1781 appointed Leclerc de Juign√©, despite the objections of other competitors. Holding true to his belief in modesty, the Bishop yielded only to the encouragement and repeated orders of the King, who saw in his choice the interest of religion. Archbishop Juign√© in 1781 De Juigne carried in his new diocese the same spirit, the same principles according to which he had governed that of Ch√¢lons, \\"the same prudence, the same moderation, the same gentleness, the same attention to maintain the peace, to try to maintain it between the priesthood and the magistracy; even zeal for ecclesiastical discipline and sound doctrine; even munificence towards the poor, his immense income was employed in alms, in good works, in pious institutions.\\" He spent most of the income of his new diocese on charity. Considerable as this income was, it could not meet the needs of the harsh winter of 1788‚Äì89. The prelate made up for this by selling his dishes, by committing his patrimony, and by taking large loans, for the guarantee of which the Marquis de Juign√©, his elder brother, was forced to pay the sum of a hundred-thousand crowns. His zeal for all that tended to the progress of the ecclesiastical sciences had made him conceive a plan for a school to train priests. This plan had begun execution at Calvaire, under the direction of the Bishop of Senez, Jean Baptiste de Beauvais. The Revolution of 1789 prevented its completion. In the Parlement of Paris he voted, on 9 January 1788, for the edict which restored to Protestants their civil status. French Revolution On 30 April 1789, the clergy of Paris elected him deputy to the Estates General. His two brothers were also called there. The Archbishop of Paris sat, \\"in these stormy assemblies, with the minority faithful to God and to the King.\\" He opposed the meeting of the three orders, and on June 19 proposed: #to verify the powers of the clergy chamber and its constitution in an active chamber; #to persevere in the pure and simple adhesion of the conciliatory plan proposed by the commissioners of the King; #to communicate the present deliberation to the orders of the Third Estate and the nobility; #to send a deputation to the King to implore him to occupy himself, in his wisdom, with the means of establishing a correspondence between the three orders of the Estates General. Watercolor engraving of Juign√© as a deputy to the Estates General Resulting at 135 votes approving this proposal, 127 voted in opposition, and 12 more joined with reservations. The motion, defeated by four votes of majority, made Archbishop Juign√© very unpopular. On 24 June, as he was leaving the Assembly at Versailles, his carriage was attacked by the very people who a few months prior he had snatched from the horrors of hunger. On the 27th he agreed to meet with the Third Estate, and his accession was hailed by the general acclamations of the assembly. At the end of the night of August 4, he proposed to sing a \\"Te Deum\\" of rejoicing, and on the 11th, he renounced the ecclesiastical tithes: > In the name of my confreres, in the name of my co-operators, and of all the > clergy who belong to this august Assembly, we are giving ecclesiastical > tithes to the hands of a just and generous nation. May the Gospel be > proclaimed, may divine worship be celebrated with decency and dignity, may > the churches be provided with virtuous and zealous priests; that the poor of > the people are helped, this is the destination of our tithes, that is the > end of our ministry and our vows. We entrust ourselves to the National > Assembly, and we have no doubt that it will afford us the means to honor > worthily and equally sacred objects. On 20 September, he offered the silverware of the churches, and on 14 April 1790, sent to the assembly his civic oath. Emigration Then, alarmed by the course of events, and no longer doubting that all was lost, he obtained permission from the King to leave France. He first sought asylum in Chamb√©ry, Savoy. From Savoy, he published an order against the election of Jean- Baptiste-Joseph Gobel as constitutional Archbishop of Paris, and was denounced by the departmental directory of Paris on 31 March 1791. He was further reproached for continuing to appoint canons to the new canonicas, despite having emigrated. De Juign√© then passed to Konstanz, where he was joined by several bishops and a great many \\"faithful\\" priests obliged to leave France. He helped them first with his purse, the sale of the few precious effects which remained to him, even of his chapel, then of the gifts which he had received from Catherine II of Russia and of princes and great prelates of Germany. He even found means of establishing a seminary in Konstanz, where young clerics were formed to replace the priests decimated by the revolutionary fury. From Schaffhausen, he was accused by the National Convention on 15 March 1795 of directing Austrian espionage against France. The success of the French armies obliged him in 1799 to leave this residence and accept asylum in Augsburg, offered to him by Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, Elector of Trier. Return to France He returned to Paris in 1802, after the promulgation of the Concordat, and without difficulty resigned, at the hands of Pope Pius VII who asked for it, his archdiocese on 31 January 1802. Juign√© then lived in retirement among his family, beloved by his old diocesans, limiting his pleasures to solitary walks, where he was astonished to be welcomed by a crowd of silent homages addressed much to his dignity, on which he bore no discernable mark. He visited with an inimitable simplicity his successor at Paris, Jean-Baptiste de Belloy, in the palace formerly his own, where both exercised respect and maintained the best relations. On 21 March 1808, Napoleon named him canon of the Imperial chapter of Saint-Denis, and created him Count of the Empire on 7 June 1808. Posthumous portrait of Antoine Leclerc de Juign√© He died in Paris on 19 March 1811, in his 83rd year, and was buried in a common grave. In the service which the metropolitan chapter gave him, Abbot Jallabert, vicar-general, pronounced his funeral oration. On the king's return, the chapter, with permission, had the body of De Juign√© exhumed and transported to the vault of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. \\"His principles were pure, his zeal equally removed from slackening and exaggeration, his mind unceasingly occupied with that which could serve the Church.\\" He joined in the happiest memory the love of serious studies, and had a taste for good literature. He was fluent in Greek, the Bible was his favorite reading, he knew it by heart, and any passage quoted to him, he indicated at once the book, chapter, and verse. A monument was erected to him and his brother, the Marquis de Juign√©, in the Cathedral of Paris. Bibliography * Louis Amable Victor Lambert.

The bridge crosses Swift Ditch which was at one time the main navigation channel of the River Thames until Abingdon Lock was built in 1790. The bridge formerly carried the A415 road from Abingdon to Dorchester, Oxfordshire, but was superseded in 1928 by a modern road bridge. It is a Grade II* listed building. History Culham Bridge was built of stone between 1416 and 1422 to replace an ancient ford called Culham Hythe by a religious body known as The Brotherhood of Christ (later Christ's Hospital) who subsequently looked after its upkeep. Parishes: Culham, A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 7: Dorchester and Thame hundreds (1962), pp. 27-39. Date accessed: 11 February 2010 It was built as part of an improvement scheme, together with the two bridges at Abingdon and a causeway across Andersey Island. It is recorded that the completion of Abingdon Bridge severely damaged trade at Wallingford.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles In the early seventeenth century the Oxford-Burcot Commission constructed a lock at the top of Swift Ditch to direct navigation under Culham Bridge and this remained the main route of the Thames until Abingdon Lock was built in 1790. Sir Henry Gage, who was killed at the bridge During the English Civil War the bridge had considerable strategic importance. After the Royalists left Abingdon in May 1644 the Parliamentarians seized Culham Bridge, and harried the royalist food convoys on the way to Oxford. The Royalists tried to recapture the bridge and demolish it in January 1645. This resulted in a skirmish on 11 January known as the battle of Culham Bridge. Sir Henry Gage \\"while boldly leading his men in a third assault on the enemy... was hit by a bullet and killed\\".Memorial in Christ Church Cathedral Oxford In the eighteenth century the road was in a very bad state, leading to an Act of Parliament for its improvement.Votes of the House of commons (which were concerned with the Oxfordshire election) Published 1754 Original from Oxford University The bridge carried the main traffic until 1928, when the modern road bridge was built upstream of it and Culham Bridge became a pedestrian bridge.

Plot A priest, Father Michael Keogh (John Mills), is sent by Rome to Quantana, a remote Mexican town which is under the control of a ruthless bandit, Anacleto Komachi (Dirk Bogarde). Anacleto is educated and intelligent, and is \\"down\\" on the Church, but he finds in Keogh a man he strangely admires and with whom he can have intelligent conversation.

Roy Ward Baker was forced to direct the film under his contract with Rank. He tried to get out of it by suggesting Luis Bu√±uel as director but was unsuccessful. Richard Burton was going to star in the film at one stage. When the Rank Organisation insisted that John Mills play the priest, Dirk Bogarde became so incensed that he told director Roy Ward Baker, \\"I promise you, if Johnny plays the priest I will make life unbearable for everyone concerned\\". The film failed at the box office, but has since developed a cult following due to its camp homosexual context and over the top performance by the black clad leather pants worn by Bogarde.

In his notes for producer Donald Brittain about the film, Lipsett wrote that \\"as science grows, religious belief seems to have diminished... The new machines (of every description) are now invested with spiritual qualities. They have become ritualistic implements.\\" Lipsett envisioned his film as a kind of cinematic time capsule for future generations, and sub-titled the film accordingly, as \\"Additional Material for a Time-Capsule.\\" A Trip Down Memory Lane combines footage from a beauty contest, religious procession, failed airflight, automotive and science experiments, animal experimentation, skyscraper construction, military paraphernalia, John D. Rockefeller and scenes of leisure, Richard Nixon and scenes of war, blimps and hot air balloons, and a sword swallower. To create the film, Lipsett travelled from Montreal to New York City to obtain stock footage in 35mm which he had reduced to 16mm. He then drew new edge code on it by hand.

The site is that of a farming village with a long occupational history. It was originally dated to 2000 BC, but these dates have now been corrected and updated to around 1200 BC.Cuello archaeology.about.comSharer & Traxler 2006, p.203. Drew 1999, p.127. Its inhabitants lived in pole-and-thatch houses that were built on top of low plaster-coated platforms. The site contains residential groups clustered around central patios. It also features the remains of a steam bath dating to approximately 900 BC, making it the oldest steam bath found to date in the Maya lowlands. Human burials have been associated with the residential structures; the oldest have no surviving burial relics, but from 900 BC onwards, they were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.203. According to some sources, ceramics from the earliest phase of the settlement at Cuello already belonged to an established lowland Maya pottery tradition.Hammond 2000, p.206 Other scholars disagree, and consider that the earliest Cuello pottery was of the Swasey type, starting at 1200 BC, with a lack of clear parallels. Although Cuello appears to have been a typical, relatively unimportant rural village in the Preclassic era, it participated in regional trade networks with obsidian being imported from the Maya highlands from 800 BC onwards, and a small amount of jade arriving in the community a few centuries later.Drew 1999, p.128. Location Cuello is located two miles Yo Creek Road in the Orange Walk District. It sits on the private land of the Cuello Family but permissions are granted to visit the site. Archaeology Uncorrected radiocarbon dates from the lowest stratigraphic levels of the site returned dates as far back as 2600 BC, although these were viewed as controversial.Estrada-Belli 2011, p.38. The site was investigated in the 1970s and 1980s by archaeologist Norman Hammond.Drew 1999, p.127. Structure 326 was excavated in 1980 and measures . The walls of the building were made of thin poles tied together with vines. This was then coated in a smoothed layer of clay and finished with a white lime wash.Hammond 2000, pp.206-207. Archaeological investigation has revealed that the diet of the Preclassic occupants of Cuello consisted of less than 30% maize, compared with up to 75% for the modern Maya. White-tailed deer made up over half the meat in their diet, followed by freshwater turtles and domestic dogs, the last of which represents 7% of the animal remains found at the site.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.163. Burials Two Late Preclassic mass burial areas have been uncovered at Cuello, one of which contained 26 or more males who had been sacrificed. Healed fractures on the bones suggest that they may have been captured warriors. Further evidence of local warfare comes from evidence of burnt buildings at the site.Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.258-259. A number of elite burials have been excavated at Cuello. The earliest phases of the Middle Classic included both adults and children accompanied by offerings of jade and shell ornaments, indicating social differentiation.Estrada-Belli 2011, p.62. High-status burials tended to be associated with specific locations throughout the history of the site. Burial 160 is an elite burial that has been dated to 500-400 BC. It consists of an individual interred in a cist, accompanied by two ceramic vessels and ornaments that included tubes fashioned from deer bones and engraved with a mat design that in later times became associated with royalty. There was also the upper portion of a human skull that had been fashioned into a plaque. Due to these distinguishing features of the burial, the excavators concluded that it was that of a Middle Classic ruler of the settlement. The site of this burial remained important in later times, with the residential patio being converted into a ceremonial platform upon which was built a small pyramid temple. Ceramic chronology The earliest pottery found in Belize is in the western part of the country, in places like Cahal Pech and Blackman Eddy. At the northern sites, the pottery is now believed to have come somewhat later.Jon C. Lohse, Jaime Awe, Cameron Griffith, Robert M. Rosenswig, and Fred Valdez, Jr., Preceramic Occupations in Belize: Updating The Paleoindian and Archaic Record. Latin American Antiquity, 17(2), 2006, pp. 209-226 The earliest Cuello pottery found is of the Swasey type, starting at about 1200 BC.Susan Toby Evans, David L.

It is used primarily for sentinel lymph node mapping and parathyroid surgery. Gamma probes are also used for RSL (radioactive seed localization), to locate small and non-palpable breast lesions. History The sentinel node market experienced high growth in the early and mid 1990s starting with melanoma sentinel node surgical search and breast cancer sentinel node staging; both are currently considered standards of care. The use of a radioactive tracer, rather than a coloured dye, was proposed in 1984. Clinical use To locate the draining lymph nodes or sentinel lymph node from a breast cancer tumour a Technetium-99m based radiopharmaceutical is common. This may be a nanocolloid or sestamibi. Although imaging with a gamma camera may also take place, the idea of a small gamma probe is that it can be used to identify lymph nodes (or other sites) with uptake at a much higher resolution, during an operation. The probe may be collimated to further restrict the field of detection.

Historical background U√≠ Maine during his reign fell away from subordinate status to the Kings of Connacht and regained something of its former independence, but at the cost of encastellation and settlement under Richard M√≥r de Burgh (died 1242) and his son, Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster (died 1271). There are only the most indirect references to U√≠ Maine in the annals, perhaps reflecting the kingdom's reduction into less significance or its domination by the de Burgh dynasty.

After an early career as a private secretary he was unexpectedly elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament in Blaydon, a traditionally extremely secure Labour constituency. After standing up in Parliament for the local mining industry he opted out of defending his seat, and could not find election elsewhere; he then became a political journalist. After wartime service in intelligence, he supported Winston Churchill's attempt to bring European unity and then became a stockbroker. A very clubbable man, he attracted interest in the 1990s as a rare survivor of the pre-Second World War Parliament. Education Martin was the son of Angus Martin, a surgeon from Forest Hall in Northumberland; his mother Robina was from Wooler.'MARTIN, Thomas Ballantyne', Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007, accessed 11 February 2010. He grew up in the borders area but went to Giggleswick School boarding school, and later matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge\\"Thomas Martin\\" (Obituary), The Times, 7 February 1995. where he graduated with a Master of Arts. Election in Blaydon During the 1920s Martin worked as a private secretary,\\"The Times House of Commons 1931\\", p. 71. and was on the staff of the Turkish Embassy in London as its English Secretary in 1928 and in 1930‚Äì31. He undertook a lecture tour of Germany in 1929.Michael Stenton and Stephen Lees, \\"Who's Who of British MPs\\" Vol III, Harvester Press, 1979, p. 239. In October 1931, when the general election was already underway, he was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for the constituency of Blaydon in County Durham;\\"New Candidates\\", The Times, 14 October 1931, p. 7, although his name was inaccurately given as 'Martin, P.B.'. the seat had a Labour majority of 13,374 and was thought absolutely safe. However Martin was elected with a majority of 496 as part of the landslide election victory of the National Government; his win was the only time that the seat had been won by a Conservative. Unparliamentary language Martin's first recorded contribution in the chamber of the House of Commons came in December 1931 during bad tempered scenes. Angered by opposition Members jeering at Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald he was overheard by Labour MP Valentine MacEntee shouting out \\"Lie down, dog!\\"; MacEntee raised a point of order and challenged him to repeat it outside. The Deputy Speaker Robert Bourne pronounced it unparliamentary and urged Martin to restrain his exuberance.Hansard, House of Commons, 5th series, vol 260 col 1911. Mining industry In Parliament, Martin concentrated on issues which affected the working lives of his mining constituents. In May 1932 he made his maiden speech on the Coal Mines Bill, urging a system where the mine owner had a guaranteed profit, while the miner had a guaranteed minimum wage, with additions according to the business done. He also endorsed a voluntary national levy on the coal trade to help exports.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 31 May 1932, p. 8. He accepted that other industries should not be sacrificed to help the coal trade,\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 2 May 1933, p. 8. but urged that operating theatres be set up near to mines to help miners who had suffered industrial accidents.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 3 March 1934; p. 7. Martin moved an amendment to the 1933 Budget to limit the tax on hydrocarbon oils to no more than 10%. The Government opposed his amendment and the House of Commons rejected it by 228 to 58.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 20 June 1933, p. 9. He also voted against the Government and in support of an amendment to remove the profits of Co-operative Societies from tax.\\"Political Notes\\", The Times, 23 May 1933, p. 14. He initially supported the National Government's efforts to help distressed areas, urging that the grants be continued until the Unemployment Act replaced them,\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 28 February 1934, p. 7. but by December 1934 was disappointed on behalf of himself and other younger supporters of the Government to find the latest proposals which would not help the basic industries. Martin stated that he could not go back to depressed areas in his constituency and tell them that the Government's policy was a solution to all their problems.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 4 December 1934, p. 7. Germany While a member of parliament, Martin visited Germany where he met leading Nazis Hitler, Goering and Goebbels; he was invited to a Nuremberg rally, but also visited Dachau. When he returned to Britain, Martin warned fellow members of parliament about the dangers of Nazism. He was one of 31 members of parliament to sign a letter endorsing an All-India Federation with provincial autonomy as a way forward of constitutional reform in India.\\"Views on Indian Policy\\", The Times, 11 May 1933, p. 14. 1935 election He was also much preoccupied with pushing forward a new constitution for the University of Durham.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 1 May 1935, p. 7. Preparing for the next general election, Martin decided not to defend Blaydon, but was instead adopted as candidate for Camberwell North in inner south London in May 1935.\\"M.P. as Prospective Candidate\\", The Times, 23 May 1935, p. 18. The sitting MP Arthur Bateman had stepped down although at one stage considered standing for neighbouring Peckham as an Independent candidate.\\"Straight Fight at Peckham\\", The Times, 4 November 1935, p. 18. At the previous election, Camberwell North had produced a Conservative majority of 765, almost as small as at Blaydon. Martin joined the other Conservative candidates for Camberwell divisions in inviting Winston Churchill to speak for them;\\"Mr. Churchill to Speak at Camberwell\\", The Times, 29 October 1935, p. 9. but observers expected that the leading Labour personality Charles Ammon would succeed in regaining the seat he had lost four years previously.\\"Contests in South London\\", The Times, 8 November 1935, p. 9. Martin was in the end beaten by nearly two to one, with a substantial majority of 5,777 against him.\\"The Times House of Commons 1935\\", p. 35. Daily Telegraph journalist After losing his seat, Martin returned to the Palace of Westminster the next year as a political correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, where he remained until 1940. He was also assistant editor of The Spectator, becoming a regular houseguest of Lady Londonderry and of the Astor family at Cliveden. He was a liaison officer between the Foreign Office and the BBC\\"The Times House of Commons 1945\\", p. 79. and then volunteered for military service during the Second World War, becoming a Squadron Leader in the Middle East Intelligence Centre (part of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve) from 1940 to 1943, then leaving the services to become adviser on public relations to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia where he remained until the end of the war. European unity In the 1945 general election, Martin was the Conservative Party candidate in Houghton-le-Spring where he was defeated by 21,866 votes. Martin then became secretary of the United European Movement in 1947, working closely with Winston Churchill for a year before becoming Secretary of the British all-party delegation to the Congress of Europe at The Hague in 1948. There Churchill developed his support for European unity, an attitude of which Martin approved. Martin regretted that Churchill did not maintain his enthusiasm when he returned to government in 1951. Later life Martin developed his career by becoming a member of the London Stock Exchange in 1949, but retained his interest in politics and contributed many letters to newspapers. In 1953 he married for the first time, Jean Bennett; they had two daughters. In 1964 Martin and Dr Charles Goodson-Wickes reformed the Kit Cat Club as an attempt to restart an 18th-century Whig dining club; it gathered a significant membership, many of whom entered public life (Dr Goodson-Wickes himself became a member of parliament). After his retirement from the Stock Exchange in 1974, Martin moved back to the borders area of Northumberland where he lived at Naworth Keep and Dacre Castle. He retained his membership of Pratt's Club where he was said to be \\"in his element leading the conversation at the head of the table\\"; so welcome was he at the club that when he resigned his membership owing to the decreasing number of visits to London, the club proprietor the Duke of Devonshire refused to accept it and waived the subscription to keep him. In 1990 the Speaker of the House of Commons Bernard Weatherill held a dinner in honour of the 23 remaining pre-war MPs at which Martin was one of the star guests; he was interviewed by the BBC afterwards. He appeared in a 1994 documentary on \\"Westminster at War\\" which interviewed the survivors of the era about what political life was like. He remained mentally alert but in his later years became physically infirm, which he recognised as \\"a downward glide\\" to a serene death.

AVE devices are often termed light and sound machines or mind machines. Altering brainwave activity is believed to aid in the treatment of psychological and physiological disorders. Introduction All of our senses (except smell) access the brain's cerebral cortex via the thalamus, and because the thalamus is highly innervated with the cortex, sensory stimulation can easily influence cortical activity. In order to affect brain (neuronal) activity, sensory stimulation must be within the frequency range of roughly 0.5 to 25 hertz (Hz) . Touch, photic and auditory stimulation are capable of affecting brain wave activity. A large area of skin must be stimulated to affect brainwaves, which leaves both auditory and photic stimulation as the most effective and easiest means of affecting brain activity. Therefore, mind machines are typically in the form of light and sound devices.Siever, D. (2007) Audio-visual entrainment: history, physiology, and clinical studies. Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications, Chapter 7 (pp. 155-183) Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Medical Press. Auditory or visual stimulation (AVS) can take a variety of forms, generating different subjective and clinical effects. The simplest form of stimulation is to present a series of random light flashes and/or sound pulses to a subject, such as from watching TV or cars drive by, and investigate the resulting subjective experiences or electroencephalography (EEG) effects. AVE, however, involves organized, repetitive stimulation at a particular frequency for a specific period of time, and the frequency of stimulation is reflected within the EEG. This is called \\"open loop\\" stimulation, or free-running entrainment, and is not contingent on monitoring brainwaves in any way. \\"Close loop\\" AVE would involve visual and auditory stimulation in response to one's EEG.Collura, T. & Siever, D. (2009) Audio-visual entrainment in relation to mental health and EEG. In J.R. Evans & A. Abarbanel (Eds.) Quantitative EEG and Neurofeedback (2nd Ed.) (pp. 155-183) San Diego, CA: Academic Press. History Clinical reports of flicker stimulation appear as far back as the beginning of the 20th century. Pierre Janet, at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in France, reported that by having his patients gaze into the flickering light produced from a spinning, spoked wheel in front of a kerosene lantern, they showed a reduction in their anxiety and hysteria.Pieron, H. (1982) Melanges dedicated to Monsieur Pierre Janet. Acta Psychiatrica Belgica, 1, 7-112. With the development of the EEG, Adrian and MatthewsAdrian, E. & Matthews, B.(1934) The Berger rhythm: potential changes from the occipital lobes in man. Brain, 57, 355-384. published their results showing that the alpha rhythm could be \\"driven\\" above and below the natural frequency with photic stimulation. This discovery prompted several small physiological outcome studies on the \\"flicker-following response,\\" the brain's electrical response to repetitive stimulationBartley, S.

As EEG equipment improved, so did a renewed interest in the brain's evoked response to photic and auditory entrainment and soon, a variety of studies were completed.Barlow, J.

(1959) Response to clicks from the human brain: some depth electrographic observations. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 12, 479-489. In 1956, W. Gray Walter published the first results on thousands of test subjects comparing flicker stimulation with the subjective emotional feelings it produced. Test subjects reported all types of visual illusions and in particular, the \\"whirling spiral\\" which was significant with alpha production.Walter, W.G. (1956) Color illusions and aberrations during stimulation by flickering light. Nature, 177, 710. In the late 1950s, as a result of Kroger's observations as to why US military radar operators often drifted into trance, Kroger teamed up with Sidney Schneider of the Schneider Instrument Company. They produced the world's first electronic clinical photic stimulator - the Schneider Brain Wave Synchronizer.Kroger, W.S., & Schneider, S.A. (1959) An electronic aid for hypnotic induction: a preliminary report. International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, 7, 93-98. It had powerful hypnotic qualities and soon studies on hypnotic induction were publishedLewerenz, C. (1963) A factual report on the brainwave synchronizer. Hypnosis Quarterly, 6(4), 23.Sadove, M.S. (1963) Hypnosis in anaesthesiology. Illinois Medical Journal, 39-42.Margolis, B. (1966) A technique for rapidly inducing hypnosis.CAL (Certified Akers Laboratories), June, 21-24. A variety of companies developing AVE (light and sound) devices have been established since this time. Physiology AVE is believed to achieve its effects through several mechanisms simultaneously. These include: * altered EEG activity * dissociation/hypnotic induction * limbic stabilization * improved neurotransmitter production * altered cerebral blood flowSiever, D. (2007) Audio-visual entrainment: history, physiology, and clinical studies. Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications, Chapter 7 (pp. 155-183) Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Medical Press. AVE consists of constant, repetitive stimuli of the proper frequency and sufficient strength to \\"excite\\" the thalamus and neocortex. These stimuli do not transfer energy directly into the cortex. The direct transmission of energy from AVE only goes so far as to excite retinal cells in the eyes and pressure-sensitive cilia within the cochlea in the ears. The nerve pathways from the eyes and ears carry the elicited electrical potentials into the thalamus. From there, the entrained electrical activity within the thalamus is \\"amplified\\" and distributed throughout other limbic areas and the cerebral cortexes via the cortical thalamic loop. AVE involves the continuous electrical response of the brain in relation to the stimulus frequency plus the mathematical representation (harmonics) of the stimulus wave shape.Siever, D. (2007) Audio-visual entrainment: history, physiology, and clinical studies. Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications, Chapter 7 (pp. 155-183) Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Medical Press. Effects AVE effects on the EEG are found primarily over the sensory-motor strip, frontally, and in the parietal lobe (somatosensory) regions and slightly less within the prefrontal cortex.Siever, D. (2007) Audio-visual entrainment: history, physiology, and clinical studies. Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications, Chapter 7 (pp. 155-183) Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Medical Press. It is within these areas where motor activation, attention, executive function, and somatosensory (body) awareness is primarily mediated. Auditory entrainment (AE) is the same concept as visual entrainment, with the exception that auditory signals are passed from the cochlea of the ears into the thalamus via the medial geniculate nucleus, whereas visual entrainment passes from the retina into the thalamus via the lateral geniculate nucleus.McClintic, J. (1978). Physiology of the human body. John Whiley & Sons, New York, NY. Eyes-closed AVE at 18.5 Hz has been shown to increase EEG brainwave activity by 49% at the vertex. At the vertex (with the eyes closed) AE has been shown to increase EEG brainwave activity by 21%.Frederick, J.A., Timmerman, D.L., Russell, H.L, & Lubr, J.F. (1999) Effects of 18.5 Hz audiovisual stimulation on EEG amplitude at the vertex. Journal of Neurotherapy, 3(3), 23-27. Successful entrainment leads to a meditative, peaceful kind of dissociation, where the individual experiences a loss of somatic and cognitive awareness. However, it is possible for visual entrainment to trigger seizures. Evidence of sensory effects HuxleyHuxley, A. (1954) The doors of perception/heaven and hell. New York: Harper & Row, 1963 edition. and WalterWalter, W.G. (1956) Color illusions and aberrations during stimulation by flickering light. Nature, 177 710. were among the first to articulate the subjective correlates of photic stimulation. They described subjective experiences of incessantly changing patterns, whose color was a function of the rate of flashing. Between ten and fifteen flashes per second, Walter reported orange and red; above fifteen, green and blue; above eighteen, white and grey. Huxley also described enriched and intensified experiences when subjects were under the effects of mescaline or lysergic acid. In his view, the rhythms of the lamp interacted with the rhythms of the brain's electrical activity to produce a complex interference pattern, which is translated by the brain's perceptual circuits into a conscious pattern of color and movement. Glicksohn also reported on altered states of consciousness from photic driving and its relationship of self-perceived creativity.Glicksohn, J. (1986/87) Photic driving and altered states of consciousness: an exploratory study. Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 6(2) New York, 167-182. Other studies have shown that stimulation can produce both transient and lasting changes in the EEG.Collura, T.F. (2001). Application of repetitive visual stimulation to EEG neurofeedback protocols. Journal of Neurotherapy, 6(1), 47-70.Frederick, J.A., Timmerman, D.L., Russell, H.L., & Lubr, J.F. (2005) EEG coherence effects of audio-visual stimulation (AVS) at dominant and twice dominant alpha frequency Journal of Neurotherapy, 8(4), 25-42. Collura articulated the relationship between the low-frequency and high-frequency components of the steady-state visual evoked potential as reflecting anatomically and physiologically distinct response mechanisms. Additional clinical studies explored the use of photic entrainment to induce hypnotic trance,Kroger, W.S., & Scheider, S.A. (1959) An electronic aid for hypnotic induction: a preliminary report. International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, 7, 93-98.Lewerenz, C.(1963) A factual report on the brain wave synchronizer. Hypnosis Quartlerly, 6(4), 23. to augment anasthesia during surgery,Sadove, M.S. (1963) Hypnosis in anaesthesiology. Illinois Medical Journal, 39-42. and to reduce pain, control gagging and accelerate healing in dentistry.Margolis, B. (1966) A technique for rapidly inducing hypnosis. CAL (Certified Akers Laboratories), 21-24. More recently, the induction of dissociation was explored, which aided the understanding of dissociative pathology and development of better techniques for relaxing people suffering from trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.Leonard, K., Telch, M., & Harrington, P.(1999) Dissociation in the laboratory: a comparison of strategies. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 37, 49-61.Leonard, K., Telch, M., & Harrinton, P. (2000) Fear response to dissociation challenge. Anxiety, Stress and Coping, 13, 355-369. Dissociation begins after approximately four to eight minutes from properly applied AVE. A restabilization effect occurs where muscles relax, electro-dermal activity decreases, peripheral blood flow stabilizes, breathing becomes diaphragmatic and relaxed, and heart rates becomes uniform and smooth.Siever, D. (2007) Audio-visual entrainment: history, physiology, and clinical studies. Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications, Chapter 7 (pp. 155-183) Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Medical Press. Visual entrainment alone, in the alpha frequency range (7‚Äì10 Hz), has been shown to easily induce hypnosis,Lewerenz, C.(1963) A factual report on the brain wave synchronizer. Hypnosis Quartlerly, 6(4), 23. and it has been shown that nearly 80% of subjects entered into either a light or deep hypnotic trance within six minutes during alpha AVE.Kroger, W.S., & Scheider, S.A. (1959) An electronic aid for hypnotic induction: a preliminary report. International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, 7, 93-98. AVE provides an excellent medium for achieving an altered state of consciousness.Glicksohn, J. (1986/87) Photic driving and altered states of consciousness: an exploratory study. Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 6(2) New York, 167-182. Research A review of 20 studies on brainwave entrainment found that it is effective in improving cognition and behavioral problems, and alleviating stress and pain.Huang, T.L., & Charyton, C. (2008) A comprehensive review of the psychological effects of brainwave entrainment. Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, 14(5). The results of a study on children with attention- deficit disorder found that AVE was more effective than neurofeedback for treating ADD symptoms.Joyce M., & Siever, D.(2000) Audio-visual entrainment program as a treatment for behavior disorders in a school setting. Journal of Neurotherapy, 4(2), 9-15. A migraine headache study involving seven migraine sufferers found that AVE sessions reduced migraine duration from a pretreatment average of six hours to a posttreatment average of 35 minutes. Measuring 50 of the participants' migraines, 49 migraines decreased in severity and 36 were stopped when using AVE.Anderson, D. (1989) The treatment of migraine with variable frequency photic stimulation. Headache, 29, 154-155. Another clinical study showed declines in depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation following a treatment program using AVE.Gagnon, C., & Boersma, F. (1992) The use of repetitive audio-visual entrainment in the management of chronic pain. Medical Hypnoanalysis Journal, 7, 462-468. A study by Berg and Siever used audio-visual entrainment devices on women suffering with seasonal affective disorder. Both depression and anxiety symptoms were reduced in participants, as compared to a placebo phase. Participants also reported improvements in their social lives, with increased happiness and sociability, decreased appetite, increased energy and weight loss.Berg, K., & Siever, D. (2009) A controlled comparison of audio-visual entrainment for treating SAD. Journal of Neurotherapy, 13(3), 166-175.

(2009) QEEG correlates of auditory-visual entrainment treatment efficacy of refractory depression. Journal of Neurotherapy, 13(2), 100-108. A study by Thomas and Siever showed that many people with chronic temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) brace up when asked to relax. AVE at 10 Hz produced deep masseter muscle relaxation and finger warming within six minutes.Thomas, N. & Siever, D.

The plot revolves around a dancer who is lured to a strange town and thrown into a deadly game after being kidnapped by a serial killer. Stripped naked, she is forced to run for her life through the vast uninhabited regions of New Mexico while being pursued by a maniacal hunter.http://allmovie.com/work/naked-fear-465087 Plot The story begins with a naked woman in the middle of nowhere, obviously under duress. She falls after being shot. A man walks up behind her and executes her with a pistol. The story then shifts to Diana Kelper, a young and beautiful dancer starting a new job at a nightclub. She's lured to a small town in New Mexico with promises by club owner Jack to pay her well for performing on stage at his club with later prospects of working in Las Vegas. Fred, Jack's agent, pays for her airfare, puts her up in a motel, takes her driver's license, charges her back for his expenses with interest, and threatens her references should she flee. Unable to make enough money dancing, she falls deeper into debt until she is forced into prostitution. Soliciting her first \\"client\\" Colin Mandle, she gets in his jeep but at the last minute she changes her mind, only for Mandle to choke her unconscious. Diana wakes up naked in a field. She spots an airplane nearby and walks towards it. As she gets closer, she sees Mandle stowing his hunting gear, so she hides behind a tree trunk. Hearing her approach, he tells her that he's giving her a fifteen-minute start. He fires a bolt near her as a warning and she turns and runs into the wilderness. The boomtown population is highly transient and it's not unusual for people to go missing. However, Dwight Terry, a recently hired sheriff deputy‚Äîwho had been forced to leave a previous police job due to arresting too prominent a person‚Äîis concerned about the disappearance of Diana (and other women from the club), and begins to question Jack. Jack denies any involvement, saying he has enough trouble getting girls to perform at his club. Dwight begins to question the club owner's business, but is warned off by Sheriff Tom Benike. He realizes that he's on his own in solving the case. His wife is similarly unsupportive, fearing he might lose his job over \\"some slut.\\" He breaks into Mandle's home, whom he suspects of being responsible for the disappearances. He is stopped by Benike, who had been alerted to a possible break-in by a neighbor. Diana is spotted by Mandle multiple times but she manages to lose him over and over. He even shoots a rattlesnake before it can strike her, denying her the \\"easy way out\\". She climbs up a cliff. Mandle sees her and begins to climb up after her. As he reaches the top, she appears holding a large rock over her head, which she throws down on Mandle, causing him to fall. She stumbles upon a man and his two sons who are out hiking. Diana collapses, unable to speak. The father takes her to their tent, where she falls asleep. He sees her wounds and realizes that something happened to her. After praying with his sons and leaving them in charge of the camp, he leaves to seek help. Meanwhile, Mandle has regained consciousness and resumes his hunt, following Diana to the camp. After unsuccessfully attempting to persuade the boys to allow him to take Diana with him (ostensibly to fly her to the hospital in his plane), Mandle kills them both. Diana takes Mandle's gun and tries to shoot him, only to discover it's uncocked. He advances on her, but Diana stabs him in the leg, bites his ear off and runs off again, finding the father's corpse along the way. Diana finds a road and is hit by two young men driving a van. Following a brief skirmish, she manages to run down and finally kill Mandle with the van. After driving back into town, she is taken to a hospital, but the experience has traumatized her so much that she is left much like a dangerous animal, wary of human kindness. Dwight brings her flowers and is told that she's chewed through her restraints and escaped. Ten months later, posing as a prostitute, Diana lures a man and kills him, stepping out of his car and walking away. A news report attributes the resulting dozens of killings of sex offenders to a Vigilante dubbed \\"The Southwest Slayer.\\" Cast * Danielle De Luca as Diana Kelper * J.D.

Like Hansen, Colin Mandle is a successful, well- known business owner in the food industry, is an award-winning bow hunter, owns and flies his own plane, and keeps jewelry from his victims as trophies. He also frequents strip clubs and hires call girls, who become his victims.

On September 22, 2009, thefirm announced that it had raised $6 million to expand its services to Southern California and California's Central Valley. On May 1, 2010, Sungevity partnered with US Bank and launched its Solar Lease program. In December 2010, the firm raised an additional $15 million toward its Series C funding round. In 2011, it worked with U.S. Bancorp, Rabobank, and Citigroup to fund residential solar installations. Also in 2011, Lowe's, the home-improvement retailer, purchased a stake in Sungevity. In April 2014, the firm raised $70 million in equity from investors including General Electric, Lowe's, Jetstream Ventures, and E.ON, Europe's largest investor-owned utility. On December 15, 2015, it announced its $600 million private equity funding by investors including GE Ventures as well as Apollo Investment Corporation. In November 2011, the firm announced it was taking an equity stake in Dutch solar company Zonline. Sungevity was to provide Zonline with its proprietary software tools, including the company's Remote Solar Design services and brand-identity assets. In June 2014, Sungevity acquired Zonline and launched Sungevity Netherlands. In April 2012, Sungevity and Australian solar company Nickel Energy announced a joint venture, called Sungevity Australia, that would provide Australian homeowners with their first pay-as-you-go solar option, which the company dubbed RoofJuice. In January 2017 the company laid off senior and mid-level managers, and in March it laid off around 2/3 of its staff without notice, with sources at the company suggesting bankruptcy was imminent. The ex-employees filed a lawsuit seeking back pay for 60 days, a requirement under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. In April, after laying off another 2/3 of its staff without severance pay, the remainder of the company was sold to private equity firm Northern Pacific Group for $50 million, who created a new company, Solar Spectrum, which acquired Sungevity's infrastructure, technology, installer network, supplier warranties, and certain agreements. Northern Pacific Group also acquired Sungevity's European businesses which were subsequently sold to French utility Engie. The now Engie owned European business operates under the name Sungevity International.  Globama (Solar on the White House)  In April 2010, Sungevity introduced the \\"Solar on the White House\\" campaign. The stated purpose of the campaign was to have the President highlight the environmental and fiscal benefits of solar energy. The campaign highlighted the fact that President Jimmy Carter had installed solar panels on the White House in 1979, at the same time he introduced several solar incentives. The panels were removed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 when Carter's incentives ran out. In August 2013, solar panels were installed on the White House. The system became operational in May 2014. During the campaign for solar on the White House, Sungevity was approached by President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives for help installing solar panels on the Maldivian Presidential Palace, the Muliaage. This campaign later led to the launch of an independent nonprofit called Solar Head of State.

Biography Adam Sedbar had been elected abbot of the Cistercian abbey of Jervaulx in 1533 when Henry VIII introduced his plans for the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He was persuaded in 1536, somewhat reluctantly, to join in a Pilgrimage of Grace, together with other local abbots from Fountains, Bridlington and Guisborough Abbeys, in order to protest about the king's policies. The cause attracted a large number of followers, and urged on by a few fanatics, became increasingly militant. After a number of Yorkshire towns were attacked by the insurgents the King eventually decided, after some negotiation with their spokesman, to round up the ringleaders and charge them with treason. Sedbar sought sanctuary with John Scrope, 8th Baron Scrope of Bolton at his stronghold in Bolton Castle. When the King's Commissioners followed him there, Lord Scrope fled for his own safety and Sedbar hid out for several days on Witton Fell but was captured on 12 May 1537 and taken with others to be tried in London. He was imprisoned in the Beauchamp tower in the Tower of London, where his inscribed name on the wall \\"ADAM SEDBAR. ABBAS JOREVALL 1537\\" can still be clearly seen. He was charged that \\"he did conspire to deprive the King of his title of Supreme Head of the English Church, and to compel him to hold a certain Parliament and convocation of the clergy of the realm, and did commit divers insurrections...\\" and \\"tried\\" or examined on both 25 April and 24 May. Although he claimed that the objectives of the insurrection were non- ecclesiastical he was found guilty, as were the other abbots, several monks and various lay ringleaders. He was taken with others on 2 June 1537 to Tyburn where they were hanged, drawn and quartered. The Prior of Bridlington suffered the same fate on the same day, as had the Abbot of Fountains and Prior of Guisborough a few days earlier. Their heads were all displayed on London Bridge.

You will also not disclose anything about the Jury's deliberation other than as required by law. France According to the French Code of Penal Procedure, all jurors must individually swear to the following message from the judge presiding the court: :You swear and promise to examine with the most scrupulous attention the charges that will be laid against [the defendant]; to betray neither the interests of the defendant, nor the interests of the society that accuses him, nor the interests of the victim; not to communicate with anybody until you [declare your verdict]; not to listen to hatred, malice, fear or affection; to remember that the defendant is presumed to be innocent and that doubt must benefit him; to decide for yourself according to the charges and the means of defense, according to your conscience and intimate conviction, with the impartiality and firmness that befits an honest and free person, and to keep the secret of the deliberations, even after you cease to be a juror.

Historic roots  Guild chest of the potters in Senftenberg (1750) A Kundschaft certifcate for a carpenter leaving Bremen in 1818 In medieval times the apprentice was bound to his master for a number of years. He lived with the master as a member of the household, receiving most or all of his compensation in the form of food and lodging; in Germany an apprentice normally had to pay a fee (German: Lehrgeld) for his apprenticeship. After the years of apprenticeship (Lehrjahre) the apprentice was absolved from his obligations (this absolution was known as a Freisprechung). The guilds, however, would not allow a young craftsman without experience to be promoted to master‚Äîthey could only choose to be employed, but many chose instead to roam about. Until craftsmen became masters, they would only be paid by the day (the French word journ√©e refers to the time span of a day). In parts of Europe, such as in later medieval Germany, spending time as a journeyman (Geselle), moving from one town to another to gain experience of different workshops, became an important part of the training of an aspirant master. Carpenters in Germany have retained the tradition of travelling journeymen even today, although only a small minority still practice it. In the Middle Ages, the number of years spent journeying differed according to the craft. Only after half of the required journeyman years (Wanderjahre) would the craftsman register with a guild for the right to be an apprentice master. After completing the journeyman years, he would settle in a workshop of the guild and after toughing it out for several more years (Mutjahre), he would be allowed to produce a \\"masterpiece\\" (German: Meisterst√ºck) and to present it to the guild. With their consent he would be promoted to guild master and as such be allowed to open his own guild workshop in town. The development of social-contract theories resulted in a system of subscriptions and certificates. When arriving in a new town the journeyman would be pointed to a survey master (Umschaumeister) or to a survey companion (Umschaugeselle). He would be given a list of workshops to present himself to find work (Umschau literally means \\"look-around\\"). When not succeeding the journeyman would be given a small amount of money (Zehrgeld) - enough to sustain his travel to the next town. Otherwise he would get a place in a guild shelter (Gesellenherberge). His name would be added to the guild chest (Zunftlade) along with a declaration of how long he would be bound to the master, usually for half a year. Both sides could recall that subscription (Einschreibung) at any time. The subscription of a new companion commonly became the occasion of a big carousal among the other bound journeymen in town. When leaving the town the guild would hand over a certificate (Kundschaft) telling of the work achievements along with asserting the journeyman's proper conduct and the orderly ending of the subscription. It was hard to find a new subscription in the next town without it, but in reality masters did often complain about journeymen running away. Many guild shelters had a black board telling the names of such absconders - along with the debts they had left behind. The certificates were hand-written until about 1730, when printed forms evolved with places to fill in details. By about 1770 the forms started to carry a copperplate print of the cityscape. The certificates were often large and unhandy, so that smaller travelling books replaced them by about 1820. This practice coincided with the establishment of modern police in Europe after the coalition wars (1803-1815) against Napoleon. The guild chest was replaced by state offices to keep registers. In some places the guilds were even banned to maintain registers.

Sociologically, one may see the Wanderjahre as recapitulating a nomadic phase of human societal development. Compare: See also Rumspringa.  Germany  Carpenters \\"on the Walz\\", 1990 The tradition of the journeyman years (auf der Walz sein) persisted well into the 1920s in German-speaking countries, but was set back by multiple events like Nazis allegedly banning the tradition, the postwar German economic boom making it seem too much of a burden, and in East Germany the lack of opportunities for work in an economic system based on Volkseigener Betrieb. Beginning in the late 1980s, renewed interest in tradition in general together with economic changes (especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall) have caused the tradition to gain wider acceptance. The tradition was brought back to life mostly unchanged from the medieval concept since the journeyman brotherhoods (Sch√§chte) never ceased to exist. (including a Confederation of European Journeymen Associations). The journeyman brotherhoods had established a standard to ensure that wandering journeymen are not mistaken for tramps and vagabonds. The journeyman is required to be unmarried, childless and debt-free‚Äîso that the journeyman years will not be taken as a chance to run away from social obligations. In modern times the brotherhoods often require a police clearance. Additionally, journeymen are required to wear a specific uniform (Kluft) and to present themselves in a clean and friendly manner in public. This helps them to find shelter for the night and a ride to the next town. A travelling book (Wanderbuch) was given to the journeyman and in each new town, he would go to the town office asking for a stamp. This qualifies both as a record of his journey and also replaces the residence registration that would otherwise be required. In contemporary brotherhoods the \\"Walz\\" is required to last at least three years and one day (sometimes two years and one day). During the journeyman years the wanderer is not allowed to return within a perimeter of 50 km of his home town, except in specific emergency situations, such as the impending death of an immediate relative. At the beginning of the journey, the wanderer takes only a small, fixed sum of money with him (exactly five Deutschmarks was common, now five Euros); at its end, he should come home with exactly the same sum of money in his pocket. Thus, he is supposed neither to squander money nor to store up any riches during the journey, which should be undertaken only for the experience. There are secret signs, such as specific, involved handshakes, that German carpenters traditionally use to identify each other. They are taught to the beginning journeyman before he leaves. This is another traditional method to protect the trade against impostors. While less necessary in an age of telephones, identity cards and official diplomas, the signs are still retained as a tradition. Teaching them to anybody who has not successfully completed a carpenter apprenticeship is still considered very wrong, even though it is no longer a punishable crime today. As of 2005, there were 600 to 800 journeymen \\"on the Walz\\", either associated with a brotherhood or running free. While the great majority are still male, young women are no longer unheard of on the Walz today.  Journeyman uniform in Germany  Journeymen can be easily recognised on the street by their clothing. The carpenter's black hat has a broad brim; some professions use a black stovepipe hat or a cocked hat. The carpenters wear black bell-bottoms and a waistcoat and carry the Stenz, which is a traditional curled hiking pole. Since many professions have since converted to the uniform of the carpenters, many people in Germany believe that only carpenters go journeying, which is untrue ‚Äì since the carpenter's uniform is best known and well received, it simply eases the journey. The uniform is completed with a golden earring and golden bracelets‚Äîwhich could be sold in hard times and in the Middle Ages could be used to pay the gravedigger if any wanderer should die on his journey. The journeyman carried his belongings in a leather backpack called the Felleisen, but some medieval towns, Charlottenburg probably having been the first and there in particular the temporary homes dedicated to house journeymen, banned those (for the fleas in them) so that most journeyman started to make use of a coarse cloth thus called Charlottenburger (abbreviated to \\"Charlie\\") to wrap up their belongings.

As such, a priest could set out on an extended journey to do research in the libraries of monasteries across Europe and gain wider knowledge and experience. The traveler books or Wanderb√ºcher are an important research source which show migration paths in the early period of industrialisation in Europe. Journeymen's paths often show boundaries of language and religion that hindered travel of craftsmen \\"on the Walz\\".

Description As in all peanut worms, the body of S. nudus consists of a sac-like portion called the trunk and an eversible proboscis called the introvert. The mouth is located at the anterior end of the introvert and is surrounded by a group of tentacles. The body of the adult worm is around in length but can reach up to in some cases, of which about to correspond to the introvert. The epidermis contains a series of longitudinal coelomic canals that are connected to the main coelomic cavity by pores. Below the epidermis there are circular muscles surrounding the body which, as the coelomic canals, are marked on the surface, making the animal's surface be marked by rectangular ridges. Distribution Sipunculus nudus is commonly found on subtidal zones of sandy shores to seabeds deep in temperate or tropical waters worldwide. The worm hides in sand burrows which it makes by itself during the day and may extend its tentacles out of the burrow to feed at night. Its diet consists of plant or animal tissue fragments and any surrounding sand it may ingest with it. Recent research indicates that it is a complex of similar species around the world rather than one species, with at least \\"five distinct lineages identified by phylogenetic analyses\\". Uses On sale in Guangzhou The species is collected and sold as a model organism for various fields of science, as fish bait, or for human consumption. It is also sold and exported as a dried seafood product. In particular, S. nudus is collected, cleaned of its innards, and eaten as a delicacy in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi, and Fujian. The worms are local delicacies in Beihai, Guangxi, where Bƒõih«éi shƒÅch√≥ng (, lit. \\"Beihai sandworm\\") and sold in dried form to be fried as a snack or braised as an ingredient for a soup stock. In Xiamen, Fujian, the species is called t«îs«în (, lit. \\"earth bamboo shoot\\") and is braise and allow to gel in the liquid as eaten as aspic t«îs«înd√≤ng) in local restaurants.

Forward In the forward to the first edition, Fromm explains that Psychoanalysis and Religion is a continuation of the thoughts he expressed in his 1947 book Man for Himself. He states that he is not asserting that his thesis applies to all researchers and practitioners in the field of psychoanalysis. In an updated forward to a 1967 printing, Fromm indicates that he believed the work had held up despite advances made over the intervening years, and he made no changes. According to an early reviewer, Fromm wrote Psychoanalysis and Religion in \\"an effort to reconcile the faith of the scientist with the ageless belief of man in the goodness and omnipotence of the Absolute....\\" As evidenced by this and his other works, Fromm was fascinated by the psychological aspects of religion and what seemed to be a ubiquitous need for religion by humans. Fromm postulated an explanation for this phenomenon, that people respond to and are comforted by the structure and discipline of church authority. Religion helps people to find fellowship and some modicum of control over their lives, and is thus a defense against feelings of powerlessness and loneliness. \\"To some people return to religion is the answer, not as an act of faith but in order to escape an intolerable doubt; they make this decision not out of devotion but in search of security.\\" (Fromm 1950, p. 4) Self-awareness, with its potential for causing acute emotional feelings, can be frightening and overwhelming. Religion may serve to help ameliorate such fears. In discerning the positive and negative effects of religion on individuals, Fromm drew a distinction between authoritarian and humanistic religions. Authoritarian religious entities promulgate the belief that humans are at the mercy of an omnipotent God, whereas humanistic ones promote the belief that the power of God is visible in the mane of the individual. According to Fromm, authoritarian religions disserve the individual by denying their individual identities, while humanistic ones provide for personal validation and growth. While Fromm provided for the possibility that religion could be a positive influence in an individual's life, perhaps facilitating happiness and comfort, his critique serves mainly to condemn, at a very basic level, most religious orders, especially those orders most commonly practiced in Western culture. Accordingly, Fromm's thesis is rejected by most theologians. See also * Psychology of religion * Jensen, Walter A.

Exhibits The Ulan-Ude Ethnographic Museum is one of the largest open air museums in Russia. The museum covers an area of 37 hectares and has more than 40 buildings and more than 11,000 objects. The museum is divided into several complexes Archeological Complex The archeological complex consists of a private pavilion and an open area. In the open area there are stone graves, stone pillars, guard stones, etc. The first burial site was discovered in 1896 in the Kyakhtinsky area. In the Middle Ages, graves were flat round stones. The private pavilion has objects from the Lower Ivolginsk settlement. Evenkiyskiy Complex The Evenkiyskiy Complex has tents, a barn and Evenki everyday objects. Buryat Complex The Buryat Complex has gers (wood and animal skin) and a Buddhist temple (Dugan). In the first half of the 19th century, Buryat temples had many domed roofs. In the second half of the 19th century, a new type of temple appeared which was substantially different from earlier temples. An example is Dugan \\"Devadzhin\\" which was taken from Gusinoozyorsk Datsan. In 1926 the temple was rebuilt - the outer appearance of the temple did not change but the area around the temple increased. The temple was predominantly painted yellow because yellow is sacred in Tibetan Buddhism. Inside the temple is a \\"Tunshi\\" panel showing an Indian story about four animals arguing about how to get fruit from a tall tree. Baikal Complex Tha Baikal Complex has a winter house of a wealthy Buryat Cossack SB Safronov. The winter house was built in Horety (now Nukutsky district of the Irkutsk region.

Habitat and ecology It preferred maritime forests with closed canopies. Characteristic trees of these forests are Sabal palmetto, Quercus virginiana, and Juniperus virginiana var. silicicola. It was also found on sand dunes where sea oats (Uniola paniculata), a high growing grass species, is the dominant vegetation. Like the nominate race, the Chadwick Beach cotton mouse was nocturnal. The ecology of this subspecies is not studied. Extinction It is only known by 15 specimens collected by Luther C. Goldman in March 1938. It is now presumed extinct after extensive surveys in 1984, 1985, 1988, and 1989 failed to find this mouse again. Causes for its disappearance might have been the deforestation of the maritime forests in the southernmost part of Sarasota County, as well as the predation by feral cats. References *Stephen R.

The channel focused on music from the 1980s to 2000s. The channel first launched in Australia on 14 March 2004 (as VH1) and in New Zealand on 1 June 2011. On 1 July 2011 MTV International channels launched new logos On 1 April 2016 the channel closed, but was ultimately revived on 27 February 2017 on the Fetch TV platform. It was later revived on Sky in December that year, and was relaunched on 1 July 2020 on Foxtel, replacing MAX. History As VH1 The channel first aired on Sunday 14 March 2004 when Foxtel launched its digital product and then on Austar and Optus shortly after. In April 2006, Australian pay TV newcomer, SelecTV also began to carry VH1. In 2008 it began carriage on TransACT and Neighbourhood Cable. The channel although Australian run, mainly showed programming for the US and the UK with programs such as The Fabulous Life of... and the celebrity based documentary Driven. The VH1 Website officially launched on 3 August 2006. The website somewhat followed the format of the MTV Australia website. It contained a news section, competitions, features, info on new acts and more. It also has details on shows like Can't Get a Date. The website also provided an e-newsletter. The website was closed down in April 2007 for maintenance and was offline until November. In mid August 2009 the site was expanded from a single page to a mini-site on the MTV website. On 25 November 2006 VH1 presented Australia's Favourite Lyric which presented a long list of songs on the VH1 website for viewers and industry members to vote. When the votes closed the list was made into a top 100 countdown and INXS took out the top spot with their song Never Tear Us Apart. Unlike sister channel MTV, the channel still aired a majority of music programming, with VH1 produced entertainment programming shown on MTV or other channels. Relaunch as MTV Classic On 10 February 2010, the channel was announced via the MTV Australia website. MTV Networks in Australia confirmed that VH1 receives fewer viewers each week than its sister channel MTV Australia. Part of the channel's launch included a music event which took the place of the annual MTV Australia Awards which was held in Melbourne at the Palace Theatre. The event consisted of a line-up of local and international artists including former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash. \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" by The Buggles was the first music video to be played on the channel. The channel was made available on Australian IPTV service Fetch TV from launch in June 2010. On 23 November 2010, MTV Classic began broadcasting in widescreen. The channel launched in New Zealand on 1 June 2011 on Sky Television. Cessation of Service on Foxtel On 29 October 2013, MTV announced they had been working with Foxtel since early 2013 to offer more diversity on the Foxtel platform, as MTV Classic and MTV Hits fought for the same audience as Foxtel Networks channels MAX and [V] Hits respectively. The channel to replace MTV Classic is MTV Dance, a channel dedicated to dance, hip hop, and RnB music from around the world - MTV's first channel to be dedicated to three different genres of music. Although MTV Classic and MTV Hits will no longer be available on Foxtel, they will continue to be offered by Australian IPTV service FetchTV and New Zealand pay TV provider Sky Television. The changes took place on 3 December 2013. Closure of channel in New Zealand On 1 December 2015, Sky Television replaced MTV Classic (and sister channel MTV Hits) with a localized version of MTV Music. Closure On 28 February 2016, Fetch TV (the last carrier of MTV Classic) announced via their Facebook page that the channel would close on 1 April 2016. Revival On 27 February 2017, MTV Classic was revived on the Fetch TV platform as a result of \\"popular demand\\". Available on channel 140, and exclusively on Fetch TV, the revived channel features rock, R&B; and pop music from 1980 to 2000. Sky TV New Zealand would also re-add the channel on 8 December 2017. This was later replaced again on Sky by MTV 80s on 6 July 2020. On 1 July 2020, MTV Classic returned to Foxtel on channel 804, replacing MAX, after a 7 year absence.

The new format was announced by the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA)(now the International Netball Federation) in 2008, and was primarily developed for a new international competition, the Fast5 Netball World Series. The rules were revamped for 2012, with the variation being renamed Fast5.  Background  In 2008, the IFNA released the details of a new, faster format of netball, which eventually became known as \\"fastnet\\". The new format was developed for a new international netball competition, the World Netball Series. According to the IFNA, the new rules were ultimately designed to make games faster and more television-friendly, with the ultimate aim of raising the sport's profile and attracting more spectators and greater sponsorship. Previously, the new rules had been trialled by England junior and senior netball squads over a 12-month period. Some of the new rules were announced in December 2008, including six- minute playing quarters and power plays; others were announced in February 2009. The new format was quickly compared to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens.  Playing rules  Fast5 features modified rules that are outlined below. Outside of these, the standard rules of netball apply (see Netball rules). * Players: Each side only has five players on the court, compared with seven in normal netball competition.Rules nz.sports.yahoo.com * Timing: Each quarter lasts only six minutes, compared with 15 minutes in normal international netball competition. Breaks in between quarters are two minutes each. Injury time-outs are 30 seconds only; standard rules allow for one initial two-minute injury time-out. * Coaching: Coaches can give instructions to players from the sidelines during play, from in front of their playing bench. Standard international rules do not allow coaching during play. * Substitutions: Teams are allowed to use rolling substitutions, with no stoppages in play per substitution and with unlimited substitutions per quarter. Standard international rules only allow substitutions either between quarters or when a player is injured. * Power plays: Each team can separately nominate one \\"power play\\" quarter, in which each goal scored by that team counts for double points. This is somewhat similar to power plays in One Day International and Twenty20 cricket, although it is not a feature of standard netball. The two teams cannot nominate the same quarter to be their power play. * Two and Three-point shots: Similar to three-point field goals in basketball and two-point goals in six-a-side indoor netball, the goal shooter (GS) and goal attack (GA) may shoot goals from outside the shooting circle. These goals count for two points if scored from inside the outer zone and three points if scored in the super shot zone; in a power-play quarter, they would count for four and six points respectively. In standard netball rules, goals can only be shot from within the shooting circle and count for one point only. * Centre passes: After each goal, the team that conceded the goal takes the next centre pass; teams alternate taking the first centre pass of each quarter. Under normal rules, a coin toss determines the first centre pass of the match, after which centre passes alternate between the two teams. * Tied scores: Tied games are decided by penalty shoot-outs, similar to those in association football. Often in competitive netball, tied games simply continue until one team wins in extra time, or else subsequently achieves a two-goal advantage. Competitions The main Fast5 competition is the Fast5 Netball World Series; presently, it is the only international competition based on the new format. It was first held in October 2009 and is contested on an annual basis between the top six national netball teams in the IFNA World Rankings. Regional fastnet competitions also emerged in 2009 in England. The Jamaica Netball Association announced plans for a domestic fastnet competition in their country starting in 2010. In the United Kingdom, the British Fast5 Netball All-Stars Championship was launched in 2017 and is fought by each of the teams that participate in the Netball Superleague, the elite domestic netball competition in the UK.

Schiffer announced his retirement from politics on 31 May 2016. Early life Andr√°s Schiffer was born in Budapest on 19 June 1971 to journalist P√©ter Schiffer (born 1943), a former Deputy Director of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZ√ÅF) and jurist Anna Hajnal. Among his uncles are director P√°l Schiffer and Socialist politician J√°nos Schiffer, who served as Deputy Mayor of Budapest between 1994 and 2006. His grandfather was P√°l Schiffer, Sr., a Member of Parliament and Hungarian Ambassador to Norway. His great-grandfather was √Årp√°d Szakasits, a leading Social Democrat, then Communist political figure also president of Hungary in (1948‚Äì1949) and Chairman of the Presidential Council of the People's Republic of Hungary (1949‚Äì1950) during Communist rule. Schiffer received his Juris Doctor degree at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in 1995. In 1989 he was a member of the short-lived \\"New Generation Movement\\" led by Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny. In 1990 he was a founding member of the Young Socialists political movement. He was a leader there until 1992 when he quit that organization. He then worked in the private sector and return to public affairs via the green movement. He became part of the leadership of V√©degylet. V√©degylet was instrumental in electing L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom for President of Hungary, against the Socialist Speaker of the House, Katalin Szili, Schiffer took a leading role in that campaign personally as well. Schiffer served as Charge d'Affaires of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (HCLU) from 2004 to 2008. He left the legal aid organization in the Summer of 2008. Political career In 2008 Schiffer founded the Politics Can Be Different movement, which formally organized as the LMP party in 2009. In the 2010 national elections in Hungary he was the leader of the LMP party list and was elected as a member of the Hungarian Parliament. He resigned as LMP parliamentary group leader in January 2012. He was succeeded by Benedek J√°vor. Schiffer (right) presents the LMP's program prior to the 2010 elections During the Politics Can Be Different party's congress in November 2012, the party decided not to join Together 2014, the electoral alliance of opposition parties and movements led by Gordon Bajnai. As a result, Benedek J√°vor, a follower of the agreement, resigned from his position of parliamentary group leader. Unlike J√°vor, Schiffer did not support cooperation with Bajnai and the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). According to the press, Schiffer's group won within the party and eclipsed the other group, led by Benedek J√°vor and Gergely Kar√°csony. In the first round, the parliamentary caucus failed to elect its new leader. Schiffer was nominated but rejected by an 8-to-7 vote. The platform 'Dialogue for Hungary' was formed within the party on 26 November 2012, with J√°vor as one of its founders. The platform gathers those who would back the Together 2014 electoral movement with the aim of \\"changing the Orb√°n regime.\\" Later that day Schiffer was elected leader of the LMP parliamentary group for a second time. MP Andr√°s Schiffer in 2014 In January 2013, the LMP's congress rejected electoral cooperation with other opposition forces, including Together 2014. As a result, members of LMP's \\"Dialogue for Hungary\\" platform announced their decision to leave the opposition party and form a new organization. Benedek J√°vor said the eight MPs leaving LMP would keep their parliamentary mandates and would coordinate with the remaining seven LMP lawmakers in order to keep the parliamentary group operational on some level. Schiffer said the move would not lead to a party split. Less than 10 percent of the party's membership had indicated a desire to leave the party, he said. The leaving MPs established Dialogue for Hungary as a full-fledged party. The eight MPs also left the parliamentary group which then broke up, according to the rules of the National Assembly. Schiffer and Bernadett Sz√©l were elected co-presidents of the LMP during the party's congress on 24 March 2013. The seven party MPs were able to re-establish the LMP's caucus on 1 September 2013, after the decision of the Committee on Immunity, Incompatibility and Mandate. Schiffer said the newly former LMP parliamentary group became the first group in Hungarian history with a female majority. On 18 July 2015, Schiffer and Sz√©l were re-elected co-presidents of the party. On 31 May 2016, Schiffer announced his retirement from politics in an interview in Index.hu. He resigned as co- president of the LMP and leader of its parliamentary group on 1 June, and also added he would give up his parliamentary seat on 31 August. Schiffer, referring to the new housing rules unilaterally adopted by ruling party Fidesz, said \\"the current parliamentary term has clearly demonstrated that we do not have the intellectual atmosphere for politics critical of the system\\". Schiffer declared that he would not participate in the next parliamentary election and would return to his previous profession as a lawyer. Disagreeing with the party's \\"new direction\\", Schiffer quit the LMP on 7 May 2018.

The incident occurred on 27 October 1993 at 19:16:48 and killed six of the nineteen people on board, including the crew of two. The scheduled flight was en route between Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes via Namsos to R√∏rvik Airport, Ryum and the aircraft crashed at Berg in Overhalla because it held too low an altitude. Parallel investigations were carried out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (HSL). A conflict arose between the two as the latter in cooperation with the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want a police investigation until after their report was finished. This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. However, it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Wider√∏e. Accident Wider√∏e Flight 744 was a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes to Namsos Airport, H√∏knes√∏ra operated with a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 4 The aircraft had registration LN-BNM and serial number 408, and was delivered to Wider√∏e in 1974. The aircraft had flown 40,453 hours and had met all service requirements.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 13 The pilot in command, Jan Bj√∏rstad, was 43 years old, had held a pilot's license since 1974 and had been employed in Wider√∏e since 1985. He had held a C certificate since 4 January 1993, and had been a pilot in command since 20 January. He had flown 4,835 hours in total and had landed 13 times at Namsos Airport in the 12 months prior to the accident.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 11‚Äì12 The first officer, Trond Hamre, was 34 years old, had training from the United States which had been converted to a C certificate in 1988. He had 6,354 hours of flight, of which 1,356 was in a Twin Otter. He had been a pilot in command for 3,441 hours prior to working for Wider√∏e, where he had been employed since 1990. He had landed 27 times at Namsos Airport in the 12 months preceding the accident.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 12 The first officer was using a medication against back pains which was not permitted while flying. However, these had been prescribed by a physician who had training in aviation medicine. No traces of the substance were found in the pilot's body after the accident.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 23 The crew had started duty at Bod√∏ Airport at 13:30 (Central European Time, UTC+1) and were to make a round trip to Trondheim Airport, with intermediate stops at Sandnessj√∏en Airport, Mosj√∏en Airport, Br√∏nn√∏ysund Airport and R√∏rvik Airport as Flight 711. On the way down, the flight canceled its stop at Mosj√∏en because of bad weather. The aircraft landed at Trondheim Airport at 17:52. The return flight was to operate as Flight 744 from Trondheim via Namsos to R√∏rvik, where the plane and crew were to overnight. At Trondheim, 17 passengers boarded along with of cargo. Estimated flight time to Namsos was 35 minutes. The aircraft had a maximum take-off weight of , while the aircraft took off with . Prior to departure, the ground handling agent SAS Ground Handling had calculated the passenger load and mean aerodynamic chord of the passengers. When correcting after observing the seating of the passengers, the pilot in command had made a calculation mistake in which he thought the passengers did not need to move around. In reality they would have to be rearranged to meet the limits of the distribution of weight.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 14 The aircraft left Trondheim Airport at 18:37 after which it ascended to cruising height at 1,500 meters (5,000 ft). At 18:53, the QNH was confirmed by Namsos to be 1017 hPa. This gave a height reading of 1,510 meters (4,950 ft) and 1,500 meters (4,900 ft), respectively, for the pilot in command and first officer. There was wind from 250¬∞, with gusts up to .Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 5‚Äì7 The pilot in command then decided on the descent plan, involving an initial descent to 1,200 meters (4,000 ft), then down to 900 meters (3,000 ft), before making a swing towards localizer 255. Then the aircraft should descend to 640 meters (2,100 ft) and head towards Namsos Beacon inbound. After that, minimum height was set to 640 meters (2,100 ft). At 19:01, the aerodrome flight information service (AFIS) announced new weather data: the wind had changed to 260¬∞ at , with gusts up to . As the crew planned to use runway 26, this would give wind directly against the craft, so the crew decided to add some height to the descent. At 19:05, the first officer stated that the descent checklist was completed, and the pilot in command started the approach checklist. At this time, both height indicators showed . At 19:07, the aircraft was turned to 050¬∞.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 5‚Äì8 At 19:10, the aircraft reached the center line and the aircraft was confirmed by Namsos AFIS at 255¬∞. By 19:14, the aircraft had descended to 640 meters (2,100 ft) and at 19:15:13, it passed Namsos Beacon. At 19:15:30, the first officer confirmed visual contact with the field. At 19:16:35, the pilot in command stated a height of 150 meters (500 ft), confirmed by the first officer. Four seconds later, the pilot in command stated: \\"we should not descend any further\\". The aircraft first hit some trees, located above mean sea level.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 22 At 19:16:48, the aircraft hit a hill from the airport, at Berg in Overhalla. An ELT signal was received by Namsos and a search and rescue operation was started immediately. Both pilots and four passengers were killed, while the remaining thirteen passengers were injured.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 9‚Äì10 Cause The weather in the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 17‚Äì19 The aircraft was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 20 There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 21 Interviews with the surviving passengers showed that none of them perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 33 The report from the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation characterized the accident as a controlled flight into terrain. The report pointed to several errors, both from the pilots, but also systematic failures from Wider√∏e and the Norwegian Aviation Authority. In particular, the report commented on the lack of callouts during descent. The base turn procedure was also criticized, because the crew failed to time it correctly, ending up from the airport. When the flying pilot canceled the instrument landing and changed to visual landing during darkness, he did not have sufficient visual references to the terrain. During this part of the approach, the aircraft's position was not controlled with any available navigational aids. This was in part due to both pilots focusing on extra-cockpit activity after the non- flying pilot had identified the necessary sight to the airport. The crew were not aware of their distance from the terrain; the small margins from 150 meters (500 ft) to 119 meters (392 ft) were in part caused by pilots' unawareness. The cooperation between the crew did not follow the regulations of crew resource management and seemed to have stopped after visual identification of the airfield. The airline was criticized for not having standardized an operative concept that the crew fully respected and followed.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 85‚Äì86 Aftermath The wounded were brought to Namsos Hospital One man in his twenties was nearly unhurt in the accident and ran to the nearby farm of Berg. After saying \\"The aircraft has fallen down. You must call for help!\\", he ran back to the aircraft. The farm's three residents were the first to arrive at the site of the crash. The site was subject to sleet, rain and a southwestern wind, causing the victims to quickly freeze. Several of the wounded could not move because of fractures. The farmhouse became the base of operations for the emergency crews. The wounded were carried to the farm, where they received initial treatment before being transported to Namsos Hospital‚Äîthe last arriving at 22:30. About seventy people participated in the emergency work. The accident was the fifth fatal accident with a Twin Otter in Norway and the fourth fatal accident by Wider√∏e in eleven years. The company's executive management met in Bod√∏ the evening of the accident before chief executive officer B√•rd Mikkelsen and others traveled to Namsos to investigate the crash site of the third fatal accident since Mikkelsen started in his position in 1988. Wider√∏e stopped all advertisements in the period after the accident. Wider√∏e announced in November that they would accelerate the replacement of their Twin Otter and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft with new de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but denied that the accident influenced the decision and instead cited financial reasons. Wider√∏e's chief operating officer, Per- Helge R√∏bekk, announced in July 1994 that he would step down because of the strain of the three accidents. By 1996 Wider√∏e had undertaken a series of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission, including a reorganization of the aircraft operation division, the quality insurance division and the company's reporting systems. Another concern was that pilots did not follow the company's routines, resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which did not follow policy or did too many errors during observations. Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired. The company would further invest 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to improve safety. The aircraft was written off after the accident. Immediately after the accident, Wider√∏e paid a compensation of NOK 10,000 to each of the survivors. The survivors and the deceased's next-of-kin claimed damages for several million NOK, including three people who each demanded over one million after becoming disabled. The demands were raised against the insurance company Norsk Flyforsikringspool. After mediation, the airline agreed to compensate the passengers with an additional NOK 15,000 in cash and NOK 30,000 worth of free travel with Wider√∏e. Investigation Four inspectors from the HSL, two police investigators from the National Criminal Investigation Service and a technician from Wider√∏e arrived at the site at 13:30 on 28 August. By then flights had resumed at Namsos Airport. They secured an area of for the investigation, in which all the debris of the aircraft had landed and trees had been felled by the crashing aircraft. The instrument landing system at Namsos Airport was tested by the Norwegian Aviation Authority on 28 October and 4 November, without any faults being found.Accident Investigation Board Norway (1996): 19 Two parallel investigations were undertaken, one by HSL and one by Namdal Police District. The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Since 1989 both the police and the prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Wider√∏e Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association recommended that its members not cooperate with the police in any way, stating that \\"the police should sit passively and wait for the report from the commission\\". On 17 November the issue was brought to Parliament by the Liberal Party's Lars Sponheim, but Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth stated that he did not want to interfere. In January 1994, the police announced that they would bring six Wider√∏e pilots to court to force them to undergo police questioning. The six pilots were the two that piloted the previous shift on the aircraft, two that landed at Namsos Airport half an hour before the accident, and the two that had test-flown after the previous maintenance spell some days before the accident. In February, HSL started extensive investigations of the culture among pilots in Wider√∏e, and initiated interviews with dozens of pilots and managers in the company to investigate systematic failures in the company. Salten District Court ruled in April in favor of court questioning of the pilots. In May, the police brought the demands to receive the CVR in to Namdal District Court. A ruling was not made until December, which supported the police's demands. However, the issue was appealed by the accident board and the ministry. The issue was not resolved until August 1995, when Frostating Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and required the tape to be handed over to the police. After the tape was handed over, both the pilots in Wider√∏e and the accident board would not cooperate deciphering the contents, nor would they hand over transcripts or notes, and asked the police take the matter to the courts if they needed any further assistance. In February 1995, SINTEF handed over a report ordered by the commission which revealed several absent safety procedures in Wider√∏e. The report was based on a recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Wider√∏e for the accident.

It hosted exhibitions, tennis tournaments and many concerts by leading musicians, but lost its importance with the opening of the Plymouth Pavilions in 1991. History The Carlyon Beach area began to develop as a popular recreation area in the 20th century, with one of the visitors being the Prince of Wales. During a visit he suggested that a sports club could be constructed on the beach for wealthy locals and in the early 1930s the building, known as the Riviera Club opened to the public. The complex featured a spa with swimming pool, tea rooms and tennis courts where Edward VIII and Mrs Wallis Simpson were reputed to have visited. During the outbreak of World War II, the complex project's development, still not yet fully completed, was put to a halt. The beach was used for military operations in this time, however in the 1950s the complex re-opened and continued developing as a leisure and entertainment centre. In the early 1960s the complex, owned by a Mr. and Mrs. Lovett, had become a large concert venue, with a capacity of over 2000 seats and featuring a bar. The main auditorium area was previously the two indoor tennis courts. The complex became known as the New Cornish Riviera Lido, although the music venue still kept the Riviera Club name. In the 1960s, the venue became increasingly popular, where the venue would bring in some major musical artists of the time including The Pretty Things, Chris Farlowe, Them, The Poets, Procol Harum, Herman's Hermits, The Kinks and DDDBMT. Each performance generally sold out, and the complex became a premier venue in the area. The owner Mr. Lovett soon decided to run dances in the venue, however by the end of 1966 Newquay was becoming increasingly popular, with the Blue Lagoon and a number of smaller club/venues. The venue would enjoy a resurrection in the 1970s as punk and new wave peaked commercially, and was a popular venue on the new wave circuit. Through the 1970s and 1980s, various major acts of the era would perform at the venue, including Thin Lizzy, The Ramones, The Clash, The Jam, The Police, Marillion, The Cure, Status Quo, The Who, Eric Clapton, Black Sabbath, Cliff Richard, Iron Maiden, Rainbow, Slade, Bon Jovi, Simple Minds, Deborah Harry, T'Pau, Wham! and Glen Campbell who recorded a live album there in 1981, as well as many comedy and light entertainment acts. During this period, the site was extended and featured a roller disco, amusement arcade, Wimpy restaurant and box office. During the 1970s period, the original badminton courts were developed into a disco known variously as Beelzebub, Bentleys, Quasars and lastly Gossips by the 1990s. The complex would be renamed firstly to Cornish Leisure World and then Cornwall Coliseum. The Cornwall Coliseum was one of the largest indoor venues of its kind during the 1980s. It had a licensed capacity of 3,400, standing, and a seated capacity of 2,600. In addition the discoth√®que won the discoth√®que of the year award when it was re-furbished in the late 1980s, which itself had a licensed capacity of approximately 750. During the 1980s the venue would play host to the Radio One road shows, and in 1986, Alison Moyet would record the music video for her single \\"Is This Love?\\" on the beach and outside the coliseum. Additionally, in 1988, T'Pau recorded a large part of the video for their single \\"Road to Our Dream\\" inside the venue during final production rehearsals for the \\"Rage Across Europe\\" tour. In 1990, planning permission for holiday homes to be created in the surrounding area, together with a sea wall with rock armouring. The planning also included refurbishing and extending the Coliseum complex. This plan never materialised as by the 1990s decade the venue started to decline, despite the occasional performances of major artists such as The Cure, Jimmy Page & Robert Plant (of Led Zeppelin) and Paul McCartney. The venue started to compete against the bigger venues in both Plymouth and Devon, such Plymouth Pavilions, which opened in 1991, and the stadiums who could better accommodate the more popular acts. In August 1998, the Megadog Beach Festival was held at the site using the car park as an outdoor stage, the permanent buildings as indoor stages and the beach itself as camping. 10,000 people attended and headliners included 808 State. The venue continued until early 2003 when only the Gossips nightclub remained open, until its closure too shortly after. Ampersand acquired the venue in 2002 and aimed to create a privately funded world-class resort of 500 top-class apartments, with the main obstacle being the need for better sea defences. Despite clear plans of a 200 million blueprint, no work had taken place due to legal battles and public enquiries. Since then the coliseum has increasingly declined and was partly demolished from the inside. The roof was also removed, exposing the venue to open weather. The site remains out-of-bounds to the public and is considered unstable and dangerous. Commercial Estates Group obtained planning permission in 2011 to redevelop the site. Approval for a ¬£250m redevelopment project was granted in February 2015 and demolition of the main building began in April 2015.

This new gene consists of the 5' end of ETV6 fused to the 3' end of NTRK3. ETV6-NTRK3 therefore codes for a chimeric oncoprotein consisting of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein dimerization domain of the ETV6 protein fused to the tyrosine kinase (i.e. PTK) domain of the NTRK3 protein. The ETV6 gene codes for the transcription factor protein, ETV6, which suppresses the expression of, and thereby regulates, various genes that in mice are required for normal hematopoiesis as well as the development and maintenance of the vascular network. NTRK3 codes for Tropomyosin receptor kinase C a NT-3 growth factor receptor cell surface protein that when bound to its growth factor ligand, neurotrophin-3, becomes an active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine residues on, and thereby stimulates, signaling proteins that promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of their parent cells. The tyrosine kinase of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein is dysfunctional in that it is continuously active in phosphorylating tyrosine residues on, and thereby continuously stimulating, proteins that promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of their parent cells. In consequence, these cells take on malignant characteristics and are on the pathway of becoming cancerous. Indeed, the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene appears to be a critical driver of several types of cancers. It was originally identified in congenital fibrosarcoma and subsequently found in secretory breast cancer (also termed juvenile breast cancer), Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary glands (also termed MASC or MASCSG), congenital fibrosarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, rare cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, ALK-negative Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and radiation- induced papillary thyroid carcinoma.Majewska H, Sk√°lov√° A, Stodulski D, Klimkov√° A, Steiner P, Stankiewicz C, Biernat W. \\"Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary glands: a new entity associated with ETV6 gene rearrangement.\\" Virchows Arch. 2015 Mar;466(3):245-54. doi: 10.1007/s00428-014-1701-8. Epub 2014 Dec 12.  NTRK3 inhibitors in clinical development  Because cancers associated with the expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein are known or suspected of being a direct consequence of overly active ETV6-NTRK3's tyrosine kinase, it has been proposed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors with specificity for NTRK3 may be of therapeutic usefulness in these cancers. Entrectinib is a pan-NTRK as well as an ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been found useful in treating a single patient with ETV6-NRTK3 fusion gene-associated mammary analogue secretory carcinoma and has lend support to the clinical development of NTRK3-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein associated malignancies. Three clinical trials are in the recruitment phase for determining the efficacy of treating a wide range of solid tumors associated with mutated overactive tyrosine kinase proteins, including the ETV6-TRK3 protein, with larotrectinib, a non-selective inhibitor of NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 tyrosine kinases.

The plot, set in rural Asturias in the early 20th-century, is based on a novel by Ram√≥n P√©rez de Ayala. Plot In early 20th-century Spain, Urbano, an idealistic liberal young man arrives in Cenciella, a small village, to be a secretary at the town hall. Urbano falls in love with Estrella, the daughter of a local landowner Joaco. Politically, the town is split in two, with the forces of evil repped by mayor Atila. Urbano tries to remain neutral but his intentions would be brutally punished. The Sunday prior to his wedding to Estrella, while the couple are in the forest enjoying an idyllic moment, everything changes with the presence of the chief, who comes to take revenge. He comes accompanied by his trusty servant, Longinus, and his three sons, who assault the couple. Urbano is tied up to a tree and beaten, while Estrella is brutally raped. However the whole assault is politically motivated as the boss says to his servant when he was denied the chance to do what have his three sons did to the girl, \\"is political, not vice.\\" At another point the mayor is extending its personal view of what happened: \\"Women and the laws are to be violated, provided that cause us problems.\\" Bewildered, Urbano's response is visceral but rational, without resorting to wash his honor and take immediate revenge, as would be more suitable to the melodrama of the time. Thinking in what is best for Estrella and in the future, the family does not report or talk about the rape, and the betrothed marry. What happened serves no other purpose than to sadden the happiness of the bride and relatives. Urbano also sees and makes Juaco, his father in law, see with different eyes, the baby that Estrella is expecting as a result of the rape. Urbani takes the baby as his own. However vengeance occurs after some time, but in a way that gives it a certain beauty to the outcome of a sad story.

Director George McCowan chose to hide his involvement by using the pseudonym Alan Smithee (spelled Allen Smithee in the credits). This was the last film appearance of Paul Lukas. Plot An American orbital weapons platform crashes in an uninhabited area of the Pacific. An unnamed Asian country arrives first, but US naval forces block their escape from the area. The platform would allow any country to threaten the US from space. While the US has an overwhelming advantage in force, the country is allied with China, which the US does not want to aggravate. The Chinese government does not want to enter a full-scale war, but neither do they want to lose face. They agree to settle the matter with a \\"surrogate\\" war, fought by a single representative of each country. General Lewis Meyers is opposed to the proposal as he believes US forces can crush its adversaries. American agents track down and bring back Jacob Gallery from a Latin American country, where he is a guide on a big game hunt. Meyers is familiar with Gallery, who was court-martialed during the Vietnam War for hunting Viet Cong sentries at night and keeping trophies of his kills. During one such unauthorized nightly expedition, his unit was wiped out while he was hunting alone. Meyers wants to send Bryant, a Marine Captain who respects authority, but the Secretary wants to send someone whose disregard for rules and procedures is more likely to produce victory. A small tropical island is selected for the battle, its inhabitants relocated to Guam. Gallery reluctantly agrees to the assignment after demanding $1 million in advance. He is put through a training program and given a selection of weapons, including a pair of Madsen submachine guns bolted together that fires regular ammunition and a birdshot rounds. He is warned that the greatest threat on the island is fungi, which can quickly infect any wound. A former resident of the island advises Gallery on where to find fresh water. Gallery is sent on his way from a surfaced submarine at the same time his adversary is sent. After his first encounter with Yuro, he sets up his base inside a hidden cave. He begins polluting the water sources, forcing Yuro to the last one. When Yuro goes to the pond, Gallery ambushes him. Yuro escapes, but not before being wounded. Gallery discovers Yuro's treetop base and booby traps it with a grenade. But Yuro had set razor blades in the tree trunk, one of which cuts Gallery's leg. On the submarine, Meyers arrives and unveils his plan to secretly send Bryant since Gallery has not been successful after four days. In the now-abandoned village, a feverish Gallery sets traps, but Yuro gets the drop on him. Gallery barely escapes and makes his way to the beach with Yuro in pursuit. Hearing his name, he peeks around rocks to see Bryant holding Yuro at gunpoint. Bryant tells Gallery to kill Yuro and be a hero, but a disgusted Gallery shoots Bryant instead. Yuro runs off. Making his way back to his cave, Gallery comes upon one of Yuro's countrymen, hanging dead in one of Yuro's tree snares, signaling betrayal from both countries. Resting in his cave, he hears Yuro beseeching him to forsake the treacherous country that sent a second man against the rules. Yuro offers to save Gallery from his festering wound, but is pointing his gun at the cave. Gallery empties his magazine into the greenery, killing Yuro. He takes out his transmitter to proclaim victory, but decides against it, throwing it away before succumbing to his infection. Cast *Darren McGavin as Jacob Gallery *Broderick Crawford as Gen.

Cultural Jet Lag in Third Culture Kids. nyc-o-time management consulting He describes the expression as the phenomenon of partial socialization in adults born from bi-cultural/national unions and whose childhood was characterized by nomadic displacement during key personality developmental stages. Jet symbolically designates international travel as the cause, cultural lag the resulting disconnect observed in these patients. Originally the author used the expressions social jet lag and cultural jet lag interchangeably, however the expression social jet lag has since more widely become associated with an unrelated delayed sleep phase syndrome and cultural jet lag has therefore become the conventional term. Cultural jet lag is sometimes just referred to by its initials: CJL. During some of the presentations of his research, Marc Perraud also coined the term cultural schizophrenia to explain the elements of confusion in children constantly exposed to changing cultural and moral environments. This expression is to be seen only as an attempt at vulgarization using popular imagery and does not refer to the actual accepted psychological definition, diagnosis or symptoms of clinical schizophrenia. Incidentally, the expression cultural jet lag was also used in the 1980s as a title for a comic strip, that focused on providing social commentary in the United States (featured in the Humor Times). This title reflects the notions of distance between the author and the subject of his cultural satire but does not reflect the literal and total connotations of the definition cited prior. (disambiguation) People most commonly affected Cultural jet lag refers to the feeling of disconnect that third culture kids (TCKs), as they have now become known, experience in relation to any culture, including the ones from which they stem. This disconnect, also present in adult third culture kids (ATCKs),Cottrell AB, Useem RH (1993). ATCKs have problems relating to their own ethnic groups. International Schools Services applies to all the cultures to which they are/were exposed, whether it be their parents' cultures or those to which they were exposed during their upbringing through international travel. Symptoms and characteristics Third culture kids, those that were brought between countries, and in a bi-cultural environment, also referred to as global nomads, typically experience varying degrees of cultural jet lag. While they exhibit high levels of cross-cultural competence (3C)‚Äîin that they are in tune with the different cultures between which they grew up, sometimes illustrating more astute understanding than mono-cultured counterparts because of their multiple referential points‚Äîthey generally have the feeling that they remain outside the culture, looking in. They do not experience the same drives, desires and constraints as other non-TCK members of their cultures and feel like constant spectators to any visceral dynamic (patriotism, identification, national pride, duty, allegiance, sports fan, political involvement etc.) Cultural jet lag drives a disconnect that can have varying levels of sociability impact on the TCK depending on their character and their support structures (friends and family in particular). Research done at , a company that regroups one of the largest concentration of TCKs (90% of employees), has shown that: * All TCK employees exhibit some degree of cultural jet lag, while symptoms vary in breadth and intensity from person to person * The cultural disconnect they experience with any mono-cultured person, even well-travelled, makes their natural tendency to seek out and bond with others experiencing the same condition. This holds true in friendship, in love and in work relationships. * CJL appears to increase the prevalence of certain psychological traits/abnormalities: antisocial behavior, relationship and commitment difficulties, apathy and boredom, substance abuse, social anxiety and malaise, light depression, and a shared feeling of lack of identity, of referent and of ownership. * On the flip side CJL seems to pre- dispose individuals to develop and be rewarded for their unique perspective on the world. This manifests itself through a higher than usual prevalence artistic and creative activities: advertising, design, music, creative writing‚Äîall of which it is postulated require a certain abstraction from conventional social and cultural models. CJL also seems to predispose TCKs to educational fields and/or careers that directly tap into their global awareness and perspectives: international relations, humanitarian and strategic thinking Other similar cross-cultural phenomena Cultural jet lag is sometimes confused with several apparently close but dissimilar cross- cultural phenomena: * Culture shock. Simply put, culture shock appears as a result of a discreet decision by an individual to travel abroad. CJL differs from culture shock in that it is not associated to a precise event but rather a lifelong condition linked to the particularities of an uprooted upbringing. CJL neither appears abruptly nor subsides over time, it is a state of being that characterizes those that have experienced a culturally de-structured upbringing. Someone's realization or third party diagnosis of CJL may be sudden, in the form of an \\"a-ha\\" moment, but he or she will quickly realize that it is simply an explanation of his or her state of being from as long as he or she can remember. * CJL also differs from the cultural disconnect that remains between the expatriate and his host country once he or she has overcome the initial culture shock. Despite the feeling of disconnect with his host country, the expatriate will never feel lost for he or she still maintains a sense of bond to his or her original culture. Even if this bond dissipates slowly with time, the expatriate will never exhibit the same psychological symptoms as those that characterize CJL. This is because the expatriate will always rely on the psychological stability he or she developed based on a stable mono-cultural referential during key youth developmental stages. * CJL also differs from what has been called reverse culture shock,Kidd, Julie and Linda Lankenau (Undated) \\"Third Culture Kids: Returning to their Passport Country.\\" US Department of State the reaction caused by an expatriate returning to his or her home country after years of being abroad. As with the example described above, no one can suddenly experience cultural jet lag as its symptoms stem from an atypical developmental environment and not a situational stimuli during adulthood (i.e. after character formation maturity). Ongoing research Some research has been done on the third culture kids.Cottrell AB, Useem RH (1993). TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence. International Schools Services However this research has primarily described attributes, anecdotes and summarized basic behavioral/sociological observations. While the serious study of the psychological mechanisms and impacts of cultural jet lag is still in its infancy, it has been brought to the forefront because of the impact globalization has had on the number of children and future adults that will experience CJL. Research currently underway is testing the postulate that cultural jet lag stems from an atypical crystallization of the super-ego during the child developmental phases. While typical children inherit morals and values first from their parents and then from their environments in a second stage, culturally jet lagged children, devoid of a single moral and cultural referential in their environment, later develop an overstated role of id in their ego balance (referring to Freudian theory). Statistical research is also underway to identify the psychological impacts of CJL, in particular the: * Prevalence of clinical psychological abnormalities in culturally jet lagged adults * Preferred psychological coping mechanisms of culturally jet lagged adolescents * Comparing the statistical distribution of Myers Briggs profiles in CJL adults vs. the general population References Category:Sociology of culture Category:Cultural assimilation Category:Culture terminology Category:Cross-cultural psychology Category:Childhood Category:Cultural globalization ","title":"Cultural jet lag"},{"id":"26166978","text":"WEC 11: Evolution was a mixed martial arts event promoted by World Extreme Cagefighting on August 20, 2004 at the Tachi Palace Hotel & Casino in Lemoore, California.

Early life Salgado was born to Ponciano Salgado and Maria de Jesus Hernandez, a middle-class family, in the village of Los Sauces in the district of Teloloapan in Guerrero in 1873. With Madero In March 1911, in Apaxtla, he joined the Maderista movement against the dictatorial rule of Porfirio Diaz. Initially Salgado only had 55 men with him but this soon grew to more than three hundred.

According to the account given to Niven, Salgado rose in revolt against Madero because Madero had appointed Ambrosio Figureoa, Salgado's enemy, as governor of Guerrero. Subsequently Figureoa had Salgado temporarily imprisoned in Mexico City and burned down his house in Iguala. Both in Guerrero and Oaxaca Salgado recruited troops from the peasants by promising them rich landowners' land, which was to be divided amongst them after the revolution.Alan Knight, \\"The Mexican Revolution: Counter-revolution and reconstruction\\", U of Nebraska Press, 1990, pg. 349 As a result, many of his soldiers engaged in immediate seizures and generally were a lot more undisciplined than other Zapatista troops. According to Frank McLynn, the Selgado revolt often shaded from a political one into straight forward banditry.

The Bo were one of the ten indigenous tribes of the Great Andamanese people, originally living on the western coast of North Andaman Island in the Indian Ocean. The tribe spoke a distinctive Bo language, closely related to the other Great Andamanese languages. The native name for the language was Aka-Bo (Aka- being a prefix for \\"tongue\\"); and this name is often used for the tribe itself. They were mostly forest-dwellers (eremtaga) with a smaller number of shore-dwellers (aryoto).George Weber (~2009), The Tribes. Chapter 8 in The Andamanese . Accessed on 2012-07-12. They are a designated Scheduled Tribe. There are still a handful of people who identify themselves as members of the tribe living on a reservation on Strait Island, but none can speak the original language.Anvita Abbi (2006), Endangered Languages of the Andaman Islands. Lincom Europa. History The original size of the Bo tribe, by 1858, has been estimated at 200 individuals.George Weber (~2009), Numbers . Chapter 7 in The Andamanese . Accessed on 2012-07-12. However, they were discovered by the British only later, in the work leading to the 1901 census. Like other Andamanese peoples, the Bo were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, alcohol, colonial warfare and loss of territory. The census of 1901 recorded only 48 individuals. Census takers were told that an epidemic had come from the neighboring Kari and Kora tribes, and the Bo had resorted to killing all of their own who showed symptoms. Their number was up to 62 in 1911, but then decreased to 16 in 1921 and only 6 in 1931. In 1949, any remaining Bo were relocated, with all other surviving Great Andamanese, to a reservation on Bluff island. In 1969 they were moved again to a reservation on Strait Island.Rann Singh Mann (2005), Andaman and Nicobar Tribes Restudied: Encounters and Concerns, page 149. Mittal Publications.

The first year consists of classes in Anatomy, Molecular and Cell Biology, Ethical and Legal Topics in Clinical Medicine, Interviewing and Physical Exam, Host Defense, Principles of Microbiology, Evidence Based Medicine, Principles of Pharmacology, Behavioral Medicine I, CU Humanities Program, Neuroscience, and Physicians Lifestyle Management. Healer's Art is an elective course that can be taken at the beginning of the spring semester. Following spring break, the M1 year ends with the first organ systems course, Neuroscience. The second year of medical school consists of organ systems based classes that last from 2‚Äì5 weeks each. These courses include Infectious Diseases, Hematology/Oncology, Cardiovascular, Behavioral Medicine II, Respiratory, Renal, Endocrine/ Reproduction, Musculoskeletal/ Integument, Gastrointestinal, and Behavioral Medicine II. There are also two concurrent classes that run throughout the year which include Case Studies in Medicine and Applied Clinical Skills. The year ends with review and time to study for the USMLE Step 1 which is taken between the end of May and the middle of June. Clinical years The third and fourth years of medical school consist of clinical rotations throughout hospitals and clinics. There are eight third year clinical rotations that last 8 weeks each: Ambulatory Primary care, Inpatient Medicine, Psychiatry, Surgery, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. Fourth year consists of 1 4-week surgical selective, 1 4-week critical care selective, 1 4-week primary care selective or 2nd critical care selective, and an additional 24 weeks of clinical electives with no more than 8 weeks of non-clinical electives. A senior Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is required prior to completion of USMLE Step 2 CS and graduation. Third year medical students are able to do family medicine rotations in rural Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Arizona. Creighton also sends a group of third year students to San Francisco for internal medicine rotations. Phoenix campus Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha and St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center have created an academic affiliation that will create a Creighton medical school presence in Phoenix. The Creighton campus in Phoenix will be the only Catholic medical school campus located west of Omaha. The affiliation will expand educational opportunities available to Creighton medical students while allowing the University's School of Medicine to recruit more students. The collaboration is also designed to strengthen the medical reputations of both institutions, promote the sharing of faculty and administrative expertise, create collaborative research opportunities, and enhance medical services for Arizona patients. Since 2005, Creighton and St. Joseph's have had an agreement that sends Creighton medical students to Phoenix for one-month rotations. Under the new affiliation, Creighton will establish a fully operational campus at St. Joseph's that will offer two full years of clinical training. Creighton expanded its entering medical class from 126 to 152 students in 2010. All students will train for their first two years in Omaha. Starting in 2012, 42 third-year students will move to Phoenix for their final two years of training, and 110 third-year students will remain in Omaha. The Phoenix campus will graduate its first students in 2014. Student clubs and organizations Service Creighton emphasizes community service, and even though it is not required, 100% of students participate in some form of service during their time in medical school. Creighton students operate and staff the Magis Clinic, which provides free health care to the homeless and poor in Omaha. Between first and second year, many medical students participate in Project CURA. CURA is a student-run program which sends medical missions to countries including Peru, Ghana, India, and Nicaragua. CUSOM is also home to the Institute for Latin American Concern (ILAC), which sends fourth-year medical students, as well as pharmacy and nursing students, to the Dominican Republic.

Ulmer and written by Ulmer and Hunt Stromberg, starring Hedy Lamarr, George Sanders and Louis Hayward. Originally released by United Artists, the film is now in the public domain. Plot In Bangor, Maine in 1824, a cruel young girl named Jenny Hager pushes a terrified Ephraim Poster into a river knowing he cannot swim. She is prepared to let him drown until Judge Saladine (Alan Napier) happens by, at which point Jenny jumps into the water and takes credit for saving the boy's life. About ten years later, Jenny (Hedy Lamarr) has grown up to be a beautiful but equally heartless and manipulative young woman. Her father, an abusive, drunken widower, whips Jenny after learning of her flirtation with a sailor. She secretly schemes to wed the richest man in town, the much older timber baron Isaiah Poster (Gene Lockhart), while his son Ephraim (Louis Hayward) is away at college in Cambridge. Poster is unkind to his mild-mannered son upon Ephraim's return. He is unaware that the boy and Jenny were once sweethearts and that Jenny is again flirting with Ephraim behind her husband's back. Poster is more concerned about the lawlessness in town, lumberjacks drunkenly pillaging the town, manhandling the women and killing the judge, confirming Poster's long-held belief that Bangor must organize a police force. Jenny secretly hopes that her husband will die after he falls ill. When he recovers, Poster must make a trip to his lumber camps. Jenny appeals to Ephraim to arrange his father's death, saying, \\"I want you to return alone.\\" In the rapids, both men fall from an overturned canoe and Poster drowns. His son, still deathly afraid of water, is unable or unwilling to save him. To his shock, Ephraim returns to Jenny telling him, \\"You can't come into this house, you wretched coward...You've killed your father.\\" He becomes a hopeless drunk, hating her and speaking freely about her deceitful ways. Poster's superintendent in the timber business, John Evered (George Sanders), goes to confront Ephraim but isn't sure whether to believe the harsh words he hears about Jenny. Jenny proceeds to seduce Evered, who is engaged to marry her best friend, Meg Saladine (Hillary Brooke), the judge's daughter. Lust overtakes them during a thunderstorm. After their wedding, Evered is eager to have children, but Jenny learns she cannot bear any. She confesses this to her new husband after some delay, fearful of his rejection of her, but to Jenny's relief, John wholeheartedly affirms his love. A traveling evangelist, Lincoln Pettridge (Edward Biby), preaches fire and brimstone that results in Jenny's searing confession to her husband that all Ephraim had said about her was true. Evered goes off to be by himself at a lumber camp, and Jenny learns that Meg has gone to see Evered there. In the cabin, knowing of his love for Jenny, Meg tells him to go back to his wife. Jenny pulls up to the cabin right afterward and, seeing them together frantically whips her horse, bearing down on them with her carriage. It hits a rock, careens off a cliff and Jenny is mortally wounded. Her dying words are an expression of her passionate feelings for John, who has let her know true love.

Biography Born in Colle di Val d'Elsa, Tarquini studied singing at the Milan Conservatory and privately in Florence. She made her stage debut in 1905 and spent the next two years performing in opera houses throughout Italy. In 1907 Tarquini was brought to the United States by impresario Henry Russell to join his Boston-based San Carlo Opera Company. She made her debut with the company in Boston as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana and then embarked on a North American tour with the company. That same year she also performed the title role in the United States premiere of Adriana Lecouvreur at the French Opera House in New Orleans. Between 1908-1911 Tarquini performed in operas in Austria, Egypt, Italy, and Portugal. Among the roles she sang were Cio-Cio San in Madama Butterfly, Maddalena de Coigny in Andrea Ch√©nier, Mim√¨ in La boh√®me, and the title role in Manon. She drew particular acclaim for her portrayal of the title role in Richard Strauss's Salome and, being a good dancer, was notably one of the first opera singers to perform the Dance of the Seven Veils herself; a move which shocked some conservative critics. On 14 October 1911 Tarquini portrayed the title role in the world premiere of Zandonai's Conchita at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan. Her performance was a triumphant success and she went on to perform the role several more times, including at the Royal Opera, London (1912), the Cort Theatre in San Francisco (1912), the Philarmonic Auditorium in Hollywood (1912), the Heilig Theatre in Portland, Oregon (1912), the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia (1912), the Chicago Grand Opera Company (1913), the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (1913), and the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples (1913). Tarquini remained busy as a performer up until her retirement from the stage in 1917 following her marriage that year to Zandonai. She had an important success at Covent Garden as Bizet's Carmen in 1912 and, besides Conchita, Salome was her most frequently assailed role. After her marriage, she lived most of her remaining life with her husband in Milan. She died in that city at the age of 93. Tarquini's voice was never recorded.

Life  Ratgar was abbot of the monastery of Fulda from 802 until 817. He was from a noble family in Germania, and was sent by his parents to Fulda, whose monastery school was already becoming a renowned center of learning.Hraban Maur in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Poetaes Latini Aevi CarolingiII, poem 13. which was at the time ruled by Saint Sturm, a disciple of Saint Boniface. Sturm died in 779 and Baugulf succeeded him as abbot, ruling until his retirement in 802,Annales Fuldenses in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Scriptores 1, p. 353. when he was succeeded by Ratgar. The sources on Ratgar's abbacy provide conflicting pictures of his rule. The future abbot of Fulda, Hraban Maur, writes of Ratgar in several poems. In one he praises the grand building projects Ratgar undertook, calling him a \\"wise architect.\\" The great Basilica, dedicated by Archbishop Haistolf in 819, was undertaken during his reign. Ratgar also showed concern for the education of the young monks in his care, sending them to study with the leading scholars of the day. He sent Hraban Maur (future abbot, archbishop and leading theologian) and Hatto to Tours to study the liberal arts with Alcuin, the founding scholar of the Carolingian Renaissance.Alcuin, Intercessio Albini Pro Mauro,in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Poetae Latini II, p. 160. He sent Candidus Bruun and Modestus to study with another luminary, Charlemagne's biographer Einhard, and he sent Candidus and others to Clemens Scottus, one of the many renowned Irish scholars living on the continent.Introduction to Candidus' Life of Eigil, Patrologia Latina 105, col. 383. On the other hand, it seems he was excessively severe on his monks. Hraban Maur, in another poem, recounts that a number of monks seceded from Ratgar's Rule.Hraban Maur in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Poetaes Latini Aevi CarolingiII, poem 30. The Saxon Chronicle recounts that, in 811, there was a great disturbance among the monks at Fulda, and other contemporary chronicles also mention chaos and dissent among the brothers, noting that a delegation of 12 monks made a plea before Charlemagne for him to reform the monastery. Candidus Bruun, who lived at Fulda throughout Ratgar's reign, paints an extremely negative picture of Ratgar.Candidus Bruun, Vita Aeigili, in E. Duemmeler, ed. Monumenta Germaniae Historica Poetae Latini Aevi Carolini II (Berlin, 1884), pp. 94-117. He nicknames Ratgar \\"monoceros\\", meaning \\"unicorn\\" (the unicorn was considered a violent and dangerous beast), and depicts an abbey divided by dissent. Despite the attempts of several bishops and archbishops to intervene, Ratgar continued his manner of rule among the monks, until in 817 he was \\"charged and convicted\\" by the monks.,Annales Fuldenses in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Scriptores 1, p. 356. and the Emperor Louis the Pious had him deposed and banished. Ratgar's successor Eigil restored peace in the divided monastery.  Bibliography  * Candidus Bruun. Vita Aeigili, liber II (= vita metrica). In E. Duemmeler, ed.

Before leaving Iran in 2003 he was known as one of the most innovative poets of the contemporary Persian poetry. He is also known by Mouta or Rato Mouta, the \\"bearer of light\\" or the \\"wise teacher\\" in old Persian.  Life  Ali Abdolrezaei (ÿπŸÑ€å ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ∂ÿß€å€å ) was born on 10 April 1969 in Northern Iran (Langrood) where he finished high school. He graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Khaje Nasir University in Tehran. Abdolrezaei's career as a poet began in 1986. Not long after, he was banned from teaching and from public speaking in Iran. In 1997, the country's new president decrease the level of censorship and Abdolrezaei's new book,‚ÄúParis in Renault‚Äù was published in Iran. It received much attention and the majority of the critics including the newspapers and top literary circles wrote and talked about his avant garde views on language and postmodernism. This brought much deserved fame to Abdolrezaei and his prodigious ideas became influential among Iranian audience. This new fame culminated in more surveillance of him by the government. Abdolrezaei was frequently invited to give lectures on poetry by different establishments but he only accepted invitations from universities, for this he became known as the ‚ÄúUniversity Poet‚Äù. Being in contact with large audiences was frown upon by the government, so they soon banned him from public speaking and intensified the censoring of his writings. Around year 2000 Ali Abdolrezaei began his close study of anarchism which continued for several years. Abdolrezaei has published many essays on the subject on internet, conveying a broader view to his Iranian readers speaking about it at underground events. He created the word ‚ÄúIranarchism‚Äù and named his party after it. The focus of the Iranarchism was the many issues of the middle eastern societies from the perspective of anarchism. He published the manifest of Iranarchism in seven parts. First publication was as a text, on the Iranian website Akhbare-rooz, in 2013, and then on YouTube as an audio presentation. In early 2016 he published his book \\"Anarchists are More Real\\", a selection of more than 400 pages of his writings.  Work  Abdolrezaei is one of the 34 international poets selected by the British Library. His recordings and their texts are kept in the Sound Archives in the British Library. His poems have been translated into many languages including English, German, French, Turkish, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Croatian and Urdu. He was also the chair person of the Exiled Writers Ink in the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2016. Abdolrezaei's fame as a poet grew extensively in the early 1990s in Iran. His poetry tackles difficult themes with his especial mastery of the craft. Poetry International says his \\"Postmodern\\" Poems \\"center on the problematic nature of language, knowledge and subjectivity.\\" He helped found the \\"Persian New Poetry\\" movement, writing colloquially about current themes rather than the traditional themes of emotion and nature. His array of poetry books endorse his poetic creativity and profound cerebral capabilities. Abdolrezaei has been controversial poet throughout his career. He has been described as \\"one of Iran's most influential poets\\" and \\"one of the most serious and contentious poets of the new generation of Persian poetry. He has been having an undeniable effect on poets and writers of different genres. It's been said that his poetry motivated a group of young poets to distance themselves from the legacy of modern Persian poetry in order to establish the Persian New Poetry form. Abdolrezaei's poetry shows that the contemporary art of Iran has been highly influenced by the traumatic historic events of the last four decades and that these events have affected millions of Iranians in one way or another. Abdolrezaei represents the artistic voice of a new, multi- faceted generation of Iranians and their cultural chasm with the past in the face of a repressive political regime. His twelve volumes of poetries were published in Iran, the remaining in exile. In 2013, years after his self imposed exile and the publishing ban of his works in Iran, the government allowed his publisher to release four of his new books. These books were received so well by the readers that they were printed multiple times in just three months. However, seven months later his books were confiscated at the Tehran Book Fair, and he was banned again from further publication. Ali Abdolrezaei resides in London, England.

He was portrayed by Finn Wittrock from October 30, 2009 to February 21, 2011. In February 2010, Wittrock was updated to contract status following the show's move from New York to Los Angeles. A long-lost member of the Martin family, Damon is the son of Tad Martin and his ex-wife Hillary Wilson (daughter of the late Langley Wallingford). Casting Wittrock was initially expected to be on canvas for about only eight weeks. However, in December 2009, when it was announced that the series would move production to Los Angeles, the series offered Wittrock a contract not wanting to lose the recurring actor upon the move. In December 2010, it was reported that Wittrock had been released from his contract with the series. Soaps In Depth later confirmed with Wittrock himself that the rumors were true, his contract was set to expire and he would depart from the series. Though his final airdate was not initially available, Wittrock revealed that his character would air throughout the month of January 2011. Initial reports stated that the new head writers were unaware of what do with the character of Damon. However, contradicting information surfaced which stated that Wittrock chose not to renew his contract. Development Damon's introduction puts Liza Colby (Jamie Luner)'s attempt to adopt baby Stuart in jeopardy as he is the child's biological father and he could influence Bailey's choice to let Bailey keep the child. Of the plot, head writer, Charles Pratt, Jr. said the storyline is \\"a very relatable and real situation.\\" Storylines Damon Miller arrived in Pine Valley as the biological father of Stuart Colby, who has been adopted by Liza Colby. Liza initially doesn't trust Damon, convinced that his renewed presence in the life of Bailey Wells, Stuart's biological mother, is only motivated by a desire to pursue a sexual relationship with her. Damon and Bailey eventually start to live life as family with Stuart, until Damon is accused of being the culprit behind a rash of break-ins in town, for which Bailey is hesitant to believe his innocence. With the stress of Damon's alleged involvement in the break-ins too much for her to handle, Bailey leaves town to be with her parents. Damon begins to get close to Liza's daughter, Colby Chandler, who believes in his innocence and subsequently gets him a job as a bartender at ConFusion. Damon gets word from Bailey that she has returned to Ohio and is staying with her parents. At the same time, the DNA test results confirm that Damon was the person doing the break-ins, but Liza gets him out of trouble again. Colby is furious when she learns of his lies, but the two eventually reconcile when her brother JR Chandler falls into a coma. He assures her that JR can hear her talking. He even gets tested to see if he is a potential bone marrow donor for him, but the results come back negative. Damon's boss later finds out that he was the one who broke in and fires him. Liza's boyfriend, Tad Martin then finds Damon sleeping on a stretcher at Pine Valley Hospital. Tad offers him a place to stay at his house, while Damon continues to show concern for Colby. On March 11, 2010, when Damon goes to trial for his crimes, Liza learns that Damon's mother, Hillary Miller was supposed to come to town for the trial, but Hillary bails at the last minute leaving Liza wondering why. Liza finds out that Hillary Miller is actually Hillary Wilson, Tad's ex-wife. On March 17, it is confirmed by a DNA test that Tad is Damon's biological father. Meanwhile, Damon's antics get him into a lot of trouble. He takes Colby's car, this time with Colby inside and begins racing down the highway. He is texting Bailey at the same time and they crash into Brooke English. Her car is totaled but, luckily, she is saved by surgery. Meanwhile, Damon needs surgery with Colby right by his side. Liza overhears Damon telling Colby he wants to be more than just friends. So she persuades his probation officer that jail is exactly what Damon needs. But later, Damon is later diagnosed with ADHD and the instead of sending him to prison, he is sent to therapy. On April 28, Paul shows up in Pine Valley, accusing Tad of harassing Hillary. Tad takes him to see Damon and they find him kissing Colby. Paul accuses Damon of seducing another girl and calls Colby a tramp before Tad makes him leave. Damon later overhears Liza confess to Colby that Damon is Tad's son. On May 4, Damon finally confronts Tad and he confirms that he is his father. Bailey calls Tad and informs him that Damon is not Stuart's father. On July 6, after he hugs Liza, he kisses her. In November 2010, throughout the murder trial for David Hayward, Damon assists Liza as she is appointed the District Attorney. On January 6, 2011, Damon spots Colby and Asher kissing. On January 7, Damon confronts both Colby and Asher. Later Damon confesses to Liza about what he saw and says he has to leave town. Just as he goes to leave Liza asks him not to leave and they hug before kissing and wind up having sex. Reception Luke Kerr said that the writers should have explored a potential romance between Damon and Colby instead of firing Wittrock. Kerr then compared the pairing of Damon and Liza to the As the World Turns pairing of Casey (Billy Magnussen) and Emily (Kelley Menighan Hensley). Michael Fairman said he also saw great potential in Damon's romance with Liza. Jamey Giddens referred to Wittrock's portrayal of Damon as one of the best reasons to watch the show and described Damon's chemistry with Liza as \\"combustible.\\" References External links *Damon Miller ‚Äì Who's Who In Pine Valley Category:All My Children characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Damon Miller"},{"id":"26167407","text":"A set of moon blocks in Yueh Hai Ching temple Moon blocks or jiaobei (also written as jiao bei etc variants; ), also poe (from ; as used in the term \\"poe divination\\"), are wooden divination tools originating from China, which are used in pairs and thrown to answer a yes or no question. They are made out of wood or bamboo and carved into a crescent shape. A pair of clam shells can also be used.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFru8FZtqoshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M32hx7b-6K0 Each block is round on one side (known as the yin side) and flat on the other (known as the yang side). It is one of the more commonly used items found in Chinese traditional religion and are used in temples and home shrines along with fortune sticks, both of which are often used together when requesting an answer from the gods. Practice Moon blocks can be used separately to receive a straightforward answer, or they are accompanied by fortune sticks to clarify an oracle. When used alone, moon blocks are first purified by revolving the blocks around the incense burner three times. The querent then kneels and says their name, date of birth, residence, and question while cupping the blocks between their hands in prayer. After the querent poses the question to the gods, the blocks are dropped to the floor and land in a specific position. There are four possible answers that the moon blocks can produce: # Sh√®ngji«éo (ËÅñÁ≠ä, divine answer): One block flat and another block round is a 'yes' answer. # N√πji«éo (ÊÄíÁ≠ä, angry answer) also k≈´jiao (Âì≠Á≠ä, crying answer): Both blocks round is a 'no' answer. It is said that the gods are displeased by the question, and this is shown in the way the blocks directly fall flat on the floor. # Xi√†oji«éo (Á¨ëÁ≠ä, laughing answer): Both blocks flat have different interpretations; either it can be an emphasized 'no' answer and a sign that the gods are laughing at the question, or that they are laughing because the querent should know the answer, or that the answer to the question is obvious. One characteristic of this answer is when the blocks sway back and forth when dropped, a symbolic show of laughter. # L√¨ji«éo (Á´ãÁ≠ä, standing answer): One or both blocks fall but stand erect on the floor indicate that the deities do not understand the referent's question, therefore the question is nullified and the procedure must be repeated. When used alone without the fortune sticks, the blocks are thrown three times in order to maintain accuracy of the deity's answer, a successful answer usually being three consecutive throws showing sh√®ngji«éo, or best two out of three throws. Usages A set of moon blocks Moon blocks Aside from questioning the deities on mundane affairs, moon blocks are also used to verify a range of issues, such as proper ritual protocol, spiritual presence of the gods or if they have eaten the offerings presented to them.

Registered in 2002, the company opened its pub in 2004. In 2008, a production facility in Elk Rapids, Michigan was purchased and renovated to accommodate larger scale batches. In July 2017, Short's announced it sold 19.9% of the company to Lagunitas Brewing Company, who is owned by Heineken International. History Short's Brewing Company was registered as a business in 2002 with the State of Michigan by 22-year-old Joe Short. In 2003, a 100-year-old empty hardware store in Bellaire, Michigan was refurbished for use as a brewpub. The pub opened on April 26, 2004, initially housing a seven barrel brewing system utilizing five fermenters and five serving tanks. First year production totaled 178 barrels. During the fall of 2006, Short began work on The Imperial Beer Series. By 2007 the 13 series beers were released, each one with its own trading card and story. Short's purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids, Michigan in January 2008, to accommodate larger scale batches separate from the brewing done on- site at the brewpub. The first Elk Rapids batch of beer was brewed in January 2009. With the Elk Rapids warehouse facilities, production capacity increased to 30,000 barrels per year. The bottling line is designed to process 800 cases per day.Shorts Brewery products to be on grocery shelves soon In 2014, the company set a Guinness World Record for the largest tap takeover when it served 120 Short's beers for the opening of HopCat's new location in Detroit. In 2014 the company produced 34,443 barrels. Pub The pub offers space for community gatherings, local art (even the bar was made by locals), and live performance. The pub always has 20 beers and Starcut Ciders on tap. Production site The Elk Rapids production site is a 30-barrel brewhouse. The site has 21 fermenters and 6 bright tanks. Short's beer is brewed with natural ingredients and is unfiltered. Every bottled product and some kegs are flash pasteurized. The production site is geared to brew and package 56 different beers in 2014. Availability The beer is distributed mostly in the upper and lower Michigan peninsulas, and is sold in over 3,200 locations statewide. Short's beers are packaged in 12oz bottles and various sizes of kegs. Flagship brews are available year-round in the state of Michigan. Additionally Short's bottles over 40 seasonal and specialty beers annually. In January 2016, Short's announced that it will expand its distribution territory for both brands (Short's Brew and Starcut Ciders) to include additional states. In March 2016, Short's began distribution in Indiana and Ohio markets through Cavalier Distributing. Starting in January 2019, Short's is partnering with Cavalier Distributing in the greater Orlando area and J.J. Taylor Distributing Florida, Inc. in the greater Tampa area to bring Short's brews to Florida. Short's will distribute their flagship beers, Huma Lupa Licious, Local's Light, and Soft Parade, along with Pulsar, Octorock, and Mosa from Starcut Ciders beginning in mid-January. Short's new flagship, Juicy Brut, will also launch in Florida in February, followed by the highly popular seasonal, Soft Parade Shandy, in March. Culture The company culture begins with the concept of the public house or ‚Äúpub.‚Äù Compared to other alcohol establishments, pubs hold a unique place in the American experience. The colonial pub was the pillar of the community. Pubs were places to catch up on local business, gather a good meal and take in a libation brewed on site by the local publican. Early taverns were full of life and comfort. The Short's Pub in Bellaire, MI is an attempt to revive that hominess and is representative of the quality, creativity and conviviality throughout the company and products. The family-oriented and entrepreneurial nature of the brewpub extends through the fabric of the company as a whole. Creativity is consistently encouraged among the entire staff, with an understanding that all employees have much to contribute to the Short's Brewing Company ethos. Exemplifying the ‚Äúpower of smallness,‚Äù Short's enjoys the excitement of being one of the largest craft breweries in Michigan while also maintaining the tight-knit, hard-working attitude of a small business. Matching the seriousness of purpose in the workplace is a driving passion for recreation. Located in the heart of what we know as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù up north (Antrim County has a total of two traffic lights), easy accessibility truly makes the natural world our playground. Whether it's mountain biking or kayaking, trail running or hiking, snowshoeing or alpine-, cross-country-, or water-skiing, the Short's staff plays with the same lust for life that inspires every beer brewed.

Oil with sand on canvas. Guggenheim Museum, New York. This work is among Bacon's most important, and, containing characteristics of both, is seen by critics as a divider between his early \\"raw\\" work, and the later, more clinically observed triptychs. The Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909‚Äì1992) painted 28 knownBacon was a ruthless self- editor, likely many more were destroyed triptychs between 1944 and 1986.Sylvester, 107 He began to work in the format in the mid-1940s with a number of smaller scale formats before graduating in 1962 to large examples. He followed the larger style for 30 years, although he painted a number of smaller scale triptychs of friend's heads, and after the death of his former lover George Dyer in 1971, the three Black Triptychs. Overview Bacon was a highly mannered artist often preoccupied with forms, themes, images and modes of expression that he would rework for sustained periods, often across decades. When asked about his tendency for sequential paintings, he explained how, in his mind, images revealed themselves \\"in series. And I suppose I could go long beyond the triptych and do five or six together, but I find the triptych is a more balanced unit.\\"Sylvester, 100 His career began with the 1944 triptych Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, an instant critical and popular success. The format appealed to him; he said, \\"I see images in series\\", according to Bacon images suggested other images and series became his dominant motif. He moved past the triptych format, and from the late 40s to the late 50s produced works in series of up to 10 works, many of which rank amongst his finest, including his series of Popes, heads and men in suits. Bacon fell from critical favour in the late 1950s having been a darling for the previous 10 years. He later admitted he had lost his voice and was seeking a new way to express himself which involved a lot of transitional work, much of which he destroyed, and much of which he preferred not to be included in his cannon. His 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion, painted to coincide with his first retrospective at the Tate, marked a return to form and has been highly praised by critics and historians such as David Sylvester, Michel Leiris and Michael Peppiatt as a key turning point in his career. He told critics that his usual practice with triptychs was to begin with the left panel and work across. Typically he completed each frame before beginning the next. As the work as a whole progressed, he would sometimes return to an earlier panel to make revisions, though this practice was generally carried out late in the overall work's completion. Works During the late 1940s and 1950s, Bacon worked on several series, such as his screaming heads, popes, animals in prey and men in blue suits. The use of reworked and revisited imagery transferred into regular use of a triptych format in the early 1960s.Davies & Yard, 114 In interviews, Bacon said that when he daydreamed, images occurred in \\"hundreds at a time, some link up with one another.\\" The triptych format was attractive, he believed, because it physically broke the images and prevented forced or constructed narrative interpretation; a tendency in painting to which he was particularly opposed and found banal. Crucifixion, 1965. Oil and acrylic on canvas. Bayerische Staatsgem√§ldesammlungen, Munich Bacon began his first large triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion in February 1962. Although he often completed a major canvas in a day, this work was not finished until the following March. At 194 cm x 145 cm, it is four times the size of his previous triptych and his first major work, the 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, with which the 1962 work shares both theme and title. In 1964, he extended the standard width of each canvas by 2.5 cm, and discounting the mid-1960s heads and early-mid \\"Black Triptychs\\", retained the larger, monumental scale for all triptychs painted in the remaining thirty years of his life. In 2000, the art critic David Sylvester categorised Bacon's large triptychs into three groupings: 18 showing a dramatic or erotic event, six showing three full-length seated portraits, and four containing single nude figures. 36 contain a single nude figure, 24 a single clothed figure. Five show a biomorph,The figuration of the biomorphs was inspired by Picasso's late 1920s and early 1930s figures on beaches. See Baldassari, 140-144 4 contain still lives. 28 are large, generally five times bigger than the small format works. Bacon was highly self-critical and destroyed a great many canvases.Some of which reappeared on the art market following his death in 1992 It is known that at least five were destroyed, while two or three were likely split by dealers and sold as individual canvasses.Sylvester, 107 Crucifixions Inversion of Cimabue's Santa Croce Crucifix, 1287‚Äì1288. Inverted to highlight the association Bacon made with Rembrandt's Side of Beef, and the central panel of his 1965 Crucifixion As well as being Bacon's first large format triptych, Three Studies for a Crucifixion introduced the later and often repeated visual motif a human body turned inside out. This idea was drawn from a long tradition in art history, and was influenced strongly by Rembrandt's Side of beef and Chaim Soutine's Carcass of Beef.Sylvester, 108 Although the idea of torn flesh was present in early work such as his Painting (1946), in the 1960s triptychs and the two versions of the Lying figure with Hypodermic Syringe (1963 & 1968), Bacon inverts the epidermis and guts of human torsos to create imagery, according to Sylvester, nearing the grotesque and horror of Rubens's Descent from the Cross, and the Crucifix panel of Cimabue. His first three major triptychs were of crucifixion scenes, and all bear debt to Rubens's The Descent from the Cross, a work the normally reticent Bacon praised time and again to critics. Heads After 1965 Bacon's focus generally narrowed, and he became obsessed with close-up portraiture. On the opening day of his first Tate retrospective, he received word that his former lover Peter Lacey had died; news that had a devastating impact on him personally, and led him to produce his first triptych in the style to his heads of the mid-1950s, which had brought him to wider attention.Sylvester, 111 The 1962 Study for Three Heads opened a dramatically new arena for the artist and was followed by similar scaled triptychs for a series of works which can loosely be seen to be painted after his \\"Colony Room associates, including Dyer, Lucian Freud (for a period), Muriel Belcher and Henrietta Moraes. From the 1970s, as the artist himself approached later life, associates and drinking friends began to die, lending many of the portraits an added urgency and poignancy. Voyeur Peter Paul Rubens's 1612-1614 triptych The Descent from the CrossIn Triptych Inspired by T. S. Eliot's poem \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\", Bacon shows a couple erotically entwined in the right- hand panel, while a clothed male figure stands looking at them. The left-hand panel shows another couple, in full view, lying in Post-coital tristesse. Here Bacon is looking at the notion of voyeurism being an ideal prelude to participation; a notion held by his former lover Peter Lacy. The idea is revisited in both versions of Triptych - Studies from the Human Body (1970), and is informed by Henri Matisse's Red Studio of 1911.Sylvester, 121-22 Bacon's triptychs show ten separate couples on beds, of which eight are erotically interacting, while in two others figures are shown sleeping side by side. The Black Triptychs Two days before the opening of Bacon's retrospective at the Grand Palais, George Dyer, his former lover and principal model for the past seven years, took his own life in the hotel room they were sharing.\\"Triptych - August 1972\\". Tate. Retrieved February 13, 2010. Bacon's acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life were heightened by Dyer's death. During the following three years he painted many images of Dyer, including the series of three \\"Black triptychs\\" (or \\"Black paintings\\") which have come to be seen as among his best work. They are so named because they share common black backgrounds emblematic of death or mourning . A number of characteristics bind the \\"Black triptychs\\" together. The form of a monochromatically rendered doorway features centrally in all, and each is framed by flat and shallow walls. In each, Dyer is stalked by a broad shadow; which takes the form of pools of blood or flesh in the first and third panels, and the wings of the angel of death in the second and first.Davies & Yard, 67‚Äì76. In its display caption for the Triptych‚ÄìAugust 1972 the Tate gallery wrote, \\"What death has not already consumed seeps incontinently out of the figures as their shadows.\\"\\"Triptych - August 1972\\". Tate. Retrieved on February 11, 2010. Bacon's work from the 1970s has been described by the art critic Hugh Davies as the \\"frenzied momentum of a struggle against death\\". He admitted during a 1974 interview that he thought the most difficult aspect of aging was \\"losing your friends\\". This was a bleak period in his life, and though he was to live for another seventeen years, he felt that his life was almost over, \\"and all the people I've loved are dead\\". His concern is reflected in the darkened flesh and background tones of these three triptychs.Davies; Yard, 65 Themes Motion Eadweard Muybridge Man ascending stairs, 1884‚Äì85 The Three Labours of Hercules (c. 1528), Michelangelo Bacon's interest in sequential images came from his interest in photography, in particular his fascination with the work of the English pioneer Eadweard Muybridge (1830‚Äì1904). He also was impressed with Michelangelo's The Three Labours of Hercules (c. 1528). These works captured movement in a series of frozen moments, shown in separate plates recorded or captured in quick succession, allowing the viewer to witness multiple perspectives.Zielinski, Siegfried.

The film stars Shahid Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film was released on 7 May 2010 under the banner of Yash Raj Films. The movie was a commercial success at the box office.  Plot  In 1994 middle-class Bombay, three ordinary youngsters, Karan (Shahid Kapoor), Zing (Meiyang Chang) and Chandu (Vir Das) graduate from college and go for a trip to Bangkok, Thailand, where they meet Bulbul (Anushka Sharma) and they start a business together. Karan eventually falls in love with her. Karan tells her that he always wanted to start his own business but his father Sajjan Kapoor (Anupam Kher) wants him to study MBA. On the other hand, Bulbul confesses that she wants to be a supermodel and advises Karan that he does not need a large amount of money to start a business, but a big \\"idea\\". Back in India, Sajjan has a heart attack. Karan's mother Maya (Kiran Juneja) pawns her jewelry in order to arrange some amount of money for better facilities and an AC room at the hospital as his insurance could only afford a Non-AC room. This leaves Karan heart-broken, and he immediately decides to get rich by any means, he decides to start his own venture along with his friends. He comes up with an idea for smuggling branded Reebok shoes in India without any customs charges. For this, they have to separate the consignment into two-halves, one half with only left shoes in Calcutta and the other half with only right shoes in Madras. At both places, the buyer will refuse to receive the consignment, hence the entire consignment will be confiscated. The confiscated consignment will then be auctioned in which Chandu (in Calcutta) and Karan (in Madras) will buy the entire consignment, pretending they are scrap dealers. Once the right shoes pair up with left shoes, the zero-valued product comes into a full value which can be sold at any profit without any customs charges. They name their venture \\"Friends and Company\\" and proceed to make a large fortune with it. When Karan is caught red-handed by Sajjan while putting away the black money, he explains the situation, including the fact that he is doing business with a smuggler. As a result, he is forced to leave the house and starts living with Bulbul and uses her to get contracts. After the government in India decides to reduce the import duty on foreign goods (including shoes), the friends decide to go to America. They get help from Karan's Uncle Jazz (Pavan Malhotra.) They do the same business in the US as they did in India, only this time they import Leather Gloves. In a short time, the group becomes excessively rich and starts to live royally. The police start to suspect Karan and his team, owing to which they change their business. Instead, one of the friends rents a lavish house for one hundred thousand dollars by taking a loan from a bank. Then the house will be sold to another friend and again that friend will take a loan from the same bank, hence repeating the cycle. Since the property of the person who cannot return the loan is used to be seized by the bank, one of them will declare thyself as bankrupt and the house gets seized, with an actual worth of one hundred thousand dollars, but the company will have already gained two hundred thousand dollars' profit. However, Karan becomes too greedy and the group begins to fall apart. Karan and Zing get into an argument about Zing's excessive drinking. Zing leaves and opens his own bar. Bulbul leaves when she finds out that Karan has married another woman for a green card. Chandu weds and quits the company to start a video store. Alone and heartbroken, Karan visits India and secretly attends a function where Sajjan is being honored for his years of service to his company. Upon seeing this, he realizes his mistake. On his return to America, he is arrested and put in jail for 6 months. He is bailed out after Bulbul comes and gives up Zing's, Chandu's and her share from what they earned in the company. Karan starts working with his uncle. One day, he meets Bulbul, who is revealed to be pregnant with his child and the lovers reconcile. At Uncle Jazz's office, Karan finds out that his uncle's entire consignment of imported shirts from Madras has been rejected as the color bleeds after washing. The news reaches to stock market due to which Jazz company's share fall down to 30%. Karan sees an opportunity and thinks of another brilliant idea and Karan patches up with Zing, Chandu and his family to start another new venture. This time, he makes Jazz's buyers believe that his company offers a new kind of shirt in the market, which changes its color every time it is washed, hence a common man gets a new shirt every time he washes it. The buyers' orders a trial order of 5,000 pieces and the public goes crazy over this new shirt, due to which Karan gets another order, this time for a much bigger amount of shirts. The shares of Jazz's company go skyrocketed as the public really appreciates and buys the shirts at an overwhelmingly high rate, hence recovering his Uncle Jazz' loss. Karan, Zing, Chandu, and Bulbul are now partners with Jazz in \\"Friends and Company\\", but it is turned into a public limited company. With his wife, son, friends and having made his father proud, Karan is finally content with his life.

She currently serves as City Councilmember At- Large for Oakland, California and finished second in the race for Oakland mayor in the November 2014 election. She previously ran for Oakland mayor in 2010 and placed third.  Career in elected office  Oakland City Councilmember At-Large Kaplan's contributions to Oakland policy making have included a focus on budget balancing measures, legislation which eased the permit process for new restaurants, creating a new public transit line downtown, and re-working and passing a law which mandates registration of abandoned and vacant buildings. Kaplan also championed the Vacant Parcel Tax in Oakland in an effort to resolve Oakland's growing homeless problem. The tax is levied on Oakland's property owners with unused and vacant residential & commercial properties. Budget-balancing measures In 2009, Oakland's budget shortfall ran into the tens of millions, and as a solution, Kaplan proposed Measure F, which raised taxes on medical cannabis businesses. The measure, which dramatically increased taxes on these businesses, was strongly supported by the businesses themselves. Kaplan received national media attention from this initiative, appearing on PBS's NewsHour and Fox Business Network to discuss it. The measure passed overwhelmingly in a special election. Three other ballot measures, also campaigned for by Kaplan, were passed in a successful effort to balance the year's budget. Vacant building registration Also in 2009, Kaplan re-designed a failed City Council measure which would require owners of certain vacant properties to register their buildings with the city. Oakland's vacancy problem had led to rampant use of empty buildings for illegal activities, and earlier in the year, Councilmember Desley Brooks had attempted to pass similar legislation, which had been voted down due to unclear language and an overly aggressive fine regime. Kaplan re-wrote the measure with a simpler scope, and was able to pass it by a wide margin of support.  Cutting ties with ICE  On August 2017, two Oakland police officers provided traffic assistance to ICE agents as Homeland Security Investigations served a federal search warrant in West Oakland regarding a human trafficking investigation that involves childrenhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/16/homeland-security-search- warrant-served-in-west-oakland/ leading to the detainment of two men, neither ever having been convicted or charged with a crime. Fearing that residents would experience a chilling effect from the incident and would be less willing to call on police for support, Kaplan proposed a resolution upholding the city's sanctuary city status by stipulating that the Oakland Police Department be prevented from colluding and assisting with ICE. According to a statement from Kaplan, \\" The head of ICE has made public statements that have helped make it more clear that ICE is not actually focusing on solving serious and violent crime, but is focused on being part of (President Donald) Trump's political vendetta.\\" Co-sponsored by Councilwoman Desley Brooks, the resolution passed city council unanimously.  Oakland Athletics  In the fall of 2019, as a member of the Oakland City Council, Kaplan contributed to an effort to sue Alameda County over the approved $85 million sale of the land currently housing the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and Oakland Arena to the Oakland Athletics. The city argued it wasn‚Äôt given a real opportunity to buy the County‚Äôs share of the land, despite Oakland not having adequate money to purchase the site. This is broadly seen as an attempt to derail the Oakland Athletic's plan to construct a privately financed new stadium at the Howard Terminal site that would keep the Athletics in the San Francisco Bay Area. The plan the Athletics put forward includes major revitalization projects at both the Howard Terminal and Coliseum sites, including the construction of affordable housing, restaurants, retail, small business space and public gathering spaces. Due to the abrupt nature of the lawsuit and the fact that the plan was backed by city leaders, A‚Äôs President Dave Kaval said that the team was ‚Äúcompletely blindsided‚Äù and ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù by the city‚Äôs lawsuit. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who said she hopes the city ‚Äúsuspends‚Äù the suit, stated ‚ÄúOur city and county governments should work with each other, not against each other, I hope the council suspends this suit so we can all collaborate together on a beneficial future for the Coliseum.\\" Oakland City Councilman Larry Reid stated that Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, told Oakland leaders that ‚ÄúBay Area fans will soon be going to Las Vegas to see the Raiders and that unless things changed, Bay Area fans may be going to Las Vegas or elsewhere to see the A‚Äôs as well.‚Äù A few weeks after the lawsuit was filed, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law two bills, AB1191 and SB293, designed to move the new Howard Terminal ballpark forward.  Election history  In November 2008, Kaplan won her current post in a run-off election against BART executive Kerry Hamill by a margin of 62% to 37%, with Kaplan receiving a total of 82,531 votes to Hamill's 50,387. She succeeded Henry Chang, Jr., against whom Kaplan had campaigned unsuccessfully in 2000. Kaplan previously served as the Member At-Large on the Alameda ‚Äì Contra Costa Transit Board of Directors, elected unopposed in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. In this post, she represented 1.5 million residents of western Alameda and Contra Costa counties. In 2000 Kaplan ran for Oakland city council registered with the Green Party, an affiliation held until she switched to the Democratic Party in 2008. In April 2010 Kaplan formed a campaign committee to explore running for Oakland mayor. In the November election Kaplan placed third in ranked choice balloting after winner Jean Quan and runner-up Don Perata. Kaplan ran again for Oakland mayor in 2014, coming in second in the ranked choice ballot to councilwoman Libby Schaaf.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Jean-Quan-loses-Oakland-mayor-s- job-to-Libby-5873406.php Personal life Kaplan is bisexual,Naomi Tucker, Liz Highleyman, & Rebecca Kaplan.

Today it has branches at RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk) and RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron). Both bases provide training, and club members regularly dive in their local areas on weekends. Diving instruction, from beginner to advanced level, is offered under the auspices of the British Sub-Aqua Club.Information on the NACSAC on the UK Ministry of Defence website. In 2005 NAC-SAC was closed down as an organisation in favour of a Royal Navy Sub Aqua Club, which is what Lieut. Graham and CPO Larn had wanted from the outset of NAC-SAC which was only given that title since HMS Vernon, the RN Diving School at Portsmouth, would not support the idea of sport diving within the service. In the early 1960s a group of chief petty officers from the Naval Air Command decided to form amateur diving clubs and mounted annual expeditions.Interview with Roy Graham in December 2005. In retirement, he and his wife Grace moved to the Isles of Scilly where they ran a holiday guest house and became active in developing tourism on the Isles. He died on 16 March 2007, shortly before the 300th anniversary of the great naval disaster of 1707, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's. These clubs were first based at the naval air stations of Portland (HMS Osprey), Culdrose and Yeovilton and conducted diving under the auspices of an umbrella organisation which became known as the \\"Naval Air Command Sub Aqua Club\\" (NACSAC). The club's first chairman was Lieutenant Roy Graham (1924‚Äì2007), an engineer officer who had begun his diving career aboard the aircraft carrier . Whilst in Gibraltar, he was in charge of diving training on this ship. Following a shallow water diving course with 24 entrants and only himself and a Royal Air Force medical officer finishing the rigorous training, Graham became the only Fleet Air Arm officer with a naval diving qualification. The organisations Diving Officer from its formation in 1960 was Chief Petty Office Richard Larn, who apart from a period on HMS Bulwark in 1967-8 continued to organise training and expeditions until his retirement from the navy in 1971. One of the club's first projects was to send a team of divers to the Isles of Scilly to find an historic Royal Navy ship, HMS Association, a 90-gun ship of the line lost in the great naval disaster in 1707.Wreck of the fleet and treasures of the deep, The Islander 3, Autumn/Winter 2007.

Their initial dives began a series of navy visits that continued for four years.For more details on these dives and the later discovery of the Association, see McBride, Peter and Larn, Richard (1999) Admiral Shovell's treasure; (hardback) (paperback). In 1964, 1965 and 1966The annual expedition in 1966 was announced as a search for the wreck of the Association. Plans to find it had existed before (see above), but until then the dives in the Isles of Scilly had largely discovered modern wrecks. See the List of shipwrecks of the Isles of Scilly. the divers could only access the Western Rocks, but barely around the Gilstone Ledge, where a later expedition managed to locate the wreck of in 1967.BSAC Pioneers on the British Sub-Aqua Club website. The rediscovery of the site also led to more government legislation, notably the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, passed in an attempt to preserve British historic wreck sites as part of the maritime heritage. www.shipwrecks.uk.com/tricent-leaflet The annual expeditions, organised to promote diving as an exciting sport, have become a key focus of NAC-SAC activities.

History The company was founded in 1908 by Bostonian millionaire Eben Dyer Jordan, Jr. and impresario Henry Russell. Jordan, an opera enthusiast and amateur singer, was the heir to a department store fortune and provided the company's financial backing for its first three seasons. He also provided the funds necessary to complete the Boston Opera House, as the theatre's construction had been halted for some years due to lack of finances. Russell had worked as a talent manager and opera director in Europe and from 1906 until 1909 his touring opera company, the San Carlo Opera Company (SCOC), had been based in Boston when not on the road. The SCOC was basically the artistic seed for the new Boston Opera Company as many artists working for this touring company, such as Alice Nielsen, Lillian Nordica, Florencio Constantino, and Louise Homer, became a part of the Boston Opera Company. The company's first performance was given for the opening of the Boston Opera House on November 8, 1909. The company presented Amilcare Ponchielli's \\"La Gioconda\\" with Nordica in the title role and Homer as La Cieca. During its six seasons the BOC presented a wide array of works, including two contemporary operas by Boston composer Frederick Converse: The Pipe of Desire and The Sacrifice. Although the company was admired for its artistic excellence (largely due to the fine conducting by Felix Weingartner), the organization was plagued with financial worries after the initial backing by Jordan ended. These monetary problems eventually forced the company to declare bankruptcy on May 11, 1915.

He is one of the most famous former prisoners of San Lucas Island.  Family and early years  Beltr√°n Cort√©s was born on November 12, 1908 as the youngest of 18 siblings to Rosendo Cort√©s Madrigal and Amelia Carvajal in Santa B√°rbara, Heredia. By 1938 he was living with his mom and three sisters in Santa B√°rbara. He finished the first levels of elementary school and then went on to work as a farmer, never getting married or having children. A door accidentally fell on him as a kid in Heredia's central market, which resulted in a head wound that left a permanent scar and a humerus fracture in his right arm that never aligned because it was not properly treated in time.  The surgeries by Dr. Moreno and Dr. Echandi  In 1928, at the age of 20, he had surgery three times by doctors Moreno and Echandi; on June 1 both doctors surgically wired his right humerus and then he had two follow up surgeries, on July 23 by Dr. Echandi and on August 3 by Dr. Moreno. On August 2, 1929, Dr. Moreno gave him metal plate implants, yet these were extracted on April 4, 1932. At this point his diagnosis was an unconsolidated humerus due to syphilis.  Criminal background  After the surgeries he served as a police officer in San Rafael de Heredia. On July 28, 1934, he killed his partner Benjam√≠n Garita Ram√≠rez while on duty. He was convicted to a 5-year sentence in San Lucas Island, however he got years taken off his sentence by performing manual labour. When he left prison he got a job at Chapu√≠ Asylum, which he quickly quit to sell merchandise in the streets.  The doctors' murders  Cort√©s became obsessed with the failed surgeries over time. At least one doctor told him they had been the surgeons' fault, while an attorney convinced him Dr. Moreno should compensate him for the hardship and pain suffered. Cort√©s later stated that he had gone to the hospital to get treated for a pain in his leg, and that Dr. Moreno took advantage of this to take a graft of bone from his healthy arm for a foreign patient. Prior to the murders, he had threatened killing the two doctors, leading his mother to ask that he be admitted into Chapu√≠ Asylum. Cort√©s bought a gun from a police officer and on August 23, 1938 at 7:30 p.m he knocked on Dr. Moreno's door. When the maid opened the door he ran into the living room where Dr. Moreno was reading the newspaper and shot him three times. He escaped the scene and immediately went to Dr. Echandi's house, stopping along the way to ask for directions. When he got there he once again knocked on the door and was received by the footman. Dr. Echandi was on his way out, as he had heard on the radio the news of Dr. Moreno's death and wanted to go to the crime scene. Cort√©s shot him twice from the front gate, although only one of the shots hit him and the other one bounced off the door. During his escape Cort√©s also killed a Canadian man called Arthur Maynard, and severely injured two people by the names of Eg√©rico Vargas Lor√≠a and Rodolfo Quir√≥s Quir√≥s, before being apprehended.  San Lucas Island  On June 23, 1938 he was convicted to a sentence of undefined length at San Lucas Island. President Le√≥n Cort√©s Castro ordered the construction of a two square metre cell for him that would allow visitors to see him. During several years tourists were brought from Puntarenas up to the island to see him exhibited in this cell. Jos√© Le√≥n S√°nchez mentioned him in his book La isla de los hombres solos. President Otilio Ulate Blanco ordered that he be taken out of that cell and placed with the other prisoners during a visit to the facility. During President Jos√© Figueres' administration the country's penal code was reformed limiting Costa Rica's maximum penalty to 30 years in prison. Since Cort√©s had already being incarcerated for 32 years at this point he was immediately released. He died of prostate cancer on June 11, 1984 at the age of 75 in his sister's house in Santa B√°rbara.Registro Civil de Costa Rica, Partido de Heredia, Secci√≥n Nacimientos, Tomo 270, Asiento 158.

They were townlands united to the city, but still preserving their own jurisdiction. St. Sepulchre's was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Dublin, although from time to time the Dublin city government claimed ownership of it.Parliamentary Papers: Reports from Commissioners, Vol. 24. Session: 4 February - 20 August 1836. House of Commons, London. Location The importance of the Manor of St. Sepulchre was enhanced in that it consisted of a number of manors, many of which lay outside the city or even county of Dublin. The manor of St. Sepulchre in the city was the principal manor. The city manor boundaries stretched from Bishop St. to St. Stephen's Green, along Harcourt Street to Donnybrook, across Rathgar to Harold's Cross and back along Clanbrassil Street. In 1523-4 the Archbishop was engaged in a legal dispute with the Mayor and Corporation of Dublin, who had apparently taken possession of the manor. An Act of the Parliament of Ireland of 2 June 1774 (13 & 14 Geo.III c.34) formed a barony, the Barony of St. Sepulchre, from that part of the manor lying north of the South Circular Road. This had previously been part of the barony of Uppercross. Within it were the civil parishes of St. Kevin, St. Nicholas Without and part of St. Peter's. The barony was abolished by the Dublin Baronies Act 1842 (5 & 6 Vict. c.96), when the area was transferred from the county to the city. Outside the city there were manors belonging to St. Sepulchre's in Swords, Lusk, Shankhill, Tallaght, Finglas and other places. Each of these manors was governed by a portreeve, who was sworn in each Easter by the seneschal of St. Sepulchre. Privileges In return for the support of the Archbishop, or to alleviate certain hardships suffered by Englishmen or the church in Ireland, privileges were granted to the manor (that is, to the archbishop and his successors) at various times and by various kings of England. These allowed the city manor (and its constituent manors outside the city) to have their own courts of justice (Courts Leet, Courts Baron and a Court of Record, where they were allowed to try all crimes except \\"forestalling, rape, treasure-trove and arson\\"), free customs, freedom from certain taxes and services, impose their own fines, have their own coroners, rights of salvage, maintain their own fairs and markets, regulate weights and measures, etc. For those condemned to death, the archbishop had his own gallows at Harold's Cross. These rights and privileges were ended by the Manor Court of Saint Sepulchre Abolition Act 1856,19 & 20 Vict. c.57 the last such jurisdiction remaining in Ireland. Administration Map (reprinted 1896) showing the layout of Dublin in 1610. The Palace of St. Sepulchre is marked as location number 66 The headquarters of the city manor (and consequently, of all St. Sepulchre manors) was the Palace of St. Sepulchre, located now where Kevin St. Garda barracks stands. This was originally constructed by John Comyn, the first Anglo-Norman Archbishop of Dublin, appointed in 1180. The name was suggested by the campaigns being waged by the Crusaders for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the Muslims. Comyn was shortly after granted land by the monarchy for the See of Dublin,which provided the basis for the manor. This palace remained the seat of the Archbishops of Dublin until 1806. A courthouse (still standing) and gaol for the use of the manor were built in the early 19th century at the corner of Long Lane and Bride St. Most of the prisoners were insolvent debtors. Much of the business of the court related to trading, fairs, weights and measures matters. Attending court was difficult for those manor residents living outside the city, in Swords, Lusk or elsewhere, most of whom were quite poor. The same difficulty applied to jurors, who were fined for not attending court when summoned. All income from court activity went to the Archbishop. In 1813 the population of this manor was 3,728 males and 5,273 females.Government figures quoted in M'Gregor, Picture of Dublin (1821), p. 62 References Sources * For medieval liberty boundaries see Citations Category:History of Dublin (city) Category:Baronies of County Dublin Category:Former baronies of Ireland Category:Places in Dublin (city) ","title":"Manor of St. Sepulchre"},{"id":"26167934","text":"Jerry Flora is an American football coach.

Origin and topography Gangavalli River (also called Bedthi River) originates from the Western Ghats the south of Dharwad (Near Someshwara temple) as Shalmala and flows in the west direction to meet the Arabian sea just after the Ganga temple. Here the River embraces the name Gangavalli from the Goddess Ganga; the village in this area carries the same name Gangavalli. This stream joins at Kalghatgi about lower down to the Bedthi River that takes its birth near Hubli. River then flows west and then south-west for a total distance of 69 km. This river has a catchment area of and has a total length of . On its course towards the Arabian Sea, the river falls from a height of 180 metre at a point called Magod.Manjaguni a new resort place on the western face of the Sahyadri, is significant and picturesque at the confluence of the river and the Arabian Sea during the low and high tides during full moons.

The various type of soil found here is golden sand, clay loamy, clayey, clayey- skeletal, and loamy. Climate Rainfall With a major part of the river lying in the Western Ghats, the Ganagavalli river basin receives a large amount of rainfall. Mean annual rainfall ranges from to . About 95% of the rainfall is received during the month of June to September (July being the rainiest) when the southwest monsoon is at its climax. There is some rainfall in the post monsoon season in the form of thundershowers mostly during October and some rainfall also occurs during the summer months of April and May. During heavy monsoons, the river floods to nearby villages and dumps dirt and dead animals to lands creating havoc to villagers. Temperature April is usually the hottest month with the mean daily maximum temperature at 36ÀöC and the mean daily minimum at 22ÀöC. Humidity During the morning, the relative humidity exceeds 75% for most times of the year. During the months of monsoon, the relative humidity during the afternoons is approximately 60%. During the driest months (January to March), the relative humidity in the afternoon is less than 35%.

Axelsson came up with the idea of exhibiting a series of paintings made by a non-human primate, under the pretense that they were the work of a previously unknown human French artist named \\"Pierre Brassau\\", in order to test whether critics could tell the difference between true avant- garde modern art and the work of a chimpanzee. \\"Pierre Brassau\\" was Peter, a four-year-old common chimpanzee from Sweden's Bor√•s Djurpark. Axelsson had persuaded Peter's 17-year-old keeper to give the chimpanzee a brush and paint. After Peter had created several paintings, Axelsson chose the best four and arranged to have them exhibited at the Gallerie Christinae in G√∂teborg, Sweden. While one critic observed that \\"only an ape could have done this\\", most praised the works. Rolf Anderberg of the G√∂teborgs-Posten wrote, \\"Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness.

First called the Social Club and later renamed the Arlington Club, it offered its all-male members, most of whom were relatively wealthy and powerful, an exclusive place to socialize and discuss their interests. During its first century, a total of more than 3,300 men were club members at one time or another. Many, in addition to pursuing their livelihoods, were officers in civic, cultural, philanthropic, or social organizations, and some held government posts at the local, state, or federal levels. For about 100 years, the club excluded Jews and minorities regardless of other criteria, and for 123 years it excluded women. In response to public pressure, it broadened the membership criteria for men by the late 1960s and for women in 1990. , the Arlington Club continues to gather at its building in downtown Portland. History In 1867, Simeon Reed and 34 other Portland men organized what they called the Social Club to \\"fraternize for mutual enjoyment and relaxation, and to provide a meeting place for discussing their own and Portland's destiny\\".MacColl, Merchants, p. 134 The club, \\"the social headquarters of Portland's male elite\\" was dominated through the late 20th century by largely white, mostly Anglo- Saxon men from the city's business and banking leadership.MacColl, Growth, p. 3 Among the founders were John C. Ainsworth (Ainsworth National Bank), Henry Failing (merchandising, shipping, iron and steel, First National Bank), William S. Ladd (merchandising, transportation, flour milling, Ladd & Tilton Bank), Donald Macleay (merchandising, shipping, United States National Bank), George Weidler (steamships, real estate, lumber), and many others who made a lasting impact on the city.Montgomery, p. 2 Paul G. Merriam describes the city's early social elite, including the members of the Social Club, as \\"primarily businessmen and their close associates, such as lawyers and editors\\".Merriam, p. 42 The social elite were heads of families who \\"held property valued at $50,000 or more, and who were officers in one or more civic, cultural, philanthropic, or social organizations.\\" Merriam counts 38 such men in Portland in 1870, 31 of whom at one time or another held local government office and several of whom held state and federal offices.Merriam, pp. 43-44 Most were nominal Republicans; some were Democrats, but they crossed party lines depending on issues and personalities.Merriam, pp. 50-51 Although one of the club's goals was to pattern itself after gentlemen's clubs of Europe and older American cities, it also had \\"civic interests at heart and civic leaders as members...\\".Montgomery, p. 1 However, according to Portland historian E. Kimbark MacColl, club members at times equated self-interest with civic interest: > In the 1890s at least, what was good for \\"them\\" was usually considered good > for \\"the city\\". Rarely did the members distinguish between the public > interest and their own private interests if actions and words have been > reported accurately. It would appear that many of the major decisions > affecting Portland's business and political life were actually reached > during \\"informal\\" discussions held within the club's portals.MacColl, > Shaping, p. 174 Big banks, utilities, railroads, and U.S. Senators from Oregon were well represented within the membership. Generally in the 1890s four or five club members were part of the Oregon Legislature. Three other clubs‚Äîthe Multnomah Amateur Athletic Club (1891), the Waverly Golf Club (1896), and the University Club (1896)‚Äîformed during the 1890s, and memberships often overlapped with the Arlington Club. The Concordia Club, formed in 1878, was the Jewish version of the Arlington Club, which was at the time not open to Jews.MacColl, Shaping, pp. 175-176 Among the club's self-generated list of notable members between 1867 and 1967 were George H. Williams, appointed Chief Justice of the Territorial Courts of Oregon in 1853, elected to the U.S. Senate in 1864, named United States Attorney General in 1871, and elected mayor of Portland in 1892. Another was Frederick Van Voorhies Holman, general counsel for an electric utility in the early 20th century, patron of the arts, and author of a biography of John McLoughlin. Journalist Harvey W. Scott, a mid-19th-century editor of The Oregonian and author of a six-volume history of Oregon, is on the list as is Lewis A. McArthur, a 20th-century electric utility executive and author of Oregon Geographic Names. University presidents, a bishop, and an Air Force general are among others on the list. Well-known guests of the club have included U.S. presidents William Howard Taft, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Ulysses S. Grant, author Aldous Huxley, heart surgeon Michael E. DeBakey, General George C. Marshall, bridge designer Ralph Modjeski, and many others.Montgomery, pp. 53-72 Meeting places, buildings A lithograph of the Arlington Club (West Park and Alder) from the first page of the April 4, 1891 edition of The Illustrated Western Shore For its first 14 years, the club members met in dining places, hotels, government chambers, or \\"any place available\\". When the club reorganized and renamed itself the Arlington Club in 1881, it had grown to a membership of about 100.Merriam, pp. 48-49 At that time, it moved into its first clubhouse, the former J.C. Ainsworth residence at Southwest Third Avenue at Pine Street,Montgomery, p. 61 which became available when the Ainsworths moved to California.MacColl, Merchants, p. 185 It built its second clubhouse, at West Park Avenue and Alder Street, which it occupied from 1892 to 1910 until moving to the building the club still occupies, on Southwest Salmon Street facing the South Park Blocks. Architects for the latter structure, a four-story, low-rise building of brick and terra cotta in a neo-classical style, were William M. Whidden and Ion Lewis. The Park Blocks just south of the clubhouse are flanked by churches, the Portland Art Museum, the Oregon Historical Society Museum, and Portland State University, as well as other buildings forming part of the city's core.Montgomery, p. 49 The building was nominated to become a National Register of Historic Places building in April 2010, and was listed on the registry in August of that year. Membership changes From the beginning, only business and community leaders were invited to join the club, a total of 3,300 of them during the club's first century,Montgomery, p. 3 but other exclusions applied as well. Jews and ethnic minorities were kept out of the Arlington Club until the late 1960s after Portland's Jewish leaders including Gus Solomon, a federal judge, criticized the exclusion rules. Change occurred slowly; The Oregonian newspaper reported that in 1989 Jews and ethnic minorities made up less than 3 percent of the Arlington Club membership and that the membership included no African Americans. In October 1989, citing a federal law banning discrimination on the basis of gender, the Portland City Council, led by Commissioner Earl Blumenauer, passed a unanimous resolution urging the Arlington Club and the University Club, another men-only club, to admit women. At the time, the Arlington Club had about 500 members and did not normally allow women inside its building. During the City Council meeting, five women, representing the Multnomah Bar Association, the Commercial Club of Portland, the Association of Black Lawyers, Oregon Women Lawyers, and the American Civil Liberties Union, testified that the clubs' discrimination barred them from business opportunities afforded to men. Representing the Oregon Eagle Forum, a woman, the only person testifying against the resolution, cited a constitutional right to assemble without government intrusion. In March 1990, the Arlington Club members voted 320 to 145 to allow women to join the club; 5 members abstained, and others of the 525 members did not vote. Since the ratio of \\"yes\\" to \\"no\\" votes was 68.8 percent, slightly more than the two-thirds supermajority required to change the club's rules, women, after 123 years of exclusion, were thereafter admitted. The club building was subsequently remodeled to add women's restrooms and a lounge, and women were officially allowed on February 11, 1991. , the Arlington Club still meets at its building on Southwest Salmon Street in downtown Portland.

Lederer subsequently opened Jerry's in 1946, and franchising began in 1957. Very similar to Big Boy restaurants, Jerry's was located in the Midwest and South. Following a sale of the company in 1990, some Jerry's restaurants were converted to Denny's by the new owners. As of 2012, only about a dozen locations, now called Jerry's J-Boy Restaurants, are still open in Kentucky and southern Indiana. At that time, there were also six Jerry's Restaurants in Oklahoma, Nevada and Arizona that were franchised or owned by Sunwest Restaurant Concepts, Inc.http://starpas.cc.state.az.us/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wsbroker1/corp- detail.p?name-id=L14955974 History Jerry Lederer, a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, had been inspired by the success of White Castle hamburger stands and decided to open his own hamburger stand named White Tavern Shop. The five-stool restaurant opened in 1929, in Shelbyville, Kentucky. White Tavern expanded during the 1930s, and by 1943, it had 13 locations in three states. Only two White Tavern locations remained following the effects of World War II rationing. In 1946, Lederer opened a 14-stool roast beef sandwich stand named Jerry's, in Lexington, Kentucky. At approximately the same time, Warren W. Rosenthal, a student at the University of Kentucky, rented an apartment in Lederer's home; they subsequently became friends, and Rosenthal joined the Jerry's Restaurants company in 1948. Rosenthal became the company's chief executive officer in 1957, and franchising began that year. Into the 1960s, the company expanded with a chain of drive-in restaurants. Rosenthal became the company president in 1963, following Lederer's death from a heart attack that year. As of 1965, the company had 53 locations in six states. As of the company's 40th anniversary in 1969, it had 67 locations, many of them in the Lexington and Louisville areas. The company was operated by the Lexington-based Jerrico, Inc., with Rosenthal as Jerrico's president. Jerrico operated 16 company owned restaurants, while the rest were franchised. Some White Tavern locations remained in New Jersey, but under different ownership. On May 1, 1990, Jerrico announced it would sell its 46 Jerry's locations to the Atlanta-based Great American Restaurants, the largest franchisee of Denny's. Great American Restaurants planned to gradually convert most of the Jerry's locations into Denny's. Following the sale, Great American Restaurants stated that it did not intend to convert the entire Jerry's chain into Denny's. By 1993, several Jerry's restaurants in Kentucky had been converted to Denny's.

The angle of the louvre blades is automatically adjusted according to their orientation to the sun. A naturally ventilated, full height atrium, on the southern side of the building, maximises natural light to each office level. The building also houses a childcare centre, two caf√©s and a basement car park for 96 cars. The large-scale aluminium sculpture at the top of the curving steps at the entrance on the corner of Bligh and O'Connell streets is by New York-based Australian James Angus.

In 1898 Graves found himself \\"financially embarrassed\\" and sold the hotel to William Dalgety Moore.  Convent  The property was purchased by the Catholic Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1901. The convent was formally known as Loreto Osborne, Claremont. A chapel and sleeping accommodation for the sisters were built in 1938 and in 1963 the old hotel building was demolished to make way for a new building. In 1963 the senior pupils from Loreto Nedlands were moved to the Claremont school, and in 1977 Loreto Osborne amalgamated with St. Louis boys' school to form John XXIII College. The school remained the senior campus of the College until the latter's move to Mount Claremont in 1986, and the site was subsequently occupied by the Western Australian International College. The convent buildings were demolished in 1990, with residential housing built on the location at 101-109 Bindaring Parade, Claremont. The high, 1937-built bell tower was rebuilt in 1991 using the original bricks, in William Street, Northbridge.

He became a general officer during the French Revolutionary Wars and held important commands during the War of the Second Coalition. He displayed a talent for leading cavalry formations, but proved less capable when given corps-sized commands. During the 1805 Ulm Campaign in the Napoleonic Wars, the French badly defeated his corps and forced it to surrender soon afterward. From 1806 to his death in 1821, he was the Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian cavalry regiment. Early career Born in Vienna on 2 August 1750 into a noble Saxon family, Riesch enlisted in the army of the Electorate of Saxony. In 1773 he switched to the Austrian army, joining the Chevauxleger Regiment # 1 as an Oberleutnant. He fought against the Prussians in the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778-1779\\\\. During the Austro-Turkish War he received promotion to Oberst (colonel) of the Nassau- Usingen Cuirassier Regiment # 14. On 18 August 1788, he distinguished himself in battle against Turkish cavalry on the Timi≈ü River in the Banat. Riesch married Theresia Josephine Koh√°ry in 1792. During the War of the First Coalition, he was wounded in action on 16 March 1793 at Tirlemont. In July of that year he received promotion to the rank of General-Major. In May 1794 he defeated a numerically superior force of French cavalry at Maubeuge. At the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794, he led a brigade in the 1st Column consisting of two battalions of the Austrian Samuel Gyulai Infantry Regiment # 32, three French √âmigr√© battalions in the Legions of Damas, B√©on, and Mathieu, and two squadrons of the B√©on Legion cavalry.Smith, p 86 Emperor Francis II raised Riesch to the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 4 March 1796. That year found him serving in the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and later under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour. Riesch led a small cavalry division in Archduke Charles' success at the Battle of W√ºrzburg on 3 September 1796. The Coburg Dragoon Regiment # 37, Kaiser Hussar Regiment # 2, and the M√ºnster Dragoon Regiment were placed under his orders.Smith, p 122 At the Battle of Neuwied, he and his cavalry ably covered the Austrian retreat after the French victory on 18 April 1797. War of the Second Coalition Riesch helped win the First Battle of Stockach on 25 March 1799 by leading a brilliant cavalry charge that overthrew Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's French cavalry reserve. For his Stockach exploit, he received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in August 1801. He again commanded a cavalry division under Olivier, Count of Wallis at the First Battle of Zurich on 4 June. On this occasion, he led 12 squadrons of the Nassau-Usingen Cuirassiers # 9 and the Mack Cuirassiers # 10.Smith, p 158 Battle of Hohenlinden In the 1800 campaign in southern Germany, Riesch again led a cavalry division under P√°l Kray at the Second Battle of Stockach on 3 May and at the Battle of Messkirch two days later. A string of Austrian defeats ended in an armistice that summer.Arnold, p 203 In the interim, the emperor appointed the youthful Archduke John of Austria to lead the army. A cavalry specialist, Riesch found himself in command of a corps containing infantry, cavalry, and artillery. When the armistice lapsed in November, both armies rapidly moved into contact. Riesch and Ludwig Baillet de Latour led their commands against the French divisions of Michel Ney and Jean Hard√ø in the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December. The Austrians succeeded in driving their enemies back in bitter fighting, but paid for the victory with 3,100 casualties.Arnold, pp 217-220Ebert, Ludwig Baillet de Latour-Merlemont. Arnold wrongly identifies Maximilien Baillet de Latour, but it was Ludwig. Two days later, Riesch's 13,000-man Left Column advanced against Jean Moreau's French army in the Battle of Hohenlinden. The 22,000-strong Left Center Column made rapid progress on the main highway while Riesch's men struggled along muddy forest trails in snowy weather. Because of the delay, Antoine Richepanse's flanking column passed across Riesch's front and crashed into the rear of Johann Kollowrat's Left Center column. Under the circumstances, Riesch might have punished the French soldiers, but he hesitated. After taking extra time to concentrate his column on the heights of Albaching, he unwisely proceeded to divide his force into a reserve and five task forces before advancing.Arnold, p 235 Riesch's men found themselves in a soldiers' battle amid woods and snow squalls, with the more aggressive French having the advantage. Charles Decaen's French division soon appeared on the scene to block Riesch's awkward attempts to break through to Kollowrat. Meanwhile, Richpanse, Ney, and Emmanuel Grouchy enveloped and crushed Kollowrat's isolated column. When Riesch heard of the disaster, he fell back. His own losses amounted to 900 men, and he brought off 500 French prisoners.Arnold, p 248 Badly shaken by the disaster, Archduke John ordered a rapid withdrawal to distance his troops from the French.Arnold, p 256 During the chaotic retreat after Hohenlinden, Riesch clashed with his French pursuers at Rosenheim on 9 December. Outnumbered 10,000 to 6,000, his troops suffered 600 casualties while inflicting only 110 losses on the French.Smith, p 190 He commanded the rear guard in an unsuccessful action at Schwanenstadt on 18 December. Catching his troops with their backs to a river, Richepanse's cavalry forced 700 Austrian horsemen to surrender.Smith, p 191 By the time Archduke Charles replaced his brother John in command, the army was practically a rabble. Both sides agreed to a truce on 25 December 1800.Arnold, pp 256-257 Afterward, John heaped blame on Riesch for his slow march on the morning of Hohenlinden, but this may be unfair because the French movements were also slow due to the miserable road conditions.Arnold, pp 253-254 Napoleonic Wars Battle of Elchingen from an engraving by Johann Lorenz Rugendas (1775-1826) At the start of the War of the Third Coalition, the Austrian high command assigned Riesch to command a corps in Archduke Ferdinand and Karl Mack von Leiberich's army in southern Germany. In September and October 1805, Emperor Napoleon I enveloped the badly-led Austrian army with a greatly superior army. In attempting to escape the trap, Mack sent Franz von Werneck's corps to the northeast of Ulm and ordered Riesch to cover his right flank.Rothenberg, p 92 Riesch occupied the villages of Ober- and Unter-Elchingen on the north bank of the Danube River. At the Battle of Elchingen on 14 October 1805, Marshal Ney's superior force attacked Riesch's 9,000 soldiers, drove them off the heights, and forced them back into Ulm.Chandler, Dictionary, p 139 During the battle, Riesch commanded two brigades under Daniel M√©csery and Johann Laudon, with 14 infantry battalions, 11 cavalry squadrons, and 12 artillery pieces.Smith, p 204 The main French attack came from the south, as Louis Henri Loison's division crossed a partly destroyed bridge over the river and went on to storm the Elchingen Abbey. Riesch fought back until a second French division approached from the east, when he ordered a retreat. Under pressure of cavalry attacks, Austrian morale collapsed and Riesch's command suffered very heavy losses.Young & Chandler, pp 376‚Äì377 A few days later, Mack surrendered with 27,000 men, including Riesch, at the Battle of Ulm.Chandler, Dictionary, p 453 In June 1806, he became the proprietor of the Reisch Dragoon Regiment # 6 and held this position until his death. In 1809, he commanded the Reserve, but missed all the battles of the War of the Fifth Coalition. He retired from the army in 1810. In 1812 he married the 21-year-old Amalie Adelheid von Sch√∂nberg, his first wife having died in 1803. He died at his splendid estate, Barockschloss Neschwitz in Saxony, on 2 November 1821.

Working for the Russian-American Company, Bolcoff was captured on shore by the Spanish in 1815. He quickly assimilated into the Spanish culture, and was given the name Jos√© Antonio Bolcof. Bolcoff traveled with Governor Pablo Vicente de Sol√°, acting as an interpreter. In 1822, Bolcoff settled in Branciforte and married Mar√≠a Candida Castro, grantee of Rancho Refugio. Bolcoff was alcade of Branciforte in 1833. In 1833, Bolcoff was granted the one square league Rancho San Augustin, and moved his family to the rancho and built an adobe. In 1839, Bolcoff replaced Francisco Soto as administrator of Mission Santa Cruz. In 1839, Bolcoff sold Rancho San Augustin to Joseph Ladd Majors. Joseph Ladd Majors (1806-1868), a trapper from Tennessee, came to California over the Santa Fe Trail with Isaac Graham in 1834. In 1838, Majors became a naturalized Mexican citizen and was baptized as Juan Jos√© Crisostomo Mayor. In 1839, Majors married Mar√≠a de los Angeles Castro (1818-1903), daughter Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Castro of Rancho San Andr√©s and a sister-in-law of Bolcoff. Over the next decade, Majors would use his naturalized status as the middleman for a series of land deals, obtaining land holdings in his name, and then leasing or selling the land back to his American partners. In 1841, Governor Alvarado granted Rancho San Agustin along with the abandoned Rancho Zayante to Mayor / Majors. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho San Agustin was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 180 ND and the grant was patented to Joseph Ladd Majors in 1866.Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 In 1852, Majors started selling Rancho San Agustin to Hiram Daniel Scott (1823-1886). Scott had come from Maine to California in 1846 as a crewman on a merchant ship, and jumped ship in Monterey. He left to try his luck as a miner during the California Gold Rush, and stayed to open a hotel in Stockton in 1850. Between 1853 and 1856, Scott brought his relatives from Maine to Rancho San Agustin. In 1856, Hiram Scott, went back to the gold mines, and his father, Captain Daniel Scott, took over the rancho. Scott sold to Joseph and Grace Errington in 1865. The Erringtons established the first dairy in Scotts Valley. Historic sites of the Rancho * Hiram D. Scott House Built by Hiram Daniel Scott in 1853.

Nova Topola has a population of 2,324 inhabitants. It was founded by German settlers. History The village was founded by 14 German settler families from northwestern Germany in 1879, one year after Bosnia came under Habsburg rule. They were joined by six more families in the following year and there was a steady trickle of more migrant families until World War I. These colonists named their settlement Windthorst. They introduced modern farming methods and were very successful and prosperous. Consequently the village grew into three distinct parts : Unterwindthorst, Mittelwindthorst and Oberwindthorst. Following a visit to the region by Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria a daughter-colony, named Rudolfstal, was established nearby in Bosanski Aleksandrovac. In 1918 Bosnia became part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and German immigration stopped. The village was also renamed at this stage as Nova Topola (literally \\"new poplar\\") in reference to a nearby village called Stara Topola (\\"old poplar\\"). Following the collapse of internal security during World War II the Nazis decided to evacuate the Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) population from Bosnia and a treaty to this effect was signed with the Usta≈°e regime on 30 September 1942. The Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi) organised an SS commando from Belgrade under Otto Lackman and \\"... went from village to village, accompanied by the military.\\"Valdis O.

The book was named to the bestseller list of the Washington Post, which in its review said Lipman \\"makes a powerful case for men to join with women to solve the persistent inequities on the job\\" and \\"offers dozens of examples of bold leaders taking a stand and engaging women to push forward a transformation. But she also piles on the evidence of a sustained gender gap so that inequities cannot simply be mansplained away.\\" That's What She Said was also the inaugural selection of the World Economic Forum for their WEF Book Club. Additional coverage of the book included Time, USA Today, Fortune, Forbes, Vanity Fair, Glamour, the New York Post and the London Sunday Times (a \\"must-read\\"). Lipman's television appearances for the book included CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and PBS, among others. In the UK, the book is published by Hodder and Stoughton under the title Win Win: When Business Works for Women, It Works for Everyone. It was named a best book of the month by the Financial Times.

Dise√±o del Rancho Refugio History As Mission Santa Cruz developed following its establishment in 1791, the coastal terrace lands to the north as far as Point A√±o Nuevo became the mission's main livestock grazing lands. Rancho Arroyo del Matadero (stream of the slaughtering ground ranch) was one of four mission cattle ranches strung along the coast.Jackson, R. H., & Castillo, E. D. (1997). Indians, Franciscans, and Spanish colonization: The impact of the mission system on California Indians, pp.102-103. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press. In 1839, the former ranch lands were granted to the three Castro sisters: Mar√≠a Candida, Jacinta, and Mar√≠a de los Angeles Castro. The three were daughters of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Castro (1768‚Äì1838), deceased grantee of Rancho San Andr√©s. Candida Castro married Jos√© Antonio Bolcoff in 1822. Bolcoff adobe at Wilder Ranch State Park, 2013. jpg Jos√© Antonio Bolcoff (1794-1866) was born Osip Volkov in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Siberia. Working as a fur trader, Bolcoff deserted a Russian ship at Monterey in 1815. He quickly assimilated into the Spanish culture, and was given the Spanish name Jos√© Antonio Bolcoff. Bolcoff acted as an interpreter for Governor Pablo Vicente de Sol√°. In 1822, Bolcoff settled in Branciforte and was alcalde in 1833. In 1833, Bolcoff was granted Rancho San Agustin, which he sold to Joseph Ladd Majors (1806-1868) in 1839. Majors married Bolcoff's sister-in-law, Mar√≠a de los Angeles Castro (1818-1903). Jacinta Castro lived with the Bolcoff family before joining the convent at Monterey. In 1839, Bolcoff replaced Francisco Soto as administrator of Mission Santa Cruz. Bolcoff's name is not mentioned in the original grant, but he took control of Rancho Refugio in 1841. Bolcoff transferred the title to Rancho Refugio to his two sons, Francisco Bolcoff and Juan Bolcoff. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Refugio was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 275 SD and the grant was patented to Francisco and Juan Bolcoff in 1860. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 A claim by Joseph Ladd Majors and his wife, Mar√≠a de los Angeles Castro, for one-third of Rancho Refugio filed with the Land Commission in 1852 was rejected.United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 286 SD In 1846, Moses A. Meder (often spelled Meader in public records) came by ship to San Francisco. Meder moved to Santa Cruz County and made a living building lumber mills and giving small loans on properties. In 1854, Meder foreclosed on Bolcoff's mortgage on an eastern portion of Rancho Refugio.Meador v Parsons,1861,Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, Volume 19, pp.294-299, Bancroft-Whitney Company Meder moved his family onto the ranch in 1859, on today's Meder Street. The western section of Meder's ranch, at the edge of the Santa Cruz city limits, is now the Moore Creek Open Space.Moore Creek Open Space Upon Bolcoff's death, his sons sold all their rights to a Charles E. Norton. By that time, perhaps twenty persons held claims for Rancho Refugio. In 1866, Meder took Norton to court to prove his claim on the eastern two-thirds of Rancho Refugio. The case of Meader v. Norton went all the way to the US Supreme Court. In 1870, the Supreme Court ruled that the grant was legally made to all three Castro sisters. The court found that \\"...the husband of one of the sisters, named Bolcoff, suppressed or destroyed this grant and fabricated a pretended grant to himself of the land, and also certain other papers intended to prove the genuineness of such fabricated grant.\\" The court further found that Meder did legally own a two- thirds interest in Rancho Refugio. Meader v. Norton, 1870, U.S. Supreme Court, 78 U.S. 11 Wall. 442 With enough of the legal issues resolved, John T. Fairbanks began buying up claims against the eastern two-thirds of Rancho Refugio in 1870. In 1871, Fairbanks sold his interest in Rancho Refugio to dairyman partners Levi K. Baldwin and Deloss D. Wilder. In 1885, the Baldwin Wilder partnership was dissolved, and the Wilder family moved onto the rancho. The Wilder family lived on and worked their land until 1969, when it was sold for residential and commercial development. Local opposition to this plan led to its purchase by the state in 1974, and the establishment of Wilder Ranch State Park.

John W, Priest, who resided and worked in the vicinity of Newburgh, New York, was one of only five architects approved by the New York Ecclesiological Society. His work is limited because of his early death in 1859, not because he was an unimportant architect. He mentored and later partnered with architect Henry M. Congdon, who had an extensive and well-documented career in church architecture after Priest's death. Two well-known and documented projects by Priest are modifications to St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Carey Street, Baltimore, 1857, and the new St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Goldsboro NC also in 1857. Both churches exhibit the high standards with careful proportions and detail espoused by the Ecclesiological Society. Priest's professional attributes and the work at St. Luke's are well documented by Phoebe Stanton's ‚ÄúThe Gothic Revival and American Church Architecture‚Äù published in 1968 by the Johns Hopkins Press.

Studies have suggested that the queens of this species may mate with more males and use sperm more evenly. The reason for this is not yet well understood. Taxonomy Synonyms V. flaviceps has been described by various other binomial names. A list of such names is presented below: *Vespula gracilia *Vespa saussurei *Vespa quadrimaculata *Vespula pionganensis *Vespa japonica *Vespa karenkona *Vespa lewisii *Vespa flavior Subspecies V. flaviceps has two subspecies. They are V. f. flaviceps and V. f. lewisii. Distribution and habitat V. flaviceps is native to Eastern Asia and Japan. It can be found most prominently on the Japanese Islands, but is also present in South Korea and the southern portion of Primorsky Krai. Its population may be threatened by invasive raccoons, which prey upon it during the summer and autumn. V. flaviceps is found in forests. During a two-year study in Japan, the species was observed to be one of the predominant species in the natural deciduous forests of northern Kanto. In 2001, it was officially recorded as one of the predominant species in this area, making up, along with two other species, 91% of all social wasps caught in a forest sampled. However, the same species was found to be much less abundant than Vespa species when attracted using a different bait. As food left V. flaviceps hive, showing larvae and pupae. The larvae are often consumed by humans. V. flaviceps is popular as food in Central Japan. All of its stages are consumed, but the larvae are considered a special delicacy. Small colonies may be collected and relocated into artificial hives near dwellings for the purpose of harvesting them for food. These colonies are sometimes even sheltered over the winter by humans, which benefits not only the humans but the wasps as well. This protection from the cold greatly helps their chances of survival. In some regions of Japan, V. flaviceps is eaten in a dish with rice. In the Chubu area (including Nagano, Gifu and Aichi), a dish in which the larvae are prepared in rice is considered a delicacy. This dish is eaten during special events, especially the autumn festivals. V. flaviceps may be prepared cooked, fried, or pickled. Larvae and pupae are often taken from nests and seasoned with soy sauce, sugar, and artificial seasonings. Recently, collection of this species from inside Japan for food has decreased, and importation from Korea has increased.

The quick success was short lived, as the club fell into financial difficulties, resulting in its leaving of the league after the 1987‚Äì1988 season. The club, though not very competitive, continued to exist thanks to the enthusiasm of a number of supporting players and fans. The club and Hockey in general in Bosnia and Herzegovina came into grim times in the 1990s due to the Bosnian War. In 1993 the home ice, Zetra, was destroyed. Thanks to HK Bosna, the BiH Ice Hockey Federation was formed that year. Zetra was rebuilt in 1998, and the club was quickly resurrected. Currently the club has both senior and junior sections.

It is chronologically the last installment of The Hunger Games series, following 2008's The Hunger Games and 2009's Catching Fire. The book continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, who agrees to unify the districts of Panem in a rebellion against the tyrannical Capitol. The hardcover and audiobook editions of Mockingjay were published by Scholastic on August 24, 2010, six days after the ebook edition went on sale. The book sold 450,000 copies in the first week of release, exceeding the publisher's expectations. It received a generally positive reaction from critics. The book has been adapted into a two-part movie, with the first part released on November 21, 2014 and the second part released on November 20, 2015. Inspiration and development Collins has said that the main inspiration for The Hunger Games series came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided to put an end to the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.Plutarch, Life of Theseus, 15. 1‚Äì2 Collins has said that there are also many parallels between the Roman Empire and the fictional nation of Panem. She describes the Hunger Games as \\"an updated version of the Roman gladiator games, which entails a ruthless government forcing people to fight to the death as popular entertainment.\\" Collins also explains that the name \\"Panem\\" came from the Latin phrase \\"Panem et Circenses\\", which means \\"Bread and Circuses\\" and refers to the strategy used by Roman emperors to appease the masses by providing them with food and entertainment (Juvenal, Satires, 10.81). As with the previous books in the trilogy, Mockingjay contains 27 chapters, with nine chapters in each of the three parts. This structure, which Collins had previously used in her series The Underland Chronicles, came from Collins's playwriting background. This \\"three-act\\" structure is also apparent in the trilogy as a whole; Collins stated that she \\"knew from the beginning\\" that she was going to write a trilogy. The cover and title information was revealed by Scholastic on February 11, 2010. The cover continues the previous books' theme on the symbol of peace. The novel's title comes from the hybrid birds of the same name that feature in the novels' storyline. As Publishers Weekly has stated, \\"the hybrid birds that are an important symbol‚Äîof hope and rebellion‚Äîthroughout the books\\". Collins likens Katniss to a Mockingjay because both \\"should never have existed\\". Plot After the events of Catching Fire, Katniss Everdeen, her mother, her sister Primrose Everdeen, mentor Haymitch Abernathy, and her friends Finnick Odair and Gale Hawthorne, along with the survivors from District 12, adjust to life in the underground District 13, headquarters of the rebellion in Panem. Katniss reluctantly agrees to act as \\"the Mockingjay‚Äù‚Äìthe symbol of the rebellion‚Äìfor rebel propaganda, on the condition that District 13 President Alma Coin grant immunity to all surviving Hunger Games tributes, including Katniss's friend Peeta Mellark and Finnick's lover Annie Cresta. Coin, however, insists on flipping for Katniss's other demand: the right to personally execute Panem President Coriolanus Snow. Peeta is tortured by the Capitol to demoralize Katniss. A rescue team extracts Peeta along with the other captured victors, but discover that he has been brainwashed to fear and despise Katniss. He attempts to kill her, and is restrained under heavy guard while medics seek a cure. Finnick and Annie marry in a propaganda effort. Katniss and Gale are sent to persuade District 2 to join the rebellion. Gale‚Äôs controversial strategy results in a decisive victory over District 2, enabling a final assault against the Capitol itself. Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent with a film crew to shoot propaganda. President Coin also sends Peeta, still dangerous and unpredictable; Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead for her lack of support and growing influence. While filming in a supposedly safe Capitol neighborhood, the team's commander Boggs is fatally wounded; before dying, he gives Katniss the team‚Äôs command. She decides to infiltrate the Capitol and kill Snow, telling her team that this was Coin's secret plan; she later reveals the lie, but the team sticks with her. In the ensuing urban warfare, many of Katniss's comrades, including Finnick, are killed. As the last of her squad reaches Snow's mansion, a hoverplane bearing the Capitol seal drops bombs among a group of children being used as human shields. Rebel medics, including Prim, rush in to help the injured children, and the remaining bombs detonate. Prim is killed, and Katniss sustains severe burns. As she recuperates, Katniss, deeply depressed over her sister‚Äôs death, learns the rebels have taken over the Capitol and Snow is to be publicly executed. She confronts Snow, who claims that Coin orchestrated the bombing to turn Snow‚Äôs remaining supporters against him. Horrified, Katniss realizes Gale had earlier proposed a similar tactic. She becomes convinced that, rather than establish a republic governed by representatives from each District, Coin intends to take Snow's place and maintain the status quo. Coin hosts a referendum for the remaining Victors to decide whether to host another Hunger Games for the Capitol children. Although three, including Peeta, are against the plan, Katniss, Haymitch and two others outvote them. Set to execute Snow, Katniss instead shoots Coin and immediately attempts suicide, but Peeta stops her, and she is arrested in the ensuing riot. Snow is later found dead, and Commander Paylor of District 8 takes over as president. Katniss is acquitted of murder by reason of insanity and sent home to District 12, while her mother leaves for District 4 and Gale leaves for District 2. Other District 12 natives later return, including Peeta, who has recovered his memories and his love for Katniss. She embraces him, recognizing her need for his hope and strength. Together, they write a book to preserve the memory of those who died. Though still suffering flashbacks and screaming nightmares, they manage to comfort each other. Twenty years later, Katniss and Peeta are married and have two children. Under Paylor's administration, the Hunger Games are abolished with the arenas replaced by memorials. Katniss is beyond joyful with her new life and her family, but still carries mental and emotional scars, and dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in the war and the Games. When she feels distressed, Katniss plays a comforting, repetitive game: reminding herself of every good thing she has ever seen someone do. The series ends with Katniss' reflection that there are much worse games to play. Themes Reviews have noted many themes in the previous books that are also explored in \\"Mockingjay\\". A review from The Baltimore Sun noted that \\"the themes of the series, including physical hardships, loyalty in extreme circumstances and traversing morally ambiguous terrain, are continued at an even larger scale.\\" In the book, Katniss must deal with betrayal and violence against people. At the same time, while she was symbolically touching thousands of lives, she must also lead those people into war. Finally, Katniss realizes she cannot even trust President Coin, leader of District 13. In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the series \\"tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war.\\" Collins replied that this inspiration was from her father, who, when going to war in Vietnam, made sure that his children understood the consequences and effects of war. Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor noted that it was \\"the most brutal of the trilogy\\" and that \\"Collins doesn't take war lightly ‚Äì her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics.\\" Katie Roiphe of The New York Times wrote that \\"it is the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world.\\" In a review for USA Today, Bob Minzesheimer pointed out that the novel contained optimism: \\"Hope emerges from despair. Even in a dystopian future, there's a better future.\\" Minzesheimer also noted a central question of \\"Real or not real?\\" which was asked throughout the novel by Peeta. Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times also pointed this out, writing, \\"Mockingjay takes readers into new territories and an even more brutal and confusing world: one where it's unclear what sides the characters are on, one where presumed loyalties are repeatedly stood on their head\\". Publication history Mockingjay was first released in the US and Canada on August 24, 2010. The UK, New Zealand and Australia received the book one day later, on August 25, 2010. The audiobook was released simultaneously on August 24, 2010 by Scholastic Audio. Sales The book had a 1.2 million-copy first printing that was bumped up from 750,000. In its first week of release, the book sold over 450,000 copies. Following this, Scholastic printed an additional 400,000 copies, bringing the initial print run up to 1.6 million. Scholastic Trade president Ellie Berger said that sales \\"have exceeded all expectations\\". The book has also been released in e-book format and topped sales in the week ending with August 29, 2010, beating out The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which had held the top spot since April. The other Hunger Games books have also made it in the top ten, with the first book at fifth and the second book taking eighth. , the book has sold over 9 million copies. Release Promotion To promote the release of Mockingjay, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The official event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot card reader, a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of Catching Fire and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read the first chapter of the novel, explaining that she would read with an accent since Katniss, the narrator, is from Appalachia. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign. Before the release, Scholastic also released a trailer for the book, launched a Facebook page that gained over 22,000 fans in 10 days, and held a contest for booksellers to win a visit from Collins and an online countdown clock to the release date. There were also advertisements for the book on websites such as Entertainment Weekly and Romantic Times. National Entertainment Collectibles Association also sold other goods such as T-shirts, posters, games and bracelets. Collins also held a \\"13-District Blog Tour\\" where 13 winners received a free copy of Mockingjay on August 24, 2010. A tour was also scheduled, starting at Books of Wonder in New York where the official party took place. The tour ended on November 6, 2010, in the Third Place Books store in Lake Forest Park, Washington. Critical reception Mockingjay has received generally positive reviews from critics. Some noted that there was a suspense drop between Catching Fire and the start of Mockingjay. Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ and said, \\"Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot\\". Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it \\"the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level\\". The review went on to praise the \\"sharp social commentary and the nifty world building\\". Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the book is exactly what its fans are looking for and that \\"it will grab them and not let go\\". Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times compared the battlefield to Iraq and said that the book is every bit as original as the first in the series, ending the review with \\"Wow\\". The Baltimore Sun Nancy Knight commented that the book \\"ends on an ostensibly happy note, but the heartbreaking effects of war and loss aren't sugar-coated\\" and that it will have readers thinking about the effects of war on society. Katie Roiphe of The New York Times said it is \\"the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world\\". However, she criticized that it was not as \\"impeccably plotted\\" as The Hunger Games. Bob Minzesheimer of USA Today gave the book three out of four stars. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp described it as \\"an entirely gripping read\\". While a review from The Sacramento Bee praised the action scenes and the battle in the Capitol, the reviewer also criticized Collins for not giving enough time to finish all the loose ends, writing that \\"the disappointment with Mockingjay hits primarily as Collins starts her home stretch. It's almost as if she didn't allocate enough time or chapters to handle all her threads\\". Film adaptation The Hunger Games trilogy was adapted into a series of films, with the stars of the 2012 film The Hunger Games signed on for all four films. Mockingjay was split into two parts; Part 1 was released on November 21, 2014, and Part 2 was released on November 20, 2015. Francis Lawrence, director of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, returned to direct the two final films in the series. Julianne Moore played President Coin.

Biography Robert D. Nesen was born January 22, 1918 in St. Louis, Michigan. He was educated at Tri-State College and the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute, receiving a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering in 1941. He worked for the Air-Research Corp. until 1942, when he joined the United States Navy, serving in World War II until 1946. Upon leaving the Navy, Nesen remained a member of the United States Navy Reserve, ultimately attaining the rank of Lieutenant Commander before retiring from the Navy Reserve in 1966. Upon leaving the Navy in 1946, he opened the Coast Aero Flying Service in Oxnard, California. Nesen started in the automobile business a few year later, opening an Oldsmobile car dealership in Oxnard. The dealership added Cadillac in the mid-1950s and then in 1971, moved to a new facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The business continued to grow in what became known as the \\"Thousand Oaks Auto Mall\\" and took on many more franchises; from Subaru and Hyundai in the 1970s and 1980s to high-end exotic brands like Rolls-Royce and Bentley in the 1990s. Governor of California Ronald Reagan appointed Nesen to the California New Car Dealers Policy and Appeals Board, and Nesen was elected as that organization's first president.

This was a single-engined jet fighter that used a flying wing structure with lateral engine inlets on each side of the nose. Wind tunnel tests began in 1953 as did testing of scale models at speeds up to . A full scale glider was built and made its first flight on 1 October 1954. Most unusually the pilot lay prone and looked out through the clear nose. Flight performance was deemed excellent and manufacture of a prototype powered by a Rolls-Royce Derwent V began in 1955. This engine was selected as it was readily available, but lacked the thrust desired for the fighter. The glider was modified with a normal cockpit in 1956. Shortly afterwards the program was split with the current aircraft becoming a subsonic trainer and a new, more powerful fighter, designated as the I.Ae. 48, with two podded engines under the wings and intended to reach Mach 2.2 (2,700 km/h). However, both projects were cancelled in 1960 as an economy measure, only a year before the I.Ae. 37 was to fly.

He is best known for his involvement with the Stonewall riots and as co-founder of the Danceteria.  Early life  Fouratt was raised in a working class Catholic home in Riverside, Rhode Island. He attended the La Salle Academy in Providence. After high school he was accepted into Harvard University but could not attend for financial reasons, instead he began studies at St. Peter's Seminary in Baltimore. In 1960, he was kicked out for homosexuality and moved to New York City. Activism Fouratt took up political activism more seriously in 1965, after being arrested in Times Square at America's first Anti-Vietnam War demonstration. In 1967 he was one of the organizers of the famous Central Park Be In. That same year he cofounded the Yippies, a youth-oriented countercultural movement, alongside Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krasner. Fouratt was at the first night of what he calls the Stonewall 'Rebellion', a term he prefers over \\"Stonewall Riots.\\" > I happened to be coming home from my job at Columbia Records. I saw a sole > police car outside of the Stonewall Inn. I was out in the New Left movement > and the anti-war movement and there was an incredible amount of > homophobia‚Äîin the old and new left. Like a good '60s radical, I went to see > why that car was there. There might have been 20 people around‚Äîthis was > 10:30 at night. On the third night of the rebellion, Fouratt co-founded the Gay Liberation Front, the first of many lesbian and gay liberation movements that sprouted across the country in the following months. Fouratt was a founding member of the Lesbian and Gay Community Service Center, the Gay Community Service Center, and Wipe Out AIDS (now known as H.E.A.L). He was active in ACT UP, serving on the media committee with Michael Signorile and Jay Blotcher. In 2009, Fouratt took part in the Democratic primary against City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. He claims to have raised $20,000 in two weeks, but later withdrew. In 2016, Fouratt ran for State Assembly but lost to Deborah Glick. He is a member of the Village Independent Democrats club.  Other Work   Music and nightlife  In 1969 Fouratt worked as an assistant to Clive Davis. In 1978, Fourrat became the manager for the club Hurrah where he brought in DJs to create the first \\"rock disco,\\" with music videos playing as well as live music acts.Shapiro, P.: Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco, page 256. Faber & Faber, October 2006. He also worked at the New Peppermint Lounge, Pop Front, and Studio 54. In 1980, he opened the nightclub Danceteria with Rudolf Pieper. In June 1982, the two became embroiled in a legal battle, and Fouratt was pushed out. In the early 1990s, he served as director of national publicity at Rhino Records, and from 1995 to 1999, Fouratt was the vice president of A&R; at Mercury Records. In the late 1990s, Fouratt attempted to launch the sub-imprint Beauty Records, but that project ended when PolyGram, Mercury's parent corporation, was bought by Seagram's, and Fouratt's acts were let go.  Journalism  Fouratt has been pop culture critic for Billboard and Rolling Stone and a contributing editor at Spin. Additionally, he has written for The Village Voice, The Advocate, Bay Area Reporter, and Gay City News. He is currently an editor for Westview News.  Acting  Fouratt studied for seven years with Lee Strasberg in the early ‚Äô60s. Fouratt was a member of the Open Theater, and performed at Caf√© Cino and La MaMa. He joined Actors Equity and made his Broadway debut in The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake. He worked with the National Shakespeare Theatre in Cambridge.  Personal life  In 1969, Fouratt asked his lover Peter Hujar to take a photograph for a Gay Liberation Front recruitment poster. The image is now one of the most iconic of the gay liberation movement. > Hujar‚Äôs boyfriend at the time, Jim Fouratt, arrived on the scene to organize > for the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), the first political group to cite > homosexuality in its name. Hujar agreed to make a photograph for a GLF > poster. The poster, portraying a jubilant group of GLF members under the > slogan COME OUT!!, appeared in late spring 1970 in advance of the gay > liberation march that marked the first anniversary of Stonewall. Fouratt has faced criticism for his comments on transgender identities and transsexualism, which he views as a method \\"to make gay men and lesbians straight.\\" He believes that transgender identity reinforces gender stereotypes and that trans discourse is marginalizing the experiences of cis gays and lesbians. However, in a 2015 Facebook post, he wrote \\"I support the right of each person to control their body. Period. Fighting the conscription of socially policed gender behavior is an essential fight.\\" In 2009, when asked by Stephen Colbert if there was a leader in the gay community on par with Martin Luther King Jr., Fouratt said \\"Well, I would like to think that I'm that leader.\\" Fouratt previously lived with Carl Miller, Allen Young, and Giles Kotcher in the Seventeenth Street commune.

She was known for her eccentric behavior. Early life The Biltmore Estate in 2006 Cornelia was born at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina on August 22, 1900. She was the daughter, and only child, of George Washington Vanderbilt II (1862‚Äì1914) and Edith Stuyvesant Dresser (1873‚Äì1958). Her father, the youngest child of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa (n√©e Kissam) Vanderbilt, built a 250-room mansion, the largest privately owned home in the United States, which he named Biltmore Estate. The estate, designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt, was modeled on the Chateau de Blois among other chateaux of the Loire Valley. She was the great-granddaughter of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, and, on her mother‚Äôs side, she was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant. After her father's death in 1914, Cornelia inherited the Biltmore estate. Her mother sold approximately of the Biltmore property to the United States Forest Service to create the core of Pisgah National Forest. Her mother later married Peter Goelet Gerry (1879‚Äì1957), a United States Senator from Rhode Island. Cornelia attended the Madeira School for high school. She was privately tutored and attended the University of North Carolina for approximately a year. When she reached 21 years old, she received an annuity of $2,000,000 and at the age of 25, she received her full inheritance of $50,000,000 from her father. Personal life On April 29, 1924, Cornelia was married to a British aristocrat who was then the first secretary of the British Embassy in Washington, Hon. John Francis Amherst Cecil (1890‚Äì1954), the son of Lord William Cecil and Mary Cecil, Baroness Amherst of Hackney. The Cecils were descendants of William Cecil. The nationally-renowned organist from St. Louis Charles Henry Galloway played organ at the wedding. They divorced in 1934, Cornelia Vanderbilt and Cecil were the parents of two sons: * George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil (b. 1925), who married Nancy Owen (1930‚Äì2016). * William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil (1928‚Äì2017), who married Mary Lee Ryan (1931‚Äì2017), a first cousin of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, as their mothers, Janet Norton Lee and Marion Merritt Lee, were sisters. Around 1932, reportedly finding life at Biltmore too dull, she moved to New York City to briefly study art, leaving her husband to manage Biltmore. A few months later, she moved to Paris where she divorced her husband in 1934, dyed her hair bright pink, and changed her name to Nilcha. After her 1934 move abroad, she never returned to Biltmore or the United States again. After Paris, she moved to London, where she met and married Captain Vivian Francis Bulkeley-Johnson (1891‚Äì1968) in October 1949. Bulkeley-Johnson, the aide-de-camp to the 9th Duke of Devonshire when he was the Governor General of Canada from 1916 to 1918, served in the offices of the Imperial War Cabinet in World War I and in the Air Ministry. They remained married until his death in 1968. One evening as she was having dinner with Edward Adamson in London, Cornelia met William Robert \\"Bill\\" Goodsir, their waiter with whom she fell in love. In 1972, Cornelia married for the third and final time to Goodsir (1926‚Äì1984), who was 26 years younger than she was. Cornelia died on February 7, 1976, aged 75, in Oxford, England. Her ashes were buried at a church near her home, The Mount, a farm in the village of Churchill in Oxfordshire, near Kingham. Legacy Her sons eventually inherited the Biltmore estate, with George Cecil, the older of the two sons, choosing to inherit the majority of the estate's land and the Biltmore Farms Company, which was more profitable than the house at the time. The younger son, William Cecil was thus left with Biltmore House, and is credited with preserving the chateau which (though still privately owned) is open to the public. Through her elder son, she was the grandmother of six, and through her second son, she was the grandmother of two more. References Further reading *Vanderbilt, Arthur T. II.

A wireless version, conforming to Japanese wireless frequency regulations was available within Japan only. The Miburi's belt unit, ‚ÄúMBU-20‚Äù, processes data from the sensors into MIDI pitch and velocity information. The unit can be programmed to interpret the data using three ‚Äòtrigger‚Äô modes: ‚ÄòCross-point‚Äô mode; ‚ÄòStop‚Äô mode and ‚ÄòAll‚Äô a combination of both modes. ‚ÄòCross-point‚Äô mode measures the speed of the transducer‚Äôs flexion asit traverses its zero point (when the flex sensor is straight). The six ‚Äòflex‚Äô sensors send 12 notes ‚Äì this is because they measure inward and outward movement of each joint as separate notes. ‚ÄòStop‚Äô mode sends note and maximum velocity values at the conclusion of a gesture. ‚ÄòAll‚Äô interprets sensor data in both modes simultaneously.Yamaha Corporation, ‚ÄúMiburi R3 Manual.

Each sensor can be mapped on the synthesizer unit, ‚ÄúMSU-20‚Äù, to any MIDI note, interpreted in any of the three modes outlined above according to 48 different response modes. The response modes (preset by Yamaha) define the manner in which the sensor‚Äôs output is graphed to velocity.

Evaluation of the Miburi  These features make the Miburi extremely effective as a computing input device. However the Miburi‚Äôs synthesizer unit is limited in its possibilities as a sound source and more importantly is only able to process gestures in a direct one-to-one relationship to the sounds they produce. The need to ‚Äòtether‚Äô the Miburi to its synthesizer unit is also clearly a drawback for movement detection and a restriction for the dancer. However, the Miburi has the robust design, and very predictable sensor output that might be expected from one of the principal electronic musical instrument manufacturers.

Produced nearly exclusively in a school bus configuration, the Wayne Lifestar used a transit-style body configuration with a front-engine chassis. Marking the return to transit-style production (after an absence of over a decade), the Lifestar adopted the single-piece body stampings of the Wayne Lifeguard in its construction. Wayne Corporation manufactured the Lifestar from 1986 to 1992 at its Richmond, Indiana facility. Following the closure and liquidation of Wayne Corporation, Wayne Wheeled Vehicles manufactured the product line from 1993 to 1995 in Marysville, Ohio.  Overview and development  In the late 1960s, Wayne Corporation produced a rear-engine transit-style school bus similar to other major school bus manufacturers. As Wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build the chassis in-house, it sourced its rear-engine chassis from Chevrolet. When General Motors discontinued its Chevrolet/GMC rear-engine bus chassis production in 1973, Wayne was forced to end production of its transit- style school bus in favor of the Lifeguard conventional introduced that year. Beyond 1973, all transit-style buses from Wayne became special-order vehicles for military and GSA (federal government) purchases with chassis outsourced from other manufacturers; the transit-style buses were too expensive to produce at a competitive price as a school bus. As the 1970s became the 1980s, the school bus industry was in a period of relative turmoil: along with the struggling economy, fewer Americans were school-age than in years past. Innovation and low cost were key to attracting school bus orders. To do so, Wayne Corporation was necessitated to develop a transit-style school bus that could be sold at a lower purchase price; for larger fleets, their higher capacity theoretically allowed for fewer buses per students transported. Named Lifestar, the new vehicle would feature the continuous longitudinal interior and exterior panels of the Lifeguard for the sides and roof, both for safety and for parts commonality.  Prototype development  Identification of an appropriate chassis design from an outside supplier to meet engineering, volume, and cost considerations was essential to the project and the future of Lifestar. In the prototype stage, Wayne developed both front- and rear-engine versions of the Lifestar, as the majority of manufacturers (with the exception of Ward, Crown Coach, and Gillig) offered both configurations. At the Welles plant in Canada, where many Wayne experimental projects had been done over the years, a rear-engine prototype was constructed, while a front-engine prototype was constructed in Richmond. The final decision was to produce the Lifestar only in the front-engine body style, primarily for cost considerations. The front-engine bus program proved more successful than rear-engine development efforts, and saw production with several different chassis. The initial production run of Lifestars were of a front engine (FE) design; production began in 1986. A rear-engine model would have been more costly than a front- engine model, and likely would have achieved lower production volumes. Competitors in that market were the Thomas Saf-T-Liner ER and Blue Bird All American RE. Each bus was a premium product; although Thomas built its own chassis for the Saf-T-Liner ER at the time the Lifestar was introduced, production volume for the All American RE was low enough that Blue Bird outsourced its rear-engine chassis until 1988. First generation (1986‚Äì1990) When introduced for 1986, Wayne Corporation selected the all-new General Motors S7 front-engine bus chassis; Lifestars would wear Chevrolet and GMC steering wheels and would be serviced at the respective dealerships. The standard powertrain was a Chevrolet 366 6.0L gasoline V8 according to 1987 GMC Chassis Brochure, with a Detroit Diesel 8.2L diesel V8 in either naturally aspirated (\\"Fuel Pincher\\") or turbocharged configuration. Unlike most transit- style school buses, the body of the Lifestar was designed with flat front bodywork and a two-piece flat windshield (to lower replacement costs). From its launch, the S7 product line was plagued with supply problems; along with the Lifestar, it underpinned similar products from Carpenter and Ward/AmTran. In 1989, Wayne suffered a setback when General Motors announced discontinuation of the unprofitable S7 product line. As a temporary solution, one of the larger Wayne bus dealers, Milton H. Smith, a truck and bus dealer and school bus contractor based in Plaistow, New Hampshire, began to import chassis from South Korea. Essentially gliders with an American-sourced powertrain (a Caterpillar 3208 diesel and an Allison MT643 automatic), the chassis were fitted to the Lifestar with redesigned engine covers to fit the larger Caterpillar engine. Branded \\"Asia-Smith\\" chassis, the venture was ultimately not well-received in U.S. markets and many sat at Wayne's Indiana plant for an extended time awaiting body orders. Due to the supply issues of the GM S-7 affecting other manufacturers, some surplus Asia-Smith chassis were sold off to other manufacturers to be fitted with bus bodies; some were purchased by Ward/AmTran (for the Ward President) and from short-lived startup New Bus Company from Oklahoma (for the New Bus Chickasha FE). Second generation (1991‚Äì1992) For its 1991 production, Wayne Corporation was forced to update the Lifestar; the supply of S7 chassis had run out and Caterpillar was discontinuing the 3208 engine in the United States, leaving the Asia-Smith chassis without an engine. In addition, the introduction of the Blue Bird TC/2000 and the Thomas Saf-T-Liner MVP series introduced new competition for the Lifestar. To adapt, Wayne replaced the S7 chassis with the International 3900FC, introduced in 1990. Although Wayne would have to share the 3900 with Ward, Carpenter, and Canadian bus manufacturer EMC/Corbeil, it was a reliable source of chassis production. The new chassis required modifications to the Lifestar's bodywork; the most visible changes were a 4-piece wrap-around windshield, quad headlights, and a change in the placement of the entry door. The powertrain included an International DT360 or DT466 inline-6 diesel with an Allison automatic transmission. This generation of the Lifestar was only produced for two years, as Richmond Transportation Corporation, then the parent company of Wayne, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Wayne Corporation was liquidated and sold. Wayne vs. AmTran Other body manufacturers also expressed interest in the 3900, and AmTran (still selling buses bearing the Ward brand name) developed a product based upon it, the Ward Senator (which later evolved as the AmTran Genesis); however, AmTran was also working on a rear-engined model using the 3900 components to be fully assembled at its Conway, Arkansas plant utilizing Navistar mechanical components; this saw production as the 1996 AmTran RE. The rear-engine concept promised substantially lower costs than chassis assembled at the Navistar plant at Springfield, Ohio, and in comparison, would put the Wayne Lifestar with the Springfield chassis at a significant price bidding disadvantage in the marketplace. Third generation (1993‚Äì1995) After Richmond Transportation Corporation's bankruptcy filing and liquidation in 1992, Wayne was sold to Harsco Corporation and began to do business as Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (WWV). After relocation to Marysville, Ohio, Lifestar production resumed at the end of 1992. One major change to the Lifestar that happened during this transition was the change of chassis supplier from Navistar to Crane Carrier Corporation. Unlike the previous supplier change, few changes were made to the Lifestar's body inside or out; aside from the removal of the Navistar-supplied components, it is difficult to distinguish a 1990-1992 Lifestar from a post-1992 version. 1993-1995 Lifestars are powered by a Cummins 5.9L diesel inline-6 and an Allison automatic transmission. Model Discontinuation For the 1988 model year, competitor Blue Bird introduced its TC/2000, a Type D model much less costly than its famous All American, which had always been marketed as a premium product offered with front engine and rear engine models. AmTran officials projected that by middle of the 1990 model year, the TC/2000 alone was projected to capture a full 10% of the U.S. school bus market. Wayne continued to struggle for market share in 1990. In mid-June 1990, the Welles plant in Canada was closed. In early 1991, Navistar International announced that it had purchased a one third of AmTran, the manufacturer of Ward school bus bodies, and one of Wayne's long-time competitors. This was seen by many industry observers as an ominous sign for Wayne's future, as Navistar was its largest supplier of both conventional and Type D chassis. Wayne had no major alliance to guarantee a source of chassis, nor any in-house capacity to do so. In August 1992, Richmond Transportation Corporation (RTC) was forced to declare bankruptcy. Assets were sold by a federal bankruptcy judge at auction that fall. Wayne, essentially in name only, lived on as Wayne Wheeled Vehicles until 1995 under different ownership.

The incident involved three US Navy warships (the sloop-of-war , the screw steamer , and the gunboat ) and three German warships (the gunboats and and the corvette ), which kept each other at bay over several months in Apia Harbour, which was monitored by the British corvette . The standoff ended when the 1889 Apia cyclone, on 15 and 16 March, wrecked all six warships in the harbour. Calliope escaped the harbour and thus survived the storm. Robert Louis Stevenson did not witness the storm and its aftermath at Apia but after December 1889 arrival to Samoa, he wrote about the event.

Remembered mostly as \\"El Grande Milovan\\", the nickname he earned for his excellent saves in the game that Yugoslavia won against Brasil in the First World Cup in Uruguay 1930 FIFA World Cup. He is considered as one of the major contributors for Yugoslavia reaching the semi- finals in that tournament.

Despite all the competition that he faced for the national team goalkeeping place, Jak≈°iƒá was selected to be the main goalkeeper at the 1930 World Cup. Having displayed magnificent exhibitions in all the matches at the tournament, it is specially remembered by his contributions in the match against Brazil, and it was after that match, that the delighted journalists started calling him by his new nickname: \\"El Grande Milovan\\".

The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on February 11, 2010. Elizabeth Banks, Jon Hamm, Shinnerrie Jackson, Douglas Rees, Horatio Sanz, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters guest star in this episode, and there is a cameo appearance by musician Jon Bon Jovi. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) schedules a dentist appointment on Valentine's Day to avoid feeling lonely on the holiday. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) meets a successful and attractive CNBC host (Banks). Elsewhere, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is frustrated when her stalker (Sanz) finally loses interest. \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\" was generally, though not universally, well received among television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 6.004 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.8 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. For his work in this episode, Matt Hubbard received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series. Plot TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon is due for a root canal. To avoid feeling lonely on Valentine's Day, she schedules her surgery for that day, but soon realizes she will need someone to escort her home from the dentist's office due to the aftereffects of anesthesia. She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, but all of them have Valentine's Day plans and cannot help. When Liz calls the dentist's office to say she does not have anyone to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all. alt=Jon Bon Jovi, a caucasian male in his mid-40s with dark blond hair, wears a black suit and white shirt with a black bow-tie. He is seen with a black acoustic guitar strapped across his stomach. Jack Donaghy, who is Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, makes an appearance on the fictional CNBC show The Hot Box. During the appearance, Jack interacts with the show's host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), with the two flirting during the broadcast. Avery and Jack share Republican viewpoints, and she asks him out for a drink after the show, which he accepts. They eventually embark on a number of both successful and unsuccessful dates. During one of those dates, Jack invites her to a TGS VIP party he has hastily staged, whereupon he enlists the help of Jon Bon Jovi‚Äîat the time NBC's real-life Artist in Residence‚Äîto come over and talk to them, in an effort to impress the successful Avery. When Bon Jovi approaches them, though, Jack disregards him due to his own intriguing conversation with Avery, which impresses her even more. After the TGS party, the two go back to Jack's apartment and end up sleeping together. Elsewhere Jenna begins to worry that her stalker, Maynard Roger Hoynes (Horatio Sanz), has lost interest in her. Jenna tracks down Maynard and her suspicions are confirmed, after he tells her that his therapist encouraged him to stop his obsession with her and move forward. Later, in the 30 Rock building, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) finds Jenna upset in her dressing room. She tells him why she is in that state and shows him letters that Maynard sent to her in the past. Kenneth, however, is confused as to why Jenna misses her stalker, leading her to reveal that Maynard has been the longest relationship she has ever had. The next day, Jenna enters her dressing room and sees that her picture is inscribed with the words \\"I want to eat your boogers.\\" Jenna is touched to find that Kenneth is responsible for the graffito, and thanks him for his thoughtfulness. On Valentine's Day, Liz goes to her dentist appointment and tells the receptionist that she did not sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz. Production \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\" was written by 30 Rock supervising producer Matt Hubbard and directed by Ken Whittingham.

She wears her blonde hair up in a ponytail. In December 2009, it was confirmed that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest star on the show, and in this episode, she played right-wing CNBC anchor Avery Jessup, and love interest to Alec Baldwin's Jack Donaghy. In an interview with Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello, Banks revealed that she approached the show's staff about making an appearance on the show. \\"I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true.\\" She said that on her first day on set she \\"begged\\" producers if she could use a teleprompter‚Äîin which she is first introduced in the episode on the set of her show The Hot Box, with her interviewing Jack and another guest (Douglas Rees)‚Äîso that she could deliver her lines quickly, explaining that her fast delivery would help \\"sell\\" the comedy and her 30 Rock character. They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks \\"throwing fastballs at [Baldwin] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster than we were doing it.\\" Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having \\"too much fun\\" making movies to commit to a television show full-time. According to a February 2010 report in the New York Post, after the airing of this episode, the Avery character was based on CNBC news anchor Melissa Francis, and it was Francis who \\"pitched\\" the character to a 30 Rock producer. Banks, however, denied this report, calling it \\"false\\". In October 2009, it was reported that musician Jon Bon Jovi would serve as the first artist in NBC's brand new \\"artist in residence\\" program. In a November 25, 2009, appearance on NBC's The Today Show, Jon Bon Jovi explained that his band (Bon Jovi) had released a new album, The Circle, and that for two months the group would be making appearances on a wide range of NBC broadcast and cable channels to promote it. On 30 Rock, Jon Bon Jovi played himself and his title as artist in residence was referenced, in which he appears as a contestant on the Bravo cooking reality television series Top Chef, and is later shown strumming the NBC Nightly News theme. Actors Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters reprised their roles, respectively, as Drew Baird, Floyd DeBarber, and Dennis Duffy; former boyfriends of Liz Lemon (Fey). In the final scene of \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\", in which she is still under the after effects of anesthesia, Liz \\"sees\\" Drew, Floyd, and Dennis speak in Jamaican accents, however, the three men are really three Jamaican dental assistants. In regards to the accent, Hamm said in an interview \\"That was given to me literally the day before we shot it. They were like, 'We wrote some more stuff, so we'll see you tomorrow.' I was like, 'Okay, how much more can it be? Oh great, it's a completely different take, awesome.'\\" Comedic actor Jason Sudeikis, who appeared in this episode as Floyd DeBarber, was at the time a main cast member of Saturday Night Live (SNL). Additionally in this episode, Horatio Sanz, who played Maynard Roger Hoynes‚ÄîJenna Maroney's stalker‚Äîhas also appeared in the main cast of SNL. Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. Cultural references The name of \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\" is based on Liz's hatred of Valentine's Day, for which she substitutes \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\", a fictional holiday celebrating the real February 14 birthday of Woman's Civil Rights leader Anna Howard Shaw. Liz tells Jack that she does not watch CNBC, a business news channel, but that she gets all her money advice from a fictitious cartoon character, Foxy Moneybags, on PBS. While confronting him, Jenna asks Maynard if the dog who gives him his orders has died, a reference to the Son of Sam killer allegedly being commanded to kill by a neighbor's possessed dog. As he does not stalk her anymore, Jenna asks Maynard if he is stalking \\"one of those kids from Glee\\", the latter being a Fox program that focuses on a high school show choir. During his appearance on The Hot Box, Avery asks Jack what his favorite movie is with him responding that it is a tie with The Fountainhead (1949) and Uncle Buck (1989). During her hallucination, in which she sees Drew, Dennis, and Floyd, Liz confesses to Dennis that watching the period drama The Color Purple with him drunk \\"was one of the funnest nights of my life.\\" The character Astronaut Mike Dexter was referenced in this episode, in which Liz tells the dental receptionist that she did not sign the liability waiver as her \\"boyfriend\\" Mike Dexter would come and take her home. Liz considers the character to be her imaginary perfect husband. The character was first introduced in \\"Sun Tea\\", in which \\"Dot Com\\" Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretended to be Mike Dexter, Liz's \\"crazy black boyfriend\\", after she planned to get her roommate out of his apartment with Dot Com's help, but her plan backfired. In \\"Dealbreakers Talk Show\\", Liz's imagination of Mike Dexter was played by actor John Anderson, in a scene where Liz fantasizes about what her life would be like following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter that he has to go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season, but near its end Liz decides her infatuation with him is pathetic and \\"breaks up\\" with him in a dream; along with her S4 finale meeting of a pilot played by Matt Damon and her brusque breakup with and dismissal of an annoying anti-love interest played by Michael Sheen; this sets the stage for Liz Lemon to be portrayed as much less of a loser from Season 5 through the series finale. Reception alt=Matt Hubbard, a caucasian male with curly blond hair, wears a black sweater with a white shirt under. He smiles and looks to his right. In its original American broadcast, \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\" was seen by 6.004 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings. The show claimed a 2.8 rating/7 share among viewers aged 18 to 49, meaning that 2.8 percent of all people in that group, and 7 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was an increase from the previous episode, \\"Verna\\", which was watched by 5.93 million American viewers. Matt Hubbard received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, but lost it to Modern Familys Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd for their work on the pilot episode. In December 2010, Hubbard received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\". In reviewing the best television programs of 2010, The A.V. Club named 30 Rock number 18 and cited this episode as amongst the best of the year. The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin enjoyed Elizabeth Banks' appearance, writing that she played her character \\"perfectly\\" and hoped she returned to the series.

B. Macaulay Thomas Bassett Macaulay, also known as T. B. Macaulay, (6 June 1860 ‚Äì 1942) was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He was a noted actuary of his era, a philanthropist; and was the founder of the Macaulay Institute, in 1930. It has been estimated that most of the world's Holstein cattle descend from Macaulay's herd. Background Thomas Bassett Macaulay was the son of Barbara Marie Reid and the Scottish-born Robertson Macaulay (1833‚Äì1915), who emigrated to Canada in 1854. The family were descendants of the Macaulay family of Lewis, and were patrilineal descendants of the 17th century Uig folk-hero Donald Cam Macaulay. Robertson Macaulay married Barbara Marie Reid, and moved his family to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, when he was offered a position there with Sun Life Assurance Company. He joined as a secretary in 1874; by 1889, he had worked his way up to president. Life Thomas Bassett Macaulay graduated high school and joined Sun Life at the age of 17. For the next 40 years he worked for the company as actuary (aged 20), secretary, managing director (46), president (55). He served as president for 20 years, before his retirement as chairman. Macaulay was a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain. He was one of four Canadian charter members of the Actuarial Society of America. In 1899, he became the first Canadian to be president of the society; as well as its youngest president, at age 39. When he died in 1942, Macaulay was also the longest surviving charter member. Macaulay represented the actuaries of both Canada and the United States at the International Congresses, held in Paris and Berlin, in the years 1900 and 1906. He was also a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, president of the Canadian Life Assurance Officers' Association, and president of the Canadian West Indian League and became an honorary president of the Navy League of Canada. In 1915 he became president of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. Commemorative corner stone of the Sun Life building. In 1914 he became one of the inaugural fellows of the American Statistical Association.List of ASA Fellows, retrieved 16 July 2016. In 1917, he was the chairman of the National Committee on Food Resources, he also was the governor of the Montreal General Hospital, as well as the Fraser-Hickson Institute public library in Montreal. Macaulay created a fund of ¬£10,000 to assist the seafaring people of his father's hometown, Fraserburgh, Scotland. He also gave ¬£10,000 to research into animal breeding at the University of Edinburgh. He gave money to the public library on the Isle of Lewis, erected a wing in the Island's hospital and established the Macaulay Experimental Farm. In 1930, he funded the purchase of , to establish the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research. Macaulay received an honorary degree from the University of Aberdeen, and McGill University, and the town of Stornoway made him the first freeman of the burgh in 300 years. Holstein herd Many of the world's Holstein cattle descend from Macaulay's herd. It has been stated that most of the world's pure-bred Holstein cattle descend from Macaulays herd, raised on his farm in Quebec. Macaulay and farm manager, Joe Chandler, bought a bull named \\"Johanna Rag Apple Pabst\\" (also known as \\"Old Joe\\"), for $15,000. The bull sired 51 bulls and 44 cows; after Macaulay's death in 1942, the herd was dispersed and went on to produce most of the pure-breds in the world. For his work as a breeder and farmer and his devotion to the advancement of agriculture in the province of Quebec, Thomas Bassett Macaulay was posthumously inducted to the Agricultural Hall of Fame of Quebec in 1992 Family In 1881, Macaulay married Henrietta M. L. Bragg, from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Bragg was the niece of US Confederate Army general Braxton Bragg. The couple had one son, followed by three daughters, and finally another son. One of their children was Frederick Macaulay, best known for his work on bond durations.https://www.sfu.ca/~poitras/mac1.pdf Macaulay had two later marriages. In 1912, he married Margaret Allan of London, England; in 1920, he married Margaret Palin of Gloucester, England. He did not have any children in his later two marriages.

Cerling (b. 1949) is a Distinguished Professor of Geology and Geophysics and a Distinguished Professor of Biology at the University of Utah. Cerling is a leading expert in the evolution of modern landscapes including modern mammals and their associated grassland ecologies and stable isotope analyses of the atmosphere. Cerling lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. :\\"A single hair can determine a person's location during the past weeks or even years\\" ‚Äì Thure E. Cerling Cerling's research interests are primarily focused on Earth surface geochemistry processes and on the geological record of ecological change. Particularly, working on conservation biology, Cerling has analyzed the modern animal diet and physiology by using stable isotopes as natural tracers as well as studying dietary changes of different mammalian lineages extending over millions of years. Emphasizing continental ecologies of lakes and modern soils and ecosystems, Cerling has written extensievely about the evolution of ecosystems, the inception and strengthening of monsoons, and the atmosphere over geological time scales through evidence gathered about the fractionation of stable istopes in these systems. Current research work includes a focus on the development of landforms in semi-arid regions, the geology of Old World paleo-anthropologic sites and on contaminant migration in surface and ground waters, including the use of tritium and helium as hydrological tracers.  Early life  Thure E. Cerling received his Bachelor of Science degree in geology and chemistry from Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa, in 1972, and, in 1973, his Master of Science in geology from Iowa State. In 1977 he was awarded a Ph.D. in geology from the University of California at Berkeley. From 1977 to 1979 he worked as a research scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and, from 1979 he has been a member of the University of Utah's faculty.  Global ecological changes  With the publication of \\"Expansion of C4 ecosystems as an indicator of global ecological change in the late Miocene\\" in 1993, Cerling, helped by Yang Wang and Jay Quade, made relevant studies relatively to carbon isotopes. Thanks to a deep analysis of palaeovegetation from palaeosols and palaeodiet measured in fossil tooth enamel, was demonstrated a global increase in the biomass of plants using C4 photosynthesis between 7 and 5 million years ago. The decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the history below a threshold that favored the C3-photosynthesizing plants was considered as a valid reason for the global expansion of C4 biomass. The publication \\"Global vegetation change through the Miocene/Pliocene boundary\\" in 1997 confirmed these results, demonstrating even how at lower latitudes the change appeared to occur earlier because of the threshold for C3 photosynthesis is higher at warmer temperatures.  Give me a hair and I'll tell you where you have been.  Thure Cerling and James Ehleringer, a biology professor at the University of Utah, founded Isoforensics in 2003, a company with the aim of interpreting the stable isotope composition of various biological and synthetic materials. This was the first step for the discovery they made which was first published on February 25, 2008, by the \\"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\\" with the title \\"Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in human hair are related to geography\\". To know where people have been and where they lived for a while are information that became available by analyzing the stable isotope composition of their scalp hair. Cerling discovered that a strand of hair could provide valuable clues about a person's travels by studying the variation of hydrogen-2 (Œ¥2H) and oxygen-18 (Œ¥18O) isotopes and comparing them to the ones in the drinking water. The extent of the information that can be deduced depends on the length of the hair: the longer is the hair, the greater is the extraction of information. The variation with geography of isotope concentrations is linked with precipitations, cloud temperatures and with the amount of water that evaporates from soil and plants. When clouds move off the ocean towards inland the ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 and hydrogen-2 to hydrogen-1 tend to decrease because of the rain water with oxygen-18 and hydrogen-2, being heavier, tends to fall first. Samples of tap water were collected from more than 600 cities across the United States as well as hair samples from the barbershops in 65 cities in 20 states. The comparison showed that both hair and drinking water samples had the same isotopic variations. In order to display these information, the scientists produced color-coded maps based on the correlation of the isotopes in hair to those in drinking water. This maps show how ratios of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in scalp hair vary in different areas of the United States. It was so proved that the water drank by a human being leaves in the hair an evidence which contain oxygen and hydrogen isotopes equal to the ones in the tap water. This technique would have been a new tool for policemen, anthropologists, archaeologists and doctors.  The elephant tail hair: how many things they can say!  Professor Cerling, helped by James Ehleringer and Christopher Remien (two University of Utah colleagues), George Wittemyer of Colorado State University and member of \\"Save the Elephants\\" in Nairobi, and Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who founded the association \\"Save the Elephants\\", conducted a research around the Samburu and Buffalo Springs national reserves in northern Kenya analyzing carbon and other stable isotopes in elephant tail hair to discover where and what Victoria, Anastasia and Cleopatra, three daughters of a mother elephant named Queen Elizabeth, usually eat over a six-years period (2000‚Äì2006). In order to monitor their life, the elephants were equipped with a Global Positioning System that recorded their positions every hour for the whole research period. For getting the sample of tail hair, elephants were immobilized with drug- filled dart guns when necessary. Considering that the hair grows about an inch per month, a single hair contained isotopic information to diet during an 18-month period.  Wet and dry seasons: different responses  The analysis of ratios of carbon-13 to carbon-12 along the length of a single elephant hair led Cerling and his crew to understand the elephants' diet. During the wet season, after the grass had grown long enough for elephants to grab with their trunks, their tail hair showed the presence of different form of carbon, indicating a high amount of high-protein grass. On the other hand, during the dry season, the results obtained by the analysis of the hair pointed out how elephants had switched over to shrubs and trees.  Birth and Cattle  For what concern the Samburu-Buffalo Springs, five weeks after the rainy season had started, the grass became rich in nutrients and the females were most likely to conceive, giving birth 22 months later, just in time for another rainy season to provide nutrients to the grass they would have eaten: the cycle could restart. The research also pointed out how developed is the competition between elephants and cattle: during the typical wet season diet of elephants, the overgrazing by cattle caused the grass to be very short, resulting in a limited access to it for elephants, out-competing them. This situation could have influenced the elephants' ability to bulk up for pregnancy.  Behavior  All these analyses pointed out even that there are some elephant families friendlier than others and showed how there are dominant families that settle down in the best places, where there is plenty of food and water.

The library formally opened on April 4, 2008.  Mission statement  \\"The John Spoor Broome Library enhances the CI mission of interdisciplinary, international, multicultural, and service learning through active collaboration with students, faculty, and staff to plan, implement, promote, and access the use of collections and services and support student learning via its robust information literacy program.\\" History Timline Wiki.PNG|A timeline for the John Spoor Broome Library The John Spoor Broome Library is a new building that incorporated some of the original but renovated buildings that were part of the former California State Mental Hospital. The project involved the demolition of the former Administration building and the modification of the Receiving and Treatment center to make room for the new facility. Architecture Second floor, mverlooking Main entrance The John Spoor Broome Library was designed by the British architect Norman Foster. The executive architect was Leo A. Daly's Los Angeles architecture firm. The library is the only \\"modern\\"-style building on campus, while the other buildings are of Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. It features a naturally lit \\"buffer zone\\", which separates existing and new structures. The surrounding environment is showcased in 360-degree views. It consists of two separate pieces: the physical structure itself and the canopy above, which extends from the plaza over the library and is anchored to the foundation through eight steel posts visible in the Reading Room. The Reading Room features a thermally insulated glass canopy. In the plaza, the canopy is louvered, thus filtering light through the plaza, while not allowing the sun to make direct contact with the book stacks. The stacks are visible from any vantage point. Just outside the main doors is the Reflection Pool. The library serves as a direct axis point through campus, both north & south and east & west. According to the Channel Islands university website, the John Spoor Broome Library is 137,000 square feet, in three stories, and cost $56 million. There are two main floors in which there are computers, books, tables and classrooms. The third floor is an outdoor study area. The construction required 7,000 cubic yards of concrete, 300 tons of structural steel, 600 tons of rebar and 40,000 square feet of glass. The architect is Gruen Associates, of Los Angeles. The construction firm was PCL, Los Angeles. Donors The John Spoor Broome Library was named after the Ventura County philanthropist who donated $5 million to the project. Broome, a sportsman, pilot, farmer and rancher in Ventura, Kern, and Monterey counties, had made the gift anonymously, solely out of a sense of joy over the opening of a long-delayed four-year institution in Ventura County. Only later did the university president, Handel Evans, convince him to permit the celebration of the gift, and only then because they thought it might help motivate another potential donor, said to have been Broome's friend Martin V. Smith. Smith later donated an identical amount to the business school that now bears his name. The university is on part of the Rancho Guadalasca Spanish land grant that had belonged to Broome's grandfather. Robert J. Lagomarsino, an Ojai resident and U.S. congressman from 1974 to 1993, and his wife Norma, donated $1 million for the new library. The donation was to be used to bolster archives and special collections and host an annual lecture. Archives The John Spoor Broome Library holds a few archives that are available to its students as well as the general public. Two archives of importance include the Robert J. Lagomarsino Federal Collection and the Camarillo State Hospital Collection.  Robert Lagomarsino Collection  Biography As noted by archivist Evelyn Taylor at CSUCI, Robert J. Lagomarsino, a Ventura County native, represented the counties of Ventura and Santa Barbara by serving as a California state senator from 1961 to 1974 and as a United States representative from 1974 to 1992. These years coincided with the time in which both Governors Brown and Reagan were active. During his service as a United States Congressman, Lagomarsino was a member of two major House Committees: the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. He was also asked by the House Leader to chair a task force to analyze and develop recommendations to the system of selection of standing committee assignments, the Committee on Committees. Collection In this collection, all of Lagomarsino's services to California are documented. The collection not only contains documents on Lagomarsino and early Ventura, but also original furniture, artifacts, signed photographs, and other memorabilia from government officials and celebrities. Additional original archival material includes documents reporting information on the Watergate scandal, the Challenger space shuttle incident, and original signed letters from the Nixon and Bush administrations. As a whole, the collection reflects the conflicts and changes of the time, and also displays Lagomarsino's contributions to Ventura County. This contribution in particular was the introduction of Senate Bill Number 70 which requested a state university for Ventura County (now CSUCI). The Lagomarsino Collection not only benefits students and scholars interested in politics or history, but also provides valuable primary resource material for such areas of study as agriculture, economics, education, environment, civil rights, crime, family concerns, foreign affairs, health interests, labor law, trade, transportation, and veterans' affairs. Camarillo State Hospital Collection History According to archivist Evelyn Taylor from CSUCI, the State of California purchased the former Lewis Ranch from agriculturists Adolpho Camarillo and Joseph P. Lewis, to build the Camarillo State Hospital in 1929. George McDougall was immediately put in charge of the State's architectural plans. In 1933 the hospital began accepting male patients, who in the beginning, were held in the former Lewis Ranch farmhouse. The hospital was eventually reconstructed under the WPA to accommodate both male and female patients. In 1936, it emerged as the largest mental hospital in the world. Between 1947 and 1957, the hospital rapidly grew, incorporating men, women, and children of all ages, eventually reaching over 7,000 patients at its peak. By 1967, the hospital was treating illnesses such as schizophrenia, manic depression, organic brain disease, autism, and birth defects, and would later successfully address drug and alcohol abuse. Its early years were rather isolated from the outside world, sustaining the hospital community using its own farms; butcher; shoe maker, dairy; ice house; schools; and hospital, police, and fire departments. In time, various services that promoted social interaction were established, such as a bowling alley, swimming pool, clothing store, petting zoo, beauty parlor, and hamburger shop. A new law regarding involuntary treatment of mental patients was put into action in 1969. The law required judicial review of every patient who was held against their will for an extended period of time, which in turn, led to the decrease of mental patients at the hospital. However, in 1983, a new approach was put into action. Discoveries of new drugs that would help the mentally disabled lead normal lives were uncovered and the hospital began to utilize these innovations. A new mission statement emerged as the hospital, now under the Department of Developmental Services of the State of California, addressed both mental and developmentally disabling illnesses: \\"Enhancing independence through innovation\\". The hospital now focused on treating patients with the intention of releasing them successfully back into society. After a long and successful treatment record, the hospital closed its doors to the public on June 30, 1996 due to lack of patients and cost per capita. Collection The Camarillo State Hospital collection consists primarily of documents, photographs, and unique artifacts. Many collection items are direct work-product items created during the hospital's tenure, until its closing in 1996. The material is classified by date (1836‚Äì2007) and general topic (e.g. treatment).

Sh≈çtei blended Western realism with the delicate colours and washes of the Kikuchi Y≈çsai school, introducing a new approach to kach≈çga or kacho (bird-and-flower painting).  Biography  Born as Yoshikawa Yoshimata, he was later adopted by the family of his father's literary friend, Watanabe Mitsue. His early studies were at age sixteen under Kikuchi Y≈çsai (1788‚Äì1878) after which he spent a brief time in the studio of the painter and lacquer artist, Shibata Zeshin (1807‚Äì1891). In 1878 he travelled in the United States and Europe, remaining in Paris for three years and becoming the first Nihonga artist to live in Europe with the aim of studying Western painting. Travel abroad was extremely difficult for Japanese artists in the early Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912), and it is unknown how Sh≈çtei managed this. A few years earlier, in 1875, he had produced designs for an export company, which may have provided him with the necessary contacts. His works have enjoyed great popularity in the West, and a large number are to be seen in both European and American collections.https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/w/watanabe_sh%C5%8Dtei,_swallows_on_a.aspx Summer.

Bell started to work on a local paper while she was in college, and used to write to publicists at record labels. After moving to New York City, she went on to work with Sean Combs. Together they wrote and produced tracks for Jennifer Lopez. Following the release of Lopez's album, Bell became known as a songwriter and producer, working with several artists, including Britney Spears, Girls Aloud, Mary J. Blige and Paulina Rubio. Biography Michelle Bell was born in Ohio. She said that while she was in college, \\"I became a junior reporter with a local paper writing about people who grew big tomatoes or had a church band. It was pretty boring stuff but I used the letterhead from the paper to write to publicists at record labels. The entertainment editor wasn't interested in the concerts and stories. I was so I was able to attend many great shows and interview my favorite artists. I met tons of people through the paper so when I moved to NY from Ohio it was easier to get jobs.\\" Bell stated that she was always inclined to work on the music business, commenting that \\"being ambitious, savvy and slightly obnoxious is how I think you make it as an anything in the entertainment business.\\" She first worked with Sean Combs, who was dating pop singer Jennifer Lopez at the time. After Bell's song was presented to Lopez, the latter recorded the track. Bell said that she \\"shared a lot,\\" with Lopez and that, \\"it was fun, we wrote a funny song about something that happened with her assistant. It started from a beat that went terribly wrong. Not for the album but just for fun.\\" Bell then went to work with several artists such as Mary J. Blige and Paulina Rubio over the years. In 2002, the producer started to work with Britney Spears on her fourth studio album, In the Zone. Together they wrote and recorded several tracks, including \\"Chaotic\\", \\"Like I'm Falling\\", \\"Look Who's Talking Now\\", and \\"Money, Love, & Happiness\\". \\"Britney Spears was awesome. She actually surprised me because she can play the piano. She's down to earth and very nice. She hides it but I think people can tell she's a real artist. I hope someday she gets to bring that side of herself out more. We had a nice time working,\\" commented Bell about the songwriting and recording process with Spears. \\"(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun\\", another track recorded by Spears and later released on Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (2004), was featured on the soundtrack of the 2011 film Bridesmaids. Bell later worked with producer Peter Wade Keusch. Together, they formed a music production duo, and worked for artists such as 88-Keys and Lindsay Lohan. They worked together on an album called The Mystery LLP. It was slated for a release on the second quarter of 2008; the album, however, is yet to be released. Bell currently lives in New York City. Reception Bell's songs were mostly well received by contemporary critics. One of her tracks she wrote with Britney Spears, \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\", was considered by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic as better \\"[than] most of the songs that were featured on [In the Zone],\\" while Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody said the song \\"is on a level with her best work, namely 'I'm a Slave 4 U'.\\" Bell's tracks included on Jennifer Lopez's album Brave (2007) received mixed to positive reviews, with \\"I Need Love\\" being considered as a \\"nice enough uptempo groove. Still, it's not something you'll be rushing to hear a second time ‚Äî a sentiment that summarizes most of 'Brave'.\\" \\"Morning After Dark\\", a track co-wrote with Timbaland, was considered as \\"catchy\\" by reviewers, with its hook receiving positive appreciation. However, Jennifer Lopez's \\"Come Over\\" did not impress critics, with Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly saying, \\"'Come to my room for a little game.‚Ä¶ I'll do very erotic things', she breathes on 'Come Over', [...] the most embarrassing satin sheet anthem since, oh, Sylvia's 'Pillow Talk'.\\" The song received comparisons to earlier works of Janet Jackson.

Construction of the tower lasted from June 1999 to November 2001. It is the second-tallest building in the city (after the Cathedral), the second- tallest in North Rhine-Westphalia (after the Post Tower in Bonn), and the twelfth-tallest in Germany. Because of the tower's location near Cologne's MediaPark, it is home to several media sector companies. The observation deck and restaurant, located on the 30th floor, were opened to the public in June 2006.  Architecture  The reinforced concrete building was built in cooperation between the architectural firm Kohl & Kohl and Parisian architect Jean Nouvel. It contains a suspended centre core and the edge between floors to Pendelst√ºtzen. The floor plan of the tower is divided into three areas, with an mast to the upper end. The glass facade of the building was designed with reflected light in mind. Pictures of the Cologne Cathedral and the skyline of Cologne's Old Town were applied to the glass via screen-printing. Depending on light exposure, different combinations of these images appear on the building.  Transmitter  From the antenna on top of the tower, three FM frequencies are broadcast mainly for the northern districts of Cologne: 98.6 MHz/0.4 kW WDR 2 Regionalfenster Cologne, 87.6 MHz/0.3 kW WDR Eins Live, and 89.9 MHz/0.03 kW Germany Kultur. Despite the low power levels, the height of the antenna allows all frequencies to transmit to the northern suburbs. In 2002, the Cologne Tower replaced the former FM transmitter site on the nearby Hansahochaus on Hansaring.

None of its members ever attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, and the gens is known primarily as a result of its long association with the rites of Hercules, and for a catastrophic plague that was said to have killed all of its members within a single month, at the end of the fourth century BC. However, a few Potitii of later times are known from literary sources and inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 514 (\\"Potitia Gens\\"). Origin The story of the Potitii is inextricably intertwined with that of the Pinarii. According to legend, Hercules came to Italy a generation before the Trojan War, and was received by the families of the Potitii and the Pinarii. He instructed them in a form of worship by which they honoured him for generations. The priesthood of this cult was carried out exclusively by members of these two families, as a sacrum gentilicium‚Äîthe sacred duty of a particular gens.Livy, i. 7.Dionysius, i. 38‚Äì40.Macrobius, iii. 6. Michael Grant suggests that the worship overseen by these families was originally introduced to Italy by the Phoenicians, and was devoted to one of the Phoenician gods, who afterwards became assimilated with Hercules.Grant, Roman Myths. The position of the Potitii in this cult was superior to that of the Pinarii, who were excluded from partaking of the entrails of the sacrifice, supposedly because they had arrived late to the sacrificial banquet given by Hercules. The two families are said to have carried out their religious obligations for centuries, as hereditary priests of Hercules, until the period of the Samnite Wars, at the end of the fourth century BC. Destruction In 312 BC, Appius Claudius Caecus, during his censorship, attempted to persuade the Potitii and the Pinarii to instruct the public slaves in these rites. The Pinarii refused, but the Potitii accepted Claudius' offer of 50,000 pounds of copper.Livy, ix. 29. Niebuhr explains that Claudius' intention was to introduce the worship of Hercules, formerly sacra privata, into the religion of the Roman state, thus making them sacra publica. However, because no flamen could be appointed for a foreign god, it was necessary to entrust the rites to slaves.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. i. p. 88, vol. iii. p. 309.G√∂ttling, Geschichte der R√∂mische Staatsverfassung, p. 178. For their impiety, Hercules sent a plague that carried off the entire gens in the span of thirty days; twelve families and thirty grown men perished, and Claudius himself was struck blind, which is how he obtained his cognomen.Festus, p. 237, ed. M√ºller.Valerius Maximus, i. 1. ¬ß 17.Servius, Ad Virgilii Aeneidem, viii. 268.Macrobius, iii. 6.Hartung, Die Religion der R√∂mer, vol. ii. p. 30. There is some uncertainty as to the chronology of this legend; Claudius could hardly have been blinded during his censorship, as he went on to be consul in 307, and again in 296 BC, and was then nominated dictator in 292 and 285. Niebuhr suggests that the Potitii may instead have died in a terrible plague that struck Rome in 292. The disappearance of an entire gens was extraordinary; together with the fact that no magistrates or other important Potitii are mentioned in surviving records, this has led some historians to suspect that they were not in fact a distinct gens, but instead a branch of another patrician family that became extinct around the period of the Samnite Wars, such as the Valerii Potiti, whose surname, Potitus, might have been mistaken for a nomen, Potitius. However, the ancient historians unanimously describe the Potitii as a gens. There are also a few indications that some Potitii survived the destruction of the gens. Cicero mentions a Publius Potitius who lived in the first century BC, and others are known from inscriptions.Cicero, In Verrem (second oration), i. 50‚Äì58. In popular culture The Potitii are the focus of the novels Roma and Empire, by Steven Saylor. These novels follow the history of Rome, up to the reign of Hadrian, and concern the fortunes of the Potitii and Pinarii, through the passing down of a family heirloom. As depicted by Saylor, the Potitii who suddenly died were in fact murdered, a clever and ruthless killer poisoning them one by one and never being discovered.

She was the daughter of Count Stephen of Spanheim. Jutta, instead of entering the convent at an early age, became an \\"anchoress,\\" a symbolic \\"anchor\\" for the world to God, and thus she closed herself for life in a one-room shelter, with only a small window through which food was passed in, and refused to be taken out. This hut was next to the Benedictine monastery on Disibodenberg, where she was abbess. She tutored several female pupils from wealthy families and they lived with her in her hermitage. She taught and raised them all, but most notably the child Hildegard of Bingen. On the Day of All Saints, 1 November 1112, Hildegard was given over as an oblate into the care of Jutta of Sponheim, who was only six years Hildegard‚Äôs elder. Jutta was also related to Marchioness Richardis of Stade, the mother of Hartwig, Archbishop of Bremen and of Richardis, who was intimate friends with Hildegard. Jutta taught Hildegard to write; to read the collection of psalms used in the liturgy; and to chant the Opus Dei (‚Äòwork of God‚Äô), the weekly sequential recitation of the Canonical hours. She probably also taught Hildegard to play the zither-like string instrument called the psaltery. Jutta was a severe practitioner of asceticism, including penitential self-flagellation. She wore a chain under her clothes, prayed barefoot in the extreme cold of a German winter, and refused the allowed (and even encouraged) modifications to the Benedictine diet for those who were sick. As an adult, Hildegard would teach moderation. Hildegard succeeded Jutta upon her death in 1136. Hildegard's other well-known teacher is the monk Volmar.

As a mockbuster distributed by The Asylum, it attempts to capitalise on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Clash of the Titans.Dread Central - The Asylum Breeding a Mega Piranha Plot Adrian Sinbad is a millionaire owner of an oil company and is from a long-line of descendants of great mariners. He and a small group of people fly to the Indian Ocean after learning that his oil rig has sunk after being taken over by Somali pirates. The helicopter becomes trapped in a thunderstorm and Sinbad refuses to go back, ignoring the pleas of his pilot. The helicopter crashes into the sea and he is washed ashore, Sinbad later battles a giant crab and meets up with his surviving crew, Gemma and Whitaker as well as Mehrak, the leader of the Somali pirates, and Atash, the oil tanker's captain and his crew member. Sinbad also encounters Loa, a female warrior living on the island. Loa tells Sinbad that he must fulfill a long- forgotten pledge and become a warrior to save the world from catastrophe from Elmec Ishu, a supernatural force that is angered by the oil spill after Sinbad's rig is sunk. The island suddenly experiences a violent earthquake, and the group then plunges into the sea, the island is actually the back of an enormous but harmless sea creature and they are attacked by a flock of large flying reptiles (called Rocs in the film), they take them back to their nest to be fed to their young. Meanwhile, Simon, the CEO of Sinbad's company, takes over while Sinbad is missing. The group manage to fight off a Roc and flee their nest, but a crew member is devoured by a young Roc. They flee to a cave, which is home to a club-wielding Cyclops. Whitaker checks out the inside of the cave, but is ultimately killed and possibly eaten by the Cyclops. Sinbad blinds the Cyclops and later trips and impales him by a stalagmite. When night falls, the men are seduced and hypnotized by some Sirens, and are to be eaten by them. Loa and Gemma prepare to kill the Sirens when it is darker, so that they can avoid getting hypnotized by looking into their eyes. But unfortunately, Gemma is hypnotized by a Siren and devoured. Loa kills all of the Sirens as they are preparing to devour the men, and Sinbad finishes off their queen. Later Sinbad and his companions enter a small village, called 'Utopia', where all those who are stranded join. Loa realizes her father is the leader of the 'Utopia' and Sinbad, Mehrak, and Atash are forced to fight each other. Atash is shot by one of them after Mehrak refuses to kill him. Sinbad tries to convince the people that he knows a way to escape, but one of them says he's lying, Loa kills the man and a fight is started between those who want to join Sinbad and those who want 'Utopia'. Mehrak is injured and fights gallantly but is killed seeing her father get injured. while trying to distract them while Sinbad and Loa escape. Sinbad knows that he must retrieve otherworldly crystals in a mountain, in order to escape the island and lowers himself down, and retrieves the crystal and kills a demon residing in the mountain with explosives. Sinbad and Loa learn that the crystal produces steam when in contacts with water after her father died. They use an old hot-air balloon and use the crystal to power the balloon, and find a ship and call for help, Loa is missing but the ship crew manages to find her. Sinbad and Loa head back to his company and uses his mini submarine to head into the sea to bring the oil rig to surface while Elmec Ishu unleashes his wrath on the city by summoning deadly water spouts, Simon is killed after sabotaging Sinbad's mission. The submarine is confronted by a giant squid, but it does not attack them, the oil rig is successfully raised and Elmec Ishu stops his rampage and appears, and commands the squid to bring the submarine to safety.

Along with Ivan Me≈°troviƒá and Antun Augustinƒçiƒá, he is considered one of the three most important Croatian sculptors of the 20th century. His most widely known work is the statue of Nikola Tesla installed at the Niagara Falls State Park, United States, an identical copy of the monument residing in front of the building of the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade (Serbia). Biography Kr≈°iniƒá was born in 1897 in the village of Lumbarda on the Adriatic island of Korƒçula in south Croatia, which was at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was born into a family with a long tradition of stonemasonry, and he was also trained at the local stonemasonry school before going on to attend the stone-working and masonry school in Ho≈ôice (in present-day Czech Republic) in 1912. Upon graduation in 1916 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, where he studied in the classes of renowned Czech sculptors Josef V√°clav Myslbek and Jan ≈†tursa and graduated in 1920. He then returned to Croatia and settled in Zagreb, where he worked as a freelance sculptor before becoming a teacher of sculpting at the Academy of Fine Arts Zagreb in 1924. By the late 1920s his individual expression was formed, away from the mainstream of Art Deco and the overwhelming influence of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. In this period his style and sculptural elegance took shape through a number of works defined by soft lines in closed forms such as Awakening, Diana, Young Woman Tending a Rose, Reading, After the Bath and others. In the following decades Kr≈°iniƒá devoted himself to works marked by finer chiseling in marble, mostly of female art nudes and motherly motifs, such as sculptures titled Meditation, Mother Feeding a Child, etc. In 1947 he was made master sculptor and head of the sculpting workshop at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1948 he became a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In his last decades Krsinic created numerous small format sculptures which varied the theme of the young girl, as well as art nudes. Works such as Worry, Sunbathing and Resting are said to represent perfection in the softness of sculpting in marble. He retired from teaching in 1967 and in 1975 he stopped sculpting.

It is non-trivial to assess user experience since user experience is subjective, context-dependent and dynamic over time.Law, E., Roto, V., Hassenzahl, M., Vermeeren, A., Kort, J.: Understanding, Scoping and Defining User Experience: A Survey Approach. In Proceedings of Human Factors in Computing Systems conference, CHI'09. 4‚Äì9 April 2009, Boston, MA, USA (2009) For a UXA study to be successful, the researcher has to select the right dimensions, constructs, and methods and target the research for the specific area of interest such as game, transportation, mobile, etc. Dimensions There are many different dimensions to consider when choosing the best assessment approach: * Goal: Summative (on the final product) or formative (during the process) * Approach: Objective or subjective * Data: Quantitative or qualitative * Granularity: Momentary, episodic, or overall UX * Setup: Lab or field Laboratory experiments may work well for studying a specific aspect of user experience, but holistic user experience is optimally studied over a longer period of time with real users in a natural environment. Constructs In all cases, however, there are certain aspects of user experience that researchers are interested in (measures), and certain procedures and techniques used for collecting the data (methods). There are many measures and some high-level constructs of user experience that can be used as the basis for defining the user experience measures, for example: # Utility: Does the user perceive the functions in the system as useful and fit for the purpose? # Usability: Does the user feel that it is easy and efficient to get things done with the system? # Aesthetics:Moshagen, M. & Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 68 (10), 689‚Äì709. Does the user see the system as visually attractive? Does it feel pleasurable in hand? # Identification: Can I identify myself with the product? Do I look good when using it? # Stimulation: Does the system give me inspiration? Or wow experiences? # Value: Is the system important to me? What is its value for me? To properly evaluate user experience, metrics and other factors surrounding a study need to be taken into account, for example: * Data (metrics): The time taken to complete a task. * Scale (metrics): Indicators that show effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. * Other Factors: Conditions of use, the surrounding environment and other human factors. Methods An individual method can collect data about a set of specific constructs of user experience. For instance, usability testing is used to collect data about usability construct. Methods also differ if they are to measure a momentary or episodic experience (i.e., assessing how a person feels about a specific interaction episode or after executing a task) or an experience over time, also known as an longitudinal experience. UXA methods can be classified in three categories: implicit, explicit and creative methods. The measures and methods for these categories are described below. Implicit methods Implicit methods of UX research focus not just only on what the users say, but also on what the user cannot express verbally. Many available tools can assist in the implicit evaluation, in particular to gather implicit or objective data. When available, UX researchers utilize state of the art equipment to uncover all aspects of the experience. Examples of implicit evaluation methods and tools: * Eye tracking * Attention tracking * User tracking * Task and reaction measurement, galvanic skin response or skin conductance * Electroencephalography (EEG) * Observation studies: participant observation where observers monitor the participant's reactions such as facial and other gestures, the tone of voice or other body language cues Explicit methods Explicit methods of UX research explore what the user is consciously aware of getting them to reflect on their own feelings or thoughts, and gather their views and opinions. An important aspect of explicit methods includes usability testing and emotion evaluation. Emotion assessment When investigating momentary user experiences, we can evaluate the level of positive affect, negative affect, joy, surprise, frustration, etc. The measures for emotions are bound to the methods used for emotion assessment, but typical emotion measures are e.g. valence and arousal. Objective emotion data can be collected by psychophysiological measurements or by observing expressed emotions. Subjective emotional data can be collected by using self-report methods, which can be verbal or non-verbal. Examples of emotion assessment methods: * Psychophysiological emotion measurements aim to identify emotions from physiological changes in muscles (e.g. face), pupils, skin, heart, brains, etc. * Expression * Think aloud protocol can be used for reporting emotions (real-time verbal self-report) * Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (retrospective verbal self-report) * Geneva emotion wheelBaenziger, T., Tran, V. and Scherer, K.R.

(snapshot non-verbal self-report) Creative methods Equally important to implicit and explicit methods are the creative methods that the user researcher can utilize in order to bring together the design team's view, as well as the target market's dreams, aspirations and ideas of optimal design. These activities are more open and allow people to either co-create with the engineers/designers, or to use their imagination to express their ideal system. Examples of creative assessment methods * Co-design activities * Creativity workshops * Paper prototyping, wireframing, mind mapping * Card sorting * Personas Longitudinal In contrast to identifying a momentary emotion, longitudinal UXA investigates how a person feels about a system as a whole, after using it for a while.

In German UPA e.V., Usability Professionals 2012 - Tagungsband (pp. 90-94). identifying the relevant product factors for holistic user experience Areas of UXA research Transportation Automobiles have come a long way since their beginning in the late 19th century. One of the major things that have helped automobiles to provide more safety and convenience is electronics. With the advances in technology and electronics, car manufacturers have been able to offer a wide variety of services and conveniences. From the creation of the electronic fuel injection to the popular global positioning system found standard in many cars today, the auto industry has revolutionized the way people travel from place to place. Understanding how people interact with vehicles today, what contributes to a great driving experience, what is their current relationship with the car, what placement does it have in their lives, is key to the development of these technologies. This information ensures user-centered design practices to generate cohesive, predictive and desirable designs. Once specific design concepts and ideas are on the table, UXA researchers further explore how people react to them regarding desirability, findability, usefulness, credibility, accessibility, usability and human factors metrics. Outcomes of this work includes user requirements, concept validation, and design guidelines. Researchers have conducted intriguing research to answer questions such as: could an In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system with a speech evoked personality change your relationship with your car?,Jennifer Healey and Dalila Szostak. 2013.

Additionally, workshops and gatherings of researchers around the world take place to discuss current evaluation techniques and advance the field of experience research in the area of transportation. An important professional venue for this work is AutomotiveUI, the International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications. UXA methods for transportation As with other UXA's the method chosen has a lot to do with the outcome desired and where the project is in its design cycle. Given that, methods are selected best suited to the research problem which most times ends up being a combination of implicit, explicit and creative. Some methods include: * Interviews: both structured and un-structured. * Diary studiesLallemand, C.

Taliefero grew up with a musical family, performing rhythm and blues with her brother in the Chicago metropolitan area. During her college years she was discovered by John Mellencamp, who helped guide her to a career as a professional musician. Taliefero performed with several artists throughout the 80s and 90s. In 1989 she was hired as a studio musician for the Billy Joel Band, and she has been touring and recording with them ever since. Early life Though born in 1963 in Bourne, Massachusetts, Taliefero spent most of her childhood in Hammond, Indiana. By the age of 11 she had begun performing rhythm and blues around Hammond and nearby Gary, Indiana, where her family moved two years later. She joined her brother Charles in the singing group Black Mist (later renamed Magic Mist), who performed in the Chicago area. Taliefero attended William A. Wirt High School where she was a top athlete and graduated in 1981. She studied music at Indiana University, eventually making the dean's list. There, Taliefero was part of the Indiana University Soul Revue, Dr. James Mumford tutoring her. She was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Career In college Taliefero performed in a band called Kilo, which included other now- notable artists such as Saturday Night Live drummer Shawn Pelton, former Tonight Show bassist Robert Hurst, and trumpeter Chris Botti. John Mellencamp's drummer Kenny Aronoff often sat in on drums, and in 1986 after hearing the first song of a live performance, Mellencamp invited Taliefero to join his touring band. In a Spring 2011 interview, Taliefero credited her experience with Mellencamp as the fundamental training that \\"changed the whole course of [her] life\\". In 1989, Mellencamp took time off as a musician to focus on painting. When asked, he lent Taliefero $3000, and with that she headed to New York City to pursue more musical opportunities. Two and a half months into living in New York, Taliefero received a phone call from a Mellencamp associate, asking her to play drums and sing for 1989's Storm Front, the upcoming album from Billy Joel. After a successful audition, she was invited to join the Billy Joel Band, who she has been with ever since. With time, Taliefero claimed the role as background vocal arranger, which she is credited with on 1993's River of Dreams. In 1991 Taliefero accompanied Bee Gees in their tour. A show in Europe needed an opening act, and they asked if she could perform some of her own material. She then formed a one-off band called Bonzai for the opening show which featured Pat Peterson, a Mellencamp backup singer, backed by the Bee Gees band. 1992 saw Taliefero taking a lead role in Bruce Springsteen's extensive 107-date world tour, ending in June 1993. The tour landed Taliefero a number of press hits. The New York Times music critic Jon Pareles described Taliefero as a \\"sassy female foil\\", while Edna Gundersen of USA Today praised her performance alongside Springsteen. Taliefero's collaboration with Springsteen also includes a 1992 MTV Unplugged documentary performance. However, Gary Graff, writing in the Detroit Free Press, lamented that Taliefero only played saxophone on \\"Born to Run\\" and missed longtime E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who was not invited on the tour. Taliefero has performed with a wide range of other artists, including Faith Hill, Garth Brooks, Joe Cocker, Tina Arena, Bob Seger, Brooks & Dunn, Richie Sambora, Elton John, Enrique Iglesias, Natalie Merchant, Meat Loaf, and Michael McDonald. Musicianship Taliefero's credits as a musician are chiefly as a vocalist and percussionist. Instruments in her percussion kit include bongos, cabasa, mark tree, congas, cowbell, g√ºiro, hand percussion, jam block, shaker, tambourine, timbales, triangle, Djembe, and wood block. In addition, Taliefero is also quite accomplished on the guitar, keyboards, harmonica and saxophone, among other wind instruments. She is known for her energetic stage performances. In its 2008 article \\"The 125-Plus People, Places and Things Ruling the Rock & Roll Universe\\", Rolling Stone magazine declared Taliefero the \\"Best Secret Weapon\\". Personal life In 1986, Taliefero suffered a ruptured appendix while touring with Bob Seger. She was hospitalized for several weeks. Taliefero's goal is to establish the Taliefero Music Foundation that will inspire and shape young upcoming lives in the world of live entertainment. As part of her purpose to inspire young musicians, she visited Central High School in East Chicago, Indiana (her home state), in 2009. Taliefero was awarded the Indiana University African-American Arts Institute's Herman C. Hudson Alumni Award on April 19, 2011. In a congratulatory statement, Billy Joel noted that some of his songs would not have been written without her inspiration.

History The National Museum of Photography, founded in 1996, moved into its current premises when the Black Diamond was completed in 1999. However, the museum is based on the Royal Library's collections. Since the invention of photography in 1839, photographs have been included in The Royal Library‚Äôs collections. The first items in the collection were photographs pasted into printed books. Later a collection of individual photographs emerged through donations and acquisitions. In 1902, the collection was incorporated into the then newly established Department of Maps and Pictures. From the beginning of the 1950s, efforts to build a comprehensive photographic collection were intensified and the collection grew tremendously under the direction of Bj√∏rn Ochner, Denmark‚Äôs first photo-historian. Today the Royal Library's collection contains around 18 million photographs. Photographs which are either of special historic or artistic importance now form the basis of the museum. Collections The museum's collections, consisting of around 100,000 photographs, cover Danish and international photography from its invention in 1839 to the present day. Pioneering photography from the 19th century is particularly well represented. The collection of daguerreotypes is the largest in Scandinavia. Exhibitions The museum's exhibitions are generally based on its collection which is frequently supplemented with loans from artists or other institutions. Exhibitions can be based on a theme, a genre, a place, a specific photographer or else aspects of the collection are highlighted via loans from artists or institutions at home and abroad.

It is contrasted with internalism which holds that the mind emerges from neural activity alone. Externalism is a belief that the mind is not just the brain or functions of the brain. There are different versions of externalism based on different beliefs about what the mind is taken to be.Rowlands, M., (2003), Externalism. Putting Mind and World Back Together Again, Chesham, Acumen Publishing Limited. Externalism stresses factors external to the nervous system. At one extreme, the mind could possibly depend on external factors. At the opposite extreme, the mind necessarily depends on external factors. The extreme view of externalism argues either that the mind is constituted by or identical with processes partially or totally external to the nervous system. Another important criterion in externalist theory is to which aspect of the mind is addressed. Some externalists focus on cognitive aspects of the mindsuch as Andy Clark and David Chalmers,Clark, A. and D. Chalmers, (1999), \\"The Extended Mind.\\" in Analysis, 58(1): 10-23. Shaun GallagherGallagher, S., (2009), \\"Philosophical Antecedents of Situated Cognition\\" in P. Robbins and M. Aydede, Eds, The Cambridge Handbook of Situated Cognition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. and many othersRobbins, P. and M. Aydede, Eds, (2009), The Cambridge Handbook of Situated Cognition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.while others engage either the phenomenal aspect of the mind or the conscious mind itself. Several philosophers consider the conscious phenomenal content and activity, such as William Lycan,Lycan, W. G., (2001), \\"The Case for Phenomenal Externalism\\" in J. E. Tomberlin, Ed., Philosophical Perspectives, Vol. 15: Metaphysics, Atascadero, Ridgeview Publishing: 17-36. Alex ByrneByrne, A. and M. Tye, (2006), \\"Qualia ain't in the Head.\\" in No√ªs, 40(2): 241-255. or Francois Tonneau;Tonneau, F., (2004), \\"Consciousness Outside the Head.\\" in Behavior and Philosophy, 32: 97-123.

Proto-externalists  The proto- externalist group includes authors who were not considered as externalist but whose work suggest views similar to current forms of externalism. The first group of protexternalists to consider is the group of neorealists active at the beginning of 1900.Holt, E. B., W. T. Marvin, et al., (1910), \\"The program and first platform of six realists.\\" in The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, 7: 393-401. In particular, Edwin Holt suggested a view of perception that considered the external world as constitutive of mental content. His rejection of representation paved the way to consider the external object as being somehow directly perceived: ‚ÄúNothing can represent a thing but that thing itself‚Äù.Holt, E. B. (1914). The concept of consciousness. New York: Macmillan. p. 142 Holt‚Äôs words anticipated by almost a century the anti-representationalist slogan by Rodney Brooks: \\"The world is its best representation\\".Brooks, R. A., (1991), \\"Intelligence Without Representations.\\" in Artificial Intelligence, 47: 139-159. More recently, neorealist views were refreshed by Francois Tonneau, who wrote that ‚ÄúAccording to neorealism, consciousness is merely a part, or cross-section, of the environment. Neorealism implies that all conscious experiences, veridical or otherwise‚Äù Another notable author is Alfred North Whitehead. Whitehead's process ontology is a form of externalism since it endorses a neutral ontology. The basic elements (prehension, actual occasions, events, and processes) proceeded from microscopic activity up to the highest level of psychological and emotional life.Whitehead, A. N., (1929/1978), Process and Reality, London, Free Press. David Ray Griffin has written an update on Whitehead's thought.Griffin, D. R., (2007), Whitehead's Radically Different Postmodern Philosophy: An Argument for its Contemporary Relevance, Albany (NY), State University of New York Press. John Dewey also expressed a conception of the mind and its role in the world which is sympathetic with externalism. Gregory Bateson also outlined an ecological view of the mind.Bateson, G., (1972/2000), Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Chicago, The University of Chicago Press. Because of his background in cybernetics, he was familiar with the notion of feedback that somehow hampers the traditional separation between the inside and the outside of a system. He questioned the traditional boundary of the mind and tried to express an ecological view of it, attempting to show that the chasm between mind and nature is less obvious than it seems.Bateson, G., (1979/2002), Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity, Cresskill (NJ), Hampton Press.  Semantic externalism  Semantic externalism is the first form of externalism which was dubbed so. As the name suggests it focuses on mental content of semantic nature. Semantic externalism suggests that the mental content does not supervene on what is in the head. Yet the physical basis and mechanisms of the mind remain inside the head. This is a relatively safe move since it does not jeopardize our beliefs of being located inside our cranium. Hilary Putnam focused particularly on intentionality between our thoughts and external state of affairs ‚Äì whether concepts or objects. To defend his position, Putnam developed the famous Twin Earth thought experiment. Putnam expressed his view with the slogan \\"'meanings' just ain't in the head.\\"Putnam, H. (1975/1985) \\"The meaning of 'meaning'\\" . In Philosophical Papers, Vol. 2: Mind, Language and Reality. Cambridge University Press, 215‚Äì271, here: p. 227 In contrast, Tyler Burge emphasized the social nature of the external world suggesting that semantic content is externally constituted by means of social, cultural, and linguistic interactions.Burge, T., (1979), \\"Individualism and the Mental\\" in French, Uehling and Wettstein, Eds, Midwest Studies in Philosophy IV, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press: 73-121.  Phenomenal externalism  Phenomenal externalism extends the externalist view to phenomenal content. Fred Dretske (Dretske 1996) suggested that ‚ÄúThe experiences themselves are in the head (why else would closing one's eyes or stopping one's ears extinguish them?), but nothing in the head (indeed, at the time one is having the experiences, nothing outside the head) need have the qualities that distinguish these experiences.‚Äù (Dretske 1996, p. 144-145).Dretske, F., (1996), \\"Phenomenal externalism, or if meanings ain't in the head, where are qualia?\\" in Philosophical Issues, 7. So, although experiences remain in the head, their phenomenal content could depend on something elsewhere. In similar way, William Lycan defended an externalist and representationalist view of phenomenal experience. In particular, he objected to the tenet that qualia are narrow.(Lycan 2001) It has been often held that some, if not all, of mental states must have a broad content, that is an external content to their vehicles. For instance, Frank Jackson and Philip Pettit stated that ‚ÄúThe contents of certain intentional states are broad or context-bound. The contents of some beliefs depend on how things are outside the subject‚Äù (Jackson and Pettit 1988, p. 381)Jackson, F. and P. Pettit, (1988), \\"Functionalism and Broad Content.\\" in Mind, 97(387): 381-400. However, neither Dretske nor Lycan go far as to claim that the phenomenal mind extends literally and physically beyond the skin. In sum they suggest that phenomenal contents could depend on phenomena external to the body, while their vehicles remains inside.  The extended mind  The extended mind model suggests that cognition is larger than the body of the subject. According to such a model, the boundaries of cognitive processes are not always inside the skin. ‚ÄúMinds are composed of tools for thinking‚Äù (Dennett 2000,Dennett, D. C., (2000), \\"Making Tools for Thinking\\" in D. Sperber, Ed., Metarepresentations: A Multidisciplinary Perspective, Oxford, Oxford University Press: 17-29. p. 21). According to Andy Clark, ‚Äúcognition leaks out into body and world‚Äù. The mind then is no longer inside the skull, but it is extended to comprehend whatever tools are useful (ranging from notepad and pencils up to smartphones and USB memories). This, in a nutshell, is the model of the extended mind.Clark, A. and D. Chalmers, (1998), \\"The Extended Mind.\\" in Analysis, 58(1): 10-23. When someone uses pencil and paper to compute large sums, cognitive processes extend to the pencil and paper themselves. In a loose sense, nobody would deny it. In a stronger sense, it can be controversial whether the boundaries of the cognitive mind would extend to the pencil and paper. For most of the proponents of the extended mind, the phenomenal mind remains inside the brain. While commenting on Andy Clark‚Äôs last book Supersizing the Mind,Clark, A., (2008), Supersizing the Mind, Oxford, Oxford University Press. David Chalmers asks ‚Äúwhat about the big question: extended consciousness? The dispositional beliefs, cognitive processes, perceptual mechanisms, and moods [‚Ä¶] extend beyond the borders of consciousness, and it is plausible that it is precisely the nonconscious part of them that is extended.‚Äù (Chalmers 2009,Chalmers, D., (2009), \\"Foreword\\" in A. Clark, Ed., Supersizing the Mind, Oxford, Oxford University Press: i-xxviii. p. xiv)  Enactivism and embodied cognition  Enactivism and embodied cognition stress the tight coupling between the cognitive processes, the body, and the environment.* Varela, F.

Aydede, Eds, (2009), The Cambridge Handbook of Situated Cognition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. Enactivism builds upon the work of other scholars who could be considered as proto externalists; these include Gregory Bateson, James J. Gibson, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Eleanor Rosch and many others. These thinkers suggest that the mind is either dependent on or identical with the interactions between the world and the agents. For instance, Kevin O‚ÄôRegan and Alva Noe suggested in a seminal paper that the mind is constituted by the sensory-motor contingency between the agent and the world. A sensory-motor contingency is an occasion to act in a certain way and it results from the matching between environmental and bodily properties. To a certain extent a sensory-motor contingencies strongly resembles Gibson‚Äôs affordances. Eventually, Noe developed a more epistemic version of enactivism where the content is the knowledge the agent has as to what it can do in a certain situation. In any case he is an externalist when he claims that ‚ÄúWhat perception is, however, is not a process in the brain, but a kind of skilful activity on the part of the animal as a whole. The enactive view challenges neuroscience to devise new ways of understanding the neural basis of perception and consciousness‚Äù (No√´ 2004,No√´, A., (2004), Action in Perception, Cambridge (Mass), MIT Press. p. 2). Recently, Noe published a more popular and shorter version of his position.No√´, A., (2009), Out of Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain, and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness, Hill and Wang. Enactivism receives support from various other correlated views such as embodied cognition or situated cognition. These views are usually the result of the rejection of the classic computational view of the mind which is centered on the notion of internal representations. Enactivism receives its share of negative comments, particularly from neuroscientists such as Christof Koch (Koch 2004,Koch, C., (2004), The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach, Englewood (Col), Roberts & Company Publishers. p. 9): ‚ÄúWhile proponents of the enactive point of view rightly emphasize that perception usually takes place within the context of action, I have little patience for their neglect of the neural basis of perception. If there is one thing that scientists are reasonably sure of, it is that brain activity is both necessary and sufficient for biological sentience.‚Äù To recap, enactivism is a case of externalism, sometimes restricted to cognitive or semantic aspects, some other times striving to encompass phenomenal aspects. Something that no enactivist has so far claimed is that all phenomenal content is the result of the interaction with the environment.  Recent forms of phenomenal externalism  Some externalists suggest explicitly that phenomenal content as well as the mental process are partially external to the body of the subject. The authors considering these views wonder whether not only cognition but also the conscious mind could be extended in the environment. While enactivism, at the end of the day, accepts the standard physicalist ontology that conceives the world as made of interacting objects, these more radical externalists consider the possibility that there is some fundamental flaw in our way to conceive reality and that some ontological revision is indeed unavoidable. Teed Rockwell recently published a wholehearted attack against all forms of dualism and internalism. He proposed that the mind emerges not entirely from brain activity but from an interacting nexus of brain, body, and world. He therefore endorses embodied cognition, holding that neuroscience wrongly endorses a form of Cartesian materialism, an indictment also issued by many others.Bennett, M. R. and P. M. S. Hacker, (2003), Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience, Malden (Mass), Blackwell. Dwelling on John Dewey‚Äôs heritage, he argues that the brain and the body bring into existence the mind as a \\"behavioral field\\" in the environment. Ted Honderich is perhaps the philosopher with the greatest experience in the field. He defends a position he himself dubbed \\"radical externalism\\" perhaps because of its ontological consequences.Honderich, T., (2004), On Consciousness, Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press. One of his main examples is that \\"what it actually is for you to be aware of the room you are in, it is for the room a way to exist.\\"Honderich, T., (2006), \\"Radical Externalism.\\" in Journal of Consciousness Studies, 13(7-8): 3-13. According to him, ‚ÄúPhenomenologically, what it is for you to be perceptually conscious is for a world somehow to exist‚Äù. Therefore, he identifies existence with consciousness. Another radical form of phenomenal externalism is the view called the spread mind by Riccardo Manzotti. He questions the separation between subject and object, seeing these as only two incomplete perspectives and descriptions of the same physical process.Manzotti, R. and V. Tagliasco, (2001), Coscienza e Realt√†. Una teoria della coscienza per costruttori e studiosi di menti e cervelli, Bologna, Il Mulino. He supports a process ontology that endorses a mind spread physically and spatio-temporally beyond the skin. Objects are not autonomous as we know them, but rather actual processes framing our reality.Manzotti, R., (2009), \\"No Time, No Wholes: A Temporal and Causal-Oriented Approach to the Ontology of Wholes.\\" in Axiomathes, 19: 193-214. A more radical and sophisticated explanation was proposed by Roger Bartra with his theory of the exocerebrum. He explains that consciousness is both inside and outside the brain, and that the frontier that separates both realms is useless and a burden in the explanation of the self. In his Anthropology of the brain: Consciousness, culture, and free will (Cambridge University Press, 2014; originally published in Spanish in 2005) he criticizes both externalism and internalism.

Miletiƒá, Saltus Tariotarum, UDK: 930.271(497.5-3 Dalmacija)‚Äú653‚Äú, p. 10 From north to the south of the peninsula large fortified settlements (modern: Grad, Domazeti, Kosmaƒç, Drid and Oriov≈°ƒçak) dominate over a short length, surrounded with a series of smaller hillforts located on more prominent elevations, fortified with dry-stone ramparts, all visually connected. They were raised in relation to overland and maritime communications, which they entirely controlled, and they enabled control over individual pastures, same as the neighboring Liburnian hillforts did. Economy The economy of the Tariotes and other, similar Dalmatae tribal communities on the coast was primary based on livestock husbandry, which associates them with the hillfort lifestyle which would last even after the Roman domination in Dalmatia commenced. With the arrival of the Romans to the province of Dalmatia, historical circumstances, and thus the role of hillforts, changed. They were no longer defensive strongholds from attacks by hostile local tribes, nor sites of resistance to the Roman army. Rome now intervened in the disputes between the tribes and these hillforts lost their military role, but retained their economical role, in the first place to safeguard livestock. In the old Tariote territory, the hillfort centres would not continue to exist through Antiquity, which was the case among the Liburnians. In Liburnia, centres such as Nedinium (Nadin), Asseria (Podgraƒëe, near Benkovac), Iader (Zadar) continued to exist in Roman times, and the Liburnians retained their ethnic distinctiveness under Rome, while the same did not occur on the neighbouring Hyllus Peninsula. However, during the 1st century AD individual Tariote hillforts lived on, and numerous Roman materials were found in them, generally vessels that indicate intense trade between newly arrived Romans settled in Pretorium (Greba≈°tica), Marina and Tragurium (Trogir) and the indigenous Tariotes. Even though hillforts experienced new architectural interventions during the 1st centuries BC and AD, already during the 2nd century AD they had primarily economic significance, while life gradually became oriented toward Pretorium and other Roman centres. The hillforts would be used as shelters for the livestock; some of them serve this function even today. See also * Illyrians * Liburnia Notes Sources * A.

The land is drought-prone and semi-arid. It is in the Deccan thorn scrub forests ecoregion. Maharashtra is one of the six states of India where great Indian bustards (Ardeotis nigriceps) are still seen. The great Indian bustard at Nannaj and Karmala was first identified By Mr B.S.Kulkarni in 1972 and with his constant efforts to save the bird had resulted in Dr. Salim Ali visiting Nannaj and starting a research project. Mr Kulkarni wrote extensively in local newspapers and made people aware of its existence and he is still active in trying to protect the bird and its habitat at Nannaj, near Solapur. In former days the bustard was a common bird in the dry districts of Maharashtra. Data on the sanctuary *Coordinates - 17¬∞49‚Ä≤36.2‚Ä≥N 75¬∞52‚Ä≤10.9‚Ä≥E *Year of establishment- 1979 *Size - *Climate - Dry, mild winter. Hot summer (40 ¬∞C to 43¬∞C ) *Temperature - 13 ¬∞C to 42 ¬∞C *Topography - Gentle undulations, with isolated hillocks of 450-500 msl. *Habitat - 6A/01 Southern Tropical Thorn Forest (Champion and Seth 1968) *Biogeographic Zone - Deccan Peninsula *Breeding Status - Breeds in Nannaj and some other DPAP plots. *Nesting season - Monsoon (July‚ÄìOctober) *Figure of bustards according to census 2009 - Total 21 ( 13 females and 8 males) Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP) Plots In 1975 the Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP), financed by the World Bank, was initiated in Solapur district . Establishment of pastures and woodlots by the forest department under DPAP resulted in regeneration of wildlife, benefited by the protection of their habitat (Rahamani, A. R. Final Report 1989, BNHS). Habitat types in Nannaj plots Habitat of Nannaj can be broadly divided into five main types (Manakadan, R. and Rahmani, A. R. 1986 Annual Report No. 3, BNHS, Rahmani, A. R. Final Report 1989 BNHS). #Grassland plots - Mardi 100 and Mardi 50 plots are pure grassland, with few young Acacia nilotica trees and Cassia auriculata bushes. Prominent grasses are Aristida funiculate, Aristida stocksii, Chrysopogon fulvus, Heteropogon contortus, Lodhopogon tridentatus, Melanocenchris jacquemontii. #Woodlot (Nannaj plots)- In some of the areas the following trees were planted by the forest department: Acacia nilotica, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta indica, Hardwickia binata, Sapindus emarginatus and Tamarindus indica. These plots have become extremely thick in the past years, and the grassland has been converted to woodland. #Grazing land #Stony grazing land #Crop fields Habitat utilization and preference by great Indian bustard Maximum sightings of bustards are seen at pure grassland areas, and no bird is recorded in dense woodlots. Bustards prefer wide open short grass plains and open scrubland with scattered trees. Bustards need open habitat for the following purposes: *Nesting *Display *Foraging *Roosting''' Need for habitat management Some of the areas like Nannaj 10 ha (close to mardi, 100 hectare) and Karamba (also close to Mardi, 50 hectare) were planted with exotic plant species like Gliricidia sepium, Azadirachta indica. Because of the dense growth of weeds like Hyptis suaveolens and Lantana camara, these areas became dense woodlands. Pictures taken from Google Earth effectively shows how dramatically habitat has changed from scrubland and grassland to dense woodland. The idea of no tree plantain proposed by some and other are not proper there has to be some trees which are not tall and there has to be the proper grassland so that the bird can hide and fly. If the camouflage is not there the bird has chance to fall prey to poachers. Recommendations *No tree planting - It is believed to be better to have less trees or bushes in the core areas than to have too many of them. *Maintenance of grassland - very thick and dense grasses are not preferred by bustards. In such cases thinning, cutting would be useful to maintain the grassland at the optimum suitability for the bustards. These recommendations were included in management plan of the sanctuary but nothing much was done for the management of grasslands in Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary, Nannaj, Solapur. Removal of trees by the forest department With reference to above recommendations in the management plan, Forest Department (Wildlife Division) Pune submitted a proposal to PCCF Maharashtra in 2006 for the uprooting and cutting of trees like Gliricidia and Lantana in Nannaj and Karamba areas. With allotments of funds, actual work started in March 2008 under the guidance of Conservator of Forest (Wildlife Division) Pune Dr. Y L P Rao. Total 25 hectares of land was cleared out of trees, of which 10 hectares at Nannaj 10 ha area (near Kale Talav) and 15 hectares at Karamba (near Mardi 50 hectare). Trees like Gliricidia, Neem and Lantana were cut and then uprooted so as to prevent their regrowth. A total of 15,240 trees were uprooted from 25 hectares of land. On 15 August 2009, an observer saw one male great Indian bustard in the newly opened Nannaj 10 (Near Kale Talav) plot. The bustard was seen foraging and the observer continued to observe the bird for about 45 minutes in 10 ha (from 7:15 to 8:00 am). Then the bustard crossed the TCM by walking and entered the Mardi 100 hectare area. The following species of birds have been observed in newly opened areas: *Great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) *Indian bushlark (Mirafra erythroptera) *Ashy-crowned sparrow-lark (Eremopterix grisea) *Rufous-tailed lark (Ammomanes phoenicurus) *Southern grey shrike (Lanius meridionalis) *Yellow-wattled lapwing (Vanellus malabaricus) *Red- necked falcon (Falco chicquera) *White-eyed buzzard (Butastur teesa) *Rock bush quail (Perdicula argoondah) *Barred buttonquail (Turnix suscitator) *Grey francolin (Francolinus pondicerianus) *Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) *Pied bushchat (Saxicola caprata) *Common myna (Acridotheres tristis) *Large grey babbler (Turdoides malcolmi) *Indian silverbill (Lonchura malabarica) A majority of the above-mentioned species are grassland birds. These observations suggest the acceptance of newly opened habitat by great Indian bustard and also by various other bird species. The Forest Department has proposed to uproot about more 5,244 trees in Mardi, Akolekati and Karamba plots. This will help in restoration of proper habitat for bustards.

Early life Henry Ronald Russell was born in London, the son of Henry Russell, a composer, pianist, and baritone, and his partner (later wife) Hannah de Lara, an artist. He was the brother of the musician Sir Landon Ronald. From his father's first marriage to Isabella Lloyd, a member of the Lloyd banking family, he had two elder half brothers, novelist William Clark Russell and Anglican priest Henry Lloyd Russell.Holden, Raymond. \\"Ronald, Sir Landon (1873‚Äì1938)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, Oct 2008, accessed 6 February 2013 He was educated at St Marylebone Grammar School. Russell was \\"first destined for medicine, but severe illness diverted him to music.\\" After St Marylebone, he then pursued studies in singing at the Royal College of Music and conducting in Italy. Career Russell began his career as a singing teacher, first in London (where Nellie Melba supplied him with his first singing pupils) and then in Rome. He then worked as a conductor at various opera houses in Italy. In 1904, he established the San Carlo Opera Company (SCOC), originally a touring arm of the Teatro di San Carlo of Naples, Italy. The company soon became its own institution and toured to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London in late 1905. Russell and his company were responsible for presenting the whole 1905-1906 season at Covent Garden, and Russell directed or conducted all the productions. After completing the season in London, Russell and the SCOC went to Boston in the United States in 1906. The group remained based in Boston and gave tours annually of mostly Italian operas throughout the United States from 1906-1909 in addition to giving performances in Boston. With the opening of the Boston Opera House in 1909, the company essentially became the seed for the newly formed Boston Opera Company (BOC), which Russell co-founded with the Bostonian millionaire Eben Jordan, Jr.. He continued to direct the BOC until it went bankrupt in 1915. After the BOC folded, Russell went to work for the Metropolitan Opera in New York as the company's associate director. He eventually returned to England where he was involved in directing productions at the Waldorf Theatre in London. He also directed a season of operas at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris. Personal life Russell married three times, first to Portuguese singer Nina Hannah da Costa Andrade (b. 1870), daughter of the Marquis de Pombal, whom he married in 1895. Before their marriage, they were the parents of two children: * Henry Tosti Russell (b. 1896), a reporter who interviewed the exiled Queen Victoria of Spain in 1936 about Edward VIII's relationship with Wallis Simpson. * Sheridan William Robin Russell (1900‚Äì1991), a prominent cellist. His second wife was fellow singer Donna Shinn (b. ), a collaborator of designer Natacha Rambova. They divorced and married his third wife, actress Lady Patricia Ethel Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (b. 1902) on 11 June 1926. Lady Patricia was the youngest of three daughters of Terence Hamilton-Temple- Blackwood, 2nd Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and his American wife, the former Flora Davis. A year before their marriage, Lady Patricia's mother remarried to Richard Curzon, 4th Earl Howe. There were no children of the second and third marriages. Russell died at his home in London on 11 October 1937 at the age of 65.

Created teams, names, kits, and players can be customised and players can be edited in a more in-depth way than before. Create a player by choosing his appearance, accessories and attributes. You may also create players and edit squads on the console itself, but to create a team you must use the Creation Centre web-based application. An in-game screenshot highlighting the improved Career Mode. *Career Mode (PS3, Xbox 360, PS2, PSP, NDS): \\"Be a Pro Mode\\" and \\"Manager Mode\\" have been merged into the new \\"Career Mode\\", where the player can choose to be a player, manager, or player-manager for over 15 seasons. Many improvements have been made to Career Mode, one being that when signing new players, the user will have to agree to a transfer fee with the club, as well as other personal demands from the player; the club could also agree a fee with two teams for a player. The board of a club can decide to give the manager a contract extension or not; this will depend on certain objectives being met, or if they feel that the user has potential as a manager. The manager reputation rating is still in the game and will go up or down depending on your efforts. Regular emails will appear from the coach telling the user about player growth, and if a player is gaining or losing overall rating, the coach will also tell the user about players that are hitting form and will suggest the user include them in the starting line up for the next match, or give them a little more responsibility. On the player growth screen, the user will also get comments from the coach, such as \\"has reached his potential\\", \\"isn't going to grow anymore\\", or \\"could develop quickly if given game time.\\" A new budget allocator has also been implemented, where the player can adjust the slider to whatever they desire, whether it will be an 80/20 split with ¬£50 million to spend and ¬£200K wage budget, or a 60/40 split, where that may be ¬£40 million to spend and ¬£250K wage budget. This gives some flexibility if the user is trying to buy specific players but does not have the wages to cover it, or does not need the wages and wants more free cash. There is a limit, however; when doing this, the user will get the notification that this is only available three times per season, so the player must make their decisions wisely. It is also now possible to view results and standings from other leagues around the world, following a similar feature that was on the official 2010 FIFA World Cup game. It still is not possible to manage an international team. * Street Football (Wii): Players can now play 5 vs. 5 street football, as well as the traditional 11 vs. 11. Each street player has a distinctive style of play with unique abilities to match.FIFA 11 has Street mode on Wii, eurogamer.net * Goalkeeper Intelligence (All Platforms): Goalkeepers now have more urgency and better perception of where to intercept loose balls, resulting in a more responsive and powerful rushing system. Goalkeepers are now more agile and can make more impressive saves.

Eurogamer rated it 8/10 summing up, \\"At its best FIFA 11 is enormous fun and brilliantly engineered, but in its battle to be more varied and realistic it has lost some of its momentum, and off the pitch returns are starting to diminish too\\". As of October 2011, 16 million copies of the game have been sold across all platforms.  Commentaries  *In PS3, Xbox 360 and PC version: Martin Tyler and Andy Gray. *In PS2, PSP, Wii, Android and iOS version: Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray. *In DS version: Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend (only).  Ultimate Team  Following on from previous FIFA games, FIFA 11 Ultimate Team was released on PS3 and Xbox 360 on 3 November 2010. It is available for free download from the PlayStation Store or Xbox Live Marketplace. In the game itself, players purchase packs of cards with in-game money. These packs contain random players and other items, such as balls and kits, and players have to win football matches in order to earn coins, to purchase new players. There are other ways to make money, such as buying players and other items cheaply and selling them on for a higher price. Also, with Microsoft points on the Xbox 360 you can buy packs of silver or gold players, staff and items. Returning users to Ultimate Team receive two complimentary Gold packs. It has been praised for its creativity, and likeness to eBay, in that it has live auctions, where player items needed from other players. This has also been likened to the real life Football market, where other managers are constantly trying to outbid each other for the best players and staff. Also, people could play their friends in this new friend mode. Players can be found in packs according to their real life transfers, for example the Fernando Torres Chelsea card appeared in packs after he was transferred from Liverpool or the Edin Dzeko transfer from Wolfsburg to Man City. These updates can be useful for the chemistry side of the game.
