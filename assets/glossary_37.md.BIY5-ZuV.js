He was still unbeaten by June 1953, when he faced Bunty Doran at the Ulster Hall, Belfast for the Irish bantamweight title and the BBBofC Northern Ireland Area title. Kelly stopped Doran in the eleventh round to take both titles. His next fight came in October 1953, when he challenged for Peter Keenan's British and European titles at the King's Hall, Belfast.

Kelly was knocked out in the ninth round by Belgian champion Pierre Cossemyns in April 1954. In September he defended his British title against Keenan; Keenan knocked him out in the sixth round to regain the title. Kelly moved up to featherweight and in March 1955 stopped Laurie McShane in the fourth round. He followed this in June with a points win over Aime Devisch, but in August was knocked out in the first round by Teddy Peckham.

The largely destroyed 5th Dynasty structure is located in the pyramid field of Abusir, east of the Pyramid of Neferefre and south of the Pyramid of Khentkaus II.  Exploration  On his (1842-1845), the German archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius identified a small pyramid site and gave it the number XXIV (24) in his list of pyramids. Ludwig Borchardt, who explored the necropolis of Abusir six years later, considered the ruins to be a mastaba or double mastaba and did not investigate it further. A Czech team led by Miroslav Verner undertook exploratory excavations in 1980-81, 1987 and 1990, as well as a full excavation in 1994 and identified the complex as a pyramid with a cult pyramid and a mortuary temple, which they assigned to the time of the 5th dynasty King Nyuserre.Czech Institute of Egyptology: Pyramid \\"Lepsius no. XXIV\\" = Identification = The inhabitant of the pyramid can not yet be identified, since no direct evidence, like inscriptions, remain. It is probable, however, that Nyuserre had the pyramid built for one of his wives, perhaps Reptynub.  Pyramid  With a base measuring 31.5 m x 31.5 m and a slope of 60¬∞15‚Ä≤, the Lepsius XXIV Pyramid originally had a height of 27.3 m. The core structure of the pyramid was built in three layers, according to recent research. The masonry of the first layer consists of a stone casing, with the interior filled with sand, rubble and debris. A ramp structure oriented north‚Äìsouth and extending into the core structure was probably used for the erection of this layer. The second layer again consists of an outer stone casing with several partition walls at oblique angles, made up of irregularly shaped stone fragments. The space between was also filled with loose debris in the same way as the first layer. The third layer no longer exists. According to Verner, the mixed technique increased stability. A cladding of fine limestone appears to have been attached later, since the masonry of the mortuary temple touches the first core layer directly. The masonry of the pyramid displays a large amount of construction graffiti. These graffiti regularly mention the Vizier Ptahshepses, who organised all royal construction under Nyuserre, which indicates that the pyramid was built during his reign.  Substructure  Entrance to the substructure of Lepsius XXIV The substructure was laid out as an open grave, which was eventually covered over by the pyramid. The entranceway ran from the north and led to a burial chamber on an east‚Äìwest orientation. The passageway has been largely been quarried away. The burial chamber contained fragments of a pink granite sarcophagus, parts of the grave goods and the damaged mummy of a woman aged about 23, whose identity is unknown. She was probably the owner of the pyramid, but it is also possible that she is an intrusive burial from a later period, since the remains of the mummy show traces of the removal of the brains, a mummification practice which is only attested from the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. An accurate dating of the mummy by Radiocarbon dating is not yet available. The name of the tomb's occupant is not attested.Miroslav Verner: Die Pyramiden, pp.355 ff Die Pyramide ¬´Lepsius Nr. XXIV¬ª In addition, the area of the burial chamber contains fragments of grave goods, like alabaster vessels, copper tools for the opening of the mouth ceremony and canopic jars.  Complex  In the pyramid complex ruins, a small cult pyramid and a funerary temple can be identified. The whole complex was surrounded by a wall. = Cult pyramid = In the south corner of the complex is a small cult pyramid with a base of about 10 x 10 metres, which has largely been destroyed by extensive spoliation. Only some fine limestone cladding from the northwest corner and the west side remain intact. The orientation of these structures differs a little from the north‚Äìsouth orientation of the main structure. = Mortuary temple = The mortuary temple is located in the usual position on the east side of the pyramid and seems to have had a simple structure. Except for a false door on the side facing the pyramid, it seems unlikely that the temple was decorated with reliefs, since no fragments of relief were found at all. The structure was largely destroyed by spoliation in the New Kingdom and the Saite Period, especially on the south side, and as a result a reconstruction is no longer possible.

It is a common item of gift during marriages with detailed patterns in bright and pleasing colour schemes. This product has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. On 22 January 2007, it was listed as \\"Chamba Rumal\\" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Classes 24 as Textile and Textile Goods, vide application number 79. History Chamba Rumal, a ceremonial cover Chamba Rumal Ram Nath Kovind presenting the Nari Shakti Puruskar to Chama Rumal embroiderer Lalita Vakil Earliest reported form of this rumal is the one made by Bebe Nanaki, sister of Guru Nanak in the 16th century, which is now preserved in the Gurudwara at Hoshiarpur. The Victoria Albert Museum, London has a rumal which was gifted to the British in 1883 by Raja Gopal Singh and it has an embroidered scene of the Kurukshetra War of the epic Mahabharta. However, from the 17th century the women of the erstwhile princely state of Chamba (now part of Himachal Pradesh), including members of the royal family, indulged in embroidery of the rumals or handkerchiefs as a part of a marriage gifts or dowry to their daughters. The handkerchiefs were made in geometrical shapes of square and rectangle using very fine hand made silk which was obtained from the Punjab or muslin cloth, a product of Bengal. Women created highly ornamental patterns using untwined thread made of silk produced in Sialkot (in Pakistan), Amritsar and Ludhiana. The embroidery technique adopted, called the dohara tanka or double satin stitch, created distinct identical patterns on both faces of the fabric, which were attractive when viewed even from distance of 10 ft and more. The dohara tanka method is a heritage of Kashmir, which was adopted in Basohli and Chamba, but was improved upon by adopting themes from the special Mughal art of Chamba miniature paintings; this art form flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Following the downfall of the Mughal empire many expert artists of this craft migrated to the hill region of Himachal Pradesh. Raja Umed Singh of Chamba (1748‚Äì68) patronized the artists. These artists drew the outlines of the design on the fabric to be embroidered using fine charcoal and also suggested suitable colours to be adopted on the mythological themes of Krishna's raas- leela of the epic Mahabharata, and themes from Ramayana or scenes of marriage and game hunting to be embroidered; themes also included events from Gita Govinda, Bhagvat purana or only Radha-Krishna and Shiva-Parvati. Inspiration was also provided from the frescoes done in the Rang Mahal of Chamba. The women then executed the embroidery. In early 19th century, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over the Punjab Hill States, Sikh style of painting also influenced the Chamba Rumal. Following Indian Independence, this art work lost its royal patronage, and quality deteriorated due to commercialization by making many cheaper varieties such as table cloths, cushion covers, clothing, and even various machine made items to compete in the market with cheaper similar work from other regions. To revive this art work, in the later part of 1970s, at the initiative of Usha Bhagat (a friend of Indira Gandhi), the DCC located the original designs of this art work from museums and collections, and women artists were then trained in this art work. As a result 16 designs have been recreated and quality restored. Lalita Vakil was awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar award for her work in helping to revive the art by organising courses. The \\"2018\\" award was made in the Presidential Palace by the President of India. Process Known as a \\"needle wonder\\" Chamba Rumal is now made in square and rectangular shapes. The materials used still consist of muslin, malmal, khaddar (a coarse fabric), fine charcoal or brush, and silk threads without knots. Using a double satin stitch for the embroidery, both faces of the cloth are concurrently stitched by a forward and backward technique to maintain uniformity of design on both faces of the rumal. After completing the embroidery, the fabric is stitched with a border of about 2 to 4 inches on all sides.

It took place during the week commencing September 21, 2014 with the aim of helping adults to improve their digital literacy in order to fill the growing skills gap. The week is run by volunteers in hubs, libraries, schools, businesses and NGOs with the intention of supporting adults to learn digital skills including coding. Richard Rolfe and Jordan Love were inspired to create the week when they trained a group of unemployed people in coding skills which eventually led to many of them getting jobs. The EU predicts a significant number of digital jobs being unfilled by 2020 due to a skills shortage. Richard and Jordan saw an opportunity to try to inspire adults to gain the skills necessary to fill the gap. History In 2015 National Coding Week ran from 21 September and spread beyond the UK. The week gained coverage and support in the EU and in the US. A number of prominent business leaders offered support to National Coding Week including Brian Doll VP of GitHub, Prince Andrew, Congressman Kevin McCarthy and Tim Lovejoy. Boris Johnson the Mayor of London stated that ‚ÄúCoding is a language that is increasingly important for both young people and adults to understand, but it can be an intimidating prospect. National Coding Week will help to make whole generations of Brits more comfortable with coding, allowing them to embrace the business opportunities of the future.‚Äù. One of the aims of the week was to also encourage women to get involved in coding Martha Lane Fox‚Äôs drive to bridge the gender gap in tech gave prominence to the week. Over 100 events and 1000 people took part in 2015. Events occurred all over Wales in libraries and hubs and was supported by WEA YMCA Community College Cymru and the Welsh Government Speaking at the launch event in Cardiff Central Library Hub‚Äôs new digital floor, the Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, Ken Skates, said ‚ÄúLearning new skills such as coding can open new doors to people. We are increasingly moving into an online world and it is important that people do not miss out on opportunities to develop these skills, which have the potential to create employment opportunities. I‚Äôm delighted to launch the National Coding Week in Wales and am pleased this is taking place in a library, which is the ideal place to get support to learn new skills. It‚Äôs particularly good to launch it in the new digital floor of Cardiff Central Library, which received a grant from the Welsh Government towards its modernisation.‚Äù In Scotland Polly Purvis head of ScotlandIS outlined Scottish plans for future tech growth and how National Coding Week fitted in. Free coding lessons for adults were also offered all over Scotland. In England, Schools, Hubs, Businesses and libraries supported the week. In November 2015 Richard and Jordan won the CIPD Award for Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for their efforts in inspiring adults from all backgrounds to gain digital skills. National Coding Week 2016 will run from 19 September to 25 September in the United States, UK and Australia.

In the early morning hours of February 14, 2000, for reasons unknown, she packed her bookbag, left her family home north of the city and began walking along nearby North Carolina Highway 18 despite heavy rain and wind. Several passing motorists saw her; when one turned around at a point from her home and began to approach her, she left the roadside and ran into a wooded area. In the morning, her parents discovered her absence. No one has seen her since. An intensive search that began that day led to the location of some of her personal effects near where she was last seen. A year and a half later, her bookbag, still packed, was unearthed from a construction site along Highway 18 north of Shelby in Morganton. At the point where she ran into the woods, a billboard now stands appealing for help finding her. Her family hosts an annual walk from their home to the billboard to draw attention to the case. While the circumstances of Degree's disappearance at first seemed to suggest she was running away from home, investigators could not find a clear reason she might have done so; she was younger than most children who do. They have speculated that she might have been abducted instead. The case has drawn national media attention. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) joined state and county authorities in a reopened investigation, offering a reward for information that could help solve the case.  Background  Harold and Iquilla Degree married on Valentine's Day in 1988. Their son, O'Bryant, was born a year later; Asha was born in 1990.Family of Asha Degree holds on to hope The Degrees raised both children in their house on Oakcrest Drive in a residential subdivision amidst a generally rural area north of Shelby, North Carolina, on the western edge of the Charlotte metropolitan area. Both worked regular jobs nearby. The children let themselves in after school, where their parents expected that they would either be doing their homework or finished with it by the time they returned. They made sure their children were insulated from outside influences and had a life centered around their extended family, church, and school. The Degrees did not have a computer in the house. \\"[E]very time you turned on the TV there was some pedophile who had lured somebody's child away, via the Internet,\\" Iquilla recalled in a 2013 Jet interview. Iquilla said Asha handled this well; she was cautious, shy, and content mostly to stay within the limits her parents set. \\"She was scared to death of dogs,\\" she recalled years later. \\"I never thought she would go out of the house.\\" Asha was in fourth grade at nearby Fallston Elementary School, going into a three-day weekend on the second week of February 2000. The Cleveland County Schools were closed on Friday, February 11, while the Degrees still had to work; the children spent the day at their aunt's house in the same neighborhood, from which they went to their youth basketball practices at their school. The following day, Asha's basketball team, on which she was a star point guard, lost its first game of the season. Asha had fouled out. Her parents recalled that she was somewhat upset about this, crying along with her teammates afterwards, but seemed to have gotten over it and watched her brother's game afterwards.  Disappearance  On February 13, a Sunday, the children went to church from a relative's house and then returned home. Around 8 p.m. that night, both children went to bed in the room they shared. Almost an hour later, the power went out in the neighborhood after a nearby car accident. The power came back on at 12:30 a.m., at which time Harold checked on his children and saw both Asha and O'Bryant asleep in their beds. He checked again shortly before he went to bed at 2:30 a.m. on February 14 and again saw them both. Shortly afterwards, O'Bryant, then age 10, recalls hearing Asha's bed squeak. He did not further rouse himself, as he assumed she was merely changing positions in her sleep. Apparently around this time, Asha got out of bed, taking a bookbag she had previously packed with several sets of clothes and personal items, and left the house. Between 3:45 and 4:15 a.m., a truck driver and a motorist saw her walking south along Highway 18, wearing a long-sleeved white T-shirt and white pants, just north of its junction with Highway 180. They reported this to police after seeing a TV report about her disappearance. The motorist said that he turned his car around because he thought it was \\"strange such a small child would be out by herself at that hour\\". He circled three times and saw Degree run into the woods by the roadside and disappear. It was a rainy night, and the witness said there was a \\"storm raging\\" when he saw her. County sheriff Dan Crawford said, \\"We're pretty sure it was her because the descriptions they gave are consistent with what we know she was wearing.\\" He added that they also saw her at the same place, heading the same direction. Iquilla awoke at 5:45 a.m. to get the children ready for school. On the morning of February 14, an important day since it was not only Valentine's Day but also the Degrees' wedding anniversary, this involved drawing a bath for them because they had not been able to take one the night before due to the power outage. When she opened the children's room to wake them up before their 6:30 alarm and call them to the bath, O'Bryant was in his bed; Asha was not, and Iquilla was unable to find her in the house or in the family cars. She told Harold she could not find their daughter. He suggested Asha might have gone over to his mother's house across the street; when Iquilla called there, her sister-in-law said Asha was not there. \\"That's when I went into panic mode. I heard a car next door ... I put shoes on and ran outside.\\" Iquilla called her mother, who told her to call the police. Search By 6:40 a.m., the first police officers had arrived on the scene. Police dogs called to the scene could not pick up Asha's scent. Iquilla went through the neighborhood calling Asha's name, which she said had awakened everyone by 7 a.m. Friends, family, and neighbors canceled their plans for the day to assist police in searching the vicinity while the pastor of their church, along with other area clergymen, came to the Degrees' home to support them. By day's end, all that had been found was a mitten, which Iquilla Degree said did not belong to her daughter, noting that no winter clothing had been taken from the house. Local news coverage prompted the two drivers who had seen Asha's walking along the road early that morning, including the one whose attempt to approach her apparently prompted Asha to flee into the woods, to report the sightings to police. On February 15, candy wrappers were found in a shed at a nearby business along the highway, near where Asha had been seen running into the woods. Along with them were a pencil, marker, and Mickey Mouse-shaped hair bow that were identified as belonging to her. It was the only trace of her found during the initial search. On February 16, Iquilla realized that Asha's bedroom was missing her favorite clothing, including a pair of blue jeans with a red stripe. A week later, after 9,000 man hours had been invested in a search of the of where she had last been seen, flyers had been posted all over the area, and 300 leads had been submitted that ranged from possible sightings to tips about abandoned houses and wells where Asha might have ended up, the search was called off. \\"We have never really had that first good, substantial lead,\\" said county sheriff Dan Crawford at a news conference. He urged the media to keep the story alive. Later developments At the news conference on February 22, Crawford said he was going \\"long-range\\" with the search for Asha. Both the FBI and North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) got involved and put her on their respective databases of missing children. While the agencies were done searching in the area of her home and route, \\"we're following everything,\\" he insisted. From Iquilla's account of what Asha had taken with her, investigators believed she had planned and prepared for this departure over the several days preceding her disappearance. \\"She's not your typical runaway,\\" observed SBI agent Bart Burpeau. Another expert, Ben Ermini of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, noted that most children who run away are at least 12. An FBI agent also pointed to the lack of an issue she might have been running away from, such as a dysfunctional family or poor academic performance. Still, investigators believed that was the most likely explanation for her departure, but that for some reason, she either got off track or was abducted. The media attention went national. A month after Asha's disappearance, the Degree family appeared on The Montel Williams Show to call attention to the case. America's Most Wanted and The Oprah Winfrey Show also devoted segments to it. On August 3, 2001, Asha's bookbag and other items were discovered during a construction project off Highway 18 in Burke County, near Morganton, about north of Shelby. It was wrapped in a plastic bag. The worker who found it said the bookbag contained Asha's name and phone number. The FBI took it to their headquarters for further forensic analysis; results from that testing have not been shared publicly. To date, it is the last evidence found in the case. On the 20th anniversary of Asha's disappearance, the FBI confirmed that the bookbag contained a copy of Dr. Seuss's McElligot's Pool and a T-shirt depicting the band New Kids on the Block. Neither appeared to have been her property before they were found in her bag; the book was from the library at her elementary school. Later leads have turned out to be dead ends. In 2004, acting on a tip reportedly received from an inmate at the county jail, the sheriff's office began digging at an intersection in Lawndale. The bones that were found turned out to be from an animal. The Degrees took steps to keep Asha's memory, and the case, alive in the public's mind. In 2008, they established a scholarship in her name for a deserving local student. They host an annual walk to raise awareness and money to fund their search. The walk starts at their home and ends at a missing person's billboard for Asha along Highway 18, near where she was last seen. It was originally held on February 14, but it was changed to February 7 in 2015 and February 6 in 2016, as Harold and Iquilla felt it was not fair to participants to make Valentine's Day a somber occasion. Pictures of Asha, both real and those showing her as she might appear in later years created by investigators to help the search, still decorate the Degree house. \\"I fully expect her to walk through the door,\\" Iquilla says. Iquilla Degree lamented in a 2013 interview with Jet that her daughter's disappearance had not gotten as much media attention over the years as some subsequent cases of missing children. She believed it was because Asha was black. \\"Missing white children get more attention. I don't understand why,\\" she said. \\"I know if you ask them they will say it's not racial. Oh, really? I'm not going to argue because I have common sense.\\" In February 2015, the FBI announced that FBI agents, Cleveland County Sheriff's Office investigators, and State Bureau of Investigation agents were re-examining the case and re-interviewing witnesses. They also announced a reward of up to $25,000 for \\"information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance.\\" A community group is offering an additional $20,000 reward. The FBI announced 15 months later, in May 2016, that their reinvestigation of the case had turned up a possible new lead. They disclosed that Asha may have been seen getting into a dark green early 1970s Lincoln Continental Mark IV, or possibly a Ford Thunderbird from the same era, along Route 18 near where she was last seen later that night. It was described as having rust around its wheel wells. In September 2017, the FBI announced that its Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) team was in Cleveland County to assist in the investigation and \\"provide on-the-ground investigative, technical, behavioral analysis, and analytical support to find out more about what happened to Asha\\". The team worked alongside FBI Charlotte employees, Cleveland County Sheriff's Office investigators, and North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation agents for ten days. The agencies also meet \\"several times a month to go over the latest on the investigation.\\" Since September 2017, local agents and investigators have conducted approximately 300 interviews. In October 2018, the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office detectives appealed for information from the public about two items of interest that were found in Degree's bookbag: McElligot's Pool, a children's book by Dr. Seuss, which was borrowed from the Fallston Elementary School library in early 2000, and a New Kids on the Block concert T-shirt. An investigator said the items are vital clues.

Meteorological history  Similar to the formation of Tropical Storm Iris, Tropical Storm Joan originated from a tropical disturbance over the western South China Sea on November 5\\\\. Tracking eastward, the system quickly organized and was immediately declared a tropical storm on November 6\\\\. Early the next day, a reconnaissance plane recorded a pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa), the lowest in relation to Joan; however, this was measured while the system was a minimal tropical storm. Continued development took place over the following day as a well-defined wall cloud developed within the system. Joan attained typhoon intensity during the afternoon of November 8 and reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) shortly thereafter. Tropical Storm Joan made landfall in nearly the same location as Tropical Storm Iris in central Vietnam before rapidly weakening over land. The system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on November 9 before dissipating over Laos.  Impact  Due to the rapid succession of tropical storms Iris and Joan, widespread flooding and catastrophic flooding was reported across central South Vietnam. Roughly 90% of structures in three provinces were damaged by the storms and nearly one million were estimated to have been left homeless. Military operations during the Vietnam War were suspended by the typhoons. Joan killed 7,000 people in Vietnam by flood.

Later in January he published his vision for the force - preventing crime, protecting the public, and helping those in need. David Thompson, said more people ask for help from the police because cuts across public services generally mean more vulnerable people were involved with the police. Thompson maintains West Midlands Police does not always have the resources to provide the service the public wants and expects due to budget cuts and cuts in the number of police officers, also due to increase in crime including modern slavery and gang crime. Thompson said, \\"The level of calls we're receiving this summer [summer 2018] are very challenging [and] sometimes that service that we're providing [at] those peak times doesn't meet what the public expect. I get that. Sometimes that service will be a poor service, sometimes actually the service is what we can and say we will offer, and sometimes that might not always be what the public want to see.\\"West Midlands Police chief constable says force offers 'poor service' BBCWest Midlands police chief says public not getting service they expect The Guardian Thompson also wrote, ‚ÄúThe government has had a partial view of policing in the last few years. It was very interested in terrorism and high-end threats but less focused on local crimes, which had been left for forces and police and crime commissioners to manage amid steep budget cuts. This more local agenda has many positives in setting priorities but it has come with steep budget reductions and a widening mission. There has been a real-term reduction of police budgets of 19% since 2010, but ranging between 11- 25% across forces. (...) Crime is rising and so is the demand on our service. The calls do not get answered as quickly as they did. Officers are not as fast at responding to emergencies and more crimes are dealt with on the phone. Fewer high-volume crimes like thefts are investigated and as a result fewer offenders brought to justice. The visibility and proactivity of neighbourhood policing is much reduced. (...)

Injectional materials are used to control stress incontinence. Bulking agents are injected into the mucosa surrounding the bladder neck and proximal urethra. This reduces the diameter of the urethra and creates resistance to urine leakage. After the procedure, the pressure forcing the urine from the bladder through the urethra is resisted by the addition of the bulking agent in the tissue surrounding the proximal urethra. Most of the time this procedure prevents urinary stress incontinence in women.  Uses  A urethral bulking injection is one type of treatment for incontinence in women. Urethral bulking injections are considered by a clinician when the woman has urinary sphincter dysfunction, urethral hypermobility, persistent stress urinary incontinence after a urethral sling or urethropexy, or stress urinary incontinence in women who cannot undergo surgery due to other illnesses or conditions. It restores the ability to retain urine during coughing, laughing and other normal occurrences that increase inter-abdominal pressure Some women choose to have urethral bulking injections because they wish to avoid surgery or the use of mesh material. Another reason other treatments may not be chosen include the desire to maintain fertility. Woman who benefit most from this treatment are those who have a stable bladder neck and an inadequate muscle strength of the sphincter muscles that close the urethra. Urethral instability is identified by the angle of the urethra. This can be evaluated when the woman lays on her back and the angle of the urethral is greater than 30¬∞ during coughing. Tests are performed to confirm the diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence such as the bladder capacity to hold urine and the strength of the bladder muscle contractions. Diagnosis is aided before the procedure by a thorough evaluation of the woman. Information that is gathered prior to the injection includes consists of a medical history and physical exam. The residual, postvoid residual urine determination and urinalysis and urine culture help in the diagnosis. The surgeon will ask the woman to keep a diary of urine output and frequency. The physician may order a urodynamic evaluation to establish the diagnosis of intrinsic sphincter deficiency. A voiding diary and/or a measured voided volume gives an estimate of bladder capacity. A free-flow uroflowmetric examination gives additional information about flow rate, voided time and volume. A cystometrogram will evaluate detrusor over-activity, bladder compliance, bladder capacity, and abdominal (Valsalva) leak pressure. Another diagnostic tool is the urethral pressure profile. This measures the maximum urethral closure strength. The physician will use instrumentation and do a visual examination called a urethroscopic visualization.  Contraindications  A woman may not be a good candidate for the procedure. Contraindications for this treatment are having a current urinary tract infection, having difficulty emptying the bladder, having a urethral stricture, having a urethral obstruction or having fragile or sensitive tissue where the injections are to be placed. In some women, cancer treatments may have created changes in the urethra, bladder and sphincter muscles which would prevent the success of the treatment.  Available bulking agents  *Durasphere *Macroplastique *Coaptite These are the most popular urethral bulking agents in the United States now that Contigen is no longer available. The ideal bulking material should be non allergic, tissue friendly, not migrate and be long-lasting. However, this has not been found, and despite a prolonged search, nothing financially feasible as yet appeared to be better than the available bulking agents. Urolastic is a new injectable product that seems to be a good candidate to become the ideal product for a minimal invasive and outpatient treatment of stress urinary incontinence since it is not degraded by the body and maintains form.  History  Urethral bulking agents were first used in 1938 and incorporated morrhuate sodium as the injection material. Bovine collagen use began after 1989 and was considered the best example of treatment. All subsequent studies afterwards were compared with this agent. Its use was stopped in 2011. Other bulking agents have been in use since the 1990s. The use of some was discontinued due to complications, the 'unpleasantness' of the procedure and the cost of the procedure.  Research  Improved materials continue to be investigated. A successful bulking agent should be readily available, non-inflammatory, easy to inject, easy to prepare, efficacious, durable, inexpensive, biocompatible, nonimmunological, long-lasting, non-migrating (the size of the particles should be larger than 80 Œºm) adult stem cell injection therapy using autologous muscle-derived stem cells for the regenerative repair of an impaired sphincter is currently at the forefront of incontinence research. The implanted cells fuse with muscle and release trophic factors promoting nerve and muscle integration. Small pilot studies have suggested restoration of the urethral sphincter over several months' time. References * Hoffman, Barbara (2012). Williams gynecology, 2nd edition.

The game was released for the Ouya in 2014, and for Microsoft Windows in 2015. A PlayStation 4 version was released in August 2017, and a Nintendo Switch version was released in May 2019. Gameplay Duck Game is a 2D action video game that features shooting and platforming mechanics. The game has a single-player arcade mode where the user can complete challenges to get tickets, which can be used to unlock in-game hats and game modifiers (such as Moon gravity or explosive props), as well as local or online multiplayer with up to four other players. Duck Game has a simple premise: players die in one hit, and last player standing wins the round. The game features a simple control scheme: beyond basic movement controls, the player can pick up/throw a weapon, use their equipped weapon, strafe (walk backwards), quack, and ragdoll. The complexity in the game comes from the large variety of weapons players use and environments players compete in. Duck Game has several unique elements, including multiple hats, a quack button, and a ragdoll button. Development Duck Game was developed by Vancouver-based developer Landon Podbielski. The game was released for the Ouya on May 13, 2014. On launch, the game only featured a multiplayer mode, however in November 2014, single-player modes were added. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on June 4, 2015. At the 2015 PlayStation Experience, a PlayStation 4 version of the game was announced, with its release following on August 23, 2018. On May 1, 2019 it was released on the Nintendo Switch. Reception Duck Game received generally positive reviews from critics. The game received an average Metacritic score of 82 based on six reviews. Critics cite the multiplayer as driving the games appeal. Reviewers likened the game to other successful 2D brawlers, including Super Smash Bros. Brawl, TowerFall, and Samurai Gunn. Sean Flint was critical of the name choice, saying \\"it describes absolutely nothing about it other than the fact that it may contain ducks\\". Several reviewers have complained about the inconsistent level design, and lack of an engaging single player experience.

was a Chinese official most active in the Southern Tang dynasty as a court minister, royal tutor, and artist. A member of the Xu family, comprising many government officials and civil servants, and descendant of Emperor Wu, he served as the Grand Guardian of Li Yu and enjoyed a close relationship with the royal family. Early life and career Xu You was born in circa 960, in Haizhou, China. His father was Xu Zhihui (ÂæêÁü•ËØ≤), one of Xu Wen's five sons. Thus, by default, Xu was already respected for being Xu Wen's grandson. Additionally, many of Xu's relatives worked for the government. During the reign of Emperor Yuanzong, he became the Grand Guardian of Li Yu, who was heir apparent to the throne. As Grand Guardian, Xu successfully proposed the construction of a \\"clear mind pavilion\\", from which imperial commands would be relayed, on the palace grounds at Jinling. He was also the chancellor of the capital. After the fall of the Southern Tang dynasty, Xu You was appointed as a Song court director alongside Xu Xuan (ÂæêÈìâ). Xu is described as a loyal subject of Li Yu. Following the death of Yuanzong in 961, Li Congshan attempted to seize the crown from the heir and his elder brother Li Yu. Viewing this as an opportune moment, the younger Li tried to coerce Xu into passing him Li Jing's final will, citing their shared genealogy and Xu's father's respect for Yuanzong. Xu was not convinced with the unlawful suggestion, however, and promptly reported the matter to the crown prince. Consequently, Li Congshan was demoted from Prince of Han to Duke of Southern Chu. He was a \\"clever\\" inventor and reportedly built a working qiqi (), a time-measuring device, from scratch. By Xu's time, the qiqi had already been obsolete and virtually none of his peers knew how to operate one. He was also well-read in the arts, especially Chinese painting, and enjoyed travelling, particularly with the royal family. Xu died of an illness. Controversially, Xu Xuan commented on his death, \\"Would Zhou Gong and Confucius play tricks, and cause this man to die an early death?\\" This insinuated that Xu You was in fact a flawed official who contravened the teachings of the aforementioned sages. In popular media Xu is mentioned in a fictitious tale collected in A Record of Ghosts and the Living, in which he dreams of a \\"an emissary dressed in black\\" who informs him that he will \\"become Lord of the Northern Dipper\\". He is also told in his dream that Chen Kangbo (Èô≥Â∫∑‰ºØ) will be his vice- magistrate; both men die concurrently a year later. This story is cited in Chen Shiyuan's Encyclopedia of Dreams (Â§¢Âç†ÈÄ∏Êó®) as a reason for \\"the noble man who cultivates himself while awaiting his destiny\\" to heed his dreams. Xu You is portrayed by Beijing actor Gao Yuqing in the 2005 Chinese historical drama How Much Sorrow Do You Have.

The vessel, based on a concept developed by French naval architecture company Marine Assistance, combines the functions of the two existing French ships it replaced: the 1966-built patrol vessel L'Albatros and the 1986-built icebreaker L'Astrolabe. The new vessel is owned and operated by the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) administration, the French Polar Institute Paul-√âmile Victor (IPEV) and the French Navy. Since Chantiers Piriou had no experience of building an ice-going vessel, the French shipyard joined forces with the Finnish engineering company Aker Arctic in order to be able to bid against foreign shipyards such as the German Nordic Yards.Piriou construira le successeur de l‚ÄôAlbatros et de L‚ÄôAstrolabe.

It stars Hrithik Roshan, Yami Gautam, Ronit Roy and Rohit Roy. The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan. Principal photography of the film began on 30 March 2016. The film follows a blind voiceover artist who becomes disillusioned when his wife is raped and the perpetrators walk free. He becomes a vigilante and decides to seek revenge against those responsible for his wife's death, while also dodging police with a cover that no one would believe a blind man can kill someone. Kaabil was released theatrically on 25 January 2017. Roshan received the Nomination of Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance at the 63rd Filmfare Awards. In 2019, it was also released in China where it became commercially unsuccessful.  Plot  Rohan Bhatnagar (Hrithik Roshan) is a kind, happy young man who has been blind since birth and works as a voice-over artist for a living. Through friends, he meets Supriya Sharma (Yami Gautam), a working woman who is also blind, but proudly independent. The two fall in love and get married. One night, on their way back home after dining out, they are interrupted by Amit Shellar (Rohit Roy), a local goon and younger brother of Madhavrao Shellar (Ronit Roy), a well-known politician. He and his friend Wasim, drunkenly misbehave with the couple, enraging Rohan, and they have a heated exchange. The next morning while Rohan is at work, Amit and Wasim sneak into the house and gang rape Supriya. A horrified Rohan immediately calls the police; Officer Chaubey advises him to get his wife medically examined in 24 hours to prove the assault. While Rohan and Supriya are on their way to the clinic, they are kidnapped by Shellar's men and held captive for 36 hours. After being set free, Rohan and Supriya are criticised by police for the delay in getting Supriya clinically examined, and both are accused of being liars. Heartbroken, they return home. Supriya attempts to live normally but Rohan becomes silent and introspective, which hurts her. One morning, Rohan returns early from work to apologize to Supriya for not being as supportive as he should have, only to find her corpse, hanging from the ceiling fan. Madhavrao visits Rohan and reveals that his brother Amit raped Supriya not once but twice. Rohan finds Supriya's braille note, which ascertains that Amit had raped her a second time; this second assault led to her suicide. Shattered, Rohan changes. He implies to Officer Chaubey that he will avenge his wife's death, challenging that Chaubey will know who did it but will be able to do nothing about it, just like he did nothing about Supriya's rape. Rohan uses his voice modulating skills to lure the culprits to places that Rohan knows well. First, he tricks Wasim and hangs him, leaving Amit's handkerchief behind to frame Amit. He then lures Amit to the warehouse where he and Supriya were held captive for 36 hours. He finds Amit by scent, tying him down to be burned alive in an explosion. Officer Chaubey suspects Rohan for Amit and Wasim's murders after remembering his challenge, and puts him under house arrest. It is revealed that Chaubey knew Amit raped Supriya but did nothing after Madhavrao bribed him. Rohan gets past police with the help of his friend, and calls Madhavrao to a building under construction that was to be Rohan and Supriya's new home. There, Rohan kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Rohan later relates the story to Chaubey: he made it look as if Amit killed Wasim, then Madhavrao committed suicide due to the pain of Amit's death. With no evidence against Rohan, a blind man, Chaubey stands helpless. Rohan, his revenge complete, scatters Supriya's ashes at sea.

Critical reception  Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"On the whole, KAABIL is gripping, gut-wrenching and is likely to stay with you for a long time.\\". The Indian Express gave the movie 1.5 out of 5 and said, \\"Hrithik does all the heavy lifting and remains the only bright spot in this dispirited mess of a movie. He still has the moves. What he needs is a plot.\\" Meena Iyer of Times of India gave the film a rating of 4/5 stars, noting that the movie seemed to be inspired by the 1989 movie Blind Fury and the 2014 Korean movie Broken. Iyer praised Roshan's performance as his \\"all-time best\\", and felt that the character Rohan was \\"vulnerable as a lover and menacing as a killing-machine\\". Sarita A. Tanwar of \\"Daily News and Analysis\\" gave the rating of 4/5 stars stating \\" Kaabil is old-school, emotional and forceful. And an absolute must for all Hrithik Roshan fans. And if you aren't his fan, you might feel differently after this film\\". Writing for The Hindu, Namrata Joshi gave the film 2 out of 5 and called it a \\"predictable revenge and retribution saga that offers nothing new other than the visually impaired protagonists.\\" Rachit Gupta from \\"Filmfare\\" wrote \\"Hrithik carries this film on his capable shoulders. His perfectly nuanced performance is the reason you‚Äôll enjoy the thrills of Kaabil.\\" and gave the movie 3 stars out of 5. Bollywood Bubble gave the movie a rating of 4 out of 5 and said, \\"‚ÄòKaabil‚Äô will present you a far bitter truth. It'll draw a very uncomfortable, shrewd reality wherein the ones in greater need of support are the ones often thrown on the edge, laughed at. It'll show you a world in desperate need of more compassion, more kindness.\\" Joginder Tuteja of Movie Talkies gave the rating of 4/5 stars and said, \\"Rakesh Roshan has ensured that Kaabil turns out to be a commercial film for the audiences that has all the right ingredients in place and that too in the right proportions. It must have been quite a challenge to have three creative brains (Sanjay, Hrithik and himself) to blend seamlessly and deliver a product which is in just the right synch. That happens with Kaabil and that is the right reason why the final outcome keeps you glued on the screen right till the end.\\" Business Standard criticized the movie's plot and direction: \\"I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs more infuriating about this film ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs regressive or stupid. Or whether it‚Äôs regressive and stupid and joyless and monotonous and silly and pointless. In fact, let‚Äôs call Kaabil for what it is: a B-movie with well-known actors. Worse, it‚Äôs exacerbated by shoddy CG, fake earnestness and a needless item number.\\" Udita Jhunjhunwala from \\"First Post\\" gave the rating of 3/5 and wrote, \\"If you are able to look past many of these niggles it's thank to Hrithik Roshan's committed performance which keeps you rooting for his Rohan all the way.\\" Sukanya Varma from Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 on 5, and felt that \\"Kaabil serves nothing beyond an unabashed platform to vaunt a seething Hrithik, sentimental Hrithik, snarky Hrithik, sly Hrithik or spry Hrithik...\\". Saibal Chaterjee from NDTV gave the movie 2.5 out of 5, calling the film \\"...paisa vasool ( worth the money) fare, if not more.\\" Mike McCahill from The Guardian gave the film 2 out of 5, and remarked that \\"Sanjay Gupta's tale of a blind dubbing artist avenging the ghost of his wife is the sort of nonsense the Indian film industry stopped churning out 20 years ago.\\"  Soundtrack  Complete soundtrack album was released on 21 December 2016 by T-Series. The soundtrack for Kaabil is composed by Rajesh Roshan. The song \\"Haseeno Ka Deewana\\" is a cover version of \\"Sara Zamana\\" from Roshan's original soundtrack to the film Yaarana (1981). The original Yaarana version was sung by Kishore Kumar, and featured Amitabh Bachchan and Neetu Singh in the music video. The Kaabil cover version is sung by Payal Dev with rapper Raftaar, while the music video is an item number featuring Urvashi Rautela.

While it surrounds the plains named T'ula Chita Pampa, T'utur Juqhu Pampa and T'ulan Chata Pampa it receives the names Ch'alla Jawira (\\"sand river\\") and Jach'a Qura (\\"big herb\\" (river)). East of Lupipi it gets that name. It flows to the west. East of Wankarani it turns to the south and then west again near the village of Chuqi Phuju (\\"gold spring\\", Choque Phuju, Choque Puju, Choquepujo) where the river is called after the village. From now on its direction is mainly to the southwest. Before it reaches the village of Llallawa it receives the name Llallawa Jawira. The confluence of the Llallawa Jawira and the Desaguadero River is in the Willk'i Pampa (\\"gap plain\\", Willkhi Pampa) near T'uturani (Totorani) on the border of the municipalities of Calacoto (Qala Qutu) and Callapa at .

The film was directed by Prashant Nagendra and produced by Ratesh N. Shah. Cultural Identity of Mithila Synopsis Radhakant gets forcefully married to Tiru instead of his college love-Kamakhya. Tiru is a reflection as well as a representation of the ideal Maithili women, an epitome of sacrifice. She is well-aware of all the rituals and societal prescribed duties of her life. Tiru was aware that Radha would never full-heartedly accept her as his wife. The suppressing silence of Tiru soon became her enemy. This perennial silence made her spouse and in-laws even stronger and negligent towards her emotions. So much that Radhakant started contemplating on getting married with Kamakhya. Radhakant confesses his intention to marry Kamakhya in front of Tiru. She declares she has no objection. Now, Tiru becomes like puzzle to Radhakant, an unsolved and inviting puzzle. During marriage ceremony, the priest requests Radha to put up red turban on his head, as this has been the costume of Maithili marriage for centuries. Tiru gives him Lalka Paag, the same which was used in her marriage with Radha. Beholding this sacrifice of Tiru, Radha bursts into tears. Radha is mesmerized by the beauty of Tiru, pure and untouched by modernization. Radha now is in a dilemma, one side there is Tiru in all her innocence and purity and on the other is Kamakhya, the love of his life.

Architecture A view of the elevator from the base of the cliff The base at the Tagus River, with the ruined warehouses and wharf The elevator is situated in the urban area along the south margin of Tagus River, along the cliffs and arriba, oriented to the north, with a view of the city of Lisbon along Almada Velha. Its riverfront base fronts the old city along the wharf and river, in a garden that connects to important points along the river bank, including Fonte da Pipa (Pipa Spring), Museu N√°utico e Arqueol√≥gico (Nautical Archaeological Museum), Cais da C√¢mara (used by the city's water-taxis) and the old warehouses. The Jardim do Rio (River Garden) was authored by architects Helena Moreira and Anabela Fel√≠cio, marked by a principal access that begins at Fonte da Pipa and established an integrated connection to the elevator. The isolated elevator/overlook occupies a concrete platform, in hydraulic mosaics, in blue and white azulejo. A few blocks that fell from the cliffs are part of the group, and includes Portuguese pavement stone that form circular spaces, where exotic species of plants are planted. The lift is supported by electric traction motor, using a VVVF regulated-mechanism, supported by a robust metal frame. The concrete lift includes a communication system between ticketbooth and machine rooms, in addition to vertical chamber, constructed of reinforced concrete, semi-open with four emergency accesses (in addition to the principal accesses). It includes a copper roof with a \\"sandwiched\\" crawler panel and lacquered polyurethane, allowing light through translucent, honeycombed polycarbonate sheet, that faces the bank.

Meteorological history  track of Irma 115 mph Typhoon Irma hit the eastern Samar on May 15. It weakened over the island, but re-intensified rapidly to a 140 mph typhoon in the Sibuyan Sea before hitting Mindoro on the 17th. After weakening to a tropical storm, Irma turned northward to hit western Luzon as a 95 mph typhoon on the 19th. It accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical on the 22nd. The extratropical remnant raced northeast before abruptly slowing on May 23 well to the east of Japan. During that time, it temporarily turned north while moving erratically. The system later acquired a general eastward track by May 26 and accelerated once more before dissipating near the International Dateline on May 29.  Impact  Severe damage took place across the Philippines, with Leyte suffering the brunt of Irma's impact. Twenty people lost their lives across the country. Preliminary reports indicated that Tacloban incurred $2.5 million in damage. A gasoline explosion near Manila that killed 12 people and injured 18 others was partially attributed to the typhoon. On May 17, the 740 ton vessel Pioneer Cebu sailed directly into the storm over the Visayan Sea off the coast of Malapascua Island after ignoring warnings to remain at port. Carrying 262 people, the ship struck a reef while battling rough seas in the typhoon. Passengers began abandoning the sinking vessel soon thereafter under the captain's orders while message about the ship's sinking was relayed by the radio operator. A large wave then struck the ship on its side, capsizing and submerging it entirely. Of the passengers and crew, 122 went down with the ship, including captain Floro Yap, while 140 managed to escape. Rescue operations lasted nearly two days, with many of the survivors being stranded in shark infested waters for upwards of 40 hours. Of the survivors, 130 were picked up by a rescue ship while 10 others were found on nearby islands. Only five bodies were recovered in the area while the rest were presumed to be lost with the ship in an area referred to as the \\"graveyard of ships.\\" A trading vessel, the Banca Alex, also sank off the coast of Cebu with 80 people aboard; 60 were later rescued while 20 others were never found.

He was one of the best staying two-year-olds in Britain in 1988 when he won three of his four races including the Group One William Hill Futurity. He ran poorly on his only start in 1989 and was retired from racing. He had some success as a breeding stallion in Australia. Background Al Hareb was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Kentucky by Robert N Clay, Michael J Ryan & Hermitage Farm. He was from the first crop of fourteen foals sired by El Gran Senor, an outstanding performer in Europe where his wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, 2000 Guineas and Irish Derby. El Gran Senor was not a prolific stallion but sired several other major winners including Rodrigo de Triano. Al Hareb's dam Icing, was a high-class racemare whose wins including the Fillies' Mile in 1975 and produced several other winners including Dr Somerville (Prix de Cond√©, La Coupe). She was a daughter of Cake, whose other descendants have included the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Tarascon. As a yearling in July 1987, Al Hareb was consigned to the Keeneland sale and was bought for $575,000 by Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estates Co LtdKeeneland July Sale 1987 The colt was sent to race in Europe and was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. He was ridden in all of his races by Willie Carson. Racing career =1988: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Al Hareb started 4/5 favourite for a thirteen-runner maiden race over seven furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse on 9 July. He took the lead three furlongs out and drew away in the closing stages to win by eight lengths from Shallow Waters. He was then moved up in class to contest the Group Three Lanson Champagne Vintage Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse nineteen days later. Starting the second favourite in a six-runner field he briefly led the field at half way but faded in the closing stages and finished fifth behind the Henry Cecil- trained High Estate. With Hern suffering from ill-health in 1988, his assistant Neil Graham temporarily took over the training licence. After a break of more than two months, Al Hareb returned in the Hyperion Stakes (for horses with no more than one previous win) over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 8 October. Starting the 11/10 favourite, he took the lead inside the final furlong and accelerated away from his opponents to win by four lengths from the John Dunlop-trained Kalanski. Two weeks after his win at Ascot, Al Hareb was equipped with blinkers when he moved up to Group One class for the William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse and started the 100/30 second favourite behind Polar Run, who had finished second to High Estate in the Solario Stakes. The best fancied of the other six runners were Mon Tresor (winner of the Middle Park Stakes), Zalazl (Washington Singer Stakes, Stardom Stakes) and Child of the Mist (third to Nashwan in a maiden race at Newbury). Carson retrained the colt in the early stages and turned into the straight in fifth place behind Mon Tresor. Polar Run took the lead, but Al Hareb overtook him two furlong from the finish and stayed on well to win by one and a half lengths from Zalazl, with a gap of seven lengths back to the outsider Frequent Flyer in third place. =1989: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Al Hareb contested the Craven Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 20 April. He was made the 11/4 second favourite but finished tailed-off last of the five runners, twenty-three lengths behind the winner Shaadi. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Al Hareb stood as a breeding stallion in Europe for two seasons and was then exported to Australia.

Her work centers on belief systems and subcultures.  Films  Mar's film American Mystic premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010. Five years in the making, the film focuses on three members of fringe religious communities: Morpheus, a Pagan priestess building a spiritual sanctuary in rural California; Kublai, a Spiritualist medium working on a farm in upstate New York; and Chuck, a Lakota Sioux, raising his family according to his ancestors' way of life.  Writing  Mar's first book, Witches of America, was published in 2015. It was a New York Times Notable Book for 2015. The book is both a memoir and an exploration of contemporary occult practice in the United States. The book traces a brief history of contemporary occult practice, from Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis to contemporary Gnostic Masses held in New Orleans. She also explores her personal relationship with Morpheus Ravenna, a Feri witch she met during the filming of American Mystic. In the book, Mar also takes on the spiritual training required to be initiated into the Feri tradition and explores her own relationship to mysticism and ritual, as the daughter of Cuban and Greek immigrants. Although the book was received favorably by critics, it was controversial within the Pagan community. Mar's essays have appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The Believer, Wired, and the Oxford American.

The game is a spiritual successor to P.T. The game ran Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight campaigns.  Gameplay  Visage is set inside a large house in which terrible things have happened. Players will have to relive fragments of the house's history, each of them bringing the player closer to what is behind the dark history of the place by witnessing firsthand the \\"visage\\" each death left behind. The game is planned to be split into four chapters. As of July 2019, the first two have been released as part of the game's early access period. Players roam the house in a first person perspective, able to manipulate objects and doors and must manage limited resources such as lighter fluid and spare light bulbs as they explore the home trying to discover the truth. Locked doors and the keys that fit them form a central part of progression through the game. The house is designed as a semi- open world, with large sections freely explorable to the player, including areas not relevant to the current chapter. Ghosts will create paranormal events by manipulating the house as the player explores, sometimes in scripted events, sometimes as randomized events such as light bulbs burning out or doors locking. There are three ways to die: being killed by environmental hazards, being killed by the various ghosts and demons that inhabit the home, or losing one's sanity. Sanity, like similar systems in games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent is decreased by witnessing enemies or paranormal events and gradually over time by staying in the darkness. The lower the player's sanity gets, the more of a foothold the ghosts have in the house and the more the player will encounter random paranormal events or hostile ghosts. Sanity can be restored by taking pills which are scattered throughout the house, or by staying in well lit areas. The game doesn't feature a health meter, so being caught results in an instant death.  Plot  The game takes place during the 1980s in a centuries-old house in a secluded town. Over the years, the property has been occupied by dozens of families. While some lived peacefully, others were brutally killed under various circumstances. As Dwayne Anderson (the protagonist) proceeds through the environment of the house, he gathers information regarding the killings firsthand, using it to piece together the history of the house, while also avoiding the restless spirits that try to kill him.  Development  Visage has been in development since January 2015 and was announced in September 2015. The game has been successfully financed by a Kickstarter campaign running from January through March 2016. The release date was set for 2018. According to the developers, the use of jump scares has been kept to a minimum. The players assume the role of Dwayne, who is tasked against time to investigate the house and its surroundings to uncover the dreadful truth. The game uses an atmospheric soundtrack that also gives hints and clues to alert the players about the dangers lurking in the house. The game has been said to feature multiple endings and the developers state that it's not an easy game, taking about 8-10 hours to complete the main story. As of September 12, 2018, Sad Square Studio announced on their Facebook page that \\"we aim to release a playable version of the game this month on PC. A delay is VERY unlikely, but still possible. We'll let you know as soon as we know\\". On September 25, 2018, Sad Square studio announced that the demo for Visage will be released on Steam on October 2, 2018, and an early access version containing the first chapter, centered around the violent ghost of a young girl named \\"Lucy\\", was released in October as planned. A new chapter for early access was released on July 4, 2019. On February 15, 2020, Sad Square Studio announced that 'the main content of Visage is pretty much done', and that they are currently projecting for a fall 2020 release.

It includes recipes for medicines as well as food. To the spices found in Medieval English cooking, the book adds herbs, especially parsley and thyme. Sugar is used in many of the dishes, along with now-unfamiliar ingredients like violets and rosewater. The book includes recipes still current, such as pancakes, haggis, and salad of leaves and flowers with vinaigrette sauce, as well as some not often made, such as mortis, a sweet chicken p√¢t√©. Some dishes have familiar names, such as trifle, but different ingredients from those used today. The Jewell is the first English cookery book to give a recipe for sweet potatoes. Context The Elizabethan age represented the period of transition from Medieval to modern. Cookery was changing as trade brought new ingredients, and fashion favoured new styles of cooking, with, for example, locally grown herbs as well as imported spices. Cooking came to be seen as a subject in its own right, rather than being part of medicine or books of \\"secrets\\". Little is known of the book's author, Thomas Dawson, beyond the bare fact that he published several books on cooking including also his 1620 Booke of cookerie. Such books were becoming available to a wider audience than the aristocratic households of the Middle Ages, hence the \\"huswife\\" of Dawson's title. Book =Overview= The Good Huswifes Jewell gives recipes for making fruit tarts using fruits as varied as apple, peach, cherry, damson, pear, and mulberry. For stuffing for meat and poultry, or as Dawson says \\"to farse all things\\", he recommends using the herbs thyme, hyssop, and parsley, mixed with egg yolk, white bread, raisins or barberries, and spices including cloves, mace, cinnamon and ginger, all in the same dish. A sauce for pork was made with white wine, broth, nutmeg, and the herbs rosemary, bay, thyme, and marjoram.Dawson, pages 14‚Äì15 Familiar recipes include pancakes, which were made with cream, egg yolks, flour, and a little ale; the cook was directed \\"let the fire be verie soft, and when the one side is baked, then turn the other, and bake them as dry as ye can without burning.\\" Blancmange appears as \\"Blewmanger\\", made of cream, eggs, sugar and rosewater.Dawson, page 28 =Approach= The recipes are written as goals, like \\"To make a Tarte of Spinadge\\", with instructions to achieve the goal. Quantities are given, if at all, only in passing, either with vague phrases like \\"a good handful of persely and a few sweet hearbs\\", or as \\"the yolks of 4 hard egges\\".Dawson, page 1 Cooking times are given only occasionally, as \\"let them seeth a quantitye of an houre\\".Dawson, page 2 Directions as to the fire are given where necessary, as \\"boyle it in a chafing dish of coales\\" or \\"with a fyre of Wood beate it the space of two houres\\".Dawson, page 13 The recipe for a salad with a vinaigrette dressing runs as follows (from the 1596 edition): This recipe is taken up by the National Trust, which calls it \\"Stourhead herb and flower salad.\\" =Contents= The 1596 edition is structured as follows:Dawson, 1596‚Äì97 * Order of meat how they must be served at the Table, with their sauces for flesh daies at dinner. * A Booke of Cookerie (39 double pages) * Approued pointes of Cookerie / Approued pointes of Husbandrie / Approued Medicines for sundry diseases * The table of the book following gathered according to euery folio throughout the whole Booke [index] ;Part II (1597) The 1597 edition of Part II is structured as follows: * A Booke of Cookerie (72 single pages) * The Booke of Caruing and Sewing (38 single pages, not numbered)  Tearmes of a Caruer  (The book of Caruing)  How to make Marchpaine and Ipocras =Illustrations= A borrowed frontispiece and the title page, 1610 edition The book is illustrated only with a frontispiece. In the 1610 edition this has six kitchen scenes, including a three-legged pot over an open fire, cordials being distilled, a bread oven, and pots and roasts on a spit over a fire. =Medicines= Dawson's recipes included medicines, some of which involved sympathetic magic. The Good Huswife's Jewell described \\"a tart to provoke courage in either man or woman\\", calling for the brains of male sparrows. Torn sinews are healed by taking \\"worms while they be nice\\", crushing them and laying them on to the sore \\"and it will knit the sinew that be broken in two\\". =Editions= * First edition, Edward White, 1585 * Second edition, Edward White, 1596 ::-reprinted 1996, Southover Press, with introduction by Maggie Black * Third edition, Edward White, 1610 A book called The Second Part of the good Hus-wiues Jewell was published by Edward White in 1597. Reception The celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright comments on Dawson's trifle that it differs from the modern recipe, as it consists only of \\"a pinte of thicke Creame\\", seasoned with sugar, ginger and rosewater, and warmed gently for serving.Dickson Wright, Clarissa (2011) A History of English Food. London: Random House. . Page 123 She notes, also from the Good Huswife's Jewell, that the Elizabethans had a strong liking for sweet things, \\"richly demonstrated\\" in Dawson's \\"names of all things necessary for a banquet\\":Dickson Wright, Clarissa (2011) A History of English Food. London: Random House. . Page 147 The culinary historian Alison Sim notes that \\"the closest the Tudors came to sponge were sponge-like biscuits\\", which could be raised with eggs or with yeast; the \\"cracknels\\" in the Jewell were boiled before baking, being put into boiling water where they would sink and then rise to the top. Sim notes that Dawson's \\"fine bisket bread\\" had to be beaten for two hours. The culinary historian Ken Albala describes the Jewell as an \\"important cookbook\\", and observes that it is the first English cookery book to give a recipe for sweet potatoes (which had arrived in Europe after Columbus's voyages), while also listing \\"old medieval standbys\\". He comments that there are several pudding recipes, both savoury and sweet, including haggis. He notes, too, that it gives instructions for the marzipan figures \\"so beloved on the Elizabethan banquetting table.\\" The culinary historian Stephen Mennell calls the Jewell \\"more distinctively English\\" than the Boke of Kervynge and the Boke of Cokery from earlier in the century. It, like Gervase Markham's The English Huswife of 1615, was aimed at a more general audience, not only aristocrats but \\"housewives\\", which Mennell glosses as \\"gentlewomen concerned with the practical tasks of running households\\". Hence the book could treat not only food but medicines, dairy-work, brewing, and preserving. The historian Joanna Opaskar notes that the Elizabethans used what \\"may seem odd ingredients today\\", such as rosewater and violets, and that Dawson provides a recipe for salmon with violets, the recipe calling for slices of onion with violets, oil, and vinegar. She also notes that sugar was included \\"in almost every kind of dish\\", as well as spices that we would use in \\"sweet rather than savory dishes.\\" Notes References Page references to Dawson are from the 1596 edition; each folio or double-page spread has a single number, so there are twice as many actual sides as numbers.

The founder of a medical college in Tianjin, Zhang penned many articles on various medical topics. After his death in 1933, a thirty-volume compilation of his papers was released. Biography =Early life and career= Zhang Xichun was born in 1860, in Yanshan County, Hebei, China. Zhang was not linguistically inclined, unlike his father, and failed his imperial examinations in Chinese literature twice. Thereafter he switched his sights to medicine; a topic his father had introduced him to together with Chinese philosophy, spending more than a decade studying it on his own. In 1911, before the end of the Qing dynasty, he joined the military as a doctor and was lauded for his work. Zhang became Dean of the Li Da Chinese Medicine Hospital in 1918. From that point he became known for his incorporation of Western medicine into traditional Chinese medicine, and was successful in remedying illnesses not curable by Western drugs alone. He also began publishing a series of essays on a wide range of medical issues titled, The Assimilation of Western Medicine to Chinese in Medicine. In 1926, he established the Tianjin Institute for Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, which attracted \\"hundreds of students from across the country\\". About two years afterwards, he formulated a treatment for febrile arthritis combining aspirin with a traditional Chinese medicine, gypsum fibrosum. His cure for \\"obstinate vomiting\\", predominantly made of rhizoma pinelliae, was said to have \\"achieved very good results\\". =Death= Zhang Xichun died of illness in 1933 at age 74. A collection of Zhang's medical papers, comprising some thirty volumes and titled, Medical Essays Esteeming the East and Respecting the West, was edited by Zhang's son and released in 1934. After 1949, rights to the compilation, alongside a few other of Zhang's essays, were transferred to the Hebei Hygiene Association. Zhang's publications are now regarded as \\"an important modern classic of Chinese medicine\\". =Views= Zhang saw philosophy as complementary and beneficial to medicine, contrary to the belief by many of his time that the former inhibits the latter's development. As he articulates in his essay Concerning The Relation of Philosophy and Medicine: He also believed that modern and traditional medicine shared a common set of principles and thought that Western medical knowledge could be proof for ancient Chinese beliefs, such as in the case of determining that the heart cannot function without the brain. However, he was unhappy with the situation of his time that was Western teachings being seen as superior to Chinese ones. Wanting to end this \\"uncritical replacement\\", Zhang supported the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. =Legacy= Zhang is considered as one of the \\"four masters of medicine\\" of China, the other three being Liu Weichu, Yang Ruhou, and Lu Jinsheng. Hailed as \\"China's leading clinician\\", \\"one of China's great scholar-physicians\\" and \\"one of the leading reformers of Chinese medicine in the early twentieth century\\", Zhang is notable for being one of the first physicians to intermix Chinese and Western medicine, and his work is credited with allowing doctors to realise that \\"the two medicines could work side by side\\". In his 2014 work Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, Charles Buck praises his \\"genuine altruistic impetus to improve Chinese medicine\\", describing Zhang as a \\"passionate integrationist\\" of medicine.

He fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and lived the final years of his life in England. Life Gustav Mayer was born into a long-established Jewish mercantile family in Prenzlau, a small town in central northern Germany. The family had settled in Prentzlau in 1677, having previously lived in Oderberg. His upbringing combined traditional Jewish values and beliefs with a keen appreciation of German intellectual developments more generally. While growing up he acquired a deep knowledge of the German classics which would underpin his subsequent work. He studied Public Economics (National√∂konomie) between 1890 and 1893, being particularly influenced by the ideas of the so-called academic socialists (\\"Kathedersozialisten\\") Gustav Sch moller and Adolph Wagner. He received his doctorate for work on Ferdinand Lassalle from Basel, for which he was supervised by . For the next few years he undertook various jobs and other activities, at one stage embarking on an apprenticeship as a book dealer. In 1896, he took a position with the Frankfurter Zeitung as a trade and business journalist, and worked as a foreign correspondent for the newspaper till 1906. In geographical terms, his remit covered the Netherlands, Belgium and France. The work provided important networking opportunities and enabled him to get to know pioneers of Socialism in Europe such as Jean Jaur√®s and Emile Vandervelde. Gustav Mayer married Flora Wolff (1882‚Äì1962) on 26 October, 1905, which afforded him a degree of financial independence and enabled him to resign from his staff job with the newspaper. He embarked on a career that initially combined work as a private tutor with freelance journalism, but he soon turned to full-time scholarship, devoting himself to the study of the German Labour Movement, basing himself first in Heidelberg and later in Berlin. However, his research work was interrupted by the outbreak of war in July 1914. He was conscripted for service in Belgium, where he involved in the administrative aspects of the occupation. At the end of the war there were suggestions that Mayer's high-level contacts with international socialists might enable him to provide useful support to the German delegation sent to negotiate the peace, but nothing came of this. Although he made a point of not joining any political party,Gustav Mayer: Erinnerungen. Vom Journalisten zum Historiker der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung.

Despite his undoubted academic qualities and the support of Hermann Oncken, when it came to a vote by the evaluation committee, the dissertation that he submitted to the Philosophy Faculty of Berlin University in 1918 failed to earn him the hoped for habilitation qualification. The next year he nevertheless obtained a teaching position on the History of Democracy, and this was extended in 1922 to a full professorship on the History of Political Parties, initially at the University of Berlin and later at Frankfurt am Main. In the meantime, in 1920, he published \\"Friedrich Engels in seiner Fr√ºhzeit 1820-1851\\" (\\"The early years of Friedrich Engels\\"), as the first volume of a planned two-volume biography. The second volume was printed and ready for distribution in 1933, but following a change in government at the start of the year distribution was banned, and was produced in the Netherlands by the publishers Martinus Nijhoff of Leiden. The Engels biography was only the most high-profile of several biographies and compendia of letters and speeches from nineteenth century Labour movement leaders that Mayer produced during the 1920s and 1930s. Sources are imprecise as to when Mayer left Germany, but between 1933 and 1936 he appears according to some sources to have been based in the Netherlands. Another states that it took him three years to arrange his family's emigration, partly due to difficulties over the level of his pension entitlements which in the end proved irrelevant because of a ban on transferring pensions abroad. He was further impoverished through the application by German tax authorities of the country's Emigration Tax, which in the end amounted to 65,000 Marks. In 1936, Gustav Mayer spoke only broken English so that there was no question of obtaining an academic teaching post, but in London he was able to become a staff member of the International Institute of Social History (IISH). He was also able to sell his library to the IISH: in addition, by 1936 he had managed to obtain an (unpaid / honorary) fellowship with the London School of Economics. In later years, Mayer himself on various occasions lamented in writing the paralyzing impact of his bafflement as his family faced the application of anti-Semitic dogmas once the Nazi party took over the government of Germany. In 1940, with other income sources gone, a relative was able to secure him a ¬£300 annual stipendium from the Rockefeller Foundation. During the later 1930s Mayer produced some research on the early years of the Labour movement in Britain, but following the outbreak of war in 1939 the family was evacuated to the countryside where there were no research libraries, and Mayer was reduced to writing a memoir. By this time the tragedy of the slaughter of friends and relatives through the unfolding Shoah in Germany was compounded for the Mayers by the suicide, early in 1941, of their son Peter. Their younger son, settled in England, abandoning his first name Ulrich and becoming known as Philip Mayer, obtaining a doctorate from Oxford and building a career as a social anthropologist with his wife Iona whom he married in 1946.

Private sponsors alongside the membership and admission fees have kept the establishment functioning. Within a year's time of its inception, the Austrian Film Museum was inducted as a member of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF). Films preserved in the Austrian Film Museum were shown to the public in the museum's own cinema, located in the Albertina building behind Vienna's State Opera. In 1989, the ‚ÄúInvisible Cinema,‚Äù based on a concept of Peter Kubelka, allowed for viewers of films to be completely focused and concentrated on the viewing and listening of films. As of November 2002, the Austrian Film Museum has installed contemporary film and sound equipment to aid in the viewing of these historical films.  Leadership  From its inception, Konlechner and Kubleka remained as the co-directors until the end of 2001, when both retired. The role of director was then passed onto Alexander Horwarth.

History View of the fort from the beach The island of Pessegueiro, on which is situated the fort's twin, the Fort of Santo Alberto In 1588, with the approval of Cardinal Alberto, the Vice-Regal representative, Filippo Terzi initiated construction of the Fort of Nossa Senhora da Queimada, part of a project that also included the building of an artificial port to link the island of Pessegueiro to the mainland. Alexandre Massay took Terzi's place in 1590, when construction of the Fort of Santo Alberto (a project which had been proposed two years previously), began on Pessegueiro. The public works were interrupted in 1598, when Massay was transferred to Vila Nova de Milfontes, where he began building a defensive fort along the sandbar of Mira River. The project was restarted five years later. Between 1661 and 1690, the fort went through several phases of construction with long pauses before it was eventually completed during the reign of King Peter II near the end of the 17th century, while its twin, the Fort of Santo Alberto, as well as the artificial port, remained incomplete. The final layout of the fort, which originally had been designed in the Mannerist style, was simplified as a rectangle, suggesting to some historians that the later version was designed by Captain Jo√£o Rodrigues Mouro.Augusto Cabrita & Julio Gil (1986), p.283 In 1755, the famous Lisbon earthquake resulted in damage to the chapel and the batteries situated over the casemates. Between 1877 and 1942, the fort was occupied by a contingent of the Fiscal Guard (Guarda Fiscal). Following its abandonment, a project was conceived in 1962 to convert the fort into a hostel, but was never approved or initiated. On 18 July 1957, a decree classified the Fort of Pessegueiro, including the island of the same name, as a national heritage; this classification was clarified by a new decree on 21 December 1974. Between 1983 and 1985, repairs were made to the exterior parapets of the left bastion and central zone (the former port entrance) by the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN). Ruined sections were reconstructed and areas in risk of damage along the exterior walls were reinforced. Architecture The Fort of Pessegueiro is situated along the Atlantic maritime coast, and dominates the beach facing the Fort of Santo Alberto on the island of Pessegueiro. It consists of a star-shaped polygon with two triangular bastions oriented toward land and a polygonal battery towards the beach; these are encircled by relatively low walls. The interior of the fort is built on a \\"U\\"-shaped plan, and stepped in terraces. The thick masonry walls, constructed using stone wedges, align with the slope and are topped by a semi-circular railing above the surrounding torus. There are traces of a circular bartizan in the middle of the wall facing the sea. A main gate is situated in the middle of wall on the land side, accessed by a wooden bridge crossing a moat. The fort also has vaulted casemates and bunkers with chimneys enclosed by the walls. The Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Queimada, which has a vaulted ceiling, lies at the extreme north end of the fort.

The screenplay is based on the 2008 novel of the same name, written by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. The film stars Lily James, Michiel Huisman, Glen Powell, Jessica Brown Findlay, Katherine Parkinson, Matthew Goode, Tom Courtenay and Penelope Wilton. Set in 1946, the plot follows a London-based writer who exchanges letters with a resident on the island of Guernsey, which had been under German occupation during World War II. A joint British and French venture, the film was distributed and financed by StudioCanal and produced by Blueprint Pictures and the Mazur/Kaplan Company. In 2010, development began on a film adaptation based on Shaffer's novel. Initially, Kate Winslet was announced as the lead, with Kenneth Branagh attached to direct. However, both dropped out in February 2013. In October 2016, James signed on for the lead role, with Newell set to direct. The film entered pre-production in January 2017, with principal photography taking place across England from 23 March to 15 May 2017. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society premiered and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom in April 2018 and in France in June 2018. The film grossed $15.7 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was distributed in other international areas by Netflix on 10 August 2018 as an original film. Plot In 1941, on the island of Guernsey, four friends are stopped by soldiers for breaching curfew during German occupation. To avoid arrest, they say they were returning from a meeting of their book club, hastily named \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\". Five years later, in January 1946, the author Juliet Ashton is promoting her latest book, written under her pen name Izzy Bickerstaff. She has just been contracted through her publisher Sidney Stark to write stories for The Times Literary Supplement about the benefits of literature. Juliet receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a Guernsey man who has come into possession of her copy of Charles Lamb's Essays of Elia and who wants to know where to find a bookshop in England to buy another book by the same author. He tells her that he is part of \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\", which meets every Friday night. Juliet sends another book by Lamb and his sister, Tales from Shakespeare, in exchange for more information about the society and how it came into being. Juliet decides she would like to write about the society and arranges to travel to the island, despite Sidney's reservations. Her American boyfriend Mark proposes before Juliet embarks on the ferry, and she accepts. Upon arrival at Guernsey, Juliet attends a meeting of the society where she is treated as a celebrity by the members: Dawsey Adams, Amelia Maugery, Isola Pribbey, Eben Ramsey, and Eben's young grandson, Eli. Juliet is told that Elizabeth, the founding member, is overseas. Her daughter Kit is being looked after by Dawsey, and calls him \\"dad\\". Juliet asks permission to write an article about the Society, but Amelia reacts negatively to the idea. Instead of returning home as planned, Juliet remains in Guernsey to conduct research, telling the group that she is writing about the German occupation. Over the following days, she learns that Elizabeth had been arrested during the occupation and sent to Germany, but that her friends are still hoping she will return. Juliet asks Mark, who is in the armed forces, to try to locate Elizabeth. Juliet's landlady tells her that Elizabeth was no saint, hinting that she had been having sex with the occupying German forces in exchange for luxuries. Juliet asks Dawsey about the story, and he explains that he is not actually Kit's father. Her real father was Christian Hellmann, a German doctor who had worked with Elizabeth at the local hospital. Hellmann had been sent back to Germany, and died when his ship was sunk. Mark arrives in Guernsey, and criticises Juliet for not wearing her engagement ring. He brings information about Elizabeth, and Juliet relays to the society the news that Elizabeth had been sent to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. There, she was shot and killed trying to protect a fellow prisoner. Juliet and Mark return to London but Juliet is unable to settle back into her previous life. She breaks up with Mark and starts to write about the society. When her manuscript is finished, she gives a copy to Sidney and posts another to the society. Dawsey reads her covering letter out loud to the group and realizes that Juliet has broken up with Mark. He decides to go to her, and departs for London. At the same time, Juliet arranges to return to Guernsey. She is just embarking on the ferry when she notices Dawsey on the wharf, and the two reunite. Dawsey is about to ask Juliet to marry him when she interrupts to ask him the same thing. He accepts. Some time later, Dawsey reads to Kit from Tales from Shakespeare with Juliet next to him, both Dawsey and Juliet wearing wedding rings. As the credits roll, the Society holds another meeting off-screen, including Sidney, exchanging excerpts from books and discussion. Cast Production =Development= In July 2010, producer Paula Mazur announced that a script based on the 2008 novel of the same name, written by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, had been picked up by Fox 2000 Pictures. Despite a lack of financial incentives, Mazur said that she wanted the adaptation to be filmed on the titular island of Guernsey, stating \\"It's all a matter of economics and what looks right, but I can't imagine not filming in Guernsey.\\" Several actresses were mentioned as potential cast members, including Kate Winslet, Anne Hathaway, and Emily Blunt. On 4 August 2011, it was announced that Kenneth Branagh was set to direct the film, with filming aimed to commence in March 2012. In January 2012 Winslet agreed to portray the lead role of Juliet Ashton. However, in April 2012, the film was delayed for another year due to scheduling conflicts. In February 2013, Winslet dropped out of the project, as did Branagh. In April 2013 Michelle Dockery was offered the lead role; she later declined. In February 2016 Mike Newell was announced to direct the film, with Rosamund Pike \\"circling\\" the lead role. StudioCanal would finance and distribute the film. Eventually, in October 2016, Lily James was confirmed to star as Juliet. In March 2017 Michiel Huisman and Glen Powell signed for the roles of Dawsey Adams and Mark Reynolds, respectively. The film entered pre-production in January 2017, with filming set to commence in spring. =Filming= Principal photography began in March 2017 in North Devon. The port and village of Clovelly in North Devon represented Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, and many other locations in the same area were used for outdoor shots representing Guernsey as imagined in 1946. Exterior shots were filmed at Princes Wharf, Bristol, to represent Weymouth Docks in 1946. For the London portion of the shoot, photography took place on Sicilian Avenue in London. Scenes were also shot at the House of Detention in Sans Walk, Clerkenwell and in the foyer of Senate House, London. Studio work was completed at Ealing Studios. Filming wrapped in May 2017, with the first official images of the film released that month. Release The film premiered and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom in April and in France in June by StudioCanal. It was released in other international areas, such as the United States, Canada, Latin America and certain parts of Europe, by Netflix as an original film on 10 August 2018. =Critical response= Lily James was praised for her lead performance as Juliet Ashton. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81%, based on 59 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Far more traditional and straightforward than its unwieldy title, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society offers delightful comfort food for fans of period drama.\\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Harry Windsor of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, in particular praising Lily James and the film's modern tone saying, \\"Buoyed by a reliably appealing star turn from James, this handsome tearjerker mostly sidesteps the tweeness of its title to become, somehow, both an old- fashioned romance and a detective story trumpeting gender equality.\\" Trevor Johnston of Radio Times awarded the film three out of five stars, calling it \\"moderately engrossing\\". He praised the \\"likeable\\" performances, in particular that of Penelope Wilton. Geoffrey McNab of The Independent also awarded three stars out of five, calling the film a \\"jaunty and good-natured affair\\". He concluded that \\"The result is a film that, while perfectly enjoyable on its own terms, becomes every bit as cosy, nostalgic and superficial as the title suggests it is going to be.\\" Kevin Maher of The Times gave a very negative review, awarding one star. He called it \\"an inept and disingenuous froth-fest\\" and criticised the lack of chemistry between James and Michiel Huisman. Guy Lodge of Variety also gave a negative review, criticising the mystery plot as \\"neither particularly intriguing nor, as the rather straightforward investigation unfolds, terribly surprising\\". Olly Richards of Empire awarded three stars out of five, calling it \\"A well told, beautifully acted drama that offers nothing new but a comforting level of familiarity and cosiness.\\" and noticing the film's \\"gentle\\" tone. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph praised the film as an \\"irresistible romantic mystery\\" and awarding four stars out of five. He also commended Newell's ensemble cast, particularly Katherine Parkinson, saying, \\"he gives each of his cast members just enough room to stretch: a broad gag here, a hushed monologue there, and in Parkinson‚Äôs case both at once.\\" Anna Smith of Metro also gave the film four stars and praised the performances from Tom Courtenay and Parkinson as \\"classy\\". However, she considered the subplots too \\"clustered\\" and said that the film's two-hour runtime was too long. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film two out of five stars, calling it \\"naive\\" and \\"a glutinous 40s-period exercise in British rom-dram solemnity\\". Wendy Ide of The Observer also gave two stars, saying \\"even fans of the source novel ... might struggle with this photogenic but laboured adaptation.\\" She also called the casting \\"hit-and-miss\\" and said that \\"the plodding storytelling relies on large chunks of exposition\\". Paul Whitington of The Irish Independent was more positive, awarding three stars; he considered the film to be a \\"gentle, meandering drama\\". David Bradley of The Adelaide Review gave a lukewarm review, awarding a score of 6 out of 10. He favourably compared it to a \\"Downton Abbey reunion\\" and praised James, saying, \\"she presents a luminous image of sheer British niceness that unfortunately never quite existed.\\" References External links  Category:2018 films Category:British films Category:2018 romantic drama films Category:British romantic drama films Category:Ealing Studios films Category:Films directed by Mike Newell Category:Films produced by Graham Broadbent Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films set in 1941 Category:Films set in 1946 Category:Films set in Guernsey Category:Films shot in Bristol Category:Films shot in Devon Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in the United Kingdom Category:Films with screenplays by Thomas Bezucha Category:Films with screenplays by Don Roos Category:Guernsey Category:StudioCanal films Category:World War II films ","title":"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (film)"},{"id":"49352675","text":"Federation of Democratic and Liberal Parties (; FPDL) was a Spanish liberal political party (with a federal structure), founded in 1976.

All the islands were attacked either for provisions or the attainment of Spanish and Portuguese prizes.Clowes p. 493 A number of Portuguese and Spanish ships were captured and also included a battle at Faial which resulted in the capture of the fort and the main town, which was subsequently sacked and burned.Letter from Captain-major Gaspar Gon√ßalves Dutra, Arquivo dos A√ßores (1981), p. 304) The English were able to return home unmolested with a total of thirteen prizes - the expedition was a success and with a good profit for the investors although many lives were lost to disease and storms.Williamson pp. 49-51 The expedition was also a scientific one in that the eminent mathematician and cartographer Edward Wright carried out navigational studies that, for the first time, explained the mathematical basis of the Mercator projection.. Background By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and as the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War was still ongoing, Portuguese shipping was a fair target for the Royal Navy.Andrews (1964) p. 219 As a result, the Azores and the Cape Verde islands were also subject to attack - this was partly due to the influx of Spanish traders to the islands as a result of the Union but also a place for the Spanish treasure galleons to replenish for victuals before the final leg of their journey to Spain.Godwin pp. 18-20 With the English Armada being organised at the same time, a breakaway expedition to the Azores was also authorised by Queen Elizabeth I.Ballantyne & Eastland pp 26-27 George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, was put in command of a private venture of which he set up a number of ships which included the Victory, Meg, Margaret, a caravel and two other support vessels. William Monson a 20 year old at the time was second in command as Captain of the Margaret. Cumberland set off on 18 June 1589 from Plymouth and headed to the coast of Spain. Expedition On his approach to the Spanish coast Cumberland's ships seized a number of French Catholic League and Flemish vessels with Newfoundland fish stock to the value of ¬£4,500 which were bound to a rich merchant in Lisbon.Godwin p 25 Cumberland sailed on and reached the Azores islands on 1 August and then positioned themselves where they awaited the passage of the galleons from Spanish America.Williamson pp. 46-48 Within a few days Cumberland then decided to attack the group of islands for supplies and any ships that were there. =S√£o Miguel & Flores= Cumberland's first call came at S√£o Miguel - he flew a Spanish flag to fool the Iberian forces there and proceeded to the capital Ponta Delgada where he surprised and captured four small Portuguese carracks just offshore. These were laden with olive oil and 30 tuns of Madeira wine, besides woollen cloth, silk, and taffeta. On August 14 the fleet then put in at the island of Flores for water and food, but while there they received intelligence of certain Spanish and Portuguese ships that were at anchor at Terceira Island. After some quick repairs and a gathering of victuals unmolested, the English at once set sail for that island. =Terceira= Upon his arrival Cumberland sailed into Angra Bay, sighted, trapped, and then immediately launched an attack on the Spanish and Portuguese ships. He was assisted by another English ship, the Barke of Lyme, which was one of Sir Walter Raleigh's vessels commanded by Captain Marksburie which happened to be in those parts. Under fire from the fort's cannon he assaulted seven ships; the largest, a Spanish galleon where a running battle ensued but as the ship tried to escape - English gunfire damaged her so much that she sank taking with her pearls, silver, and 200,000 golden ducats.Childs pp 120-21 An attempt on a large heavily armed Portuguese carrack failed which then managed to escape. Another,a Portuguese carrack, however which had come from Malacca and India was captured when the English sailors boarded her. Overall seven ships were captured and these included the Spanish ships Nuestra Se√±ora del Loreto, San Juan, El Espiritu Sanctu, and the San Cristobal coming from Spanish America. The riches included silk, gold, silver, and porcelain.Godwin pp. 31-33 From two Portuguese ships Cumberland took cargoes of elephants teeth, grain, coconuts, and Guinean goat skins. Whilst the battle was raging English captives on the island managed to escape, stole a small boat, and were subsequently rescued by the Margaret. After the capture and destruction of the vessels the English ships gathered some water further round the island and set sail to Faial Island.Ballantyne & Eastland pp 28-30 =Faial= Forte de Santa Cruz present day in which Cumberland took by assault On 6 September 1589 the English fleet arrived off Horta harbour in Faial. The Forte de Santa Cruz which dominated the harbour was approached under a truce and a surrender was demanded, but the Governor of the place refused saying that their \\"oath and allegiance lay to King Philip of Spain\\".Godwin pp. 28-30 After this was done 300 English troops descended on the beach of Lagoa, launched an attack on the port then swiftly attacked the village, sacked the buildings and forced the residents to flee into the interior. For four days they plundered the possessions of the inhabitants, in addition to demanding a ransom of 2000 ducats. This eventually was paid by the authorities, mostly with the silver of the churches whose buildings were not spared by the destructive fury of the Englishmen. When they attacked the fort, the building was defended by less than fifty Spanish and Portuguese soldiers and was quickly overwhelmed after some resistance. The Governor Diego Gomez was however given a safe conduct by Cumberland personally. Fifty-eight pieces of iron ordnance were also captured and taken away and the platform on which they had stood was demolished, and the buildings within the fort were burned down. After gathering booty the fleet sailed to the nearby island of Graciosa whereby an attack was then made. The Portuguese villagers however immediately produced a flag of truce and some sixty tons of wine, and fresh food was brought out to the fleet, after which they then set sail from the island. By this time however a Spanish treasure feet had just entered Terceria and Cumberland not realising had missed them whilst being at Graciosa. George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland by Nicholas Hilliard =Santa Maria= The next prize was taken off Santa Maria Island, a small Portuguese carrack having come from Portuguese Brazil laden with sugar, but this was not secured without a severe struggle, in which the English lost two men and had sixteen others wounded. Cumberland sent the Margaret which was unfit to go along further to accompany the captured vessel which was sent back to England, with many of the hurt and wounded on board. Soon after Cumberland planned an attack upon the fortifications of the island which was undertaken at Captain Lister's advice. After they disembarked in the Vila do Porto, they climbed the rocky cliffs of Concei√ß√£o and were met by gunfire from the defenders, under the command of Captain-Major Br√°s Soares de Albergaria and his adjutant Andr√© de Sousa (as recorded by Father Manoel Corvelo, who also an active participant; extorting the defenders while holding an image of the Virgin Mary in his hands).Figueiredo p .75 Throwing rocks from the cliffs, the Portuguese inflicted casualties, disorder, and confusion, eventually causing the English to desist, retreating and leaving behind small boats, muskets, and cutlasses. Cumberland was himself wounded in the side, head, and legs, and Captain Lister was shot in the shoulder.Godwin pp. 34-35 Cumberland's men left to lick their wounds but not to be disheartened by this failure they then waited off Santa Maria in their ships. Within a few days they sighted an approaching vessel which was set upon and quickly captured - a Portuguese vessel of 110 tons bringing from Brazil 410 chests of sugar and a large quantity of Brazil wood. Then acting on information obtained on board her, set off in pursuit of the companion vessel the Spanish nao Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia.Godwin pp. 36 Two days later Victory caught sight of her, overhauled the ship battered her and then boarded her supported by the Meg. After a short bitter fight the galleon surrendered; the Captain was an Italian who had adventured 25,000 ducats in the expedition. The English explored their loot - Cumberland was surprised by what he saw: the vessel was loaded with hides, cochineal, and some chests of sugar, also with china dishes, plate, and silver. The remaining vessels now made for the coast of Spain. The fleet started for home, in expectation of being back before Christmas with their rich prizes. Cartographic voyage Edward Wright's map for sailing to the Azores The expedition's route was the subject of the first map to be prepared by Edward Wright - a prominent English mathematician and cartographer.. Wright a fellow of Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University was requested by Elizabeth I to carry out navigational studies with the raiding expedition organised by the Earl of Cumberland to the Azores. Derek Ingram, a life fellow of Caius, has called him \\"the only Fellow of Caius ever to be granted sabbatical leave in order to engage in piracy\\". In 1599 ten years after the expedition Wright created and published the first world map produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator's original 1569 map. Together this was published in Certaine Errors in 1599.Parsons & Morris, p. 61 Aftermath With the general success of the expedition they returned to England but on the way the fleet was struck by severe storms; hunger and disease also took its toll on the fleet as well. Many died of thirst on the return voyage as water had run out and the efficiency of gathering supplies dogged the whole expedition. After a brief stop in Ireland for supplies due to strong winds driving them there, news soon reached them that an English ship the Margaret with the richest prize Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia had been shipwrecked off the coast of Cornwall near Mounts Bay. However Captain Lister and all the crew save six had been drowned, but the vast majority of goods had been saved and kept for them by Sir Francis Godolphin. Meanwhile, the vessels struggled in the face of a heavy storm towards Plymouth. They had to give up the idea of landing at the place from which they had set sail, and returned to Falmouth on 27 December instead. Cumberland had taken thirteen prizes of various sizes with a varying degree of profit. On reaching London there was news from his family his eldest son had died but a daughter had been born.Dean p 138 On the Azores the fortresses were repaired and were reinforced but they had insufficient artillery, the military regiment could do little but prevent ships from off-loading their forces. This was the case in August 1597, when Walter Raleigh and his men attacked, sacked and set the village of Horta aflame, during the campaigns of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex during the Islands Voyage. The explorer John Davis joined and took part in the expedition.Palmer p 62  References  ;Citations Bibliography      * Category:Conflicts in 1589 Category:Naval battles of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604) Category:Naval battles of the Eighty Years' War Category:Naval battles involving Spain Category:Naval battles involving England Category:1589 in the British Empire Category:History of the Azores Category:Eighty Years' War (1566‚Äì1609) ","title":"Azores Voyage of 1589"},{"id":"49352767","text":"Victor Malu Military Tribunal is a seven-man special military tribunal (SMT) commissioned by the administration of general Sani Abacha in the year 1997, headed by general Victor Malu, to investigate roles played by soldiers and civilians in the coup plot to overthrow general Abacha‚Äôs regime.

It can be generally found in Great Britain. Its suborder is Polyphaga, the infraorder is Bostrichiformia, the superfamily is Bostrichoidea, and the family is Dermestidae. The carpet beetle is shaped like an oval and about the size of a pin. Description =Diet= Carpet beetles are well known for eating away at our carpets and rugs. Their diet consists of feathers, furs, insects, dead animals, processed human food, skins, cotton, silk, and wool. =Predators= A variety of predators like ants and spiders will feed on carpet beetle larvae. No predators will exclusively eat carpet beetles and the larvae will hide in dark places to avoid them. =Life Cycle= All carpet beetles will go through metamorphism during their lives. They will pass through the egg, larval, and pupal points to reach full maturity. This can take two months to many years. Female carpet beetles can lay over 100 eggs which can hatch after 7‚Äì35 days. Four generations of carpet beetles can develop every year. It can take 9 months to 2 years for a carpet beetle to become a full adult. However, adults only survive for a couple of weeks. On the plus side for the beetles, the adults are skillful fliers and can live for many weeks without food. =Signs you have an infestation= Signs that you have an infestation is spotting their pellets and skin. You should also expect to see the adult beetles and their larvae. Adult guernsey carpet beetles have patches of brown, white, and black. They move slowly and if you touch them they will roll over. Identify the source of the infestations by looking where there is more beetles, skins, and feces. =Outdoor Treatment= First of all get rid of all nests and hives in your backyard. Those are great places for beetles to nest which you do not want. Then, spray liquid insecticide around the perimeter of your house. Make sure so wear proper clothing at all times before you do this. =Indoor Treatment= Vacuum your whole entire house especially where you think the infestation is. Throw away any items that are already infested. Wash all your clothing and fabrics with soap and hot water. If you want, you can go the extra length by steam cleaning your furniture and carpentry. =Prevention= Close your screen less doors and windows at all times to prevent the beetles from entering your house. Inspect all plants and flowers before they enter your house. Store unused clothing in airtight containers and let your clothing get some sunlight everyday.

Background The IRA began a bombing campaign in Britain in 1973 when they exploded a car bomb outside the Old Bailey on 8 March of that year. According to the leader of the Balcombe Street unit, the first bombing they carried out was the Guildford pub bombings on 5 October 1974, which killed five people and injured over 60 others. In February 1975, the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce. Before the truce, the IRA Active service unit (ASU), later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (because of the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege), had been bombing targets in England since autumn 1974, particularly in London and Surrey. In total the unit carried out around 40 bomb and gun attacks on mainland Britain between October 1974 - December 1975. Bombing After the 1975 IRA‚ÄìBritish Army truce began to break, the IRA's Balcombe Street ASU stepped up its bombing and shooting campaign on mainland Britain. On the night of 18 November 1975 the unit chose to bomb Walton's Restaurant, in Walton Street, Chelsea. At approximately 21:50 in the evening, an explosive device was thrown by IRA Volunteers through the window of the restaurant. Two civilians, Audrey Edgson (aged 45) and Theodore Williams (aged 49), were killed. The explosive device injured 23 other people, the oldest of them 71 years of age. The IRA used miniature ball bearings within the bomb to maximise injuries. Two persons, a man and woman, died at St. Stephen's Hospital shortly after being taken there. According to Dr. Laurence Martin, the consultant in charge of the casualty department in St. Stephen's Hospital, four of those injured required emergency operations. Martin reportedly said: \\"We have been involved with nine bomb incidents in the past two years but this is the worst\\". Senior Scotland Yard official, James Nevin, deputy head of the bomb squad, said that the bomb used in the attack had been a \\"shrapnel‚Äêlike device\\" containing three pounds of explosives. Aftermath This was the Balcombe Street gang's last major attack during their fourteen-month bombing campaign of the British mainland. The IRA units bombing campaign would come to an end in December 1975 when they were caught at the Balcombe Street Siege which is where the unit got its name from.

Neidner, F.W. Sage, and Ned H. Roberts with rifles, 1912 Major Ned H. Roberts (1866 Goffstown, N.H.  1948), was an American hunter, competition target shooter, gun writer & editor, ballistician and firearms experimenter. Roberts was a prolific contributor to sporting publications, including Outdoor Life, Outers, Arms and the Man (later renamed as American Rifleman, and to Hunting and Fishing magazine, for which latter publication he served as Firearms Editor. His work on cartridge design in collaboration with Adolph Otto Niedner, Franklin Weston Mann, Townsend Whelen, and F.J. Sage led to a commercialized version of his own original .25-caliber wildcat cartridge introduced by Remington in 1934 and named the .257 Roberts. Development of the .257 Roberts Roberts announced in the March 1928 issue of American Rifleman the creation of a new \\"ideal, or perfected\\" .25-caliber cartridge superior in ballistics and accuracy to any other cartridge yet produced in that caliber. Dr. F.W. Mann and Adolph Otto Niedner had previously developed wildcat cartridges in .25-caliber made by necking down the .30-40 Krag and the .30-06 Springfield cases. The two .30-caliber cases held too much powder, however, and could not be filled with any existing smokeless powder. Although good results had been obtained with the Krag cartridge case, a rimless cartridge compatible with the best (Springfield and Mauser) actions was desired. He originally intended to base the new cartridge on the .30-06 case, as proposed by Townsend Whelen, but Whelen's friend and correspondent Harvey A. Donaldson pointed out, in a letter to Whelen that it would save work to modify the shorter 7x57 Mauser case. Roberts was a perfectionist and there followed years of trial-and-error testing which involved the making up of literally dozens of barrels for his .25-caliber wildcat, with different chambers, groove dimensions and rifling twists. Colonel Whelen once told Ken Waters that he doubted if any man ever spent so much time perfecting a cartridge as Ned Roberts did with his .25 Roberts, as he originally called it. Colonel Townsend Whelen and Mr. L. C. Weldin, ballistic engineer of the Hercules Powder Company advised using a shoulder angle of 15¬∞ in order to hold down pressures with the rather fast-burning powders of the late 1920s. This suggestion was adopted and the 7mm case necked down, formed to the new long-sloping shoulder, and trimmed approximately 1/16\\". The Neidner Rifle Corporation of Dowagiac, Michigan proceeded to offer barrels and complete rifles in the new caliber featuring A.O. Neidner's usual close chambering. The result was availability to an elite audience of especially keen and affluent shooters of the original wildcat .25 Roberts cartridge, designed to be capable of firing 1-inch ten shot groups at 100 yards from a rest with a telescopic sight. Griffin & Howe, the great New York custom gun-making firm, soon followed suit, making custom rifles chambered in their own slightly-modified version of the wildcat cartridge. The .25 Griffin & Howe differed from the .25 Roberts only with respect to the New York company, skipping one step and opting for a slightly longer cartridge by leaving the 7x57 Mauser case untrimmed. In 1934, Remington decided to make the new .25 Roberts cartridge available commercially. Remington eliminated case- trimming and modified the shoulder angle from the original 15¬∞ to 20¬∞ for greater ease in manufacturing. The resulting cartridge had a 1/16\\" longer case, and was given the slightly different designation of .257 Roberts. The new Remington cartridge went on to become, for decades, one of the most popular North American hunting cartridges. Schuetzen Rifle and Other Target Shooting Roberts published extensively on match target, Schuetzen, and long- range hunting rifles of both the 19th century black powder era and the early 20th century smokeless powder era.

The species was discovered and documented in 2015 by Sri Lankan prominent wildlife researcher and herpetologist Mendis Wickramasinghe and his crew from Loolkandura forest of Central highlands of Sri Lanka. It is distinguished mainly from other shrub frogs by the absence of nuptial pads and anterior and posterior dorsum without horny spinules. Its natural habitats are wet highland forests of Sri Lanka. As other frogs in the island, it is thought to be threatened by habitat loss and other anthropogenic works. The frog was named after Sri Lanka's finest tea exporting company Dilmah Conservation, for its dedicated efforts to biodiversity conservation on the island.

It is built in the style of Egyptian Revival architecture and has been in the ownership of the Landmark Trust since the 1970s. The current building dates from 1835‚Äì36. History The building is at 6‚Äì7 Chapel Street, Penzance. An older building on the site was owned by Richard Hitchens of Madron and later, John Fleming, (described as Perukemaker). The site or building was put up for auction on 3 April 1835 by James Tregarthen, a master mariner of St Mary's, Isles of Scilly and was purchased by John Lavin, a mineralogist of Penzance.Laws, Peter. A Review of the Architecture of Penzance. In: Pool, Peter A S (1974). The History of the Town and Borough of Penzance. Penzance: Corporation of Penzance. There is some dispute over the architect and the date of build. George Clement Boase (1890) writes that the Egyptian Hall was built by John Lavin, and a deed of 1850 states that he occupied 6‚Äì7 Chapel Street and ‚Ä≥... some time since erected and built by him‚Ä≥. In Reminiscences of Penzance (1883) the house was built in about 1839, ‚Ä≥.... which was built in imitation of the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London .... Laws (1974) writes that John Foulston of Plymouth may be the architect. Foulston designed the Classical and Mathematical School, Ker Street, Devonport in 1823 which the Penzance building closely resembles. There is an assertion that the Chapel Street building is an exact copy of Peter Robinson's 1811‚Äì12 museum in Piccadilly, London, which in not correct. Although an 1883 account (see above) states that it was an ‚Ä≥imitation‚Ä≥. Robinson rebuilt Trelissick the seat of Thomas Daniell in 1824‚Äì25. In his Guide to Penzance, published in 1845, J S Courtney describes the building as .... the astonishing gaudy and eccentric Egyptian House recently built by John Lavin, mineralogist and Egyptologist. Mineral collectors visited the building to see and purchase from Mr Lavin's collection. His son, Edwin Lavin, in about 1865, sold the collection for ¬£3000 to [Baroness Burdett Coutts who donated it to the University Museum, Oxford. In 1878 and 1879, the property is described as ‚Ä≥The Library‚Ä≥ in weekly advertisements in The Cornishman newspaper, and states that Mrs Daves stocks ‚Ä≥a large and complete stock of berlin and other wools, stationery, useful and ornamental articles‚Ä≥. Mrs Daves moved her business to nearby Queen Square in March 1882. The building was later neglected and in the 1960s hardly noticed. In 1973 scaffolding, which had been erected for several years, was removed to reveal a refurbished building and a new exterior colour scheme of brown and creams. The architect Paul Pearn of Plymouth concluded, that these were the original colours after stripping layers of paint from the elaborate mouldings which were mainly of coade stone. The building was fully restored under the ownership of the Landmark Trust.

In November 2019, Shareblue Media became The American Independent.  History and activities  Under its original name Blue Nation Review, the site published a report on the spending habits of former U.S. Representative Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), playing a role in his eventual resignation. In November 2015 the site was sold by Moko Social Media Limited, a multi-media platform developer, to Media Matters for America founder David Brock. Brock terminated almost all of the previous staff and hired Peter Daou ‚Äì a former Clinton Senate-staffer who worked for her 2008 Presidential campaign as a digital media strategist ‚Äì to head True Blue Media, LLC and to write for the website. The website relaunched as Shareblue in September 2016. Brock said that the main goal of the website was to get presidential candidate Hillary Clinton elected. During the primaries, the website endorsed Hillary Clinton and was critical of Bernie Sanders, posting stories like \\"With Bernie Sanders As Their Nominee, Democrats Can Kiss The Presidency Goodbye\\" and \\"Why does Bernie Sanders keep denigrating Hillary‚Äôs supporters?\\" Tad Devine, a Sanders campaign consultant, called it ‚Äúthe pond scum of American politics.‚Äù Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, viewed Shareblue more as a necessary voice in a world teeming with conservative radio, television and internet outlets that fire up the Republican base. After Clinton won the primary, Shareblue focused its attention on Donald Trump \\"exposing what it considers to be news coverage stacked against\\" Clinton. The group's major message was \\"that a shameful false equivalence was causing the media to soft-pedal Mr. Trump's many transgressions and overplay the few it could find on Mrs. Clinton.\\" In November 2019, Shareblue Media changed its name to The American Independent, stating that it would \\"go forward with an increased focus on investigative journalism in preparation for 2020 coverage.\\"  Ownership  Brock formed a Delaware-based corporation, True Blue Media, LLC, to manage his ownership stake in the website.

The arena was constructed after the City of Norfolk and the military found a need to construct an entertainment venue in the city after the population of the city doubled between 1938 and 1941 as a result of World War II-related military buildup. The building remains standing but has been converted into a storage and administrative facility for the adjoining Harrison Opera House. History =Construction= The building was constructed with combined funds from the City of Norfolk, who gave $245,000, and the Military, who allocated $278,000 from the Federal War Fund. The building, designed by architect Clarence Neff, contained a 3,000-person auditorium and sports arena and a 1,800-person theater. The City of Norfolk took full ownership of the facility in 1947. =Operation= The venue was host to a large variety of events: trade shows, conventions, industry events, concerts, high school and college graduations, plays, and the television studios of the predecessor to WTKR. Elvis Presley was one prominent act to play at the Norfolk Auditorium. The venue also served as the alternate home to the William & Mary Indians basketball team; the Indians (now known as the Tribe) usually played one or two home games a year in Norfolk (away from their usual home at Blow Gymnasium in Williamsburg). =Decline and renovation= The building began to fall out of use with the opening of the modern Norfolk Scope Arena in 1971. William & Mary stopped playing games in Norfolk and Old Dominion University (formerly known as the College of William and Mary in Norfolk) began playing its basketball games at the ODU Fieldhouse on its campus. Nonetheless, the building saw a massive renovation in 1993 in order for the Virginia Opera, which was founded in 1974 by a group of community leaders organized by Edythe Harrison, to make use of the auditorium's Center Theater. The renovation, which cost around $10 million, added \\"a dynamic new facade, a three story grand lobby with floor to ceiling windows, glittering chandeliers, and an enclosed elegant staircase to the grand foyer and balcony levels.\\" The theater-portion of the theater, with a new seating capacity of 1,632, was henceforth known as the Harrison Opera House. =Current status= The old gymnasium and arena, which is still visibly attached to the back of the renovated Opera House, is no longer in use and now serves as a storage and construction area for the Virginia Opera as well as the location for the Opera's administrative offices.

While white people enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the world, the lives of black people were carefully circumscribed so that they enjoyed few rights with no legal recourse.

R. Sayer. He was District Officer for the Northern District of the New Territories and acted as Magistrate presiding over the Small Debts Court in the New Territories on several occasions in the 1930s. In 1936, he was appointed Deputy Clerk of Councils and in 1937 he was the Superintendent of Imports and Exports. On the eve of the Japanese occupation, he was the Principal Assistant of the Colonial Secretary and was interned during the occupation. Megarry acted as the Secretary for Chinese Affairs in the early post-war Hong Kong and was appointed Official Member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong in 1947. He perceived that Chiang Kai- shek's Kuomintang government on the Mainland China had increased significant influence in Hong Kong during the Japanese occupation, much larger than in reality, by enlisting Triad members to subversive activities against the Japanese. He believed that Kuomintang attempted to influence and control by \\"systemic blackmail\\" the Hong Kong newspapers and to dominate the seamen's unions by supporting the unions in labour disputes. Megarry suggested Governor Mark Aitchison Young to buy off the Triad bands in order to counter the Kuomintang influence. The observations of Megarry made Young worried about his proposed democratic reform which would invite infiltration of the Kuomintang. The plan was eventually turned down by Young's successor, Alexander Grantham. Megarry also became the first chairman of the Public Service Commission, a principal statutory advisory body to the Governor on civil service appointments, promotions and discipline, on 3 August 1950 with two members John Roberts Jones and Sir Man Kam Lo. He served on the commission until March 1951 and replaced by Justice Ernest Hillas Williams.

Early life and education He was born in Worcester, the eldest son of William Caldicott, a hop merchant and amateur musician. At the age of nine he became a choirboy in Worcester Cathedral, where several of his brothers and half-brothers subsequently also sang. He rose to be the leading boy treble, and, while taking part in the Three Choirs Festival, formed the ambition to conduct an oratorio of his own in the cathedral. At the age of fourteen his voice broke, and he was articled to William Done, the cathedral organist. He remained at Worcester, acting as assistant to Done until 1863, when he entered the Leipzig Conservatory to complete his studies. He remained at Worcester, acting as assistant to Done until 1863, when he entered the Leipzig Conservatory to complete his studies, returning to the city in 1865 to become organist at St. Stephen's Church and honorary organist to the municipal corporation. Career In 1878 Caldicott graduated from Cambridge University as a Bachelor of Music and began to achieve success with a series of glees based on nursery rhymes. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\", Score in W. F. Sudds, The Part Song Galaxy (1882), pp.50-57 the first of these, was awarded a special prize in a competition instituted by the Manchester Glee Society in the year of his graduation.

In the wake of his popularity, both in Britain and abroad, he was now commissioned to compose an oratorio for the Worcester festival. He chose the story of the Widow of Nain as subject, writing both libretto and music himself, and on 12 September 1881 realised his boyhood dream by conducting his oratorio in the cathedral. In 1882 Caldicott left Worcester for Torquay, but a few months later settled in London. He then began to compose operettas for Thomas German Reed performed at St. George's Hall, London, the first being Treasure Trove, performed in 1883. Reed produced twelve others, including A Moss Rose Rent, 1883; Old Knockles, 1884; In Cupid's Court, 1885; A United Pair, 1886; The Bosun's Mate, 1888; The Friar; Wanted an Heir; In Possession; Brittany Folk; Tally Ho!

He afterwards conducted at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, where two operettas, All Abroad and John Smith, commissioned by Carl Rosa, were performed in 1889‚Äì90. He went to the United States in 1890 as conductor to Agnes Huntingdon's light opera company. After his return to England he was appointed a professor at the Royal College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music. In 1892 he resigned these posts on being appointed principal of a private teaching establishment styled the London College of Music. He also became conductor at the Comedy Theatre in 1893. Incessant work overtaxed his strength, and in 1896 cerebral exhaustion gradually developed. His last composition was a part song, \\"The Angel Sowers\\", composed for J. S.

History The estate is mentioned in written sources for the first time in the late 14th century. At one point it belonged to Karl Ulfsson, Lord High Constable of Sweden. In 1429 it became the property of King Charles VIII of Sweden. After his death it passed to his daughter and through her marriage to the Gyllenstierna family. It stayed in the Gyllenstierna family for almost 250 years, until in 1720 it passed by marriage to Count Arvid Horn. For three generations it stayed within the Horn family. During the 19th century, it belonged to the families Thott and Posse but was sold in 1852 to the Crown Prince, the future King Charles XV of Sweden. The prince, however, sold the estate in 1855, and it subsequently changed ownership many times. Architecture The manor is located on a small island in an inlet of the Baltic Sea. The medieval estate included a castle surrounded by a moat located approximately south of the present manor. The ruins of the castle, destroyed during the Dacke War in 1542, are still partially visible. The presently visible main building of the manor was built during the 18th century. Designs were made already during the 1730s by architect Carl H√•rleman but construction did not commence until the 1770s. The designs were then probably somewhat altered by architect Jean Eric Rehn. The main building is a two-storey building with an extension protruding from the middle of the facade towards the garden. There are two wings, built at the same time as the main building, as well as several outbuildings and annexes.

Meteorological history  The incipient disturbance that became Super Typhoon Kit was first identified on June 20 near Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia. The JMA designated that system as a tropical depression that day as the system moved steadily westward. The JTWC followed suit with this classification on June 22 following an investigation by reconnaissance. Early the next day, the depression acquired gale-force winds and was dubbed Tropical Storm Kit. Turning to the northwest, Kit developed a 35‚Äì55 km (20‚Äì35 mi) wide eye and reached typhoon status late on June 23. Explosive intensification ensued late on June 24 into June 25; Kit's central pressure dropped 51 mbar (hPa; 1.51 inHg) in 18 hours from 965 mbar (hPa; 28.50 inHg) to 914 mbar (hPa; 26.99 inHg). During this time, Kit's eye contracted to . Typhoon Kit June 26, 1966 surface analysis At 06:00 UTC on June 26, the JMA estimated Kit's pressure to have abruptly dropped to 880 mbar (hPa; 25.99 inHg), which would rank it among the top ten most intense tropical cyclones on record. Around this time, the JTWC estimated Kit to have attained peak winds of 315 km/h (195 mph); however, these winds are likely an overestimate. A later reconnaissance mission on June 26 reported a pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg), the lowest observed in relation to the typhoon. Weakening ensued thereafter as the system accelerated to the north-northeast. Retaining typhoon strength, Kit brushed southeastern Honshu, Japan, on June 28, passing roughly 155 km (100 mi) east of Tokyo. The system subsequently weakened to a tropical storm and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone south of Hokkaido on June 29. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported the remnants of Kit to have dissipated the following day near northeastern Hokkaido. However, the JMA states that the system turned eastward and accelerated over the north Pacific before losing its identity on July 3 near the International Dateline.  Impact  Although the center of Kit remained offshore, torrential rains and damaging winds wreaked havoc in eastern Japan. An estimated of rain fell across the region, triggering deadly landslides and floods. More than 128,000 homes were affected by flooding, of which 433 collapsed.

It is possible that in the beginning of his career he was influenced by the Utrecht Caravaggisti and Vermeer's portrait paintings as is shown in a signed painting of the Madonna and Child (Auctioned at Live Auctioneers). The Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent holds two compositions by van Orley with mythological scenes set in lush Classicist landscape. Richard van Orley created a series of paintings on the life of Saint Norbert for Tongerlo Abbey, only one of which survives (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). He created another series of four religious compositions on the same theme for Grimbergen Abbey. He also painted a Portrait of abbot Augustinus Willem Van Eeckhout who commissioned this series.Schilderijen in het koor at Grimbergen Abbey Van Orley created a number of detailed gouaches, mostly on parchment.

Academic contributions  = Complex dynamic systems =  Human dynamics  In 1971, while working on his PhD thesis at Columbia University, under the supervision of Martin K. Starrhttps://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/History-and-Traditions/Miser- Harris-Presidential-Portrait-Gallery/Martin-K.-Starr (for modeling), William H. Newman(for management) and Noel Tichy (for individual behavior), Professor Thietart proposed a ‚Äòhuman model‚Äô in the professional work context. His work extended that of the System Dynamics Group at MIT founded in the early sixties by Jay W. Forrester. His model was based on the general theory of systems and the simulation programs were written in DYNAMO (programming language). His model of human-system is made of five subsystems in interaction. The subsystems are 1 / the motivation subsystem, 2 / the satisfaction subsystem, 3 / the learning subsystem 4 / the decision subsystem and, 5 / the performance subsystem. Each of these sub-systems is composed of multiple loops of action and feedback. The simulation is performed in a work context in which man is subjected to various types of control. Although richer and more complex than previous representations of individual behavior, ‚Äòthe man‚Äô of Thietart nevertheless remains a determined man, as recalled by Jacques Lesourne in the preface of the book ‚Äúla dynamique de l‚Äôhomme au travail‚Äù published in 1977. Though not followed extensively, the book has nevertheless been an important contribution to the scientific representation of man in a work context.  Chaotic organization  According to Thietart and Forgues, organizational processes (decision-making, innovation, crisis) are potentially chaotic. It is the coupling of stabilizing forces (control, planning, and structure) and destabilizing forces (individual initiative, innovation, risk taking) that produces under certain conditions, chaos in organizations. Chaos, in their writings is not a metaphorical term, but is grounded in mathematics.. In a situation of chaos, induced by tight coupling between forces of stability and instability, forecasting becomes impossible except for the very short term. Also, replication of successful practices of the past is, at best, ineffective for the future. Finally, similar behaviors should be observed at different levels (scales) of the organization. Forces in play are functional to the extent that the destabilizing ones push the organization towards change and prepare it for an unknown future. Forces that push the organization towards order help in making sense of organized action. The challenge of management then lies in finding a balance between these opposing forces. Managerial recommendations of this research underscore the need to proceed step by step in the face of unpredictability, to encourage experimentation that renders the organization ready when the future reveals itself and to rely on dialectic methods to question current organizational practices.  Strategic dynamics  In this line of research, Professor Thietart addresses a central strategic question: namely, can leaders choose the timing of their strategic action? He challenges the idea that the time for strategic action and consequently its dynamics is controlled by the \\"strategist\\". On the basis of an in-depth study of a company over a period of forty two years, Thietart shows that although the \\"strategist\\" (the agent) is partly responsible for the dynamics, over time, strategy and its evolution of strategy are to a large extent self-organized, anchored in the past and impacted by chance. His results challenge the idea that strategic action and particularly its temporal nature could be attributed to the deliberate choice of the leader. He shows that the evolution of the strategy is the result of a complex combination of will, chance, determinism and self-organization. In his conclusion, he suggests that with the exception of periods of great stability, the strategist has little direct control over when to act. The strategist may choose the content of his/her strategy and the sequence of actions but not when to act. It is through the organization of his/her actions that he/she might have an influence on the overall dynamics of the strategy. The greater the degree of organization of the strategist‚Äôs actions, the greater is the stability of the strategy dynamics. An intermediate degree of organization, meanwhile, favors the phenomena of emergence while the lack of organization leads to disorder. =Strategic movements=  Life cycle The idea that appropriate company strategies depend on where a company is in its life cycle is not recent. However, Thietart and Vivas show that previous research on this idea is fragmented and prescriptive. To remedy this, they evaluated the relative effectiveness of different strategies for more than 1100 activities depending on the phase of their life cycle (growth, maturity, and decline). They show that successful strategies at these different phases differ and depend on the pursued objective (long or short term). Their research supports the idea that a good match between internal capacity and competitive environment is required.  Outsourcing  Thietart and Jain address two important issues in outsourcing: 1 / decision to make or buy, 2 / competitive dynamics between companies and its impact on the outsourcing decision. With respect to the first issue, they show that a company‚Äôs strategic capability changes the threshold at which an outsourcing decision is made. Due to the specific capabilities of some companies, the boundary between governance by the market and that of the hierarchy is changed. They suggest this as a way to seamlessly integrate the theories of Resource-based view and Transaction cost. For the second issue, they explore the competitive dynamic between companies and its impact on outsourcing decisions. Through a computer simulation of competing companies, they show that outsourcing implemented by a company influences the relative performance of other companies, thereby initiating a succession (a cascade) of outsourcing decisions.  Decline and revitalization  According to Thietart, corporate decline is not inevitable. A company can, even in a declining situation, continue to create value. He shows that the strategies for declining industries and their revitalization are based on the aimed objective (growth or profit). They are also based on an adequate balance between strategic positioning of the company and its competitive environment. He stresses that the traditional measures of downsizing are not the only solutions. Companies must instead rely on their unique abilities to adopt a differentiated positioning that meets the constraints of their environment and therein rests on a good strategy. =Strategic decision making= Chance, choice, inevitability Thietart and De Rond claim that the belief in freedom of strategic choice is necessary because to motivate choice, one must believe that choice makes a difference. However, there is a chance that questioning the scope of that choice may open up new possibilities for future actions. Strategic choice is not enough to drive strategy. Choice, like chance is a contributing, but not the only factor that drives strategy. A determining causal context is needed to interpret and leverage results offered by random occurrences. So, strategy is to be made of choice, chance and inevitability induced by external and internal constraints to which it is subject.  Strategic Mix Thietart suggests that strategy formation does not originate from a rational, logical and deductive approach only. Strategy formation is the product of several processes -rational, organizational and political - that interact according to their respective strengths. The conventional approaches of strategic planning focus on a rational process. However, there is also an organizational process that relies on the means and resources that are mobilized. Finally, there is a political process that forces organizational actors pursuing different objectives to negotiate. The result is a \\"mix\\" of different approaches, without which the best strategy on paper will have a short life and will never be implemented. Inter-relational dynamics Thietart and Bergada√† propose a process of strategy formation through a digitized and decentralized network, the objective of which is to facilitate strategic decision making and its implementation. The process is based on the dynamic interaction between actors linked by a network of computers through which they communicate and collectively build a strategy. The process not only takes advantage of structured approaches to strategic decision making, but also underscores the natural communication processes that exist within organizations. It also uses conflict as a source of creativity while seeking consensus to facilitate future implementation of strategy. Finally, it allows everyone to act according to their perceived role. Strategic Information Under the assumption that information on the competitive environment is crucial, Thietart and Vivas focus on an often neglected resource for acquiring this information - vendors and sales people who are in contact with customers Their focus is built on the fact that more than any other feature, it is the speed of communication which makes the difference between a missed and a seized opportunity. Based on a sample of sales persons of a large industrial company, Thietart and Vivas emphasize trust, training and participation in communicating adequate information. . Vendors and sales people are uniquely positioned between the company and its environment and they constitute an effective communication channel. They stress the importance of using these too often untapped human resources as a source of strategic information. =Management of organizations= Management Thietart defines management as \\"A set of intentions (planning)-transformed into action by a bureaucracy (the organization), its actors (activation) and regulated by a control system (control).‚Äù He further adds that, \\"A manager [...] must implement the technical, financial and human resources to accomplish its task and achieve the objectives of [the organization]\\". For him there are not 5 functions‚Äîas posited by Henri Fayol‚Äîbut four: planning, organization, activation, control, which puts him in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Managers and Shareholders Thietart, studying the tension between the interests of shareholders and those of managers, shows how to achieve a balance between managers and controlling shareholders. As part of the theories of agency and transaction cost economics, he highlights, in a longitudinal study of more than sixty years of a major French company in the IT sector, the link between types of control and ownership structure. Mutual Organization For Thietart and Koenig one of the challenges of strategic alliances between firms is their management. They highlight patterns of behavior observed in successful alliances and compare them to the patterns of behaviour of alliances facing major management problems. They do so in the context of y co-operation over time between firms in the European aeronautics sector. They find an original form of successful cooperation which they call ‚Äòmutual organization‚Äô. Airbus and ESRO (European Space Research Organization) cooperation at its inception is a perfect illustration of this form of cooperation. Innovation Management In this field, Thietart has explored two topics. The first study with Horwitch focuses on the identification of links that should exist between \\"high tech\\" activities. This is to address the problem of interdependence or independence of activities and to determine when an activity must be tightly controlled or should be left autonomous. The research is based on the study of two hundred fifty high-tech activities. The second study, with Xuereb, deals with cognitive processes: bureaucratic, strategic, and organizational that a firm implements to manage the complexity and uncertainty inherent to innovation projects. These processes, they say, are intended to draw boundaries to a complex system that would allow actors within the system to operate rationally. The research is based on the analyses of about twenty innovation processes and two hundred innovative projects. Strategy and Management One of the conditions for strategy to succeed, according to Thietart and Horovitz, is its proper alignment with the management system that supports it. In a study of fifty diversified and non-diversified businesses, they highlight the necessary link between diversification strategies and management systems. Management systems are defined as being composed of the organization, planning, control and activation (\\"staffing\\" and \\"directing\\"). =Research methods= Inter-disciplinary approaches ‚ÄúM√©thodes de Recherche en Management‚Äù (Doing Management Research, in its English adaptation) is a book on research methods. It is the result of a collaboration between Thietart (acting as coordinator) and a score of doctoral students, all of whom went ahead to hold academic positions in universities in France and abroad. The project started from the premise that doing management research does not imply following a linear trajectory but rather a trajectory that incorporated feedback between an intuition, exploration and implementation. Drawing on the expertise of each author, but through a collective process of self-criticism, the book aims to help the reader/researcher facing a problem with the methodological tools they may need. Historical Approaches Thietart and Marmonier advocate better interaction between historical research methods and management research. They show how rigorous historical method can contribute significantly to the study of the management processes. They also suggest that history as a memory of organizations could prove to be a rich source of data to better understand organizations evolution.

Unveiled in 1921, the memorial is one of multiple buildings and structures Lutyens designed in Mells. His friendship with two prominent families in the area, the Horners and the Asquiths, led to a series of commissions; among his other works in the village are memorials to two sons‚Äîone from each family‚Äîkilled in the war. Lutyens toured the village with local dignitaries in search of a suitable site for the war memorial, after which he was prompted to remark \\"all their young men were killed\\". The memorial takes the form of a marble column topped by a sculpture of Saint George slaying a dragon, an image Lutyens used on two other public war memorials. At the base of the column, the names of the village's war dead are inscribed on stone panels. The memorial is flanked by identical rubble walls in local stone, on top of which grows a yew hedge. Low stone benches protrude from the walls to allow wreaths to be laid. Additional panels were fixed to the wall after the Second World War to commemorate that conflict. The memorial was unveiled on 26 June 1921 by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, whose brother is among those commemorated on it. It is a grade II* listed building and since 2015 has been part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials. Background memorial to Edward Horner in St Andrew's Church; the statue was by Alfred Munnings while Lutyens designed the plinth. In the aftermath of the First World War, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Before the war, Lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons, but from 1917 onwards, he dedicated much of his time to memorialising the casualties of the war. He went on to design The Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme in France, among many other memorials and cemeteries. According to Tim Skelton, author of Lutyens and Great War, \\"if there was one village above all others that would have a war memorial designed by Lutyens, it would be the village of Mells\\".Skelton, p. 81. The war memorial is one of multiple buildings and structures by Lutyens in the village. He was a friend of two prominent local families, the Horners and the Asquiths, through his collaborations with Gertrude Jekyll on country houses and gardens early in his career. Gertrude's sister-in-law was Dame Agnes Jekyll, the sister of Lady Frances Horner, who was the incumbent owner (with her husband, Sir John) of Mells Manor, a manor house in the centre of the village dating originally from the 16th century. Shortly after their first meeting, Sir John commissioned Lutyens for renovations to the Horners' London town house. Lutyens first visited Mells in 1896 at the request of Lady Horner (with whom he became close friends), who commissioned him to rebuild the house, and later for several other works related to the manor.Gliddon, pp. 323‚Äì324. The Horners' son, Edward, was killed at the Battle of Cambrai on the Western Front in November 1917 and is among those named on the war memorial. The family separately commissioned Lutyens to design a memorial to him in St Andrew's Church‚Äîa large statue of a mounted cavalry officer (by Alfred Munnings), which stands on a plinth by Lutyens based on the Cenotaph. In the same church is a memorial to Raymond Asquith (the Horners' son-in-law and the eldest son of the prime minister, H. H. Asquith), designed by Lutyens and executed by Eric Gill. Raymond was killed in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Both men are listed on the village war memorial.Skelton, pp. 91, 216.Borg, p. 111.Boorman, pp. 138‚Äì139.Hussey, p. 474. By 1916, seventy-four men from Mells had left to fight, and several women, including Lady Horner, were working as nurses in France. By the end of the war, 21 men had been killed and multiple others wounded. Among the returned was the curate of St Andrew's Church, who earned the Military Cross for saving a wounded soldier.Dakers, p. 126. Commissioning Mells' war dead were first commemorated by a stone tablet on a wall in St Andrew's Church, designed by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers.Dakers, p. 209. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something to be looked at and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by. As with most of his war memorial commissions, Lutyens walked around the village in August 1919 to examine possible sites for the memorial. He was accompanied by Katharine Asquith (Sir John and Lady Frances Horner's daughter and Raymond Asquith's widow) and a group of representatives from the village. Lutyens was moved by the villagers' personal loss and wrote in a letter to his wife, Emily: \\"My weekend was a spring day, fun and tears. All their young men were killed\\".Winter. p. 107.Brown, pp. 172‚Äì173. He told Emily he had \\"found a perfect site in the middle of the village, which no-one else found, or thought of, and with a little tact and patience it was carried by the villagers with acclaim\\". Design Side view of the war memorial The memorial takes the form of a Tuscan column of Purbeck Marble construction, on which stands a statue of Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in Portland stone that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.Dakers, pp. 209‚Äì210. To either side of the pedestal are matching panels onto which are inscribed the names of the village's war dead. At the same height are flanking walls of coarsed, squared rubble from the nearby Doulting Stone Quarry, set back at the ends and topped with a yew hedge. In front of each wall is a small stone bench that protrudes across the base of the column, and above the benches, fixed to the wall, are round plaques bearing the dates of the Second World War and the names of the village's dead from that conflict. The statue and the inscriptions are both the work of Eric Gill, who also carved the memorial to Raymond Asquith.Corke, p. 58. Colin Amery, who chaired an exhibition of Lutyens' works after his death, describes the memorials at Mells as among Lutyens' finest.Amery, et al., p. 143. Lutyens was profoundly affected by the war and sought a new form of architecture to memorialise the Lost Generation. He generally preferred abstract designs for his war memorials, of which he designed dozens, over allegorical or figurative sculpture or the overt religious imagery that was present in many First World War memorials. Mells is one of the few monuments in which he used such allegory (in this case, the statue of Saint George). It is the most intricate of Lutyens' civic memorials to feature a statue of Saint George, though his memorial inside Wellington College's chapel features a similar sculpture of George and the Dragon. Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire and Hove War Memorial in East Sussex both feature less intricate bronze statues of George with a sword and shield.Skelton, p. 173. History The memorial was unveiled at a ceremony on 26 June 1921. It cost ¬£400 to build, which was raised by public subscription. The unveiling was performed by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, brother of Raymond Asquith, who is commemorated on the memorial.Dakers, p. 210. General Asquith was later instrumental in the creation of Lutyens' Royal Naval Division War Memorial outside the Admiralty building in London.Quinlan, p. 231. Mells War Memorial was designated a grade II* listed building on 1 January 1969 and noted for its setting with the village hall (which is also listed at grade II*) and the various other historic buildings in the village, including several by Lutyens. Listed building status offers statutory protection from demolition or modification; grade II* is reserved for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\" and applied to about 5.5% of listings. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Historic England recognised Lutyens' war memorials as a \\"national collection\\".

It is the home base of several sports clubs and teams who are associated with the Guinness Athletic Union. These include St James's Gate F.C. and St James Gaels GAA. It is named after Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, who purchased the site and then donated it to the union. Other clubs that play at the Iveagh Grounds include a field hockey club and a rugby union club. As well as St James's Gate F.C., two other association football clubs, Bangor Celtic F.C. and St. John Bosco F.C., also play home games at the Iveagh Grounds. History In 1905 John Lumsden, the chief medical officer at the St James's Gate Brewery, the home of Guinness, founded the St James's Gate Athletic and Cycling Union. This was later renamed the Guinness Athletic Union. From about 1912 Lumsden started campaigning for a permanent sports ground for the union. However, initially the Guinness board were reluctant to finance one. St James's Gate F.C. was the most prominent member of the union; however, by the early 1920s the membership had almost doubled and its activities had expanded to include tennis, cricket and handball branches. In 1926 St James's Gate Rugby Football Club was founded and 1928 saw the arrival of St James's Gate Hockey Club. This expansion highlighted the need for a permanent home base. In 1922 a twenty-five-acre site on the Crumlin Road owned by a Mr. Begg was identified as a possible candidate. Begg had been offered ¬£5,000 by the Dolphin's Barn Brick Company but he eventually sold the site to Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh because \\"he did not like the idea of having a quarry in front of his house\\". Iveagh subsequently donated the site to the union. He also established a board of trustees, that included Lumsden, and donated a further ¬£20,000 to develop and manage the site. However the 1st Earl of Iveagh died before work on the site was completed, so the Iveagh Grounds were officially opened on 14 April 1928 by Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh and his wife Gwendolen Guinness, Countess of Iveagh.

She works in a framework of deliberative democratic theory, where she defends a participatory construal of the democratic ideal against proposals to insulate political decision making from the influence of the citizenry. This conception requires the citizens to respect the priority of public reason over religious or otherwise comprehensive views in their political deliberations in the public sphere.C. Lafont, \\"Religion and the Public Sphere\\" At the level of global governance, she argues against the current state-centric understanding of human rights obligations because of the protection gaps it leaves open. Instead, she advocates a more ambitious construal of the responsibility to protect (R2P) human rights, which she interprets as a provisional duty of the international community as a whole until appropriate institutions are in place to close these gaps.C. Lafont, Global Governance and Human Rights Lafont is also widely known for her work in Critical Theory, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Critical Theory especially for her critical elaboration of themes in the philosophy of J√ºrgen Habermas. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on J√ºrgen HabermasHabermas Handbuch (2013), co-ed. with Hauke Brunkhorst and Regina Kreide Cristina Lafont‚Äôs earlier philosophical work in the philosophy of language of Heidegger‚Äôs hermeneutics issues in her identification of a specific form of ‚Äúlinguistic turn‚Äù (centered on the ‚Äúworld-disclosing‚Äù function of conceptual structures in language) in post-Kantian German philosophy between Hamann and Habermas.Author meets Critics issue of Inquiry on 'Heidegger, Language and World Disclosure', with Precis and Replies by Cristina Lafont The upshot is that the systematic idealistic and constructivist tendency of this tradition is owed to a specific set of assumptions in its linguistic philosophy. In this work, she applies select tools from the theory of meaning developed in analytic philosophy of language Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Analytic Philosophy of Language to foundational issues from German Continental philosophy. This approach enables fruitful and precise comparisons between, e.g., Robert Brandom‚Äôs inferentialist framework and hermeneutics or Habermas‚Äô theory of communicative action. One central tenet of Lafont‚Äôs philosophical work that runs throughout these otherwise very different works is her interest in the necessary conditions for normative rational criticism and reasoned change on this basis. This motivates her insistence on the need for realist correctives of the idealism characteristic of German philosophy of language as much as it is behind her critical examination of principles of public reason in deliberative democracy and as it drives her research in human rights (as not merely constructed by but a source of the moral quality of legal and political systems). Education, major professorships and Honors Lafont graduated ‚Äòcum laude‚Äô with a Licenciatura in philosophy from the Universidad de Valencia in 1987. From there, she moved to Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universit√§t Frankfurt (Main), where she obtained her PhD in philosophy (Dr. phil.) ‚Äòsumma cum laude‚Äô in 1992 under the supervision of J√ºrgen Habermas.

His most recent novel Thomas Jefferson Dreams of Sally Hemings has been published by Viking. His short fiction has appeared in The New Yorker, The Best American Short Stories, Conjunctions, and New England Review. His essays have appeared in The New York Times, and Agni. His poems have been in Poetry, The Beloit Poetry Journal, and Missouri Review. Early life O‚ÄôConnor was born May 21, 1952 in Brooklyn, New York to an Irish father and a French mother. He grew up mainly in New Jersey, and attended Columbia University, where he studied with Kenneth Koch and U.C. Berkeley, where he studied with Leonard Michaels. He published his first short story, ‚ÄúOn the Wing‚Äù, in Partisan Review in 1981. His first book was Rescue (Harmony, 1989), a collection of short stories, some realistic, some surrealistic, and a long narrative poem about John Wesley Powell‚Äôs exploration of the Grand Canyon. Literary and teaching career From 1988 until 1996, he directed a school-wide Teachers and Writers Collaborative program at a combined elementary and middle school in New York City, which became the subject of his second book, Will My Name Be Shouted Out? (Simon & Schuster, 1996). While this book is nominally a memoir, it primarily concerns a group of students whom O‚ÄôConnor helped to write and perform plays about actual incidents of violence in New York City, and whose lives exemplify the ways that talented and hard-working Black and Latino children are ill-served by schools, social policy and many other aspects of American culture O‚ÄôConnor returned to the topics of poor children and social policy in his next book, Orphan Trains; The Story of Charles Loring Brace and the Children He Saved and Failed (Houghton Mifflin, 2001), a nonfiction account of a controversial nineteenth and early twentieth century effort, under which vagrant and/or orphaned children in New York City were sent, generally by train to the country where they would be taken in and sometimes exploited by local families. Like Rescue, Here Comes Another Lesson (Free Press, 2010), O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs second collection of short fiction, contains a wide variety of surreal and realistic stories, one about a minotaur and a computer-game playing ‚Äúnew girl\\", another about a traumatized soldier just back from Iraq, and a series of stories about a professor of atheism. Ron Charles from The Washington Post reviewed the most recent novel and said that \\"[...] with its magically engineered collection of fiction, history and fantasy, and particularly with its own capacious spirit, Thomas Jefferson Dreams of Sally Hemings doesn‚Äôt just knock Jefferson off his pedestal, it blows us over, too, shatters the whole sinner-saint debate and clears out new room to reconsider these two impossibly different people who once gave birth to the United States.

He was the leading British two-year-old in 1989 when he was undefeated in six races including the Chesham Stakes, Bernard Van Cutsem Stakes, Lanson Champagne Vintage Stakes, Solario Stakes and Racing Post Trophy, starting odds-on favourite on each occasion. He finished unplaced on his only run in 1990 and was retired to stud. He had some success as a sire of winners. Background Be My Chief was a bay horse with a large white star four white socks bred in Kentucky by his owner Peter Burrell. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Chief's Crown who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse in 1984. He went on to sire several other major winners including Erhaab, Grand Lodge and Chief Bearheart. Be My Chief's dam Lady Be Mine won one minor race from four attempts as a three-year-old in England in 1981. She was a granddaughter of the broodmare My Game, whose other descendants have included Marwell, Marling, Paean and Unite. Peter Burrell who ran the British National Stud brought the colt to race in Europe and sent him into training with Henry Cecil at the Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1989: two- year-old season= Be My Chief began his racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Doncaster Racecourse on 27 May in which he was ridden by Willie Ryan and started at odds of 4/9 against seven opponents. He recovered from being hampered at the start, took the lead a furlong out, and won by three lengths from Balla Cove, a colt who went on to win the Middle Park Stakes. When the colt reappeared on 22 June for the Listed Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot he was ridden by Steve Cauthen, who partnered him in all his subsequent races. Starting at odds of 2/5 in an eight-runner field, he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from the Richard Hannon, Sr-trained Osario. Be My Chief again started odds-on favourite when he was stepped up in distance for the Bernard Van Cutsem Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. He led from the start, drew clear in the final furlong, and won by three lengths from Long Iland, with Balla Cove two and a half lengths back in third. On 27 July, Be My Chief was stepped up to Group Three level for the Lanson Champagne Vintage Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Starting at odds of 8/15, he led from the start, accelerated into a clear advantage two furlongs from the finish and held on to win by half a length and a length from Robellation and Dashing Blade. In his next two races, Dashing Blade won the National Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. Only two horses, Balla Cove and Robellation, appeared to oppose Be My Chief when the colt started 1/3 favourite for the Solario Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 18 August. Be My Chief recorded his fifth consecutive victory, but had to be hard ridden by Cauthen to prevail by three quarters of a length from Robellation. On his final race of the season, Be My Chief was stepped up to Group One level for the Racing Post Trophy over one mile at Newcastle Racecourse on 28 October. The event had been previously known as the William Hill Futurity and was being run for the first time under the sponsorship of the Racing Post. It had been transferred from its traditional venue at Doncaster Racecourse after the St Leger meeting in September had been abandoned owing to the poor state of the ground at the Yorkshire course. His four opponents were the Qathif, Cutting Note, Baligh and Loch Fruin, none of whom had previously contested a Group race. Starting the 4/7 favourite, he led from the start, accelerated in the final furlong and won by four lengths from Baligh. =1990: three-year-old season= Be My Chief suffered from a series of training problems in the early part of 1990 and missed both the 2000 Guineas and The Derby. He eventually reappeared in the Scottish Classic over ten furlongs at Ayr Racecourse on 12 July and started the 2/1 favourite in a seven-runner field. He led until the last three furlongs but then quickly faded and finished tailed off in last place, more than twenty-five lengths behind the winner Husyan. Stud record Be My Chief was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He was initially based at the National Stud before standing in Sweden and Poland. His two most successful runners, however, had their biggest wins in North America: Hail The Chief won the Hawthorne Gold Cup whilst the racemare Donna Viola won the Yellow Ribbon Stakes and the Gamely Stakes. His other good winners included Flying Squaw a filly who won the Mo√´t & Chandon-Rennen. He died in 2006 at the age of nineteen.

Description  Tropaeolum incisum is a perennial herbaceous plant with a tuber deep underground and a usually unbranched, procumbent and sometimes climbing stem of usually up to about 60 cm long and 4 mm in diameter. The plant is entirely without hairs. The leaves are alternate and without stipule, with leafstems of 2‚Äì5 cm long and leafblades approximately round (1¬Ω-3¬Ω cm), palmately divided into five to nine (mostly seven) blue-grey leaflets, with thin purplish edges particularly on younger growth. These leaflets are themselves deeply pinnately incised with two to seven lanceolate lobes, which in turn may have some teeth, with a blunt tip that sometimes ends abruptly in a sharp point and which are folded in a V-shape along their midveins. The flowers are bisexual and zygomorphic, are carried on stems of 4‚Äì10 cm long. The calyx consists of five sepals which are yellowish, apricot or blue-grey and sometimes tinged with purple, with triangular equal size lobes (8‚Äì13√ó4‚Äì8 mm), with a slender spur of 12‚Äì20 mm long, with a narrow base. The petals are a compromised yellow, pinkish yellow, orange-yellow or dark yellow with purple veins and have a more or less red-purplish staining on back of lobes. The petals consist of a claw and plate (or lamina) and the upper two have an almost elliptical lamina, with a blunt tip and wavy margins, each about 12‚Äì17√ó5‚Äì12 mm, while the lower three have longer claws, are indented at the tip and about 10‚Äì17√ó3‚Äì10 mm. Tropaeolum species have eight stamens. Pollen is approximately 17¬Ω√ó13 Œºm, radial symmetric, rounded triangular, tricolpate, flattened (or oblate), with short furrows of about 4 Œºm. The superior three- carpelled ovary when ripe will split in three blackish one-seeded parts (mericarps) of 5‚Äì6 mm long. In good garden soil plants grow more vigorous and climb up to 2 m. In its native area it flowers from September to February. = Differences with related species = Tropaeolum incisum looks a lot like T. polyphyllum, which also has stems that spread across the soil and has greyish blue leaves. The leaves of T. incisum however are larger and more grey rather than blue, while the leaflets are deeper divided and have strongly undulating edges. The flowers of both species are similar however, although T. polyphyllum may have a brighter yellow color.  Taxonomy  Genetic analysis suggests that T. incisum is closely related to T. polyphyllum as well as T. leptophyllum. T. myriophyllum might originate from a cross between T. leptophyllum and T. incisum.  Distribution and ecology  Tropaeolum incisum is concentrated in the Argentinean lake district of northern Patagonia (northern Chubut, western R√≠o Negro, Neuqu√©n, and southern Mendoza Provinces), and can also be found in neighboring Chile but only near the passes. It may grow at elevations up to 3000 m. It grows in arid, sandy fields and low scree in the rain shadow of the Andes. Hyposchila galactodice, a butterfly belonging to the Pieridae that occurs in western Patagonia, Argentina, is a specialist feeding on Tropaeolum incisum.  Cultivation  Tropaeolum incisum is sometimes grown as an ornamental and is on offer from several seed companies and nurseries.

The pipeline's headquarters were in Calgary, Alberta, with division offices in Valleyview, Alberta, Grande Prairie, Alberta, Whitecourt, Alberta and Dawson Creek, BC and the control centre was located in Edmonton, Alberta. The Peace Pipe Line, its subsidiaries; Pouce Coupe and Plateau, were in part, predecessors of today's Pembina Pipeline Corporation. The Peace Pipe Line had two major supplies to Fox Creek, Alberta. A 12-inch line, coined the Deep Basin line, which originated from the Brassey field in BC and ran to LaGlace via Gordondale. From LaGlace, the Deep Basin ran straight south, (west of Grande Prairie), with gathering points and stations at Wapiti, Bald Mountain, Kakwa, then turned eastward across the Smoky River to gathering points and stations at Lator, Simonette and Tony Creek before terminating at Fox Creek. The second major route to Fox Creek originated in Red Earth and ran to Valleyview with gathering points and pump stations at Cranberry, Foster and Gilwood and consisted of two loop segments. The Valleyview to Fox Creek portion of the Peace was a 16-inch line. From Fox Creek, the Peace system went south to Edson Terminal via 12-inch line to connect to the TransMountain system and also delivered eastward to Edmonton on a loop system of a 12-inch and 20-inch lines with gathering points and stations at Windfall Jct, Whitecourt, and Glenevis. By the end of 1990, Peace Pipe Line's system was directly serving 27 crude oil fields between Alberta and British Columbia and over 20 gas processing plants with seven truck unloading terminals. Peace Pipe Line was sold to Pembina Corporation on October 31, 1991.  Incorporation and production  Oil was discovered in 1954 about 220 miles (355 km) north west of Edmonton, Alberta in the oilfields known as a Sturgeon Lake, Sturgeon Lake South and Little Smoky. With a demand for market access, six of the producing companies in the area joined forces and incorporated Peace River Oil Pipe Line Co. Ltd. on November 17, 1954. The six equal owners were; AMERADA Petroleum Corp., Canadian Gulf Oil Co., Hudson's Bay Oil & Gas Co. Ltd, Imperial Oil Ltd., Shell Oil Co., and Union Oil Company of California. The British American Oil Co. Ltd (B/A) and consequently its subsidiaries, including Britamoil, merged with Canadian Gulf Oil Co. at the emergence of the pipeline and as such, The Peace River Oil Pipe Line Co. Ltd was operated by Britamoil, from 1955 to 1963, when a separate management group was established. In 1955, $7 million was spent to construct the first mainline portion of the pipeline to transport crude oil from the Sturgeon Lake fields to the Trans Mountain Pipe line pump station at Edson. The first leg of the line was a 16-inch pipeline from the Valleyview pump station which was situated 12 km south of Valleyview, Alberta, and ran to Fox Creek, Alberta. The mainline continued from Fox Creek to Edson via 12-inch line. 1956 was Peace River Oil's first year of operation, with a total of 145 miles (233 km) and delivering a daily average of 9093 barrels. Nearly all of the transported product was owned by the major six shareholders. During this same time, several refineries in Edmonton were being constructed to accommodate the expansive market demand of the growing exploration and discoveries in the province. In 1961, a major extension to the system was undertaken with the construction of a pipeline from the Fox Creek pump station to Edmonton, Alberta, with connections to the TransMountain Pipe Line, Interprovincial Pipe Line and to the new local refineries. By this time, approximately 65% of the stream was owner production, with capacity being supplied by other new producers. In 1961, additional ownership shares were issued to fund the construction, bringing the total number of shares to 272,388. 1963 was a busy year for Peace, starting with a separate management group, as the Peace River Oil Pipe Line had taken over its management from Britamoil and established a head office in Calgary with 13 employees in addition to 20 field employees, for a total of 33 staff. During the same time, a gathering line was completed from Valleyview to Snipe Lake and construction began on a new 120-mile (193 km), 8-inch trunk line from Snipe Lake to Red Earth, Alberta, and a further 8-inch line from Red Earth to Nipisi, which was all completed in 1964. Other projects during this era included gathering lines to Goose River, Sturgeon Lake South and to Kaybob South. By the end of the year, Peace River Oil was operating 581 miles (935 km) of pipeline. = Increased output and expansion = From 1962 to 1965 there was an increase of 10,300 barrels/day to the pipeline system. In early 1965, The company began construction of the Edmonton Control Centre and a microwave radio communication system to enhance its operational efficiency. By the end of this year, the company's throughput was an average 55,562 barrels/day with over 691 miles (1112 km) of pipe. By the end of this year, approximately 55% of the stream came from the owners‚Äô production. Construction began on a 20-inch line from Valleyview to Zama, north-west of High Level, Alberta, whish was complete in mid-March 1968. In 1968, part of the Fox Creek to Edmonton upgrade to a 20-inch line was completed as part of a looping system. Peace River Oil now had a throughput of over 71,000 barrels/day, with five separate streams of oil being transported, and a total of 1151 miles (1852 km) of pipe with 61 employees. With so much growth, additional shares were issued, increasing the total to 389,055. Beginning in 1969, Peace River Oil's volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids coming into Fox Creek had insufficient capacity to Edmonton with only one line. 78 miles (125 km) of 20-inch line was built to complete the looping of line between Fox Creek and Edmonton. The 20-inch portion of line was used for crude oil service, and the adjacent 12-inch line was used for condensate and LPGs. The Zama field north-west of High Level, Alberta, never had realized oil production as projected, however, had substantial dry gas production. As such, Peace River Oil's 20-inch pipeline from Zama to Valleyview (Northwest System) had difficulty delivering profitability, and in 1971, the Peace River Oil Pipe Line sold the Northwest system to Alberta Gas Trunk Line for approximately $25 million. This sale affected Peace River Oil's throughput and reduced crude oil volumes by 12,300 barrels/day and reduced the staff to 58 employees. Peace River Oil Pipe Line negotiated long-term throughput agreements with three major gas plants in the Kaybob South area this year. = System changes = In 1973, the company changed its name as operations were no longer conducted in the Peace River area, for brevity's sake, and to relate to the ceremonial indigenous peace pipe symbol. Peace River Oil Pipe Line's name was changed to Peace Pipe Line Ltd. effective November 22, 1973. Effective the first day of January, 1979, Peace Pipe Line converted to the metric system to align with the rest of the industry. Continued expansion was occurring within the system, and Peace had up to 85 employees by the end of the year, with a daily average throughput of 145,466 barrels/day (23,116 cubic meters) over 1598 km (993 miles) of pipe. In August 1980, Peace received approval to construct the Deep Basin line, a 240 km, 12-inch line from the LaGlace (~40 km North West of Grande Prairie, Alberta) to Fox Creek. The expansion came in at a cost of $32 million and grew the workforce of Peace Pipe to a total 90 employees delivering 18 different streams of oil over a total 1912 km of pipe. The construction of the Deep Basin was completed in 1981, and Peace Pipe grew its workforce by a third, to 120 employees, but daily throughput was reduced by imposed provincial cutbacks from March 1 to September 1. Valleyview Office With continued exploration in the Peace Pipe's operating area, volumes continued to increase over the next few years with a major expansion north along and connecting to the Deep Basin. A crude-oil gathering system was built to connect to the Valhalla field in 1985 and this system was further extended north east of LaGlace to connect to crude-oil production in the Spirit River and Rycroft areas. Peace Pipe also constructed major new facilities to handle the growing production of Ethane under long-term throughput agreements from three plants in the LaGlace, Elmworth and Wapiti areas. In October 1985, a permanent field office for the Deep Basin was located in Grande Prairie, Alberta, to manage the experienced and projected growth. By the end of 1986, staff levels spiked to 241 employees working at Peace Pipe Line.  Subsidiaries and selling of company  In 1988, construction began on an 8-inch pipeline from LaGlace north-west to connect to Gordondale, where a new truck unloading terminal was built. In February 1989, two wholly owned subsidiary companies were created. The Pouce Coupe Pipe Line Ltd. was a 25 km, 8-inch section from Gordondale to Dawson Creek, British Columbia, crossing the Alberta and British Columbia Border. The Plateau Pipe Line Ltd. would continue west of Dawson Creek another 40 km to serve the Brassey Field. Peace Pipe Line created the subsidiaries to better account tariffs and manage regulatory requirements. Peace Pipe Line was registered as Alberta Company, needing only to liaise with the then, ERCB, whereas the Pouce Coupe was a federally registered entity as it crossed provincial boundaries and would tariff would be set by the National Energy Board. The Plateau Pipe Line was registered as a provincial entity in British Columbia and was regulated by the OGC (British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission). After a number of trying bids by organizations, competitors and industry producers, the 12 shareholders (Amoco Canada Resources Inc., Shell Canada Ltd., Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., Amerada Minerals Corporation of Canada Ltd., Unocal Canada Ltd., Petro-Canada inc., Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., Husky Oil Operations Ltd., Esso Canada Resources Ltd., Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd., and Luscar Ltd.,) of Peace Pipe Line Ltd were realigning focus on production and exploration, thus decided to sell the company. Peace Pipe Line and subsidiaries were sold to Pembina Corporation (now Pembina Pipeline Corporation), effective October 31, 1991.

It is a hybrid film that combines live action with animation. Background The film's animations were created mainly using 3ds Max and After Effects. Nowak personally created all images and the fantasy world, with assistance from CG artist, Malte Lauinger, who created the final character models and rigs, and animated about half of the character motion.\\" The live action shooting took two months of work and, after five years of developing and designing the processes, two years were spent with animation. All animation was hand done and used no motion-capture, thus designed to be the \\"soul\\" of the film and containing \\"most of the innovation and finesse\\". The live action segments were set to act as the film's counterpart, leading viewers from animation to reality and back. Nowak grants that creating his protagonist's hair \\"was one of our most difficult tasks\\", and done using 3ds Max‚Äôs ‚ÄúHair & Fur‚Äù tool. Some of the hair treatment was performed by CG artist Gunter Freese using Maya and HairFx. Rendering took a full year with five computers running around the clock, but as rendering was subsequent to animation, Nowak would begin animating his next shot during rendering of the previous. Plot In a surreal, floating animated world, a genius musician (Roland Schupp) lives a lonely life, and every day plays a tube-shaped piano in a huge and empty concert hall. As it spins, his fingers tickle the keys filling the air with beautiful music. One strange day his animated world begins to collapse and reality breaks out. During the transformation from an animation into live action, the musician has but one singular wish: to play for his daughter (Hannah Heine). In the reality, the daughter spies her father in the street below and the Mother (Nina Petri) warns her away from the window. The daughter expresses worry that the police might return, and the mother cautions that her father is not as might be wished. In the streets, the musician tries to encourage interest in his works, but is continually rebuffed. He views traditional pianos in a music shop window and in looking over his reality is saddened and faints. Being examined in the hospital, the Doctor (Klaus Zehrfeld) explains that he is suffering from a common delusional fantasy called \\"Spherical Dissonance\\", and that he should escape it and embrace reality. Leaving the hospital, the musician sees the dissonance trying to re-emerge. While the Mother speaks on the phone about how a restraining order is proving useless, the daughter leaves the home and approaches her musician father as he sits on the sidewalk outside. She sneaks him into the home and he begins to play for her on the home's traditional piano. The mother hears and confronts the musician. He nails a music box to the piano and leaves the home. Outside, he momentarily re-embraces his spherical dissonance before stepping sadly into reality.

An ear print is a two-dimensional reproduction of the parts of the outer ear that have touched a specific surface (most commonly the helix, antihelix, tragus and antitragus). Ear prints and their use for identification was first discovered by Fritz Hirschi in 1965. Fritz Hirschi was the first to identify a criminal in Switzerland in 1965 and ear print analysis has also been successfully used to solve crimes in the UK and the Netherlands. In addition to identification, the height of an ear imprint at a crime scene may also provide investigators with information regarding the stature of the perpetrator. In 2002-2005 the Forensic Ear Identification (FearID) research project commenced to analyse the use of ear print evidence in criminal investigations. The research project was sponsored by the European Union to study the effectiveness of ear prints to be used as evidence in criminal investigations. The project used ear prints from 1229 donors. The European Commission is currently trying to create a database that will set the worldwide standard for ear print analysis. The reasoning behind the limited use of ear print analysis in modern day forensics is due to the complex nature of collection and analysis methods. There has been some success with ear print analysis but the collection methods of ear prints and the complexity of proving a print matches a specific ear makes the identification method unreliable.  History  Fritz Hirschi, from Bern Switzerland, was one of the first people to use ear prints for identification in 1965. . Hirschi analysed two earmarks at the scene of a burglary in Bienne, Switzerland. The earmarks were then used to observe if there was a connection between a more recent burglary where two men were arrested. The two men had their ear prints taken to compare to the previous marks left at the first burglary. Hirschi discovered that one of the two suspects had an ear print significantly similar to the ear mark at the first burglary, convincing Hirschi that he was involved with the most recent burglary. = Use as Evidence = The creation of the ear print identification system (similar to the fingerprint identification system) was developed by a University of Leicester Professor Guy Rutty along with a private forensics company. The team presented its work at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Dallas. Rutty measured the ear and observed physical elements such as sex differences in the external auditory canal, where females have shorter canals than males. The discoveries by Professor Guy Rutty of physical variations in the human ear opened the field of identification methods using ear prints. Ear prints have been used in criminal cases for identification in Holland, with more than 200 judicial cases. Ear print databases are common in Spain, with history of criminal sentences using ear prints as evidence. Fear ID Project Forensic Ear Identification (FearID) research project commenced in 2002 to analyse the use of ear print evidence in criminal investigations. The project was sponsored by the European Union and was composed of nine institutes from the United Kingdom, Italy and Netherlands. = Methods of Collection = The project used 1229 donors who donated three left and right ear prints. The ear prints were collected using controlled methods. Donors pressed their ear up to a glass plate and were instructed to listen for a sound. Then the ear print was lifted with a black gel filter. The research project aimed to standardise a method of ear print collection and accurately depict the print an ear may leave at a crime scene. Analysis of the ear print included details such as shape, size, Darwinian tubercles, creases, moles, piercings and scars. = Limitations Discovered in Project = The methodology used in the FearID project where donors press their ear against a glass plate to depict the print at the scene is not valid to use for forensic investigations today. This is due to the inability to control the force suspects place on the glass. Suspects may not cooperate, and prints may not be representative of reality.  Limitations of Ear Print Analysis  Ear print analysis is not used as a valid and reliable method for identification due to its lack of scientific research. Present day forensic analysis commonly uses DNA testing methods as it is more reliable and valid in court. = Factors Affecting Analysis = Ear print analysis can be greatly affected by certain factors: * How long the suspect's ear was in contact with the surface, and the applied force * Smudging or sliding occurring on surface * The quality of surface (glass and metal have greater potential for detailed prints) *Secretion of oils or waxes on the ear * Environment factors (weather, period of time since the print was left to when it is lifted) * The method of ear print lifting (using different materials instead of FearID black gel lifters) * Storage of information (software used and the loss of details when prints are transferred to a digital form These factors outline the difficulties in creating specific methods to extract and analyse ear prints. Each factor affects the reliability and validity of the print. Additionally, a variety of ear prints can be made by the same ear due to these factors and the uniqueness of an ear print.  Use in Court  New York City Police Dept. activities- taking Bertillon measurements-ear LCCN2006677371There is a lack of jurisprudence, doctrinal studies and studies relating to comparative law on the significance of ear prints in forensic investigations. Ear prints are not accepted as reliable evidence in court cases. In court cases, definitions used to define the evidence of ear prints are not completely assertive. Wording such as \\"there is ‚Äòhigh probability‚Äô the ear print was made by the suspect\\" is used. = Subjectivity = The identification of an ear print matching a suspect's ear mark is based on the assessment by a forensic specialist. The match of an ear print to an ear mark and its value in court is based on the forensic examiners judgement. The use of ear prints in court is not common due to factors such as the subjectivity of value given to a print and the forensic examiner's experience. = Notable Cases = Notable cases of ear print identification failing to convict suspects of crime include Mark Dallagher‚Äôs United Kingdom case from 1998. Dallagher was convicted of murder on the foundation of an ear print. In January 2004, the conviction was dropped due to DNA testing that found his DNA was not a match with the earmark found at the scene.  Future Possibilities  Ear print analysis needs further research and scientific method improvement to ensure analysis is reliable and valid. Due to improvements in technology, the future of ear print analysis to be used widely in criminal investigations is possible. There are still fundamental questions to consider when analysing ear prints. There needs to be a greater understanding of ear print features and factors and how they can improve intraindividual variation. Ear prints need to resemble the same ear more than it resembles another ear. Subjectivity also has to be accepted when scientific experts analyse ear prints and make conclusions.

The film, directed by Guy Glover, described the creation of the All Canadian Atlas. The film's French version title is L'Atlas du Canada.  Synopsis  Canadian mapmakers 400 years ago relied on hand- drawn maps derived from personal accounts by explorers, fur traders and settlers. These maps were limited to coastlines and partial interior views. Explorers like Samuel de Champlain, Jacques Cartier and David Thompson made their own maps. Later explorers and prospectors were often the first to go into uncharted regions, and their information on the land was invaluable in drawing up the maps of the time. In 1959, the new All Canadian Atlas is a product of the joint efforts of geologists, meteorologists, prospectors, agronomists, draughtspersons, naturalists and especially, the Royal Canadian Air Force. Aerial photography was essential in mapping the vast north of Canada. In 1948, No. 413 RCAF Squadron/No. 13 (Photographic) Squadron flying specially converted Avro Lancaster 10P aircraft undertook the task of mapping Canada's Arctic. Three large islands were discovered and one island near Baffin Island was named \\"Air Force\\" in their honour. With all the accumulated data from photographs, the mapmakers of the All Canadian Atlas consulted with interested parties from government, industry and academia to ensure that all relevant information is included. Each of the 500 maps contains a wealth of information, depicting Canada in a hundred different ways from political boundaries, settlement, urban development, habitats, mineral and agricultural areas, temperatures and climates, transportation and industry to provide an accurate portrait of Canada in the late 1950s.

Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (), its acronym being PINRO (), is one of several research institutes of Russia subordinate to the Russian Federal Agency for Fisheries (Rosrybolovstvo). It is based in Murmansk. It is named for Nikolai Knipovich. History The institute was created on March 10, 1921 as the Floating Marine Research Institute (Plavmornin). It was preceded (though not directly) by the Imperial Russian organization Murman Scientific Fisheries Expedition, which existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and conducted early research with the vessel Saint Andrew. Between 1929 and 1933, the Institute was named State Oceanographic Institute of the USSR (SOI). Since 1935, it has borne the name of fisheries science pioneer Nikolai Knipovich. During the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II (called, in Russia, the Great Patriotic War) the Institute was evacuated to Arkhangelsk. The Institute's main expedition ship Perseus, which had been with the Institute since its early days and undertaken close to 100 expeditions, was sunk by German air raiders in the early days of the war. The Perseus's flag, showing a stylized representation of the Perseus constellation, remains the Institute's symbol to this day. Since then, the institute has operated several research vessels, including large purpose-built research ships, and submersibles. Activities The main task of the team of scientists of the institute is conducting annual studies to help determine the total allowable catch of commercial fish species, invertebrates, algae and marine mammals. The main focus is on cod, haddock, capelin, herring, Greenland halibut, the Barents Sea population of the Kamchatka crab, and salmon. The Institute's area of responsibility includes the northern waters near European Russia ‚Äì the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, the White Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the Greenland Sea and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean ‚Äì as well as freshwater lakes in the Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Regions, the Komi Republic, and the Nenets Autonomous District.

Catalogue of the Barton Collection. Boston: Boston Public Library, 1888. iv. Detail of a letter from Thomas Pennant Barton to Thomas Rodd, dated May 13th, 1844. Throughout his career as a collector, Barton worked with booksellers, binders, and stationers in both Britain, Europe, and America. He purchased from or through Obadiah Rich, Thomas Rodd, Horatio Rodd, H.G. Bohn, William Pickering, John Russell Smith, F.W. Christern, Joseph Sabin, and numerous others.See: Thomas Pennant Barton correspondence (BPL call no. MS f G.52.9) Through these agents, he was an active buyer at many of the major British book auctions of the mid-nineteenth century, including the sales of Richard Heber (1834), Benjamin Heywood Bright (1845), the Statfold Hall Library sale (1856), and a number of J.O. Halliwell-Phillipps' auctions.See: Barton Collection Catalogue for a list of Barton's annotated sale catalogs. Barton's primary collecting interest was in the works of William Shakespeare and, in particular, in the early quarto and folio editions of his plays and poems. During his lifetime, Barton acquired many rare and early Shakespeare editions, including 45 play quartos issued before the English Restoration, nine of which were issued during Shakespeare's lifetime. Barton also acquired all four seventeenth-century folio editions (including the First Folio of 1623, two copies of the Second Folio (1632), both issues of the Third Folio (1663 and 1664), and the Fourth Folio (1685)). Among the many early Shakespearean quarto editions in the Barton collection are all nine of the Jaggard/Pavier quartos (sometimes referred to as the False Folio), as well as several early and rare anthologies and poetic miscellanies containing Shakespeare's poetry.Boston Public Library. Catalogue of the Barton Collection. Boston: Boston Public Library, 1888. pp. 1-51. John Alden refers to Barton as \\"the first American to form an extensive, purposeful collection of Shakespeariana.\\"‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs First Shakespeare Collection,‚Äù by John Alden, in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, v. 58 (1964) pp. 169. Indeed, his participation in the Heber sale (1834-1836) marked a watershed moment in the history of American Shakespeare collecting. During that single sale, Barton acquired, among other things, the first quarto of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the first quarto of The Merchant of Venice, and the third quarto of Hamlet (lot nos. 2012, 2014, and 2021, respectively).See: Letters from Obadiah Rich to Thomas Pennant Barton, Dec. 18th and 23rd, 1834. BPL call no. MS f G.52.9 Barton was also interested in English drama more generally, and the collection is particularly strong with respect to the early modern period, containing hundreds of quarto editions of English playbooks by playwrights including Christopher Marlowe, John Lyly, Thomas Kyd, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton, John Fletcher,and Thomas Heywood, among others.Literary world.Dickinson, Donald C. Dictionary of American Book Collectors. New York: Greenwood, 1986. p. 30. Barton also amassed substantial selections of French, Italian, Spanish, and German literature and belles-lettres. In addition, nearly 4,000 volumes in Barton's collection come from the personal library of Edward Livingston, which Barton inherited in 1836. Livingston's library consisted largely of works on jurisprudence and history. The condition of his books was a major concern for Barton, and he sought out only the finest copies of any given editions available on the market.Winsor, Justin. A bibliography of the original quartos and folios of Shakespeare. Boston: Osgood, 1876. pp. 5-7. As a result, the breadth of his collection was limited by the availability on the market of excellent copies. In the collection of Barton's papers held at the Boston Public Library, Barton can be observed frequently turning down exceedingly rare editions of early quartos and folios based on their poor or otherwise deficient condition. Many of these copies can now be tracked to other collections. As of 2017, the Boston Public Library is actively engaged in the conservation and digitization of Barton's Shakespeare and Shakespeareana. Digitized copies of his books are accessible through the Internet Archive. Personal life In 1833, Thomas Pennant Barton married Coralie \\"Cora\\" Livingston (1806-1873), a member of the prestigious Livingston family. Cora was the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State Edward Livingston and Louise (n√©e d'Avezac de Castera) Livingston (sister of Auguste Davezac). Her paternal grandparents were Judge Robert Livingston, a member of the New York Provincial Assembly and a Judge of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, and Margaret (n√©e Beekman) Livingston, heir to immense tracts of land in Dutchess and Ulster counties. He died, without issue, on April 5, 1869 at Montgomery Place, the Livingston family estate near Barrytown, New York.

It was the last large gun to be operational with the Royal Navy.  Development  The development of the Mark V gun started during the Second World War and was intended for triple Mark 25 mountings on the projected Neptune-class cruisers. When the Neptune-class ships were cancelled in 1946, the gun was redesigned to be mounted in pairs to the new and complex Mark 26 dual purpose mounting and gun turret designed for rapid automatic fire on the projected Minotaur-class cruiser. These were to be the first British 6-inch guns in over sixty years to use brass cartridges instead of bagged charges. By the time the first two experimental weapons had been completed in 1949, the Minotaur-class had also been cancelled, and after some time it was decided to use the N5 gun (as the Mark V had been redesignated) and the Mark 26 mounting, on the Tiger-class cruisers, whose hulls had been built during the war and had since been totally redesigned. Initial trials were undertaken at the Shoeburyness ranges on the Essex coast. A prototype of the complete gun, mounting and turret system was mounted on the former heavy cruiser, HMS Cumberland, which had been converted to a trials ship in 1949‚Äì1951. The turret was mounted in the \\"B\\" (forward, upper) position, while mounted on the \\"X\\" position (aft, upper) was a twin Vickers Ordnance QF 3in Mark N1 gun which was also under development for the Tiger-class. In April 1957, Cumberland sailed for the Mediterranean for firing trials, during which she expended 645 6-inch rounds. The guns were operated in conjunction with the Gun Direction System (GDS1) and a Type 992 radar. The cruisers were to carry two twin 6-inch mounts, fore and aft, and together with the ships' 3-inch guns, was intended to be able to fire a barrage of 800 shells per minute.  Service  The guns entered service with the Royal Navy when HMS Tiger was commissioned in 1959. The weapon system gained a reputation for unreliability and difficult maintenance, however the main problem was the number of technicians required to keep the guns operational. This was especially true of the earlier hydraulically actuated mountings, later versions were electrically operated. Two of the ships, HMS Blake in 1969 and HMS Tiger in 1972, underwent a radical conversion which replaced the aft 6-inch turret with a helicopter flight deck and hangar. These two ships remained in service until December 1979 when Blake fired her guns for the last time in the English Channel; they were the last 6-inch guns ever to be fired from a British warship.

It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea and parts of the Middle East and central Asia, where it grows in coastal and inland salt marshes, alkali flats, and other habitats with saline soils. Description Halocnemum strobilaceum is a much-branched, semi-prostrate, sub-shrub with erect branches up to a metre or so high. The woody stems at the base are jointed and have sterile, rounded or conical shaped buds, arranged in whorls on the terminal part of each portion. The erect stems are cylindrical and succulent, with green joints that turn yellow as they age. The stubby, bluish- green, scale-like leaves clasp the stem at each node. The flowers are hermaphrodite and very small, and are arranged in whorls of three on the upper part of the branches. Distribution and habitat Halocnemum strobilaceum is found around the coasts bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. It is also present in the Middle East and central Asia as far east as Mongolia and China. In Iran and Pakistan, it grows in the muddy coastal swamps immediately inland from the mangroves (Avicennia marina) that border the coast of the Persian Gulf. In the delta region of the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, it dominates some plant communities in the salt marsh habitats. In Abu Dhabi it grows in lagoons with muddy substrates in association with Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, and along the storm ridges of shelly sand that form higher up the beach. Gelatinous crusts of cyanobacteria sometimes form in depressions in the ground, and when these get dusted with windblown sand, H. strobilaceum colonises these habitats too. It grows along the sandy Tunisian coast, forming hummocks, growing alongside Bassia muricata, Cutandia memphitica and Traganum nudatum.R. H. Hughes In northwestern China in the provinces of Xinjiang and Gansu, it is one of the dominant plants on saline plains, on the shores of salt lakes and at the edges of alluvial fans. Along with glasswort and A. macrostachyum, H. strobilaceum was one of the first plants to recolonise oil- polluted marshland in the Persian Gulf after the soil had been churned up and aerated by the action of crabs.

It is classified as one of the 22 Samanya (general) Upanishads, and identified as a Vedanta text. It is attached to the Samaveda. The text discusses the four varnas (caste system).Mariola Offredi (1997), The banyan tree: essays on early literature in new Indo-Aryan languages, Volume 2, Manohar Publishers, , , pages 442‚Äì446 It is notable for being a sustained philosophical attack against the division of human beings, and for asserting that any human being can achieve the highest spiritual state of existence. Etymology The Sanskrit word Vajrasuchi means \\"diamond pointed needle\\". The term Upanishad means it is knowledge text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture, the Vedas. History The Vajrasuchi Upanishad survives into the modern era in several versions. Manuscripts of the text were discovered and collected during the colonial times, and by early 19th-century eight copies of the manuscripts from North India and five copies from South India were known. Most versions were in Sanskrit in Devanagari script and two in Telugu language, in palm-leaf manuscript form, with some in damaged condition.Theodor Aufrecht (1892), , University of Bonn, Germany, page 2 see entry 8Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 555 There are differences in the text between these manuscripts, but the focus and central message is the same.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 553‚Äì556 The opening lines of the Vajrasuchi Upanishad (Sanskrit, Devanagari script). The date as well as the author of Vajrasuchi Upanishad is unclear. The Upanishad is attributed to Sankaracharya in the manuscripts discovered by early 1800s. Sankaracharya, also known as Adi Shankara, was an Advaita Vedanta scholar, but given the Indian tradition of dedicating and attributing texts to revered historical scholars, there is uncertainty whether texts attributed to Adi Shankara were actually composed by him or in the 8th- century he likely lived in.Paul Hacker, Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, , pages 30‚Äì31M Piantelly, Sankara e la Renascita del Brahmanesimo, Indian Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Apr. 1977), pages 429‚Äì435 This text is also sometimes titled as Vajrasucika Upanishad, Vajra suchika Upanishad, Vajrasuci Upanishad, Vajrasucy Upanishad and Vajrasucyupanishad. In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 36. = The Vajras≈´cƒ´ of pseudo-A≈õvagho·π£a = After the discovery of palm-leaf manuscripts of the Vajrasuchi Upanishad manuscript, a Buddhist text attributed to 2nd- century CE Asvaghosa was published from Nepal with the same title Vajrasuchi, which is similar in its message as the Vajrasuchi Upanishad. It was published in 1839 by Hodgson, Wilkinson and S≈´bajƒ´ BƒÅp≈´. This added to the complications in dating and in determining the author of the text. However, the authenticity of the Buddhist text, and whether its author was Asvaghosa is considered seriously doubtful, according to many scholars, and most recently by Patrick Olivelle. Schrader stated in 1908 that the Vajrasuchi attributed to Asvaghosa, \\"though seemingly an independent work, in fact is nothing but a Buddhist commentary on or elaboration of the first part of Vajrasucyupanisad, with many quotations from Sruti and Smriti\\". Contents The text is structured as a single chapter in a prose form. It opens with verse 1 asserting that it describes the \\"Vajrasuchi doctrine\\", which destroys ignorance, condemns those who are ignorant and exalts those with the divine knowledge. The verse 2 of the text presents a series of questions, the possible answers analyzed in verses 3 through 8, the verse 9 presents its view, and then an epilogue concludes the Upanishad. =Question on the four varnas= The text asserts, in verse 2, that there are four varnas: the Brahmin, the Kshatriya, the Vaishya and the Shudra. The Brahmin, states the text, is declared by Smriti to be chief. But what does this mean, is this social division justified by Jiva (life, soul), Deha (body), Jati (birth), Jnana (knowledge), Karma (deeds), Dharmic (virtues or performer of rites)? =Answers= The Jiva does not make anyone a Brahmana, states the text, because with rebirth the Jiva migrates from one body to another, this Jiva remains the same individuality while the body changes. Thus, it is not Jiva which can determine whether one is a Brahmana, asserts verse 3. The Deha or body does not make anyone a Brahmana, according to the text, because every human being's body is the same, constituted of the same five elements, everyone ages, everyone dies, people from all classes show various combinations of dharma (virtue) and adharma (vice) characteristics. All color complexions similarly, asserts the text, are found is all castes and those who are outcaste. Thus, states verse 4 of the Upanishad, it is not the body which can determine whether one is a Brahmana. Does Jati or birth make a Brahmana? It is not so states the text, because sacred books tell of great Rishi (sages) born in various castes and diverse origins, such as Vyasa from a fisherman's daughter, Kaushika from Kusa grass, Valmiki from an ant hill, Gautama from the hare's posterior, Vasistha from a celestial nymph, Jambuka from a Jackal and Agastya from a mud-based vessel. Regardless of their birth origins, they achieved greatness. Therefore, asserts verse 5 of the Upanishad, it is not the birth which can determine whether one is a Brahmana. Jnana or knowledge too does not make a Brahmana, asserts the text. It is not so because among Kshtriyas and others, there are many who have seen the Highest Reality and Truth, and therefore Brahmin knowledge is not what makes the Brahmana. Karma or deeds do not make a Brahmana, continues the text, because all living beings perform the same deeds, past and future embodiments are common, and everyone is impelled by past. Thus, asserts the text in verse 7, deeds do not make the Brahmana. The text in verse 8 states that Dharmic action is not the essence of the Brahmana either. Many Kshatriyas give away gold, such virtuous actions and anyone performing religious rituals is not what makes a Brahmana. =Brahmana: the Vajrasuchi doctrine= Who indeed then is Brahmana, rhetorically repeats the verse 9 of the text. Whoever he may be, answers the Upanishad, he is the one who has directly realized his Atman (innermost self, soul). He is the one who understands that his soul is without a second, is devoid of class, is devoid of actions, is devoid of faults. He knows that the Atman is truth, is knowledge, is bliss and is eternity. He is the one who knows that the same soul in him is in everyone, is in all things, pervading within and without, something that can be felt but not reasoned. He is the one who is free from malice, who fulfills his nature, is not driven by cravings for worldly objects or desire or delusions. He is the one who lives a life untouched by spite, ostentation, pride or the need to impress others. =Epilogue= The Upanishad closes by stating that this doctrine is the opinion of the Srutis (scriptures), the Smritis, the Itihasas and the Puranas. There is no other way to attain the state of Brahmana, states Vajrasuchi Upanishad, other than meditating on the non-dual Brahman (ultimate reality and truth), with the Atman as the Satcitananda ‚Äì truth-consciousness- bliss. Thus ends the Upanishad. Buddhist Vajrasuchi and Hindu Vajrasuchi Upanishad The relationship between the Vajrasuchi text of Buddhism and Vajrasuchi Upanishad of Hinduism has long been of interest to scholars. This interest began with Brian Houghton Hodgson ‚Äì a colonial official based in Nepal who was loaned a Sanskrit text titled Vajra Suchi in 1829, by a Buddhist friend of his, whose contents turned out to be similar to the Vajrasuci Upanishad. In 1835, Hodgson published a translation.Brian Houghton Hodgson (1835), [ Vajra Suchi by Asvaghosha], Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Transactions, Volume III, J. Murray and Parbury, Allen & Co. The first line of the Hodgson translation mentioned \\"Ashu Ghosa\\" and invoked \\"Manja Ghosa\\" as the Guru of the World. The details of the caste system, its antiquity and \\"shrewd and argumentative attack\\" by a Buddhist, in the words of Hodgson, gained wide interest among 19th-century scholars. The scholarship that followed, surmised that \\"Ashu Ghosa\\" is possibly the famous Buddhist scholar Asvaghosa, who lived around the 2nd century CE. Scholars such as Weber, Burnouf and Winternitz attempted to authenticate and place the text in the history of Buddhist literature, without success. Winternitz in his review wrote, \\"there are grave doubts as to whether Asvaghosa was actually the author\\" of the Buddhist Vajrasuci, or ascertain when it was written and by whom. The serious objections to its authenticity came from attempts to chronologically place the Buddhist Vajrasuci text in known, methodically dated and preserved Chinese translations of Indian Buddhist texts, as well as the Tibetan archives and the Hindu anthologies that included Vajrasuci Upanishad as a significant text. The Vajrasuci, added Winternitz as well as other scholars, is not enumerated either by the 7th- century Chinese scholar I-Tsing or in the Tibetan Tanjur among the works of Asvaghosa.SN Dasgupta and SK De (1947), A History of Sanskrit Literature: Classical Period, Volume 1, University of Calcutta, page 71 with footnotes 2 through 4 Further, the only known Chinese translation and compilation that does mention a \\"Vajrasuci\\" was completed between 973‚Äì981 CE, but this Chinese collection states that the Vajrasuci was authored by Dharmakirti and that it refutes the Vedas. The text there is very different, and scholars have wondered if that is because Buddhist Vajrasuci was different from Vajrasuci Upanishad, or because Chinese version got badly corrupted over time. Johnston, in 1936, added his voice to the doubt, stating there are serious doubts that Vajrasuci is an authentic work of Asvaghosa, because it cites Manusmriti by name. Johnston called the manuscript attributed to Asvaghosa as \\"a clever piece of polemics\\" that shows no trace of Asvaghosa's literary style and mentality. Patrick Olivelle in his 2005 book, states that a close examination of the surviving version of the Buddhist Vajrasuci supports Johnston's serious doubts, and it cannot be dated \\"even close to the 2nd-century CE\\", about the time when Asvaghosa lived. The false ascription of the text to the Buddhist Asvaghosa, adds Olivelle, continues to be currently perpetuated in India. Reception Mariola Offredi ‚Äì a professor of Literature at the University of Venice, states that among all pre-colonial Sanskrit texts, the Vajrasuci Upanishad is a \\"sustained philosophical attack against the division of human beings into four social classes determined by birth\\". While many other Hindu texts such as Bhagavad Gita and Puranas question and critique varna and social divisions, adds Offredi, these discussions are at their thematic margins; only in Vajrasuci Upanishad do we find the questioning and philosophical rejection of varna to be the central message.Mariola Offredi (1997), The banyan tree: essays on early literature in new Indo-Aryan languages, Volume 2, Manohar Publishers, , , page 442 Ashwani Peetush ‚Äì a professor of Philosophy at the Wilfrid Laurier University, states the Vajrasuchi Upanishad is a significant text because it assumes and asserts that any human being can achieve the highest spiritual state of existence.Ashwani Peetush (2011), Justice and Religion: Hinduism, in Encyclopedia of Global Justice, Springer Netherlands, , pages 596‚Äì600 The Vajrasuchi was studied and referred to by social reformers in the 19th century, states Rosalind O'Hanlon, to assert that \\"the whole of human kind is of one caste\\", that it is character not birth that distinguishes people.Rosalind O'Hanlon (2002), Caste, Conflict and Ideology, Cambridge University Press, , page 227 According to Nadkarni, the Vajrasuchika Upanishad is among the many ancient and medieval era texts that demolish the myth that Hindu scriptures supported a caste system.M.V.

The coat of arms was acknowledged in 1816 by the High Council of Nobility, the coat of arms has not been changed ever since.  History  The oldest known seal dates from 1361. The herrings stand upright. They probably symbolise the importance of fishery. Besides the herrings the seal also shows two six pointed stars. The seal was used until 1478. A new seal was created in 1538. This seal shows the herrings placed horizontally on a shield. This shield - or escutcheon - is held by a woman standing on the side. In 1816 Enkhuizen received a new coat of arms, acknowledged by the High Council of Nobility. The herrings on the seal have never been crowned. In the atlas made by Willem Blaeu they do wear crowns. The coat of arms is shown in azure and argent. The coat of arms is also shown in the canton of the flag of Enkhuizen. Herrings were also used on the coat of arms of the water board Drechterland. This coat of arms was partially formed by map makers who expressed their artistic freedom during the creation process. Until 1816 the herrings looked towards the right (left from the viewpoint of the bearer), they had no crowns and there were two stars between the herrings. Both stars had six points but since 1816 they have eight points. The supporter probably is the personification of Enkhuizen, in Dutch stedenmaagd.  Heraldic elements  The coat of arms exists out of an escutcheon and a supporter. There is no crown, motto or other heraldic element. = Escutcheon = The field of the coat of arms is azure and charged with three vertically ordered argent herrings looking to the right and placed en fasce. All three have a crown or three acanthus leaves (in Dutch heraldry: fleurons) above their head. Above the dorsal spines they have a star containing eight points. = Supporter = The supporter is not properly described in the emblazonment. She is only described as a woman standing. Neither the cloths, nor the way the woman holds the escutcheon is described. Usually she wears white clothing and she holds a shield using a red ribbon to do so. She always pictured on the right side (left from the viewpoint of the bearer) of the coat of arms, and on a field of grass.

Unlike summative assessments, that check for understanding at the end of learn, formative assessments come in during learning. and ‚ÄúFormative assessments support learning during the learning process. They serve as practice for students, just like a meaningful homework assignment. They check for understanding along the way and guide teacher decision making about future instruction.‚Äù Formative assessments give teachers a chance to break down complex ideas into smaller understandable pieces. This allows teachers to correct ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù and fine tune skills before summative assessments. I thought you said sports? While formative assessment is mostly talked about in the classroom it can also be used in athletics. Think about the process in learning a new sport. We take the whole sport and break it down into simple steps. Along the way we have coaches giving us specific feed back. We don‚Äôt teach a new sport to kids by having them go out and play in a game right away. If we did, our feedback after our summative assessment (their game) would likely be negative. Instead along the way we break sports up into drills and game like situations. This allows coaches to give athletes feedback and make corrections before the game. The process of breaking ‚Äúchunking‚Äù a sport can be broken down into three parts: drill, situations, and competitions. Each one of these is a stepping stone to the next. Even during competitions adjustments and learning can occur. Drill We take a sport and break it down to simple moves. Like dribbling a basketball or shooting a single leg takedown. While we are working on simple moves, coaches are looking for specific things. Where are the athlete‚Äôs eyes? Are their feet moving in the right direction? These things are considered our success criteria for each drill. Coaches use these to give athletes‚Äô feedback in order for them to successfully complete the drill. By providing good feedback like, ‚Äúkeep your eyes up when dribbling,‚Äù or, ‚Äúyour left foot is sliding to the right,‚Äù coaches are giving pointers to the learner that they can immediately work on correcting. \\"The principle of specificity in training states that the body will adapt to the specific imposed stimulus. Therefore, if an athlete desires to improve in a specific skill, movement, or exercise, he or she must perform that exercise in training with multiple variations, or tweaks, to that drill. Because of the complexity of the human structure and human movement, specificity is paramount in training to reach the desired outcome. Another layer to this philosophy is that if the test is the exercise, then if the exercise is properly tweaked (complex variations), it will provide the best opportunity for an improved outcome .\\" The only way to achieve the desired outcome is to drill and tweak until we get to the desired outcome. Takedown Drill - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfu1ikO__-s Situations Coaches put athletes in live situations all the time. Full-court presses, fumbles on the football field, bunting with man on bases are just a few examples. These situations are assessing a team's response to the situation. The coach can tell if the team has specifics areas they need to work on. Maybe the pitcher needs to cover first base, but was unaware of that until the situation. By chunking up a game into situations coaches are able to simulate games while keeping the ability to give instruction and instant feedback. \\"Simulation training enables athletes to develop and master the skills they will need to maintain optimal focus and perform their best in competition. In simulated competitions, athletes become aware of what they will confront in actual competition.\\" Baseball practice- Bunt offense and bunt defense- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvXT6kq4lR4 Competitions The last way coaches can use formative assessment is during a competition. While some may see this as the summative assessment, I believe that happens as a team looks back on the season as a whole. During competitions coaches might praise specific things and athlete is doing, ‚Äúgood coverage on the receiver, turn your hips with him right away.‚Äù Coaches can also give feedback during halftime or the end of a quarter. ‚ÄúWe are giving the quarterback open passing lanes in the middle. Our middle linebacker should line up five yards off the ball instead of three.‚Äù These are formative assessments made during the progression of competitions.

Named the \\"Unofficial Ambassador of Good Eating\\" by the Maine Department of Agriculture, she wrote a weekly food column for the Bangor Daily News from 1951 to 1994 promoting traditional Maine recipes. She was the main proponent of the claim that the chocolate brownie was invented in Bangor. She was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1997. Early life and education Readfield Depot, c. 1909 She was born Mildred Greely Brown on a farm in Readfield Depot, Maine, to Fred Brown and Nellie Mabel Gordon Brown. She was a member of the Kennebec County 4-H club and won a canning contest in her teens. After graduating from Winthrop High School in 1921, she attended the University of Maine ‚Äì the first person in her family to go to college ‚Äì and earned a bachelor's degree in home economics in 1925. Career She began her career as a tester for home gas stoves for the Bangor Gas Company. She next worked as an assistant leader in 4-H clubs statewide and as the Penobscot County 4-H club agent through the 1930s, updating home demonstrators on \\"food preservation, kitchen design and farm life\\". In the 1940s she worked for the United States Department of Agriculture Extension Service, giving demonstrations and classes and also teaching \\"camp cookery to forestry students\\". She also taught home economics classes at the University of Maine. In the 1950s and 1960s she became the Maine Food Products Promoter for the Maine Department of Agriculture, and also did cooking demonstrations on television. =Food columnist= Schrumpf began writing a weekly food column called \\"Brownie's Kitchen\\" for the Bangor Daily News on August 31, 1951. Each column opened with remembrances of life in 20th- century Maine and featured traditional recipes using simple ingredients that could be found in any Maine grocery. Although she initially eschewed the use of ready-made ingredients, Schrumpf later printed recipes using convenience foods, which were included in her second cookbook collection, Memories from Brownie's Kitchen (1989). She continued producing her column until April 4, 1994. =\\"Bangor Brownies\\"= A chocolate brownie Schrumpf received widespread publicity for her claim that the chocolate brownie was invented in Bangor, Maine. In its first edition (2007), The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink refuted her premise that \\"Bangor housewives\\" had created the brownie. The Oxford Companion noted that while Schrumpf cited the inclusion of the recipe in the Girl's Welfare Cook Book published in Bangor in 1912 as proof of the brownie's origins, a Fannie Farmer cookbook published in 1905 already contained a recipe for the chewy chocolate treat. However, in its second edition (2013), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America said it had discovered evidence to support Schrumpf's claim, in the form of several 1904 cookbooks that listed a recipe for \\"Bangor Brownies\\". Other activities Schrumpf served as a judge for the Bangor State Fair and the national Pillsbury Bake-Off. She chaired the Maine Boiler Festival Chicken Barbecues and Luncheons, and headed delegations of Maine food demonstrators to the Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield, Massachusetts. She maintained a lifelong association with the University of Maine and its alumni association, serving as class secretary for 40 years. She provided many artifacts for the \\"Brownie's Kitchen\\" exhibit, a replica of an early 20th- century farmhouse kitchen, at the Page Farm & Home Museum on the university campus. Honors and awards The University of Maine alumni association awarded her its Black Bear Award in 1957 and Pine Tree Alumni Service Emblem in 1974. She was named Woman of the Year by the Maine Press, Radio and TV Women in 1968 and \\"Unofficial Ambassador of Good Eating\\" by the Maine Department of Agriculture in 1970. She received a Kiwanis Recognition in Service Award from the Orono-Old Town Kiwanis chapter in 1976 and an Achievement Citation Award from the Maine chapter of the American Association of University Women in 1989. She was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1997. Personal Known for her lively and energetic personality, she was always happy to answer cooking questions and share recipe advice. As she advanced in years, her birthday celebrations were well-attended affairs that were said to \\"require traffic control\\"; for one \\"birthday bash\\", a 20-person committee coordinated the event. She married William E. Schrumpf, an agricultural economist at the University of Maine Agricultural Experimental Station, in 1932; he predeceased her in 1976. In her final years, she resided in a nursing home in Orono, where she died on March 2, 2001 at the age of 98. The Brownie and William E. Schrumpf Papers, including her extensive collection of Maine community cookbooks and recipe pamphlets, are housed in the special collections department of the Raymond H.

She returned to New Zealand to write her father's memoirs and spent time on Stewart Island. According to her biographical entry in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, she purchased the of land clad with bush and overlooking Halfmoon Bay at that time, but during a speaking tour in Auckland in April 1940, she appeared to imply that her father purchased the land for her at her birth. She had a homestead built in 1934‚Äì35 in a Dutch colonial style and called it Moturau Moana, which is MƒÅori and means \\"islands of bush above the sea\\". Baker drew inspiration from an acquaintance, British garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, and created a garden based on New Zealand flora. She used a list compiled by botanist Leonard Cockayne based on his 1907 visit to Stewart Island to grow all the island's indigenous plants in her garden. Baker tried to gift Moturau Moana to the University of Otago and the Canterbury University College, but both organisations declined due to the ongoing maintenance costs. In November 1940, it was reported that Moturau Moana had been given to the Crown as a botanical research station. were designated as a scenic reserve a month later just before Christmas. At Baker's request, the reserve was named in her father's name. Baker continued to live in the house, but on 7 December 1948, she handed the keys to her house to the minister of lands, Jerry Skinner, in an official ceremony. For her botanical work at Moturau Moana, Baker was awarded the Loder Cup in 1949. Baker had another cottage built for herself on Stewart Island, but she later purchased a house in Nelson where she stayed over winter. She died on Stewart Island in 1958. Her homestead, for a long time a major tourist attraction, burned down in 1967. Moturau Moana was at first administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, followed by the New Zealand Forest Service, and upon its disestablishment in 1987, by the Department of Conservation.

After the Thurloes discuss the noises from their bedroom that might disturb others (the dialogue contains a large amount of innuendo), Mr. Thurloe pulls Arthur to one side and begs him to buy the house so that he would not be trapped with Mrs. Thurloe and their son Mark, who tries to proposition Emmy, but she slaps him. Arthur makes an offer for the house, but is rejected as he lacks any documentation to prove that he has the necessary finances. Mrs. Thurloe then makes an offer, which is accepted. In a park Arthur worries that Emmy will never enjoy being spoiled and resolves to treat her to a trip to the West End of London. He takes Emmy to Fortnum and Masons. After a sales pitch (in song) by a salesman, Arthur buys Emmy an expensive gold watch with a strap made of elephant hair. Meanwhile, Mavis's parents become concerned at Arthur's disappearance with the money and ring the police to report him and Emmy missing. After visiting a cafe, Arthur takes Emmy to the zoo. As the five-millionth customer, Emmy is rewarded with a free visit escorted by the zookeeper Bent, and Arthur and Emmy are given a free ride on an elephant. When Emmy tells Bent that her new watch is made of elephant hair, Bent says that elephants do not have hair and that the alleged hair on her watch is a piece of wire. Arthur's conversation with Bent shows concern about the treatment of the animals in the zoo, who were born in captivity and given euthanasia when no longer of use. Emmy becomes very attached to the elephant. When Bent says that the elephant is due to be put down soon (referred to as \\"going into the gas chamber\\"), as a new shipment of elephants is expected, Emmy asks Arthur to buy her the elephant, and he eventually does. Arthur and Emmy are joined by a group of young people. (The elephant disappears without explanation at this point in the film, which Loach later said he regretted.BFI Screenonline - The End of Arthur's Marriage (1965) - Synopsis) The group are shown riding down the canal on a barge and a dance begins with a singer named Lily who strips her top half so that only her bra remains. Arthur dances with her and, in his excitement, throws his remaining money into the canal. Emmy tells him to behave better, and the party ends with two of the young people criticising Arthur as irresponsible. Arthur asks Lily if she would like to come home with him, but she turns him down. Arthur and Emmy return to Mavis's parents' house, where Mavis and her parents seem to know what has transpired. After Arthur admits that he has used all the money that was given to him, he is prevented from entering and given his belongings in a suitcase, but Emmy is brought inside before the door is closed. Arthur then leaves the suitcase in the garden and walks away. As the end credits roll, some quotes from the film are repeated before Lily's song from the barge is played again. Style The play is unusual for Ken Loach, a director known for social realism, in that it has elements of fantasy and surrealism. Some breakaway scenes fit with the theme of the plot. After the Thurloes beat Arthur and Mavis for the house up for sale, a large football crowd is jubilant in applauding the Thurloes for their success and cease applauding for Arthur. Many couples are shown arguing throughout the film as a constant theme. However, other scenes appear for no apparent reason. The more obscure scenes include reports of the death of tourists in a plane crash, an interview on the history of gas works, a man shaving, two prostitutes' discussing a solicitor who role-plays as Mr. Universe (a dialogue that includes a large amount of sexual innuendo) and a police officer's jumping out of his moving car to ask Arthur for a light for his cigarette. The use of nudity in the play was unusual on the BBC during the period this drama was broadcast. In 2011, the film was given a 12 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification for \\"brief sexualised nudity\\".THE WEDNESDAY PLAY - THE END OF ARTHUR'S MARRIAGE, BBFC website, retrieved 4 April 2016 Shortly after Arthur and Emmy leave Fortnum and Masons, there is a brief scene in which a cafe worker named Harry Otana remembers his home in Africa that contains full frontal nudity. In addition, the scene in the zoo is interrupted by an enactment of the eating of forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, in which Adam and Eve are naked, and a close-up of Eve shows her winking at the camera seductively. This scene ends with Adam and Eve as a modern, clothed couple walking from their house to their car. An interpretation of the Garden-of-Eden scene, which comes after a discussion on the ethics of zoos, is that ownership of animals by humans came after the eating of the forbidden fruit, and led to the caging and eating of animals by humans. This links with the fetishisation of ownership, which is a theme of the film. There are cameo appearances in the play by BBC journalist Kenneth Allsop and by Loach himself in the same scene outside Fortnum and Masons. Allsop is interviewing members of the public on whether they prefer working or spending money, when Loach interrupts him to say that his interviews are interfering with the picture that he is trying to film. As in Loach's earlier work, Three Clear Sundays, an earlier Wednesday Play broadcast the previous April, songs are used both as part of the dialogue and as commentary on the plot. For example, in Fortnum and Masons, a salesman sings about the merits of a particular watch. In an earlier scene of Mavis's parents, a song describes them as fearful, boring and obedient. As with the breakaway scenes, there are songs that appear for no apparent reason, such as Aunty Mary.

The statement was forged during the union of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the formation of the Presbyterian Church (USA). Although Reformed in its origins, the preface to the statement explicitly notes its universal intention: \\"This statement therefore intends to confess the catholic faith.\\" As such, the statement is internally organized with an ecumenical, and Trinitarian structure, having both a reformed and Protestant flavor with regard to soteriology and yet remains sensitive to contemporary concerns such as gendered language of God, sexism, racism, and care of creation and the environment. The tone and content of the statement strongly parallels (and was possibly influenced by) the 1981 doxological version of the Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ. Text In life and in death we belong to God. Through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, we trust in the one triune God, the Holy One of Israel, whom alone we worship and serve. We trust in Jesus Christ, Fully human, fully God. Jesus proclaimed the reign of God: preaching good news to the poor and release to the captives, teaching by word and deed and blessing the children, healing the sick and binding up the brokenhearted, eating with outcasts, forgiving sinners, and calling all to repent and believe the gospel. Unjustly condemned for blasphemy and sedition, Jesus was crucified, suffering the depths of human pain and giving his life for the sins of the world. God raised this Jesus from the dead, vindicating his sinless life, breaking the power of sin and evil, delivering us from death to life eternal. We trust in God, whom Jesus called Abba, Father. In sovereign love God created the world good and makes everyone equally in God‚Äôs image male and female, of every race and people, to live as one community. But we rebel against God; we hide from our Creator. Ignoring God‚Äôs commandments, we violate the image of God in others and ourselves, accept lies as truth, exploit neighbor and nature, and threaten death to the planet entrusted to our care. We deserve God‚Äôs condemnation. Yet God acts with justice and mercy to redeem creation. In everlasting love, the God of Abraham and Sarah chose a covenant people to bless all families of the earth. Hearing their cry, God delivered the children of Israel from the house of bondage. Loving us still, God makes us heirs with Christ of the covenant. Like a mother who will not forsake her nursing child, like a father who runs to welcome the prodigal home, God is faithful still. We trust in God the Holy Spirit, everywhere the giver and renewer of life. The Spirit justifies us by grace through faith, sets us free to accept ourselves and to love God and neighbor, and binds us together with all believers in the one body of Christ, the Church. The same Spirit who inspired the prophets and apostles rules our faith and life in Christ through Scripture, engages us through the Word proclaimed, claims us in the waters of baptism, feeds us with the bread of life and the cup of salvation, and calls women and men to all ministries of the church. In a broken and fearful world the Spirit gives us courage to pray without ceasing, to witness among all peoples to Christ as Lord and Savior, to unmask idolatries in Church and culture, to hear the voices of peoples long silenced, and to work with others for justice, freedom, and peace. In gratitude to God, empowered by the Spirit, we strive to serve Christ in our daily tasks and to live holy and joyful lives, even as we watch for God's new heaven and new earth, praying, ‚ÄúCome, Lord Jesus!‚Äù With believers in every time and place, we rejoice that nothing in life or in death can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.

He represented both New Zealand and Scotland in rugby union and won the Military Cross during World War I as a captain in the British Rifle Brigade. A Rhodes Scholar, he became headmaster of both John McGlashan College in Dunedin, New Zealand, and Scotch College, Melbourne, and served as deputy chancellor of the University of Melbourne on two separate occasions. Early life and family Born at Broughty Ferry, Scotland, on 17 March 1885, Gilray was the fourth child of Annie Gilray (n√©e Macdonald) and her husband, Thomas Gilray, at the time professor of English language and literature at University College, Dundee. The family moved to Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1890 after Thomas Gilray was appointed professor of English language and literature at the University of Otago in 1889. Gilray was educated at Otago Boys' High School, and went on to the University of Otago, where he was president of the student union. He graduated in 1907 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and German (first-class honours) and classics (second-class honours). Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1907, Gilray went to University College, Oxford, graduating Master of Arts with second-class honours in 1910. Between 1910 and 1913 he taught at Mill Hill School, London. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1913 and then returned to New Zealand, practising law at Milton. On 24 November 1917, Gilray married Ethel Muriel Standish at Haslemere, Surrey, England. Ethel was the daughter of Arthur Standish, the first mayor of New Plymouth. She was in England as a nurse at the No. 2 New Zealand General Hospital in Walton-on- Thames, where New Zealand troops were hospitalised, and was particularly noted for her massage work. The couple went on to have one daughter. Rugby union A wing three-quarter, Gilray played for the Otago University club during his undergraduate studies. He made his provincial debut for in 1904, and also played for the South Island in the inter-island fixture that year. In 1905 he declined a place on The Original All Blacks tour of the British Isles, France and the United States, but he did play for New Zealand against the touring Australian side in their single Test match, at Tahuna Park, Dunedin, on 2 September 1905. The 14‚Äì3 victory by New Zealand was to be Gilray's only appearance for the national team. He continued to play for Otago through the 1906 season. After taking up his Rhodes Scholarship, Gilray played rugby for Oxford University and London Scottish. He made his debut for Scotland on 21 March 1908 in the 1908 Home Nations Championship, against England at Inverleith, with Scotland winning the match by 16 points to 10. He was awarded an Oxford Blue later that year. In the 1909 Home Nations Championship, Gilray made two appearances for Scotland, against Wales and England. In the latter game he scored his only try for Scotland. He made a further appearance for Scotland, in the 1912 Five Nations Championship against Ireland. Gilray also captained London Scottish. Back in New Zealand in 1914, Gilray made one final appearance as an injury replacement for the Otago University team during the local club competition final. Military service Gilray enlisted in the British Army in early 1916, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) in July that year. He was wounded on 13 November 1916 during the latter stages of the Battle of the Somme. Promoted to captain, he was invalided back to England in September 1917. He was awarded the Military Cross, gazetted on 1 January 1918. For the remainder of the war, Gilray trained officer cadets at Aldershot. From 1921 until 1935, when he was transferred to the retired list, Gilray was a captain in the 2nd Battalion Otago Regiment, New Zealand Territorial Force. Teaching career Gilray returned to practising law in Milton in 1919. However, in 1922 he was appointed principal of John McGlashan College in Dunedin, succeeding Arthur Gordon Butchers. During his tenure, Gilray developed music and science at the school, and raised academic standards. While visiting Queenstown in September 1931, Gilray sustained a fracture dislocation of his left ankle when it was run over by the car that he was pushing in an attempt to make it start. He was left with one leg shorter than the other. Gilray was elected to the University of Otago Council in 1925, and the Council of the University of New Zealand in 1927. In 1933 he declined nomination as vice-chancellor of the University of Otago. In 1934, after 12 years at John McGlashan, Gilray took up the post of principal of Scotch College, Melbourne, following the death of the incumbent, William Still Littlejohn. With 1500 pupils at Scotch College compared to about 200 at John McGlashan, Gilray found that he was fully occupied by administrative tasks, although he occasionally still found time to teach English or religious studies. Under his leadership the school developed its art, theatre and music programmes, and he resisted higher student fees. Gilray was a member of the standing committee of the Headmasters' Conference of the Independent Schools of Australia (HCISA) from 1939 to 1952, and served as its chairman between 1949 and 1952. He retired as principal of Scotch College at the end of April 1953. In the Australian 1951 New Year Honours Gilray was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his services as principal of Scotch College. His brother, Thomas Gilray, was also appointed an OBE in the New Zealand 1951 New Year Honours, for services as a medical practitioner. Later life and death Following his retirement from Scotch College, Gilray continued as executive officer of the HCISA for 10 years. He served as deputy chancellor of the University of Melbourne from 1954 to 1958 and 1959 to 1962. The University of Melbourne conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws on Gilray in 1956. Between 1961 and 1965 Gilray was a member of the Committee on the Future Development of Tertiary Education in Australia, chaired by Sir Leslie Martin, which led to a formalised ‚Äòbinary divide‚Äô between the universities, as research and teaching institutions, and other higher education teaching institutions. Ethel Gilray died in 1968. Colin Macdonald Gilray died in East Melbourne on 15 July 1974, and he was buried with his wife at Box Hill Cemetery.

They are commonly referred to as the Lancaster Martyrs and are commemorated locally by the Lancaster Martyrs Memorial Stone which may be found close to the centre of Lancaster city. Law at the time, such as the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, made it treason to be a Catholic priest in England and therefore Catholic priests were typically hanged, drawn and quartered. Laymen convicted of assisting priests were usually sentenced to the lesser punishment of execution by hanging.  List of the Lancaster Martyrs  The Lancaster Martyrs include the following individuals: * Edmund Arrowsmith: A Jesuit priest born in Haydock and executed in Lancaster on 28 August 1628. Declared a saint by the Catholic church. * Ambrose Barlow: A Benedictine priest born in Manchester and executed in Lancaster on 10 September 1641. Declared a saint by the Catholic church. * Edward Bamber: A priest born in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool and executed in Lancaster on 7 August 1646. Beatified by the Catholic church. * James Bell: A priest born in Warrington and executed in Lancaster on 10 April 1584. Beatified by the Catholic church. * John Finch: A layman born in Eccleston near Preston and executed alongside James Bell in Lancaster on 10 April 1584. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Richard Hurst: A layman born in Broughton and executed alongside Edmund Arrowsmith in Lancaster on 28 August 1628. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Thurstan Hunt: A priest born in Rothwell near Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire and executed in Lancaster on 3 April 1601. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Robert Middleton: A Jesuit priest born in York and executed alongside Thurstan Hunt in Lancaster on 3 April 1601. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Robert Nutter: A Dominican priest born in Burnley and executed in Lancaster on 26 July 1600. Beatified by the Catholic church. * John Thules: A priest born in Whalley and executed in Lancaster on 18 March 1616. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Thomas Whittaker: A priest born in Burnley and executed in Lancaster on 7 August 1646. Beatified by the Catholic church. * John Woodcock: A Fransciscan priest born in Clayton-le.Woods and executed in Lancaster alongside Thomas Whitaker on 7 August 1646. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Edward Thwing: A priest born in Heworth near York and executed in Lancaster alongside Robert Nutter on 26 July 1600. Beatified by the Catholic church. * Roger Wrenno: A layman born in Chorley and executed in Lancaster alongside John Thules on 18 March 1646. Beatified by the Catholic church * Lawrence Bailey (Baily): A layman executed in Lancaster on 18 March 1604. The last Abbot of Whalley Abbey, John Paslew and the last Abbot of Sawley Abbey, William Trafford along with a monk by the name of Richard Estegate are also believed to have been executed at Lancaster on 10 March 1537 after being tried for complicity in the Pilgrimage of Grace, although there are some claims that Paslew was taken back to Whalley for execution. Whilst there is a tradition of considering them among Catholic martyrs of the English reformation, they are not formally listed among those martyrs that have had their cause advanced through the canonisation process of the Catholic church.  Lancaster Martyrs' Memorial Stone  Inscription on the Lancaster Martyrs' Memorial StoneThe executions were not carried out on the same spot and their precise sites on Far Moor, to the East of the city, were never formally recorded in order to avoid any future veneration of martyrs by Catholics. However, a memorial standing in the approximate vicinity of at least some of the executions was eventually erected in 1996 and blessed in front of a crowd of several hundred people. It is located in what is now recreation ground (opposite Williamson Park and North of Quernmore Road) on a hillside above the Catholic Cathedral of St Peter and St Thomas More, looking out towards the panorama of Morecambe Bay and the mountains of the Lake District. The Lancaster Martyrs' Memorial Stone is dedicated \\"to the memory of those Martyred for their faith in Lancaster\\". It includes a quotation from the Gospel of Matthew (20:22): \\"Can you drink the Chalice that I am about to drink? They said to Him, we can.\\"  Canonisation and Beatification of the Martyrs  Numerous men and women killed during the reformation period have been officially recognised as martyrs of the English reformation by the Catholic Church. Two of the Lancaster Martyrs, Edmund Arrowsmith and Ambrose Barlow, were among the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales canonised by Pope Paul VI as saints on 25 October 1970. James Bell, John Finch, and Richard Hurst were among one hundred and thirty seven martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope Pius XI on 15 December 1929. Edward Bamber, John Thules, Robert Nutter, Thurstan Hunt, Robert Middleton, Thomas Whitaker, John Woodcock, Edward Thwing and Roger Wrenno were among eight five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987. Lawrence Bailey has not been canonised as a saint or beatified. However he has been declared as \\"venerable\\", a lower status in the canonisation process. Abbot John Paslew, Abbot William Trafford and Richard Estegate have not had their cause advanced to the Holy See.  Feast of the Lancaster Martyrs  The Catholic church marks the feast of the Lancaster Martyrs on 7 August. This feast is usually celebrated in the Catholic Cathedral of Lancaster on that day. A specific collect for the feast day reads: \\"Almighty Father, may those who died on the hill above Lancaster, grieving for England which they prayed God soon to convert, be our patrons now in heaven that our lives may witness to the faith they professed. Through Our Lord jesus Christ, who lvies and reigns with you in unity of the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen\\" The feast of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, which include Edmund Arrowsmith and Ambrose Barlow among their number, is celebrated on 25 October.

A resident of Newton for most of his life, he graduated from Tufts University and, after dropping out of the University of Virginia School of Law, found employment as a civil engineer, real estate broker, and university instructor. A progressive member of the Democratic Party, he served on the Newton Board of Aldermen as well as in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. From his election to the House in 1968, freshman legislator Shea engaged in activism against the Vietnam War and supported the burgeoning modern environmental movement. A bill he sponsored, which later bore his name, exempted Massachusetts residents from being conscripted into federal service in undeclared foreign conflicts. While it passed the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Francis Sargent, the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. Laird declined to hear the state's challenge the war's constitutionality. Already feeling overworked soon after he entered the legislature, Shea was frequently asked to speak and floated as a candidate for higher office. Succumbing to what his wife described as \\"political pressures,\\" he committed suicide by gunshot at the age of 30. Early life and family =Childhood and education= Shea was born on December 10, 1939 in Boston, Massachusetts, the first of three sons of Eileen (n√©e Curtin; 1911‚Äì2002) and Herman James Shea Sr. (1911‚Äì1998). His father was a civil engineer and member of the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He grew up in Newton and attended public schools there, including Newton High School, from which he graduated in 1957. He then went on to Tufts University, where he earned a degree in political science, with a minor in economics; he attended the University of Virginia School of Law, following this, but left after completing 34 credit hours. Before devoting himself to politics full-time, he was employed as civil engineer and real estate broker. He also completed graduate work and served as a teaching assistant in political science at Northeastern University. =Marriage= In 1967, Shea married the former Anita Vesta McDonald, an instructor at Salem State College, at Saint Mary's Catholic Church in Plainfield, New Jersey. The couple settled in Newton after a honeymoon through New England and Canada. Political career =Local politics= Shea sworn in as alderman by Newton mayor Monte Basbas Shea first ran for an at-large seat on the Newton Board of Aldermen in 1963. In a race for two spots from Ward 7, he ran on a progressive platform that included providing public records of board attendance and activities. He placed a distant fourth among the candidates. In 1965, he ran again, this time for the Ward 7 seat being vacated by incumbent William Carmen, and initially came in 8 votes behind Boston University professor Harry H. Crosby. After a recount, Shea was given 961 votes to Crosby's 958 and was declared winner. =State politics and anti-war activism= Shea with Professor Steve Worth and Governor Francis Sargent at the Shea Bill's signing ceremony He was opposed to the Vietnam War, and he drafted a bill challenging its constitutionality, thus enabling Massachusetts residents to ignore the draft. Death and funeral On May 8, 1970, Shea and his wife went to the home of John M. McDonnell, a Newton alderman and friend, where they spent the evening socializing. Upon returning to their residence on Princess Road in West Newton, Shea committed suicide by gunshot in front of his wife at approximately 12:30 the following morning. He had reportedly been under \\"political pressure\\" at the time. After Shea's wife phoned McDonnell, who called the police, Shea was transported to Newton- Wellesley Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival at 12:55. Attendees at the funeral included U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, Congressman Philip J. Philbin, and Massachusetts Attorney General Robert H. Quinn. Legacy Businessman Robert Kraft was elected chairman of the Newton City Democratic Committee in 1968. The death of Shea, a friend, deterred Kraft from further pursuing a career in politics, including a 1970 congressional run.

She is a Professor of Political Science at University of Paris-8 and a founder of the collective Les Mots Sont Importants. Biography Born in 1971, Tissot studied at Sciences-Po, the University of Minnesota, and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, where she earned a PhD with highest honors. She began her career as an Assistant Professor at University of Strasbourg and now serves as a Professor in the Political Science department at the University of Vincennes-Saint Denis Paris-8, directing the \\"Discrimination, Diversity and Representations\\" track in Master's Program in Political Science. She has been a Fulbright Scholar as well as a visiting scholar at NYU and Harvard University. Research Tissot's research deals with urban policy and the transformation of major cities in France and the United States, focusing on such topics as public housing and gentrification. Her first book L'Etat et les quartiers. Gen√®se d'une cat√©gorie de l'action publique (Seuil 2007) examines the evolution of public housing in France since World War II and the emergence of the \\"quartier sensible\\" (\\"sensitive neighborhood\\") as a category of state intervention. Tissot argues that a view of social ills as localized in at-risk neighborhoods replaced systemic economic analysis in French public policy. Tissot's second book, De bons voisins. Enqu√™te dans un quartier de la bourgeoisie progressiste (Raisons d'agir 2011) examines gentrification in Boston's South End. Through historical and ethnographic research, Tissot maps the contested, contingent processes that transformed the neighborhood. She focuses particularly on the ambivalent tool of \\"diversity\\", detailing the central role this principle played as a group of progressive upper-middle-class residents established themselves as a local elite in the formerly working-class neighborhood. Verso Books published an English translation of De bons voisins in 2015, entitled Good Neighbors: Gentrifying Diversity in Boston's South End. Tissot's current research focuses on gay-friendliness in urban space. Tissot is a member of the Cultures et Societ√©s Urbaines (CSU) and Centre de Recherches Sociologiques et Politiques de Paris (CRESSPA) units at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and serves on the editorial board of leading social science journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales, founded in 1975 by Pierre Bourdieu. Activism In 2001, Tissot founded the activist collective Les Mots Sonts Importants with Pierre Tevanian and the lmsi.net website. Within the framework of this collective, she is particularly committed against policies restricting the right of entry and residence of foreigners, against double punishment and against impunity for police violence (notably during the forum \\"Let's Resist Together against Police Violence\\" organized with the Mouvement Immigration Banlieue in 2002). Within the Collective Une √âcole Pour Tou-te-s, she protests against the law on religious signs at school. In 2008, she participated in the creation of the French feminist collective Les TumulTueuses and in its actions, notably against the anti-nawab laws (anti- niqab law of 2010) and anti-prostitution laws (law penalizing the client in 2013). She stands for equal rights to marriage and parenthood between homosexuals and heterosexuals. Film In 2015, Tissot released two documentaries she directed with her sister, curator and filmmaker Florence Tissot: Je ne suis pas f√©ministe, mais... and L'Ab√©c√©daire de Christine Delphy. Je ne suis pas f√©ministe, mais... premiered in March 2015 and traces the biography, career and intellectual contributions of Christine Delphy, one of the founders of the French Women's Liberation Movement and of materialist feminism. L'Ab√©c√©daire features an extended dialogue between Sylvie Tissot and Delphy, examining major issues in Delphy's thought. Bibliography  * Filmography * Je ne suis pas f√©ministe, mais... dir.

It is a shrub with many hairy branches arising from near ground level, narrow, hooked leaves and mauve and blue flowers. Description Eremophila labrosa is an erect, broom-like shrub growing to about tall with branches that are covered with tangled, branched hairs and which are often at least partly sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches, linear in shape with a curved, hooked end. They are mostly long and wide, hairy at first but become glabrous, shiny, sticky and sometimes rough due to the presence of resin as they age. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a straight stalk, long. There are 5 overlapping, sticky, shiny, slightly wrinkled, elliptic to egg-shaped sepals which are long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple on the upper surface, pale lilac below and white inside. The outside of the petal tube is densely covered with glandular hairs but the inside surface of the lobes is mostly glabrous. The central part of the lower lip is pushed up, closely the opening of the petal tube which is densely woolly inside. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to October and is followed by oval-shaped to conical fruits with a pointed end and which are long.Norseman Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (labrosa) is derived from the Latin labrosa meaning \\"large-lipped\\", referring to the prominent lower lip of the petal tube. Distribution and habitat This eremophila is common in the Hyden Grasspatch and Norseman districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Eremophila labrosa is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has an upright, narrow, open growth habit and is ideal for situations requiring such a shape, especially since it bears masses of lilac to purple flowers in spring to early summer. It can be propagated from cuttings at most times of the year and grown in most soil types, including clay, in full sun or partial shade. It is reasonably drought tolerant and can withstand heavy frosts.

Early life and education  He was born in Dromcollogher on 31 March 1926 and after a local primary education attended St. Munchin's College, Limerick. He studied for the priesthood at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and was ordained there on 18 June 1950. He began postgraduate studies in Philosophy at the Catholic University of Louvain and was awarded a Doctorate in Philosophy there in 1951. After that he took up studies in Sociology at the University of Oxford for four years before taking up a teaching post at Queen's University, Belfast. Lecturer in Maynooth College In 1953 Newman was appointed Professor of Sociology at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, succeeding Peter McKevitt. It was an institution he would remain within, and eventually lead with distinction, until he was appointed Bishop of Limerick in May 1974. He published two books about the college Maynooth and Georgian Ireland (1979) followed by Maynooth and Victorian Ireland (1983)  Bishop of Limerick  He arrived in Limerick with a strong reputation for reform having served a number of years as President of Maynooth where he adapted and shaped the college to the new challenges of the 1970s. His academic background in sociology gave him an informed understanding of the changing dynamic in Irish life, especially rural life which he has been writing about since the early 1960s especially the dangers of depopulation. He often made comment on national matters particularly about church-state relations which has been his special area of study for over 20 years. He took what might be called a broadly 'conservative' approach which, as time went on, jarred with wider public opinion especially as Ireland faced a number of constitutional referenda in the 1980s. At least one modern author has quoted the epithet alleged to have been conferred on Dr Newman by Conor Cruise O'Brien 'The Mullah of Limerick\\" for articulating a neo-conservative position more commonly associated with the United States.  Death  Jeremiah Newman died in office and was the subject of many obituaries not least because of his extensive public statements in his years as Bishop of Limerick. The Tablet suggested he was most \\"well known for his conservatism and taste for controversial remarks\\" before quoting the homily by Cardinal Cahal Daly that \\"he seemed to have a strange sense of inadequacy; and, for one who was so lovable, he seemed to have difficulties in believing that others respected and admired and indeed loved him.\\" The Irish Times obituary said he was a man \\"who kept fighting the battles of long ago.\\" He was succeeded as Bishop of Limerick by Bishop Donal Murray.

Early years Skaters Cavalcade recorded the formation of the Alexandra Palace Roller Skating Club in 1905 by Messrs H Holmes, W Kent, Russell Smith, Gibbs, and Micklewood. This is predated by an account in Sporting Life of a game of roller hockey between Alexandra Palace and Thornsett in March 1904 at Crystal Palace. The club established itself as one of England‚Äôs top roller sports club enjoying success across all disciplines. A number of club members won national championships including speed skating champions Jimmy Reed, Eddie Stumbke and Dan Howard as well as figure skating champion Len Seagrave. Post-war Alexandra Palace RHC picked up where they left off following the war with further success in national speed skating championships. However, this success was set against an increasingly hostile relationship with the management of Alexandra Palace who in an attempt to maximise profits favoured prioritising rink time for public sessions. Later years The hockey team had its most successful period in the early 1960s winning the NRHA Cup in 1962, but this was followed by a sharp decline soon after. The rink at Alexandra Palace fell into an increasing state of disrepair during the 1970s culminating in sections of the roof collapsing in 1977. A fire during restoration damaged much of the rest of Alexandra Palace and signalled the end of Alexandra Palace RSC. The hockey section was reconstituted, first as Talacre RHC and then as North London RHC. The club disbanded in 1998.

He was promoted to major general on 26 December 1812 and after the end of the battle of Paris to general on 27 March 1814. After returning to Russia, he was put in command of the 4th Dragoon Division. On 25 June 1825 he became the supreme commander and governor of the Caucasus. He was promoted to general of the cavalry in July 1828, during the Russo-Turkish War (1828-29). In 1829 he organised and led the first Russian scientific expedition to Mount Elbrus, for which he was made a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Biography George Arsenyevich Manuiloviƒá (hence Emmanuel) was born in Vr≈°ac, a Serbian town in the Banat Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy where from early age he participated in actions against the Turks in the Siege of Belgrade (1789) in the ranks of the Serbian Frei-Corps (volunteers). In 1791 he joined the Austrian army to fight the Porte. At Landau in 1792, he was serious wounded after receiving a bayonet wound to the stomach, and a cannonball splinter to the right hand. The same year, in another battle he was shot with canister in the right leg. For his actions under combat, he was awarded a gold medal with inscription \\"Der Tapferkeit\\" (for bravery) and, notwithstanding his humble origins, was accepted in the Hungarian Guard with rank of second lieutenant in 1794. But Emmanuel soon found the Austrians reluctant to commit resources to the Serbian cause (war of independence). Dissatisfied with his prospects he resigned in late 1796 and sought military employment elsewhere. He arrived in Moscow in April 1797 and applied to Emperor Paul I of Russia, who immediately accepted his services. The same day, he enlisted in the Life Guard Hussar Regiment with a rank of lieutenant. The next year, he became staff rotmistrz (or rittmeister) and in 1799, was promoted to rotmistrz, commander of between 100 and 180 hussars, having lieutenant Hussar executing his order. He was highly valued by Paul I who, in October 1800, promoted Emmanuel to colonel. With the accession of Alexander I of Russia, Emmanuel's rapid promotion slowed down. In 1802, he was transferred to the Kiev Dragoon regiment and then participated in the 1806-1807 Campaign against Napoleon. At the Battle of Pultusk, he commanded two squadrons and was again seriously wounded, but remained in the ranks. For his courage, Emmanuel was awarded a Golden Weapon \\"For Bravery\\". After his wounds healed, he served in General Ivan Essen's 1st Corps. In June 1807, he fought at Dobre Miasto (Guttstadt), where he personally led his squadron in a charge and captured over 100 French. For his actions, he was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir (4th Class). He then distinguished himself at the Battle of Heilsberg and received the Order of Saint Anna (2nd Class). At the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807, he served with Kiev Dragoons, covered the retreat of the main forces, and destroyed the bridges over the Neman River. On 24 May 1808, he was appointed commander of the Kiev Dragoon Regiment and on 23 December 1808, became chef of the Kurland Dragoon Regiment. Two months later, on 2 February, he became chef of Kiev Dragoon Regiment. During the 1809 Campaign against Austria, his regiment was assigned to the corps of Sergey Fedorovich Golitsyn (1749-1810) to fight the Austrians, but Emmanuel appealed to Alexander for permission to avoid the service because he once had served in Austria. His petition was satisfied and he did not participate in the actions. In 1812, Emmanuel served in the 2nd Western Army and fought at the Battle of Mir (1812) on the 9th of July, for which he received the Order of St. Vladimir (3rd Class). He took part in actions at Novoselsk, Saltanovka, Smolensk and the retreat from the Battle of Borodino to the Shevardino Redoubt. He led several charges against the French at Shevardino but was wounded in the chest. For his courage, he received the Order of St. George (4th Class). Emmanuel spent next weeks recuperating and joined the army in late September at the Battle of Tarutino. In October he was assigned to the advance guard and fought at Battle of Vyazma. For his actions, he was promoted to major general on 7 January 1813. During the campaign in Germany, Emmanuel took part in sieges of Modlin and Glogow, and then commanded a detachment around Zwenkau. He was one of the first to cross the Elbe River and participated in several minor actions prior to the Battle of Bautzen, where he distinguished himself against Jacques MacDonald, Marshal of France. During the armistice, he was observing the demarcation lines on the Bohemian borders. For his actions before and after Bautzen, he was awarded the Order of St. Anna (1st Class) and Prussian Order of Red Eagle (2nd Class). As the hostilities resumed, Emmanuel commanded the cavalry of the advance guard of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's Corps. On the 19th of August he fought the French near Zibeneichen on the Bobr River and then had several minor actions until the Battle of Katzbach, where, according to the official rosters, he captured seven guns and 1,131 men. He then engaged the French at Levenberg on the 29th of August and had minor actions at Stolpen, Rotmeritz, Bischofswerda, Elster, Duben, Rodefeld, and Badefeld. For his service in these actions, he was awarded the Order of St. George (3rd Class). Emmanuel then took part at the Battle of Leipzig on 16-18 October and distinguished himself by capturing two generals, including Jacques Lauriston, 17 officers and 400 soldiers. However, Emmanuel was not awarded for this action because of disagreements on tactics with the famed Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher. He was soon transferred to Lieutenant General Guillaume Emmanuel Guignard, vicomte de Saint-Priest's 8th Corps and fought at the Battle of Reims, where he covered the retreat of the Russian troops. He took part in the Battle of Paris (1814) and was promoted to lieutenant general on 8 May 1814. He also received the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle (1st Class) and the Swedish Order of the Sword (2nd Class). In 1815, Emmanuel was given command of the 4th Dragoon Division and remained at this position for the next ten years. In July 1826, he was appointed to command the Russian forces in the Caucasus and succeeded in subjugating the local tribes. For his actions, he received the Imperial Order of Alexander Nevsky. During the Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829), he defeated and annexed several major regions in the North Caucasus, including Karachaevo (Karachay-Cherkessia), and suppressed a pro- Turkish uprising in the Kuban Valley. For his actions, he was promoted to general of cavalry in June 1828 and two years later was awarded a lifetime pension and estate. Emmanuel retired in 1831 and lived at Elizavetgrad (now Kirovohrad) for the next six year. He died there on 26 January 1837.

Formerly known as the Dighton Unitarian Church. The congregation, formally and legally known as the Pedo-Baptist Congregational Society due to the practice of infant baptism, was founded in 1769 and incorporated in 1798. The building was begun around 1769 and \\"completed enough for use\\" in Spring 1770. The building was finished in 1798. A tower was added in 1827 to house a Revere Bell. History Church interior In 1767, the first meeting house in Dighton Village burned to the ground. A new meeting house was built in an area called Buck Plain, but residents were unhappy with the location. In 1769, a group of well-off traders and businessmen formed the Pedo Baptist Congregational Society. (The name \\"Pedo\\" referred to the practice of infant baptism). This group selected a new building site in the village at Lower Four Corners, at the eastern edge of a cornfield used by the Pokanoket tribe. A tree in this field was used by Native Americans as a meeting place; King Philip (Metacomet) was said to have visited the tree many times. Construction on the church building was \\"completed sufficiently for use\\" by Spring 1770; however, the church was yet unfinished, with no tower or steeple. During the Revolutionary War, the unfinished church was used as a barracks for colonial soldiers, and sometimes to hold sheep. Construction was finally finished on the main building in 1798. At this time the building still lacked a bell tower. Ezra Stiles Ezra Stiles arrived in Dighton from Newport with a congregation which included William Ellery. They lived together in the Whitmarsh house on Elm Street, just north of the church. Ellery represented Rhode Island as a member of the Continental Congress, and he traveled by horse from Dighton to Philadelphia for meetings. After the Declaration of Independence was approved on July 4, 1776, a copy was brought to Dighton. On July 13, 1776, a copy of the Declaration was read in the church, most likely read by Ezra Stiles. Stiles became the first minister of the church in 1777. The Pedo Baptist (Child Baptizing) Congregational Society of Dighton was incorporated June 25, 1798. In 1870 the church received an English Georgian era organ which had been used in the Harvard College Chapel. In 1949 a new organ was installed inside the case of the old organ. The name changed to Community Church in 1971. =Revere Bell= The bell tower features a Revere Bell. It was cast at the Revere Foundry and purchased by Joseph Revere in 1821. The bell bears the inscription \\"Revere Boston 1821\\", and is listed in the Revere Stockbook as \\"Bell Number 254.\\" The bell was hauled from Canton to Dighton by two oxen in 1821, and hung in a small shed in the church yard. A tower was built for the bell, where it was installed in 1827 and rung frequently. The bell's yoke and wheel were restored in 2012-2013. =Renovations= The church was renovated in 1830, when the pew layout was changed and the Elm Street door removed. The church was modernized in 1861 and had a complete renovation in 1930. Various repairs and restorations were conducted in the 1980s, including repainting and a new roof. In 2002 the steeple was removed and transported to Vermont, where it was completely rebuilt, and re-installed in September of that year. Traditions * The church has been known locally for its annual Day Lily Show, held every summer since 1960. The Day Lily show was not held in 2016. * Every year since the town's 300th anniversary in 2012 (or possibly since 2011), the Declaration of Independence has been read aloud as part of the town's July 4 commemorations. Cemetery The cemetery. On the West side of the cemetery, on the site of the old Indian cornfield, is a cemetery. The Massachusetts Historical Commission refers to this cemetery in MACRIS as DIG805. The earliest burial in the cemetery dates to about 1750. Many members of the locally prominent Baylies family are buried here. Medal of Honor recipient Frederick C.

At the beginning of the 21st century considerable redevelopment of the estate took place, with a large community centre established, and demolition or modification of older substandard houses. The Eastern Cemetery established 1931 at the east of the estate is contemporary with the original build. The estate contains few structures of note, excluding the large Archbishop Sentamu Academy. Geography Eastern end of Preston Road (2005) The Preston Road Estate is the south-eastern part of Hull, east of the river, between the main Holderness Road (A165) and Hedon Road (A1033). It is located along, and to the north and south of the east‚Äìwest running dual carriageway Preston Road, which crosses the north‚Äìsouth running Holderness Drain in approximately the middle of the estate. The modern Archbishop Sentamu Academy and community centre, the \\"Freedom Centre\\" are located close to this crossing.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 2006; OS OpenData 2016; The area is almost exclusively used for housing, excluding playing fields and allotments. The surface is flat, and consistently under above sea level. To the west is Southcoates; north-west Summergangs and the Holderness Road; to the north-east is the Bilton Grange Estate; and to the east is the Greatfield Estate ‚Äì all predominately housing areas. To the south the landscape becomes industrial ‚Äì an ancillary area to the Alexandra Dock and King George Docks that also contains Hull Prison and the former village of Marfleet ‚Äì the southern boundary is formed by a cycle path, the former route of the Hull and Holderness Railway, as well as by part of the Hull Docks Branch railway line. Urban decay on Preston Road As of 2011 47% of the housing stock was semi-detached, and 40% terraced. In 2011 the area had high levels of unemployment, with 61% of the housing in the area rented social housing, and 30% owner occupied. History =Background and construction ( ‚Äì1945)= In 1850 the area of the future estate was completely rural, consisting of enclosed drained fields. To the north-west Southcoates was a small hamlet, as was Marfleet to the south. The Hull and Holderness Railway (built ) ran east‚Äìwest to the south; the Holderness Drain (built 1760s onwards) was the major feature in the landscape.Ordnance Survey Sheets 226, 227 1:10560 1852‚Äì3 By 1910 there had been some north-eastward expansion of Hull from Drypool along either side of the Holderness Road, reaching the edge of the grounds of the future estate.Ordnance Survey Sheets 226SE, 227SW 1:10560 1908‚Äì9 Development of the Preston Road Estate began in the 1920s. By the mid 1920s Preston Road had been laid out, connecting at the end of Southcoates Lane in the west to Marfleet Lane in the east.Ordnance Survey Sheets 226SE, 227SW 1:10560 1925‚Äì6 The initial development of the estate was west of the Holderness Drain, around Pembroke and St John's groves. Flinton Grove school was established in 1928 in temporary accommodation, with permanent buildings opened in 1931. The temporary building were destroyed during the Second World War. After several reorganisations and splits. the school amalgamated with Southcoates Junior High school in 1980, and was renamed Foredyke Junior High School. Entrance to the Eastern Cemetery, with chapel beyond. Built 1931 (2008) The Eastern Cemetery was established 1931, on the eastern edge of the estate. The cemetery's chapel, in a striped polychrome brick and limestone Neo-Romanesque style also dates to 1931 and was listed in 2006. A branch library was opened in 1935, and a Methodist church in 1937, both on Preston Road. An Anglican church, St George, was established on Marfleet Lane in 1938 as a subsidiary of the parish of Marfleet. A tower and sanctuary was added . The church closed 2009, and was demolished . By the late 1930s the estate was extensive (or under construction) along both sides of the Holderness Drain, and on both sides of Preston Road, and an extension north-east of Marfleet Lane and Preston Road to a similar plan centred on Wingfield and Swanfield Roads was also being built.Ordnance Survey Sheets 226SE, 227SW 1:10560 1938 By the mid 1940s the entire development area was full of housing, excluding some ground used for allotments or playing fields. The extents were defined by the Marfleet Old Drain and Poorhouse Lane to the east, by Hopewell Road and Portobello Street to the north, and by the Holderness railway line to the south. The northeasternmost extent of the estate included a new school;Ordnance Survey Sheets 226SE, 227SW 1:10560 1946‚Äì8 the school Estcourt High had been relocated from Southcoates after the original had been destroyed by bombing during the Hull Blitz. =1945 ‚Äì 2000= In the post-Second World War period Hull Corporation created several new housing estates in east Hull ‚Äì these were Bilton Grange, Longhill and Greatfield Estate ‚Äì constructed to the east and north-east of the Preston Road Estate, with the Bilton and Greatfield estates being adjacent. Building developments in the estate remained mostly unchanged through the remainder of the 20th century.Ordnance Survey 1:10560, 1:10000 1956‚Äì7, 1968‚Äì9, 1970‚Äì7, 1981‚Äì4, 1985‚Äì93 In 1963, a new secondary Roman Catholic school, St Richard's was established in the south-east of the estate, off Marfleet Lane, (as of 2016 a Voluntary Catholic Academy and primary school). In the early 20th century a farm, Willow Farm had been established in a place called Swan Field off Marfleet Lane. The farm was eventually surrounded by the estate, and was demolished by the 1970s. By the 1980s housing around Bessinby Grove had been built in the former field.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1910, 1927‚Äì8; 1:10560 1968‚Äì9; 1:10000 1970‚Äì7, 1981‚Äì4 Bessingby Grove now (2016) functions as a sheltered housing facility. Craven Park rugby ground was opened at the south-eastern edge of the estate in 1989. =2000 ‚Äì present= Freedom Centre, built 2005 (2008) In 2000 the estate received ¬£53 million (over 10 years) regeneration funding as part of the New Deal for Communities scheme. The funding was used to provide new social facilities including parks, play areas and a new 'village centre' with both civic and commercial facilities. The new community centre was given planning permission in 2002, to be built a site cleared of estate housing around Ryehill Grove adjacent to the Holderness Drain and Preston Road. The new centre, named \\"The Freedom Centre\\", opened in 2005. New school building took place in the area in the 2000s, funded by the Building Schools for the Future scheme: in 2008 plans were submitted for a new large academy school on the north side of Preston Road, directly east of the drain, requiring demolition of several streets of housing. Plans for the new school, to be called Archbishop Sentamu Academy, were finalised in 2009. The school opened in 2011. In 2011 a plan to demolish the existing school buildings on the Hopewell Road site (the then \\"Archbishop Sentamu Academy\\", since 1988 \\"Archbishop Thurstan school\\") and construct a new special educational school with onsite accommodation was submitted. This was to transfer facilities from the Oakfield school formerly on Inglemire Lane, Newland, Kingston upon Hull. The new school was completed in 2013 and was officially opened in 2014. Gateway/Chevin Housing Group houses, Exeter Grove (2012) Construction for Gateway(Hull)/Chevin Housing Group of 65 new houses in the Pembroke Grove/College Grove area of the estate was permitted in 2010, on land that had been cleared of housing . In 2011 Hull City Council published a finalised Holderness Road Corridor Area Action Plan, which included the Preston Road area in its remit. The report identified the 'Winget' housing type as problematic, and made it an objective to resolve the problems associated with that housing type, and/or provide new housing, as well as improving the general environment of the estate, additional changes included a new secondary school (Academy) on Preston Road. Keepmoat/Sanctuary/HCC houses, Wyton Grove (2015) In 2013 permission was given for the construction of 175 houses in the Ganstead Road area of the estate. The site had been cleared of Boot house type (Henry Boot Construction) houses in the late 1990s, due to carbonatation problems in their concrete structures. Construction work by Keepmoat for Sanctuary Group/Hull City Council began on the first 54 houses at the site in December 2013. In 2013 the City Council committed to a continuation of the housing stock renewal scheme, Preston Road Renewal Programme, starting in 2014. The scheme identified 540 for demolition, 300 for refurbishment, with 1,000 new houses built. Demolitions and refurbishments were to be mainly on concrete 'Winget' type housing. Refurbished properties were to have structural reinforcement and external wall insulation added. The area to be demolished for redevelopment was located between the Holderness Drain and Marfleet Lane, south of Preston Road. The properties listed for refurbishment were the houses on the inside of the area formed by Marfleet Lane, Mappleton Grove and Bilton Grove; and in the Downing Grove area. New build houses were to be built around Ganstead Grove to the north-west, and to the north on either side of the Holderness Drain near the Maybury Road bridge. Construction at the Ganstead Grove site began in July 2015.

The WRBU also performs arthropod collections management for the Department of Entomology, National Museum of Natural History mosquito collection and maintains a molecular entomology laboratory within the Smithsonian Institution Museum Support Center for joint use of WRBU and National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) personnel. History Army entomologists began formal collaborations with Smithsonian Institution entomologists as early as 1961. The WRBU's unit lineage begins with the stand up of the Army Mosquito Project (AMP) in 1964. In 1966, the AMP's mission was refocused on the vectorborne disease threat facing troops deployed to southeast Asia for the Vietnam War and the unit was reorganized as the Southeast Asia Mosquito Project (SEAMP).O.S.

She has written 16 books and is a doll judge of antique, collectible, modern and artist dolls and she has lectured internationally.  Early life  Marjory was born in Geelong, Victoria and began her schooling there. The family later moved to Wangaratta and her high school years were completed in Melbourne at Coburg High School. Marjory was unable to take up a scholarship to be a teacher when the family moved to Brisbane, Queensland so she undertook commercial studies and obtained office work but with the birth of her children she developed an interest in dolls and toys.  Personal life  In 1953, Marjory married Jim Fainges. They had met at a friends' sister's 21st Birthday Party in late 1949, were engaged in 1951 and married in the Lutwyche Methodist Church, Brisbane. The family which was to include 5 children Lyn, Sue, Ian, Neil and Keith moved to Everton Park, Brisbane where Marjory and Jim worked on many projects together. Jim had his own interests including model railways and designing scale model. From 1973 Jim worked at the Department of Main Roads as a professional Model Maker. He retired in 1989 and died 18 October 2015.  Career  In the 1970s Marjory interest in toys and dolls led to the making of glove, rod and marionette puppets by Jim which Marjory and the three boys used in shows under the name Panaroo Puppets. Marjory and Jim collected dolls and toys and operated the business Doll Restoration and Repairs for 25 years until 2002. In 1980 they opened Panaroos Playthings, Dolls & Toy Museum in Windsor, where Marjory was both the owner and curator. It housed the largest such collection in Australia and specialised in Australian produced toys before closing in 1989.  Publishing  In conversations with other doll enthusiasts the topic had arisen of the lack of relevant publications available. Marjory enjoyed research and in 1986 published her first book Australian Dollmakers History through Kangaroo Press. This was the beginning of a long association with this publisher who published the majority of the 16 books written by Marjory through to 2007. Kangaroo Press was run by David and Scilla Rosenberg and although taken over by Simon and Schuster in 1997 they continued to publish as Kangaroo Press. The photographs used in the books were taken by Marjory unless otherwise acknowledged. For knitting and crochet books the garments were often based on old patterns which sometimes contained errors. Marjory verified and adjusted the patterns to suit the particular doll she was working with. Dollhouses were constructed by Jim who also made the miniature furniture often used in the photographs and he also drafted the clothing patterns. Marjory published a range of books. There were illustrated knitting and crochet pattern books for dressing dolls, encyclopaedias of dolls from Australia and World Regions, particular types of dolls and toys. Her book Cyclops Toys through the Years encapsulates her work as a researcher and historian as the history of Cyclops Toys also reflects many changes in Australian society. Later she published on CD. In her knitting and crochet books Marjory gives details and history of the dolls she has used and dresses them in outfits from earlier eras but which are still suitable for modern dolls. Marjory was approached by Reverie Publishing Company to write a book specifically for the American market on 61/2-9 inch dolls as this size doll was not available in the Australian market. The book was published in 2007 under the title Knit and Crochet for Small Dolls and is still listed by that publisher.  Memberships  In 1976 Marjory together with others who shared the same enthusiasms formed the Brisbane Doll Society Inc. She has variously served as President, Secretary, Editor over the years and is now an Honorary member. Their Facebook pages include an article about Marjorie. The first United Federation of Doll Clubs Inc in Australia was formed by Marjory and she served several terms as President. Was elected a Region Director United Federation of Doll Clubs Inc (Region 16- which encompassed the world) in 1999 for a period of 3 years, the first person from outside of North America to do so. She was the Associate Editor, Australian Doll Digest 1988-2002. In 1989 joined Brisbane Miniature Enthusiasts' Association Inc which caters for those interested in scale doll house building, dolls and their settings. She has acted as President Secretary and Editor, and is now an Honorary Member. Marjory's husband Jim was a founder member in 1981.  Displays/museums  In the International Year of the Child 1979 Marjory organised a doll display at Newstead House which became the genesis of Panaroos Playthings, Dolls & Toy Museum. Approached by the Queensland Arts Council (later known as Artslink) to produce a display of dolls showing the fashions and occupations of Queenslanders from 1900 to 2000. Marjory designed and made clothing for 82 dolls that toured during 2001-2002. The Queensland Museum holds a collection of 1000 articles in the Fainges Toy Collection which cover the period 1930 to 1970. Marjorys collection includes teddy bears, dolls, cars and trucks, wooden toys, puzzles and board games including many rare examples. Marjory was a Consultant to the Queensland Museum on Dolls and Toys. The Logan City Historical Museum, in 2014 held an exhibition featuring 120 dolls produced by Marjory which depicted Heritage Through Costumes depicting periods and occupations from 1788 to 1988. The collection was donated to the Logan City Museum and is housed in the Kingston Butter Factory Community Arts Centre.

He was the chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce and also an unofficial member of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

Regeni was a PhD student at Girton College, Cambridge, researching Egypt's independent trade unions, as well as a former employee of the international consulting firm Oxford Analytica. He grew up in Fiumicello, a former comune (now Fiumicello Villa Vicentina) in the province of Udine in Northeastern Italy.  Discovery of the body  Regeni's mutilated and half-naked corpse was found in a ditch alongside the Cairo-Alexandria highway on the outskirts of Cairo on February 3, 2016. His recovered body showed signs of extreme torture: contusions and abrasions all over from a severe beating; extensive bruising from kicks, punches, and assault with a stick; more than two dozen bone fractures, among them seven broken ribs, all fingers and toes, as well as legs, arms, and shoulder blades; multiple stab wounds on the body including the soles of the feet, possibly from an ice pick or awl-like instrument; numerous cuts over the entire body made with a sharp instrument suspected to be a razor; extensive cigarette burns; a larger burn mark between the shoulder blades made with a hard and hot object; a brain hemorrhage; and a broken Cervical vertebrae, which ultimately caused death. Investigations Italian and Egyptian officials conducted separate autopsies on Regeni's corpse with an Egyptian forensic official reporting on March 1, 2016, that he was interrogated and tortured for up to seven days at intervals of 1014 hours before he was finally killed. The Egyptian autopsy findings have still not been made public. A 300-page report of the Italian autopsy findings has been handed over to the public prosecutor's office in Rome and denies earlier reports of signs of electric shocks administered to Regeni's genitals. On March 24, 2016, Egyptian police killed in a shoot out four men who were allegedly responsible for kidnapping Regeni. According to a Facebook post from the official page of the Ministry of the Interior, the gang specialized in kidnapping foreigners and stealing their money. In a raid on the flat of one of the gang members, the Egyptian police claim they found various items that belonged to Regeni including his passport and student photo IDs. However, witnesses told Declan Walsh and other journalists that the \\"gang\\" members had been executed, not shot while riding in the van: \\"One was shot as he ran, his corpse later positioned inside the van\\". Their link to Regeni was also suspect: \\"Italian investigators used phone records to show that the supposed gang leader, Tarek Abdel Fattah, was 60 miles north of Cairo the day he supposedly kidnapped Regeni\\", according to Declan Walsh. The New Cairo prosecutor's office later denied that the criminal gang was involved in his murder. Regeni's passport and the other documents were handed over to Italian prosecutors on November 1, same year, during a \\"positive\\" meeting in Cairo. On June 8, 2016, Italian news agency ANSA reported that Regeni's tutors at Cambridge University had declined to collaborate with the inquest into his murder, to the disappointment of investigators and Regeni's family. This had been anticipated by coverage in the Italian weekly L'Espresso on June 7, 2016, which reported that Regeni's tutor Maha Abdelrahman had followed advice from University lawyers not to collaborate with the inquest. The University of Cambridge strongly rejected the claims in a statement released to Varsity, the Cambridge student newspaper. Despite commitment on behalf of Cambridge University, as of early December 2017, British authorities had denied requests by the Italian prosecutors concerning the interrogation of specific individuals in Britain; on a similar note, Abdelrahman had refused to speak to the Italian prosecutor. Such British inaction in the aftermath of the incident would be later described by Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner as \\"lack of tenacity\\". Following the controversy that played out in the media, Abdelrahman eventually accepted to be questioned by Italian authorities and received praises from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs for having chosen to cooperate. Accusations against the Egyptian government Due to Regeni's research activities and left-wing political leanings, the Egyptian police is strongly suspected of involvement in his murder in Egypt, although Egypt's media and government deny this, alleging secret undercover agents belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt carried out the crime in order to embarrass the Egyptian government and destabilize relations between Italy and Egypt. On April 21, 2016, Reuters reported three Egyptian intelligence officials and three police sources independently claiming Regeni was in police custody at some time before his death. According to these sources he was picked up by plainclothes police officers near Gamal Abdel Nasser metro station together with another Egyptian man on the evening of January 25. Both men were then taken in a white minibus with police license plates to Izbakiya police station in downtown Cairo. Shadowing foreigners were later dismissed by a Homeland Security official and the Interior Ministry as day-to-day work bearing no implications, and Egyptian general prosecutor Nabeel Sadek confirmed that Cairo police had received a report on Giulio Regeni on January 7, 2016, and that the Egyptian National Security Agency had been monitoring Regeni. On December 7, 2016, a joint statement of Egyptian and Italian prosecutors, released following a two-day summit in Rome, stated that Egyptian prosecutors had questioned the policemen who investigated Regeni's death in January, as well as those who killed the four gang members in March. On August 15, 2017, journalist Declan Walsh collected in a New York Times article the statement of an anonymous Obama administration official who revealed that, in the weeks after Regeni's death, the United States acquired \\"explosive proof that Egyptian security officials had abducted, tortured and killed Regeni\\" and that \\"Egypt's leadership was fully aware of the [death] circumstances\\". Walsh writes that Italian investigators working in Egypt \\"were hindered at every turn. Witnesses appeared to have been coached. Surveillance footage from the subway station near Regeni‚Äôs apartment had been deleted; requests for metadata from millions of phone calls were refused on the grounds that it would compromise the constitutional rights of Egyptian citizens.\\" After the article, the Italian government denied that the Americans provided any actionable proof; AISE told the hint from the USA was of little benefit, since it came when the autopsy and investigation had already persuaded Italian investigators of Egypt's involvement, and Americans refused to reveal anything more specific, like names of involved people or institutions. On December 21, 2017, the Italian investigators led by Giuseppe Pignatone flew to Cairo to meet the Egyptian prosecutor Nabel Sadek and his team. The Egyptian team submitted new reports, including the progress on the recovery of surveillance cameras footage. The Italians had carefully examined and cross linked all the evidence available to them until then, and provided a detailed explanation for the facts. For kidnapping, they reiterated and pinpointed the allegations against major Magdi Ibraim Abdel al-Sharif, captain Osan Helmy, and three other people of Egyptian National Security Agency. For red herring, which included the killings on March 24, 2016, they blamed captain Mahmud Hendy and other people of the local police. A witness spoke in May 2019 and said that he was in a cafe in the capital of Kenya, Nairobi in August 2017, where he heard Egyptian officials discussing the \\"Italian guy\\" case. After spying on an exchange of business cards, he heard that the officer who claimed to have been personally involved in the kidnapping and death of Giulio Regeni was, in fact, Major Majdi Ibrahim Abdel-Al Sharif, 35 years old. According to the eyewitness account, they believed Regeni was a British spy and that the officer said he had to hit and slap Regeni after loading him into the police van. The Italian investigators listened to the witness and credited his reconstruction of the events with some reliability. In fact, the Major was already among the suspects.https://shahadanews.com/?p=5863https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2019/05/04/news/caso_regeni_nuovo_super_testimone-225486829/https://www.raialyoum.com/index.php/ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßŸäŸÖÿ≤- ÿ±Ÿäÿ¨ŸäŸÜŸä-ÿ™ÿπÿ±ÿ∂-ŸÑŸÑÿÆŸäÿßŸÜÿ©-ŸÖŸÜ-ÿ£ÿµÿØŸÇÿßÿ¶/ Reactions of the international community Banner \\"Truth for Giulio Regeni\\" (Verit√† per Giulio Regeni) on the city hall in Turin, Italy The gruesome torture and murder of Giulio Regeni sparked global outrage, with more than 4,600 academics signing a petition calling for an investigation into his death and into the many disappearances that take place in Egypt each month, while on February 24, 2016, Amnesty International Italy launched a campaign \\"Verit√† per Giulio Regeni\\" (Truth about Giulio Regeni). UK Parliament petition No. 120832 was created by Hannah Waddilove, a former Giulio Regeni's colleague at Oxford Analytica, in February 2016.See the U.K. Parliamentary petitions website UK involvement was solicited on the rationale that freedom of thought, expression, and press are not meaningful if they cannot be backed by freedom of research. Hence active steps were expected from the U.K. in order to protect operations carried out by personnel belonging to its universities. The petition reached 10,000 signatures next April, the Parliament renewed their offer of assistance. An online petition was also started on Change.org that received more than 100,000 signatures. On April 14, 2016 the New York Times, with an editorial, attacked France harshly, calling it \\"shameful\\" the silence in the face of Italy's requests to put pressure on Egypt Upping the Pressure on Egypt On March 10, 2016, the European Parliament in Strasbourg passed a motion for a resolution condemning the torture and killing of Giulio Regeni and the ongoing human rights abuses of the al-Sisi government in Egypt. The resolution was passed with an overwhelming majority. In April 2016, Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt due to a lack of co-operation, during the investigation, from the Egyptian authorities. In May 2016, Italian weekly magazine L'Espresso set up a secure platform based on GlobaLeaks technology to collect testimonials about torture and human rights abuse from Egyptian whistleblowers ‚Äì and to seek justice for Giulio Regeni and for every Regeni in Egypt. On January 25, 2017, first anniversary of his disappearance, thousands of people gathered to remember Giulio Regeni in Rome, Milan, Fiumicello, and other Italian towns. On 1 May 2017, Pope Francis confirmed that the Vatican is taking steps to investigate the situation: \\"The Holy See has taken some steps. I will not say how or where, but we have taken some steps\\".Holy See Press Office, Press Conference with Pope Francis during the return flight from his trip to Egypt, 01.05.2017, accessed 27 May 2017 Since in 2016 al-Sisi had promised Giulio's parents his personal involvement to establish the truth on the murder of their son, three years after, Paola and Claudio Regeni published a hard reply. \\"We cannot be satisfied by your condolences anymore, nor by your failed promises\\", they said.

Examples Most genes considered master regulators code for transcription factor proteins, which in turn alter the expression of downstream genes in the pathway. Canonical examples of master regulators include Oct-4 (also called POU5F1), SOX2, and NANOG, all transcription factors involved in maintaining pluripotency in stem cells. Master regulators involved in development and morphogenesis can also appear as oncogenes relevant to tumorigenesis and metastasis, as with the Twist transcription factor. Other genes reported as master regulators code for SR proteins, which function as splicing factors, and some noncoding RNAs.

The town was soon eclipsed by St. Marks, and Steele decided to move south to Fort Brooke in Tampa. = Tampa = Steele came to Tampa in 1830 and planned the city. Tampa at the time of Steele's arrival was only a small village. Steele suggested that there be a county there and said it should have Tampa as its county seat. Steele persuaded friends that he knew in the State Capitol, Tallahassee, and made the county 8,580 sq miles of land for Hillsborough County. During the Seminole War, Steele was given the position of postmaster at Fort Brooke. He was asked to give the news of the Dade Massacre from Fort Brooke to the governor.

After this, Steele bought land at a Navy land auction at Atsena Otie Key and with it built a resort there. Steele wanted Atsena Otie to be a port and planned on using its deep water facilities for shipping out cotton, lumber, sugar, and tobacco from plantations inland. Steele bought all the buildings on the island for $270 (worth $6,900 in 2015) in 1843. Steele later on became Cedar Key's postmaster, Tampa & Cedar Key's port inspector, and an Internal Revenue Service collector. = Politics = Augustus ran for the Florida State Legislature in 1850 and 1852.

Brynsalov announced his candidacy with a speech on February 20. In his speech he declared that money was \\"man's greatest invention\\". As a candidate, Brytsalov boasted about his wealth and personality, saying, Brytsalov promoted himself with the superlative claim of being \\"the richest man in Russia\\". As a candidate, Brytsalov flaunted his wealth by dressing in a flashy wardrobe and wearing a $80,000 Rolex. During his campaign he was often was accompanied by his wife, who was noticeably twenty years his minor. In addition to flamboyantly flaunting his wealth, Bryntsalov sought to present himself as a rags to riches success story. Brytsalov claimed that his leadership would eliminate the country's poverty, promising that, if he were elected, there would be, \\"no poor pensioners, no poor workers, no poor entrepreneurs, no poor farmers.\\" His plan, which he dubbed \\"Russian socialism\\", was for large companies to begin paying wages comparable to companies in other industrialized nations. The plan anticipated that the employees of the companies would consequentially pay larger income taxes, spend more on consumer goods, and increase their productivity at their jobs. The feasibility of this plan was criticized, as Russian companies were considered to be unable to pay such wages. Despite being a (recently elected) deputy of the State Duma, Brytsalov did not have a voting-record.

Controversially, the Supreme Court found in favor of Bryntsalov and ruled that 170,000 of the contested signatures were indeed valid. These were enough signatures to place Bryntsalov above the required one-million signatures, thus permitting him to be a candidate in the election. Relatively unknown to the Russian populace, Brytsalov was generally seen as a marginal candidate and was viewed as unlikely to win the election. =Presidential campaign, 2004= Bryntsalov again ran for president in 2004.–í–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏–ë—Ä—ã–Ω—Ü–∞–ª–æ–≤ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∏—á However, he withdrew from the race in January without having submitted any signatures to register as a candidate.

Further work was done until March 2015 in Bavaria, Berlin and Brandenburg. Some scenes were shot on original locations in Amsterdam, for example the Merwedeplein, where the Frank family lived before they went into hiding. The exterior shots of the Prinsengracht 263 were produced in the nearby Leidsegracht. The original Anne Frank House could not be used for this purpose because its look has changed since the 1940s. The producers Michael Souvignier and Walid Nakschbandi acquired the worldwide and exclusive rights for films about Anne Frank's diary. They produced the film in cooperation with Universal Pictures. The work was supported by the Anne Frank Foundation, so the producers could use the whole archive. The director Hans Steinbichler regards this film as a production for the younger generation. He said he wanted to make the story completely subjective and to transform the written texts of the diary into speech.

Based on the myth of the cave of the sun goddess from the Kojiki, the painting resides at the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris, where it is known as Le coq blanc or The white cockerel. Subject Edo- period woodblock print); Uzume's dance is linked with the origins of kagura; here she wields kagura suzu According to the Mus√©e d'Orsay catalogue, the painting's principal subject is repr√©sentation animali√®re or the depiction of animals. As suggested by the painting's Japanese name and observed in the contemporary Japanese press, the work draws heavily on Japanese mythology, in particular the episode of the sun goddess Amaterasu's withdrawal into a cave due to her brother Susanoo's improprieties, depriving the land of light. In the Kojiki version, after the assembled kami took counsel, \\"the long-singing birds of eternal night\\" (generally understood as a periphrasis for \\"the barndoor fowl\\") were enticed to crow, the mirror Yata no Kagami and string of curved jewels Yasakani no Magatama were commissioned, divination was performed using the shoulder blade of a stag and the bough of a cherry tree from Mount Kagu, and the mirror, string of jewels, and blue and white cloth offerings were hung from an uprooted sakaki tree. Uzume then decked herself out before performing a lewd dance upon a sounding-board; the ensuing hilarity finally succeeded in provoking Amaterasu's curiosity. Opening the door to her cave, she was presented with a mirror; opening it further, she was drawn from it by her hand as well as by rope. Later a penitent Susanoo presented to her the third of the Three Sacred Treasures, the sword Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi. Replete with allusions to this story, Kawamura Kiyoo's painting features a mirror, magatama, sword, suzu, sakaki with blue, white, and red cloth cords, cherry blossoms, a blue-grey Sue ware footed ritual vessel adorned with a deer, and an enza or circular woven straw mat. At its centre is a white cockerel with a brilliant scarlet crest.

It is an erect, spreading shrub with densely hairy, greyish leaves but its most distinctive feature is its densely woolly sepals. Description Eremophila lachnocalyx is an erect shrub with many tangled branches growing to a height of . Its branches and leaves are densely covered with mostly branched, woolly hairs giving them a greyish appearance. The leaves are clustered, often in dense spirals around the branches and are elliptic to egg-shaped, long, wide, and sometimes covered in resin so that they appear to be glabrous. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a straight, hairy stalk, long. There are 5 linear to tapering triangular sepals which are mostly long with their outer surface densely covered with a thick layer of woolly hairs. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is lilac-coloured to deep violet on the outside and white inside. The outside of the petal tube is mostly covered with hairs but the inside surface of the lobes is glabrous while the inside of the tube is woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to September and is followed by oval-shaped fruits which have a crusty, woolly covering and are long.Nannine townsite Taxonomy and naming Eremophila lachnocalyx was first formally described in 1942 by Charles Gardner and the description was published in Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (lachnocalyx) is derived from Ancient Greek words meaning \\"woolly sepals\\". Distribution and habitat This eremophila grows on red-brown clay on flats or along drainage lines. It occurs in scattered populations between Sandstone, the Barlee Range and Karijini National Park in the Gascoyne, Murchison and Pilbara biogeographic regions. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Its silvery-grey foliage and masses of cottony buds followed by pale lilac-coloured to purple flowers make this one of the most attractive eremophilas. It can be propagated with difficulty from cuttings but most plants in cultivation have been grafted onto Myoporum rootstock. It grows best in well-drained soil and full sun and is tolerant of drought. It will survive lights frosts but in cold, damp climates is prone to fungal diseases.

Education Edythe Mae Chapman was born in Washington, D.C., probably on June 4 and sometime in the period 1895‚Äì1900; the date is uncertain because the existing documents differ on her birth year. She was apparently raised by members of her mother's family, surnamed Bicks; nothing is known of her father. She was educated at M Street School, a public school, and graduated in 1916. In her last year at the school, she married Eugene Gordon, then a student at Howard University and later a writer for the Boston Post. By 1919 they had moved to Boston; they separated in 1932 and divorced in 1942. In 1926, Gordon enrolled as an undergraduate at Boston University. She graduated in 1934 with a B.S. degree in religious education and social services; a year later she earned her master's degree from the university's School of Social Services, a then-rare accomplishment for an African-American woman. Writing In 1925, Gordon's husband Eugene organized an African-American literary group, the Saturday Evening Quill Club, out of which grew a literary magazine, Saturday Evening Quill, of which he became the editor. Published three times a year, Quill contains most of the surviving specimens of Gordon's writing. Her first piece for Quill was a 1928 short story, \\"Subversion.\\" It was listed among the year's distinguished stories by the O. Henry Award prize committee, which at the time rarely noticed works by non-white authors. Gordon would go on to publish two more short stories and a dozen poems in Quill. She also published two poems in the 1938 anthology Negro Voices, edited by Beatrice Murphy. Gordon's fiction focuses on the unhappy lives of urban African-American couples, challenging some of the era's social norms. Her poems are lyrical odes to love that take their metaphors from nature. There is little information about Gordon after her 1942 divorce. She died in 1980. A compilation of Gordon's work, Selected Works of Edythe Mae Gordon, was published in 1996. That same year, \\"Subversion\\" and another story, \\"If Wishes Were Horses\\", were republished in the anthology Harlem's Glory: Black Women Writing, 1900-1950.

Life and career Jean-Baptiste C√¥t√© was born to Jean- Baptiste C√¥t√© and H√©l√®ne Grenier in the Saint-Roch parish in the Lower Town of Quebec City. The elder C√¥t√© worked as a carpenter in the sipbuilding yards near the Rivi√®re Saint-Charles. C√¥t√© became apprenticed as an architect to Fran√ßois-Xavier Berlinguet around 1850.

C√¥t√© and Adolphe Gu√©rard left La Scie in 1865 to found the printing company A. Gu√©rard et Compagnie and published La Scie illustr√©e with the intention of bringing a halt to Confederation. C√¥t√© contributed hundreds of woodcuts: mainly caricatures, as well as some portraits and rebuses. In May 1866 La Scie illustr√©e was replaced by the more serious weekly L‚Äô√âlecteur, then the unillustrated L'√âcho du peuple (June 1867 ‚Äì April 1868), and then the humorous Le Charivari canadien (June‚ÄìNovember 1868). Several cartoons in Le Charivari canadien were signed \\"Nemo\\", which may have been a pseudonym of C√¥t√©'s; if they were, they likely would have been his last published caricatures. Steel-hulled ship construction came to take over from those of wood in the 1870s, and C√¥t√© turned his skills elsewhere: furniture, signs, cigar store Indians, religious carvings, hearses, tombstones, and others. He began attracting attention for his statuary, and in 1877 won a special prize at the provincial exhibition for his wooden statues. He won a commission to carve two floats for the procession on 24 June at the French Canadian national convention of 1880. The secretary general Honor√©- Julien-Jean-Baptiste Chouinard remarked called C√¥t√©'s floats \\"by common consent, the most imposing and the most outstanding, in the size of its figures and the elegance of its every detail\\". The floats established his reputation, and C√¥t√© when on to fulfill a number of such commissions, particularly of religious carvings. C√¥t√© contracted a spinal condition in 1903 and had to give up his work. He died in poverty at his home on 9 April 1907 in Quebec City and left everything he owned to his three daughters who lived with him. He was buried at the Saint-Charles cemetery on 11 April and had a large funeral. Works C√¥t√© worked in a variety of media, including architecture, wood engraving, caricature, publishing, and printing. He is best remembered for his hand-painted wood sculptures, especially ones of animals. C√¥t√© received formal training, in contrast to many of his contemporary folk artists in Quebec. Much of his work is unsigned. Personal life C√¥t√©'s first marriage was on 8 September 1856 to Marie Auger, daughter of Marie Roussin and Jacques Auger, a ship's carpenter and foreman. The couple had ten children. On 21 January 1884 C√¥t√© remarried to Ad√©la√Øde B√©dard, with whom he had no children.

He is known for his seamless merging of genres in his stories, resulting in a visionary, original and difficult-to-define style. All of his fiction has literary underpinnings, though his work is infused with genre elements running the gamut from magical realism, horror, science fiction, noir, historical, western, Bizarro, to surrealism. For this reason the term \\"slipstream\\" has often been used to describe his work, though some reviewers consider the term inadequate to define Zelenyj's unclassifiable style. Style Thematically, Zelenyj's fiction often explores the darker side of the human condition. His stories are known for being emotionally harrowing, with elements of the surreal and bizarre interwoven among their plots. This emotional impact often has a distinctly melancholy character, with violence, depression, and suicide being recurring themes. The Canadian landscape figures prominently in much of Zelenyj's work, specifically his home city of Windsor, Ontario and its surrounding environs. More generally, the city is often portrayed as a sinister and immoral place, and is frequently juxtaposed against the natural peace and beauty of rustic settings. A historical element recurs throughout his fiction, with a focus on war and its effects on both those serving in the military as well as the family members of soldiers. Zelenyj's stories have examined both World Wars, the Vietnam War, colonial struggles in the American West, and Medieval-period conflict, among others. Religious themes resonate through his fiction, particularly in the stories of Songs For The Lost, which depicts fringe spirituality in the form of organized suicide cults and individuals seeking spiritual escape from the trauma of their lives. Themes of apocalypse and post-apocalypse recur in his fiction. The dark quality inherent in much of Zelenyj's work gives it an apocalyptic tone even in those stories not dealing explicitly with end of the world scenarios. Zelenyj's prose style has been described as burnished and literary, drawing comparisons to the work of authors such as Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, as well as more contemporary slipstream authors such as Michael Cisco and D.P. Watt. Some of his recent work is more streamlined in nature. Zelenyj's short story collections are known for their massive length, the eclectic variety of literary genres and styles represented, their often dark and melancholy subject matter, and for their thematic cohesion and inter-story links. Biography Zelenyj lives in Windsor, Ontario with his wife Elizabeth.

There are more than 700 species of mammals in Brazil, and according to Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and Ministry of the Environment, about 110 species and subspecies are threatened and one is extinct.PORTARIA No - 444, DE 17 DE DEZEMBRO DE 2014 Brazilian definition of \\"threatened species\\" uses the same criteria and categories established by IUCN. Among the 12 mammal orders which occur in Brazil, eleven have threatened species, except Lagomorpha (which has only one species in Brazil, the Brazilian cottontail). Although the rodents have been the most diverse order of mammals, the order with most species on list is Primates (34 species). The actual list of threatened species was published in Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o, on December 17, 2014. Even though some species have been removed from the list, (for instance, the Humpback whale), the number of threatened species has increased in comparison with the former list (which had had 69 species). The Brazilian tapir, the White-lipped peccary, the Short-eared dog and many rodents have been included in the list. Many of them are just regionally threatened. In spite of using the same criteria, ICMBio list often shows a different conservation status than IUCN. That's because both assessments have been done in different moments and by different researchers. Most of Brazilian mammals are vulnerable species.

The character was introduced as a disruptive student to Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) before meeting the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) and joining him for an adventure. She was portrayed by Ellis George. Background According to Courtney‚Äôs character profile, she is billed as \\"She‚Äôs cheeky, opinionated and a disruptive influence‚Ä¶\\" and it was also said \\"She can be a nightmare and when Clara first joined the school‚Äôs teaching staff, Courtney delighted in giving her a hard time. She also picked up on the romance between ‚ÄòMiss Oswald‚Äô and Danny Pink, never missing an opportunity to poke fun at Clara about it.\\" Storylines On Clara's first day as a teacher, she threatened to kick all of the students out of school. Courtney challenged her threat, replying with, \\"Go on, do it.\\" Clara was inspired to use the same tactic against the Half-Face Man when he threatened to kill her. Courtney teased the secretary in the school about her flirtations with Danny. She once told Clara she couldn't focus on her work because Clara's face was \\"too wide\\". Clara related this story to Danny on their first date. Courtney went to fetch some paper towels from the new caretaker, who was the Doctor being undercover and saw a light coming out of the TARDIS. He initially denied her knowledge, but then showed her the capabilities of his ship. He took her into space. However, the experience was too much for Courtney, who was made sick by it. According to Clara, at some point the Doctor had told Courtney that the child \\"wasn't special\\". This apparently prompted Courtney to increase her disruptive behavior, including stealing the Doctor's psychic paper and using it as a fake ID. Clara implored the Doctor to tell Courtney that she was indeed special. His interpretation of this was to take Courtney and Clara for an adventure on the Moon in 2049, where Courtney would end up being the first woman on it, As it became clear that the Moon was really an egg about to hatch, Courtney strongly advocated for not killing the emerging creature. This led to her and Clara saving Earth from the results of making the wrong choice. The Doctor claimed to Clara that Courtney would eventually \\"bizarrely\\" become President of the United States, meeting a man named Blinovitch. This was suggested again in a post-it on Clara's apartment in Dark Water. Reception In a review for \\"Kill The Moon\\", the reviewer described Courtney as \\"a giant pain in the behind.\\" A reviewer in the Guardian called Ellis George one to watch for her role as Courtney in \\"The Caretaker\\". While giving the episode \\"The Caretaker\\" a bad review, the reviewer gave praise Ellis George, calling her \\"a star in the making,\\" and her inclusion in the episode as \\"great.\\" References External links Category:Recurring characters in Doctor Who Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional Black British people Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Teenage characters in television ","title":"Courtney Woods"},{"id":"49357876","text":"San Francesco is a Romanesque-Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church located in Tolentino, province of Macerata, region of the Marche.

The species was originally described in 2000 after being isolated from hot springs in Kamchatka. It is the type species of the genus Acidilobus. Description A. aceticus has a coccoid morphology of 1-2 Œºm diameter with a relatively thick S-layer. A. aceticus has an optimal growth temperature of 85¬∞C (qualifying it as a hyperthermophile) and an optimal pH of 3.8. It is a non-motile obligate anaerobe with fermentative metabolism characterized by production of acetate under cell culture conditions tested; its name recognizes this property. Although its growth is accelerated by the presence of elemental sulfur, which is reduced to hydrogen sulfide, sulfur is not essential for growth. It is resistant to the antibiotics chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. A. aceticus differs from A. saccharovorans, the only other recognized species in the genus, in two major respects: it is non-motile whereas A. saccharovorans is flagellated; and it is capable of growth on a much narrower range of substrates.

Lettinga. https://www.amnesty.nl/urbanworld The Human Rights City initiative emerged from the global human rights movement, and it reflects efforts of activist groups to improve respect for human rights principles by governments and other powerful actors who operate at the local or community level. Because of their focus on local contexts, Human Rights Cities tend to emphasize economic, social, and cultural rights as they affect the lives of residents of cities and other communities and their ability to enjoy civil and political human rights. Human rights advocates describe a Human Rights City as ‚ÄúOne whose residents and local authorities, through learning about the relevance of human rights to their daily lives (guided by a steering committee), join in ongoing learning, discussions, systematic analysis and critical thinking at the community level, to pursue a creative exchange of ideas and the joint planning of actions to realize their economic, social, political, civil and cultural human rights.‚ÄùHuman Rights Learning and Human Rights Cities: Achievements Report.

History of the Human Rights Cities movement  The Human Rights City initiative is the result of long-standing efforts of popular groups to defend and promote human rights, and thus represents an aspect of global human rights struggles. =Origins: From the Right to the City to the People‚Äôs Movement for Human Rights Learning= Contemporary human rights city initiatives grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of urban problems affecting people's everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in places around the world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the ‚Äúright to the city.\\" According to David Harvey, ‚Äúto invoke rights to the city means ‚Äòto claim some kind of shaping power over the processes of urbanization, over the ways in which our cities are made and remade and to do so in a fundamental and radical way‚Äô.\\" Ideas inspiring this movement first emerged in the 1970s, with many influenced by Henri Lefebvre‚Äôs 1968 book, Le Droit √† la ville. The movement has expanded and gained momentum around the world since the mid-1990s. The proliferation of global financial crises, urban austerity, and environmental damage has contributed to the rise of a growing number of cities around the world that are referring more explicitly to international human rights in their policies, statements, and programs. The formally named ‚ÄúHuman Rights Cities‚Äù initiative was launched by the People's Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), which was formerly known as People's Decade for Human Rights Education, in the wake of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Austria. The initiative aims to mobilize people in communities to ‚Äúpursue a community-wide dialogue and to launch actions to improve the life and security of women, men and children based on human rights norms and standards.‚Äù This approach is different from the traditional way that human rights are enforced and applied because of its emphasis on popular education, engagement, and culture as a necessary complement to government enforcement. Human Rights Cities have grown in part because of the enhanced efforts by international agencies like UN Habitat to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world are facing a similar host of urban problems, including a lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion and insufficient public services. Cities have looked to international forums like the UN Conferences on Human Settlements and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities to help address these problems. Shulamith Koenig, founder of the People's Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), worked closely with human rights organizers in some of the first formally designated human rights cities, including Rosario Argentina, which became the first Human Rights City in the world in 1997 and the first U.S.-based Human Rights City of Washington, D.C. =Human Rights Cities International Consolidation (1998 - today)= The city of Gwangju has been a pioneer in the implementation of the human rights cities framework in South Korean and Asia, and has coorganized since 2011 the World Human Rights Cities Forum. 1998 would suppose a breakthrough for the human rights movement both in terms of institutional consolidation as well as global outreach. At the European level, the Barcelona Conference Cities for Human Rights gathered more than 400 local authorities uniting their voices and calling for stronger political acknowledgment as key actors in safeguarding human rights. The Conference process would culminate 2 years later in the French city of Saint Denis by the adoption of the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City (2000). By the same time, the movement of human rights cities was also taking ground in Asia, as regional civil society organizations were about to launch the Asia Human Rights Charter (Gwangju, 1998). Both charters would highlight the increasing role of local actors in promoting human rights as a way to reinforce local democracy and the place of human rights in the city in an increasingly urbanized world. After the establishment of Rosario as the first Human Rights City back in 1997, other local authorities in South America effectively embraced the human rights-based approach by placing a special emphasis on its link with the notion of right to the city. In 2001, the City Statue of Brazil offered a renewed framework for promoting human rights and the social function of the city at a national scale. Mexico City is also among the pioneers in the development of the human rights cities notion: in the last decade, it has promoted the Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City, created mechanisms to monitor human rights at the local level and adopted a new constitution specifically based on the human rights approach. The city of Bogot√° was also at the forefront in the implementation of the human rights approach, with the implementation of the Bogot√° Humana policy (2013-2016) which took a specific emphasis on the rights of homeless people, women and elderly population. In North America, Montreal was a regional pioneer with the establishment of its local Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities (2006). San Francisco has implemented policy translates and implements locally the rights of women as defined in the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women since 1998. Human rights organizers in United States have nonetheless faced particular challenges due to the role of the U.S. in the world and to the U.S. failure to ratify most major international human rights treaties. However, in the 2000s, more U.S.-based activists have been working to raise international awareness of U.S. human rights violations, including racial discrimination in the criminal justice system, economic human rights violations, and the rights of children. In 2014 residents of Detroit who were losing access to clean water brought their case to the United Nations, which sent a Special Rapporteur to the city and issued a statement condemning practices that inhibited residents‚Äô right to water. This issue and others have encouraged more U.S. cities, including Baltimore Maryland, Mountain View California, Columbia South Carolina, to consider the human rights city model. Throughout the last years, several examples around the world show a deepening on the concept and implications of human rights cities. In South Korea, Gwangju pioneered the establishment of a human rights municipal system (2009) that was quickly followed by cities such as Seoul (2012) and Busan. Gwangju has also been the main organizer of a World Human Rights Cities Forum that has gathered hundreds of human rights cities on a yearly basis. All around Europe, cities such as Barcelona, Madrid, Graz or Utrecht have established mechanisms to guarantee human rights and monitor their responsibilities under international human rights standards. Particular examples in this regard can be found in local government measures such as Barcelona's ‚ÄúCity of Rights‚Äù programme (2016) or Madrid's ‚ÄúStrategic Plan for Human Rights Cities‚Äù (2017).  Cities and international law  All international human rights law is based in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948. This document outlines the inalienable and fundamental rights of humankind that are protected regardless of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, or any other social, economic, or political factor. The articles in the UDHR are not legally binding, but they are recognized as part of customary international law, and they authorize the development of binding international treaties, which countries may choose to sign and ratify. International human rights treaties and monitoring processes, however, privileges national governments and limits the role of local officials, whose cooperation in the implementation of international law is critical. The day-to-day work of implementing human rights standards often rests on the shoulders of local and regional authorities. They too are bound by these agreements. Local and regional authorities are often directly responsible for services related to health care, education, housing, water supply, environment, policing and also, in many cases, taxation. Mayer, Margit. 2012. \\"The 'Right to the City' in Urban Social Movements.\\" pp. 63‚Äì85 in Cities for People Not for Profit: Critical Urban Theory and the Right to the City, edited by N. Brenner, P. Marcuse and M. Mayer. New York: Routledge. How cities implement human rights ideals varies from city to city. This allows for each city to develop a plan that is specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated ‚ÄúHuman Rights Cities‚Äù typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, and public officials (or their appointees) working in partnership. Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City. San Francisco is another such example, since its 1998 adoption of a city ordinance reflecting the principles of the Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women. The San Francisco example has helped shape work by activists organizing a ‚ÄúCities for CEDAW‚Äù campaign to convince cities around the United States to implement the CEDAW convention despite the failure of the national government to ratify the treaty. = Human Rights Council on the \\"role of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights\\" = In the last years, the advance of the human rights cities movement has been assessed by several resolutions and statements of international organizations such as the Human Rights Council or the Council of Europe. A breakthrough in this regard was the adoption by the Human Rights Council of the Advisory Committee Report A/HRC/30/49 on the ‚ÄúRole of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights‚Äù. The report assessed local governments responsibilities in the light of international human rights law, but most importantly, emphasized the opportunities posed by the human rights cities movement in promoting and protecting human rights due to their close relation with the needs and aspirations of city inhabitants. The Report promoted local governments participation in the drafting of national human rights strategies, and called to secure the necessary powers and financial resources for local administration to be able to comply with their human rights responsibilities. It enshrined as best practices the initiatives of various local governments and promoted networking as a way to advance the human rights cities movement, including some examples and best practices such as the World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju or the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City. The 2015 Report has received an intense follow up by the Human Rights Council constituency and other international and local governments organizations working for the advance of the human rights cities movement. As the world representative of local and regional governments, the UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights has for instance presented various statements to the Council and shared the Report's recommendations among its constituency. In 2016, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution (A/HRC/RES/33/8) ‚ÄúRecognizing the role of local government in the promotion and protection of human rights‚Äù and that ‚Äúgiven its proximity to people and being at the grass-roots level, one of the important functions of local government is to provide public services that address local needs and priorities related to the realization of human rights at the local level‚Äù. On 2017, the same Council organized an intersessional panel discussion on the Report and the most recent advances in its implementation.  International networking and instruments  The city of Madrid held in 2017 an international meeting of cities for human rights and the right to the city Work by international human rights activists and by policymakers in the United Nations has helped spread ideas about how city governments can improve human rights implementation. In 2004, UNESCO helped establish the International Coalition of Cities against Racism to help municipal leaders exchange ideas and improve policies to fight racism, discrimination, xenophobia and exclusion. The European Coalition of Cities against Racism (ECCAR) grew out of that effort, and it now has more than 104 municipalities in its membership and has adopted a ten-point action plan. In 2005, the UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights was created in the framework of the largest organization and world representative of local governments: United Cities and Local Governments. The Committee represents and facilitates the exchange between worldwide local authorities having a strong agenda on human rights (Mexico City and Gwangju were for instance two of its co-chairs in 2018). As relevant outcomes of more than 10 years of work for advancing the notion and recognition of human rights cities, the Committee has been in charge of the follow-up of the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City and has created and promoted the Global Charter Agenda for Human Rights in the City. It has also carried out a strong political advocacy at a UN level for the recognition of local governments as key actors in the promotion and protection of human rights, and co-organized yearly a World Human Rights Cities Forum. Another relevant example in regards to concrete partnerships for advancing the human rights cities agenda are the so-called ‚Äúaction-research centers‚Äù. In this case, a local research center is generally at the forefront of mobilizing local authorities for the implementation of human rights at the local level. Relevant examples in this regard can be found at a European and North American levels. One of the most advanced examples on how can a local research center scale up and become a global actor in the promotion of the human rights agenda is the Raoul Wallenberg Institute. Although being affiliated to Lund University since 1984, the Institute's outreach has nonetheless gone beyond its local or even national level, as it now carries out projects in different regions of the world.

The novel is the first in a seven novel cycle. The novel depicts the perilous unbalanced psychology of the narrating character Silver, who becomes an apprentice to a lighthouse keeper. The novel follows in Winterson's typically mythological and metaphorical writing, exploring themes of storytelling, love and history. The novel received mixed reviews, with some reviewers seeing it as a continuation of Winterson's success of as a literary writer, while others frustrated by her writing.  Themes  Following in Virginia Woolf's metaphor of To the Lighthouse, the novel focuses on the lighthouse metaphor where \\"the continuous narrative of existence is a lie... there are lit-up moments, and the rest is dark.\\" The novel has both a present-day narrative, and one which flashes back 100 years, exploring the views of Charles Darwin and Robert Louis Stevenson. In this context, The New York Times describes the novel focusing on two themes: storytelling and love.  Style  The novel follows the richness of allegory and metaphor that is evident in much of Winterson's other works, including Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit. New York Times reviewer Benjamin Kunkel, describes novel as doing this too much: \\"metaphors have altogether slipped free of their sponsoring facts; her figurative language has turned into so many solemn doodles. The novel concentrates the worst qualities of her writing.\\" The novel is a mix of both exploratory metaphor and stories tolled by Silver's mentor, the lighthouse keeper. The Guardian reviewer Joanna Briscoe describes the first few chapters as returning to the best of Winterson writing, and compares the novel to a series of \\"self-contained tales\\" which have \\"the flavour of The Shipping News is tangling with The Wolves of Willoughby Chase via Heart of Darkness\\".  Critical reception  The Guardian reviewer Anita Sethiositively reviewed the novel, highlighting it philosophical and stylistic richness. The review concludes that \\"the power of Lighthousekeeping is in its stylistic dynamic between holding itself together with the pared-down precision of its language, each word smoothed into a finely polished pebble, and spilling out in the consciousnesses, narratives and disparate times that bleed seamlessly into each other.\\" The New York Times, had a decidedly negative review, noting that Winterson's style of writing takes over the storytelling. The reviewer, Benjamin Kunkel, concludes that in the novel \\"nothing gets in the way of lyricism or love, and the result is rhapsodic inconsequence and vacuous romantic uplift.\\" The Guardian reviewer Joanna Briscoe reaches a similar conclusion, calling the novel \\"a flawed return to form\\". Within some of this critique, Briscoe still finds some positives about the novel, saying that Winterson is a true innovator of form\\" and that calling the novel \\"not only to be admired, but enjoyed.\\"  References  External links *Complete Review profile Category:2004 British novels Category:Novels by Jeanette Winterson Category:Philosophical novels ","title":"Lighthousekeeping"},{"id":"49358255","text":"Candice Diana Skjonnemand (born 21 October 1986, Gold Coast), who also performs as Candice Dianna, is an Australian-born singer-songwriter, voice actress and record producer.

She was notable as the first African American woman to be elected mayor of a major New England city ‚Äì Hartford, Connecticut ‚Äì in 1987. She served three terms before being defeated in 1993. She served as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1980 until 1987. Perry was known for her distinctive broad-rimmed hats.  Early life and career  Perry was born on August 30, 1931 in Hartford to David Saxon and Mabel Lee. She was primarily raised by her grandmother after her father left the family when she was only six months old. She graduated from Howard University with a degree of economics and attended Howard University School of Law for two years before leaving school to marry James Perry, Jr. After leaving law school, she worked with a number of community organizations and help establish boards for organizations such as Planned Parenthood. She also worked for the state welfare agency. Political career Her first run for state representative ended in defeat in 1976. She was elected in 1980 and served until her election as mayor. She was selected as an assistant majority leader, chair of the bonding subcommittee, and a committee member for education, finance and housing. She became known for donning unique hats, of which she owned about two dozen. She said she started the habit because didn't have time to take care of her hair. = Mayorship = Perry was elected the mayor of Hartford at the age of 56. In 1987, Mayor Thirman L. Milner, the city‚Äôs first African America mayor, announced that he would not seek re- election to city hall. Perry entered the race and won the endorsement of the local Democratic Party. In the general election, she defeated Republican Philip Steele with 58 percent of the vote. She was credited for helping reduce racial tension in the city; notably, she visited black neighborhoods after the Rodney King verdict, which was credited with preventing rioting in Hartford as had happened in other large cities. She championed LGBT rights in Hartford during her mayorship, introducing legislation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in Hartford schools, 5 years before such legislation was adopted in Connecticut. She also focused on reducing burgeoning gang activity and drug trafficking, which was on the rise at the time. The position in Hartford is considered largely ceremonial, and paid a stipend of $17,500. After three terms as mayor, she was defeated by first-time Democratic challenger Michael Peters, a city firefighter. He had run on a campaign capitalizing on Hartford's declining economy and a sense that street crime was on the rise.  Personal life  Perry married James Perry, Jr. from whom she was divorced. She had a son, four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. Perry died on November 22, 2018 at the age of 87. However, her death remained unreported until November 2019.

It is located in the Luz neighborhood of S√£o Paulo in the left wing of the Luz Monastery, a religious institution founded in 1774 by Frei Galv√£o. The monastery is the only colonial building of the eighteenth century in S√£o Paulo to preserve its original building elements, materials and structure. The monastery was listed as an architectural monument of national importance in 1943 by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) and subsequently by the State of S√£o Paulo Council for the Defense of the Historical, Archaeological, Artistic and Touristic Heritage (CONDEPHAAT).Turner & Rose (1989) pp. 85‚Äì86. The museum was founded in 1970 and is maintained jointly by the State Government of S√£o Paulo and the Archdiocese of S√£o Paulo. The collection includes Brazilian and foreign works sacred works dating from the sixteenth century, and includes works by noted artists such as Aleijadinho, Agostinho da Piedade, Agostinho de Jesus, Valentim da Fonseca e Silva, Manoel da Costa Ata√≠de, Jos√© Ferraz de Almeida J√∫nior, and Benedito Calixto. Museum of the Curia Valentim da Fonseca e Silva (ca. 1750-1813) Anjo, 18th century The collection of the Museum of Sacred Art of S√£o Paulo began early in the early twentieth century on the initiative of Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva (1867-1938), the first archbishop of S√£o Paulo. He was responsible for the distribution of sacred works during the demolition of the S√£o Paulo Cathedral in 1911 for the construction of the present cathedral. Dom Duarte distributed the sacred works to various churches throughout the greater S√£o Paulo area with the goal of bringing the collection together into a unified collection at a later date. The archdiocese opened the Museum of the Curia (O Museu da C√∫ria) in 1907, and the collection grew over the 20th century. Foundation and opening The Curia Museum continued to collect pieces during the period of demolition and rebuilding of several churches from the state S√£o Paulo during first half of the twentieth century. The collection was kept in a room in the Curia on Rua Santa Teresa. In 1969, when Abreu Sodre was governor of S√£o Paulo, the Secretary of Finance, Luis Arrobas Martins, engaged in the creation and consolidation of a network of cultural facilities in the state. He began negotiations with Cardinal Agnelo Rossi (1913-1995) aiming at the creation of the S√£o Paulo Museum of Sacred Art. An agreement for the merger of the existing collection of the Curia and similar collections of sacred art owned by the state government was signed on October 28, 1969. The agreement between the government and the Archdiocese was approved at the same time as the restoration work of the Luz Monastery by IPHAN. The museum opened to the public on June 29, 1970. The initial collection was joined by other works of sacred pieces acquired by private collectors such as Luis Arrobas Martins (1920-1977), Pietro Maria Bardi (1900-1999), and Ciccillo Matarazzo (1898-1977). The Luz Monastery underwent another makeover in the 1970s under the direction of CONDEPHAAT to restore its appearance to that of the early eighteenth century. It is now considered the most outstanding work of colonial architecture that remains in the S√£o Paulo metropolitan area. Antonio de Oliveira Godinho (1920-1992) became director of the museum in 1979 and fundamentally reshaped the profile and display of the collection. The newly elected Pope John Paul II visited the museum in the same year.

Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain was a student of Bronislaw Malinowski who worked in 1949 with Alfred M√©traux, and participated in a UNESCO project in Haiti. She married Jean Comhaire, a Belgian who headed the Anthropology Department of University of Nsukka. Subsequently, she worked in Africa. Biography She was born on 6 November 1898 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and was the daughter of Georges Sylvain, Haitian activist and symbol of the resistance against the American Occupation, and of Eug√©nie Malbranche. She studied in Kingston and Port-au-Prince before she obtained her bachelor's degree and Doctorate in Paris. Besides her interest in Haitian folklore and social issues of the condition of women in Haiti and Africa, her research focused on the origins of Creole language; an idiom considered juvenile and worthless at that time. She had chosen a difficult path but her quaint work, disregarded by her peers, sparked the interest of famous Polish anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. The latter invited her in London where she became her research assistant while studying at London University and later at the London School of Economics. She also conducted successful research at the British Museum that resulted in her major work regarding the African roots of Haitian Creole. Comhaire-Sylvain conducted field research in Kenscoff and Marbial (Haiti), Kinshasa (Congo), Lom√© (Togo) and Nsukka (Nigeria) worked with renowned anthropologists such as Melville Herskovits and Alfred Metraux who entrusted her and her husband Jean Comhaire with a mission of the UNESCO in Haiti. Suzanne also taught at the New School for Social Research in New York and was appointed member of the United Nations trusteeship council for Togo and Cameroon under French administration. Comhaire-Sylvain came from a very notable family, her uncle Benito Sylvain being one of the founding fathers of Pan-Africanism and her father Georges Sylvain (1866‚Äì1925) was an important figure of the resistance against the American occupation in Haiti. Comhaire- Sylvain was the oldest of a family of seven. Her sister Yvonne Sylvain (1907‚Äì1989) was the first Haitian woman physician and the first gynecologist- obstetrician of the country.

On 3 January 1969 VAL-4 was established with the mission of conducting surveillance and offensive operations in support of river patrol craft, as well as providing air support for SEALS and combined U.S. Army, Navy and South Vietnamese operations, complementing the operations of HA(L)-3. In March 1969 VAL-4 was permanently based at the Naval Support Activity Detachment Airfield, Binh Thuy Air Base, South Vietnam, for combat operations. The squadron had two detachments, Detachment A assigned to Binh Thuy and Detachment B assigned to Vung Tau Airport. On 19 April 1969 the squadron began combat operations, flying air support for the Mobile Riverine Force in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam. The missions included normal patrol, overhead air cover, scramble alert and gunfire/artillery spotting. The OV-10s large payload and long endurance meant that it could provide air support to US and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces throughout the delta. From April‚ÄìMay 1970 VAL-4 participated in combined South Vietnamese and U.S. Riverine Force operations designed to neutralize sanctuary bases in the Mekong delta in support of the Cambodian Campaign. On 1 July 1970 Detachment B was disestablished and all operations were concentrated at Binh Thuy. In February 1971 VAL-4 with HA(L)-3 provided air support for Republic of Vietnam Navy supply convoys up the Mekong river to Phnom Penh. On 31 March 1972 the squadron conducted its last combat mission prior to its disestablishment on 10 April 1972.

HCI includes, at a minimum, virtualized computing (a hypervisor), software-defined storage and virtualized networking (software-defined networking). HCI typically runs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers. The primary difference between converged infrastructure (CI) and hyper- converged infrastructure is that in HCI, both the storage area network and the underlying storage abstractions are implemented virtually in software (at or via the hypervisor) rather than physically, in hardware. Because all of the software-defined elements are implemented within the context of the hypervisor, management of all resources can be federated (shared) across all instances of a hyper-converged infrastructure. Expected benefits Hyperconvergence evolves away from discrete, hardware-defined systems that are connected and packaged together toward a purely software-defined environment where all functional elements run on commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) servers, with the convergence of elements enabled by a hypervisor. HCI infrastructures are usually made up of server systems equipped with Direct-Attached Storage (DAS). HCI includes the ability to plug and play into a data-center pool of like systems. All physical data-center resources reside on a single administrative platform for both hardware and software layers. Consolidation of all functional elements at the hypervisor level, together with federated management, eliminates traditional data-center inefficiencies and reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) for data centers. Potential impact The potential impact of the hyper-converged infrastructure is that companies will no longer need to rely on different compute and storage systems, though it is still too early to prove that it can replace storage arrays in all market segments. It is likely to further simplify management and increase resource- utilization rates where it does apply. While hyperscale web services also use original design manufacturer x86 systems with software in custom ways, a model that is clearly scalable, they do so with a variety of optimized server types (some of which have no durable capacity) and storage approaches, not with one. See e.g. the variety of approaches in the Open Compute Project. Hyperconvergence is consistent in some key ways with this model, but it is simplified for smaller deployments by most vendors through focusing on one type of system and storage infrastructure, and this is believed to limit its success to date in mixed use, low latency and Tier 1 deployments at scale.

They had been sent to Rupara to assist Nurse Anna Rautaheimo in the founding of a clinic in Rupara. After a few years there, the family moved to Ovamboland, where Rebekka Amupanda was from, and then to Angola, to assist the Finnish missionary Tuure Vapaavuori, who needed an assistant there who could speak the local languages. When the Finns had to leave Angola in 1946, the family once again moved to Ovamboland. The family settled down in the Engela mission station. Max went to school there, and after finishing school, he was admitted to the teacher training seminary in Ongwediva. Having graduated as a teacher, Max worked in the Ohalushu school near Engela, while continuing to live at home. At the time, he was engaged in the boys' club, boy scouts and the youth work of his home parish. His interest in learning new things led him to study to become a pastor, and he was ordained a minister in 1965. The same year he married Nurse Kaunapawa Kristian, who had worked for a couple of years as a missionary among the San. The Ovambo-Kavango Church decided to send Max to work with Ovambo migrant workers in the central and southern parts of the country. He was stationed in the town of Okahandja, where his co-worker, Finnish missionary Pauli Laukkanen also lived. They were to organize church work among the 40,000 Ovambos working in diaspora outside of Ovamboland. The Apartheid laws of the country made this work quite difficult at times. Max was always eager to engage himself in new projects. This led him to one of the founders of the trade union movement in Namibia, which got him into trouble with the South African government. In 1981 he was arrested and imprisoned in Windhoek as a communist agitator. He was later let out of jail and put under house arrest, but eventually he was allowed to continue his work among migrant workers, however, under close surveillance. In 1987, Max moved to the United States in order to study theology there. He completed both a Master of Divinity and a Doctor of Theology degree. In his doctoral thesis, he examined Namibian theology of labour. When he returned to Namibia, Max wanted to incorporate social awareness to the church's activities and a readiness to combat economical inequality. However, the Ovambo-Kavango Church was not ready to pursue these issues. Max was sent to Walvis Bay, to work as a pastor among the black population there. In 1996 Max was finally transferred to Windhoek, where his wife had been living since 1972. In Windhoek, Max was installed as the pastor of the ELCIN parish, and he was also to act as a trainer in ELCIN urban work. He also became the chairman of the cooperation committee of the Lutheran churches of Namibia. However, he had only worked in these capacities for some two months, when he came down with a severe case of cerebral malaria, which caused his death on 5 June, 1997. Max and his wife Kaunawapa did not have biological children, but they had three adoptive children. Max visited Finland three times. He spent the year 1970 there with a scholarship from the Mikkeli Diocese of the Finnish Lutheran Church. Max's colleague Paul Isak emphasized how eager Max was to pursue his calling. If he had conducted a service on a Sunday, he would be seen on the streets and private homes of his parishioners the next day, addressing his parishioners. A head of a men's dormitory in Walvis Bay said of him: \\"Max did not really differ from any us ordinary people, yet everyone had respect for him as a pastor.\\" References Category:1935 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Kavango West Category:Ovambo people Category:Namibian Lutheran clergy ","title":"Leevi Gerson Max"},{"id":"49358775","text":"ANIPLUS Asia is a Southeast Asian pay television channel focused on airing anime as its main programming genre.

Rad. The film took twenty-one years to make and release, production beginning in 1984 and edits being made throughout the intervening years. Plot The plot of Dangerous Men is somewhat unclear, and changes abruptly towards the middle of the film. Mina (Melody Wiggins) and her fianc√©, Daniel (Coti Cook) are walking on a beach when two bikers, named Tiger and Leo, set upon them. They kill the fianc√© and attempt to rape Mina. In the struggle, Leo is killed and Tiger goes to leave the beach. Mina insists that he take her along, secretly plotting his murder. After taking Mina for a steak dinner at a motel, Tiger retires with her to their room. Mina distracts Tiger by having him rub her knees and lick her bellybutton before producing a knife hidden in her buttocks and stabbing him to death, taking revenge for her fianc√©. Mina flees into the desert, where she is picked up by a British man driving a pickup truck. The driver pulls over and attempts to rape Mina at gunpoint. She threatens to castrate him with her knife and sends him off, nude, to wander the desert. The film follows him for approximately 5 minutes as he narrates his own misfortune, occasionally addressing his own penis. He is seen singing and dancing as he wanders about. Eventually a van passes him by and he is pelted with garbage. Mina visits a prostitute and asks her to teach her to be \\"one of the girls of the night\\"- a ruse which she uses to kill several potential Johns with her knife. Mina's campaign of murders is reported on the news and comes to the attention of the police. A police detective (who is the brother of Mina's fianc√©) begins investigating a biker gang (led by the as-yet unseen Black Pepper, played by Bryan Jenkins), despite nominally being on vacation. He pays a bartender $300 for information about the bikers. Later, the detective tails one biker onto the beach where he is attempting to rape a young woman (Annali Aeristos). The detective chokes him into unconsciousness. In the next scene, the biker gang is driving in a convoy. The biker from the previous scene is distracted by the young woman he failed to rape- who is sunning herself on the hood of a car by the roadside. Unbeknownst to him, the detective is concealed in the car, wearing a bulletproof vest and motorcycle helmet. When the biker pulls over to once again attempt to rape the young woman, the police detective attempts to intervene. However, he spends several minutes attempting to extricate his foot which is stuck under a seat. Eventually he frees himself and chokes the biker into unconsciousness. The detective drives away with the biker bound in his back seat. He learns Black Pepper's location and drives to the foot of the hill where his house is located. In an unrelated scene, Mina is arrested by several other police officers in a public park. In the house, Black Pepper and a young woman watch a belly dancer perform. They then retire to Black Pepper's bedroom. They are interrupted in an amorous moment by one of Black Pepper's subordinates who tells him the police have arrived. After a fight in the house, Black Pepper flees into the brush and is pursued by the police chief. The chief chases Black Pepper through a small cave and into a neighboring house. Black Pepper is poised to rape the young blind woman who lives in the house. However, she produces a pistol from under her sewing and starts firing at Black Pepper. Shortly after, the chief arrives and arrests Black Pepper. The film abruptly ends on a freeze frame.

Rad was a trained architect who had worked in film production in Iran. He fled the revolution in 1979, and began auditions for his first American project in 1984. There was a screening of a 'finished' version of the film as early as 1985, but work continued on and off for the next two decades. The film was not released until 2005, when Rad paid for a week-long run in five Los Angeles theaters. This limited release reportedly earned $2,238. At least one person saw the film three times. Dangerous Men was re-released in 2015 by Drafthouse Films. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 50% approval rating, based on 10 reviews. In a scathing review, Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted, \\"In his handling his multiple assignments Rad shows no discernible talent for any of them. The pacing is bizarre (at one point there's a long belly dancing interlude, for no apparent reason); the dialogue is laughably atrocious; the production values are non-existent; the acting is embarrassing; the fight scenes are ineptly staged, with loud sound effects failing to compensate for the fact that no blows are landed; and the synthesizer-heavy musical score sounds left over from a '70s porn film.\\" But the review also stated the film \\"is sure to become an instant cult classic.\\" References External links   Category:2005 films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime films ","title":"Dangerous Men"},{"id":"49358941","text":"Dave Tofani is an American saxophonist and woodwind player, and composer.

It is located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was established in 1994 on the site of an Air Force base that was closed down by The Pentagon. In most cases, the person or entity that files the original USCIS petition (also known as the petitioner) differs from the person (or persons) on whose behalf the petition is filed (also known as the beneficiary or beneficiaries). The beneficiaries are the persons who may subsequently apply for a visa based on the approved petition, and NVC's communication is with the beneficiary (with the petitioner getting a notification at the beginning). In this article, the terms \\"beneficiary\\" and \\"visa applicant\\" are both used based on context.  Petitions that go through the NVC  = Form I-130 petitions = Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, is used by United States citizens and permanent residents to petition for immigrant status for their immediate relatives. The IR subcategory in the Form I-130 category is uncapped, and therefore the NVC immediately begins processing the application. However, the F subcategory has numerical limits, and is generally backlogged, and therefore applications in this category may have to wait. Note that wait times depend both on the type of visa in the F category, and the country of chargeability. = Form I-140 petitions = Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, is used by United States businesses (and in some cases, by the immigrant beneficiary himself or herself) to petition for immigrant worker status for the beneficiary in one of the categories EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3. All the categories are numerically capped. For any given country of chargeability, EB-1 gets higher priority (and therefore has lesser backlog and a shorter wait time) than EB-2, which in turn has higher priority than EB-3. For some combinations of country of chargeability and category, the priority date may be current, in which case NVC begins processing immediately, whereas for others, applications in the category may have to wait. = Other immigrant visa petitions that go through NVC = The following immigrant status petitions also get sent to NVC: * Forms I-600, I-600A, I-800, and I-800A, used for adoption of an orphan by a United States citizen (the IR-3 and IR-4 categories). * Form I-360, used for the EB-4 visa as well as some other special immigrant categories. * Form I-526, for the EB-5 visa = Form I-129F petitions = Form I-129F is a non-immigrant visa petition intended for the fiance(e) and children of the fiance(e) of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, with the intention of marriage with the fiance(e). The corresponding visa category is the K visa. If the petitioner and beneficiary fiance(e) marry within three months, the fiance(e) can undergo Adjustment of Status. This is a rare case of a non-immigrant visa category with explicit immigrant intent. There are no cutoff dates for these petitions. = Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver = A Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver is a waiver provided by the USCIS indicating that it waives unlawful presence in the United States as a ground of inadmissibility for a given applicant. It is obtained by applying with Form I-601A to the USCIS. It is used by people currently unlawfully present in the United States prior to departing the United States for a consular interview. USCIS notifies NVC once the Form I-601A is approved and the Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver is granted, so that NVC can process any visa application for the applicant based on a petition listing him or her as a beneficiary. = Petitions and visa categories that do not go through the NVC = Form I-129 petitions for non- immigrant workers do not go through the NVC. For these petitions, once the petition is approved by the USCIS, the beneficiary may directly apply for a visa at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. Some of the Form I-129 categories have numerical limits, but these limits are taken care of by the USCIS at the time it receives the application. Moreover, due to a limit of six months for receiving the petition (i.e., the petition can be received at most six months before the proposed start date) there cannot be huge backlogs; in case more petitions are received than the numerical limits the additional petitions are rejected and the petition must be filed next year. Among immigrant visa categories, the Diversity Immigrant Visa does not go through the NVC. The program is managed by the Kentucky Consular Center of the U.S. Department of State.  Distinction between immigrant visa applications outside the United States and Adjustment of Status applications  There are two ways to become a United States Lawful Permanent Resident. # Have an immigrant status petition listing one as a beneficiary approved and then use that to apply for an immigrant visa from outside the United States. In this case, after receiving the immigrant visa, the beneficiary can apply for a Green Card for delivery to their United States address, and then enter on the immigrant visa and transition to LPR status upon entry. # Be in the United States in another status and then file a Form I-485 petition for Adjustment of Status either concurrently with or after receiving approval for the immigrant status petition. In this case, the approval of Form I-485 transitions the beneficiary to Lawful Permanent Resident status. The key difference between the two methods is that for (1), the key decision to approve the beneficiary's transition is made by a consular officer employed by the U.S. Department of State and stationed in another country, whereas for (2), the final decision is made by a USCIS Field Officer. The National Visa Center is involved only for method (1). In case method (2) is being used, the NVC will not receive the petition at all if the Adjustment of Status application (Form I-485) is filed concurrently with the petition. If, however, the petition is filed as a standalone petition, the NVC may contact the beneficiary, and the beneficiary must indicate to the NVC in response that he or she is adjusting status and does not intend to apply for a visa. In this case, the NVC holds on to the petition until it is requested by a USCIS Field Office. If the applicant does not respond, the NVC continues processing it for a visa application. However, the numerical limits apply to all petitions regardless of whether method (1) or method (2) is used, and are managed by the Visa Reporting and Control Division of the Department of State. For Form I-130 and I-360, in some cases, another option called Direct Consular Filing (that bypasses the NVC) is available; however, this applies only to categories with no numerical limits.  Steps  = The petition is received by the USCIS = When the USCIS receives a petition, it puts it in a processing queue handled by USCIS and marks the date of receipt of the petition. If approved, and in the case that the category is numerically capped, the petition's Priority Date will be set to this date of receipt. Note that for I-140 petitions that require labor certification, the Priority Date is set as the date that the application for labor certification is received. The USCIS may take some time to approve the petition. The USCIS publishes both its processing time goals and its current processing times, which are approximately 7 months. For some petitions, the USCIS may issue a Request For Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny. The USCIS may deny the petition and the denial may be appealed. For Form I-140 petitions, it is also possible to speed up the process by availing of the Premium Processing Service. Throughout the process, the NVC is not involved. It is only if and after the USCIS approves the petition that the petition is forwarded to the NVC in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. As soon as it receives the petition from the USCIS, NVC gives the petition a case number through which the status of the petition may be tracked and contacts the applicant confirming that the petition was received. Note that this case number differs from the USCIS case number and also from the immigrant visa number (that, for capped categories, may not be immediately available). = For numerically limited visas, the National Visa Center may hold the petition until a visa number becomes available = For visas in numerically limited categories, the date that the petition is received by the USCIS is treated as the Priority Date for the application, with the exception of petitions that require labor certification. For petitions requiring labor certification (as is the case for some Form I-140 petitions) the Priority Date is the date the application for labor certification was received by the U.S. Department of Labor. Applications are processed from earlier to later Priority Dates. At any given point in time, the cutoff date (also known as the Qualifying Date) for current processing for each combination of category and country of chargeability is available, and published in the Visa Bulletin. If the Priority Date is earlier than the cutoff date for that category at the time NVC receives the petition, it immediately starts processing the application. However, if the Priority Date is later than the cutoff date, NVC holds the application until the cutoff date is about to approach the Priority Date. At this point, NVC contacts the beneficiary and starts the processing. An application whose Priority Date is earlier than the cutoff date is termed \\"current\\". NVC is not responsible for managing the queue of applications or updating the cutoff dates. That responsibility lies with the Visa Reporting and Control Division of the U.S. Department of State, that also publishes the Visa Bulletin and issues immigrant visa numbers. Moreover, the applications that go through the NVC are not the only ones in the queue; the queue also includes Adjustment of Status applications. Some implications of the way Priority Dates work: * The time taken by the USCIS to process the petition affects the total time taken to obtain the visa only if it is in an uncapped category or it exceeds the NVC wait times. This is because the Priority Date for a petition is set as the date that the USCIS receives the petition, not the date it starts or finishes processing the petition. * There can be a considerable period of time during which a person outside the United States is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition but cannot enter the United States in immigrant status because the Priority Date has not yet become current. Under these conditions, it can be difficult to enter the United States in non-immigrant status because of the clearly demonstrated immigrant intent; however, it may still be possible to use a B visa by demonstrating that one's visit will be short and that one does not intend to apply for Adjustment of Status. = NVC processes the application, arranging for a consular interview = NVC does the following to move forward on the beneficiary's visa application: # It invoices the beneficiary for visa application fees # It collects the visa application and supporting documentation # It holds the visa petition until an interview can be scheduled with a consular officer at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. NVC's first communication with the visa applicant, even before collecting fees, asks the applicant to choose an agent to represent him or her in communication with the NVC.

The sisters had an older brother, Caswell (1876-1936). Reverend A. A. Whitman came to be known as the \\"Poet Laureate of the Negro Race\\".Giemza, Bryan, Lisa Abney, Gail Galloway Adams, Gilbert Allen, Timothy D. Adams, Regina Ammon, Daniel Anderson et al. Southern Writers: A new biographical dictionary. LSU Press, 2006. p435 The sisters were taught by their father to sing religious songs and to dance, in order to accompany him on evangelical tours. Around 1899, Mabel and Essie began performing as the Danzette Sisters (or \\"Daznette Sisters\\" by other sources). They were invited to perform in New York by George Walker but their father and manager insisted that they stay to finish their education, and the sisters continued performing in the south. After their father died in 1901, Mabel, Essie and Alberta formed the Whitman Sisters' Novelty Act Company in Augusta, Georgia, and the twelve- strong Whitman Sisters' New Orleans Troubadours in 1904. The sisters were light-complexioned - their mother may have been white - and were occasionally obliged to perform in blackface. They were described as \\"bright, pretty mulatto girls\\" with \\"wonderful voices\\". Alberta (\\"Bert\\") performed regularly as a male impersonator. They moved their base to Chicago in 1905, and the youngest sister, Alice, joined the company around 1910. Mabel Whitman managed the company after her mother's death in 1909, and in 1910 organized Mabel Whitman and the Dixie Boys, and toured the US and (reputedly) Europe. Researcher Nadine George-Graves wrote that the sisters were the highest paid act in the Vaudeville circuit. While they claimed to have performed in England for King George V, George-Graves was not able to find evidence to support this. She wrote that \\"Many other actors started or advanced their careers with the Whitman Sisters' company. People of all races enjoyed their show. Even after Vaudeville was no longer in its prime, they continued to perform in theaters and churches around the nation and were admired by all types of audience members.\\"George-Graves, Nadine. The Royalty of Negro Vaudeville: The Whitman Sisters and the Negotiation of Race, Gender and Class in African American Theatre, 1900-1940, New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000. According to George-Graves, a typical show during their period of greatest popularity, from about 1909 to 1920, included \\"jubilee songs and coon shouts, cakewalks and breakdowns, comedians, midgets, cross-dressers, beautiful dancing girls, pickaninnies, a jazz band.\\" Other notable performers in the company at various times included Leonard Reed, Willie Bryant, Jeni Le Gon, Count Basie, Lonnie Johnson, and Bill Robinson. George-Graves wrote: > Mabel handled all the bookings, Essie designed and executed costumes, > Alberta composed music, and Alice, having won cakewalk contests from a > child, was billed at the star dancer.

Tanada's was born in Hawaii in 1919 to Japanese immigrants. Tanada attended the University of Hawaii studying Botany, and received a B.S. in 1942, and a M.S. in 1944. Tanada and his brother Shigeo volunteered for the Army. Tanada said he was rejected when he initially tried to join the military after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but was drafted later in part due to being fluent in Japanese. He enlisted on June 21, 1944. He translated top-secret Japanese communications for the Military Intelligence Service and was promoted to technical sergeant. After World War II ended, Tanada became an administrator to import and manufacture fertilizer. Tanada was assigned to the United States Department of Agriculture, where he published works related to the effects of red and far-red light on plant roots. The photomorphogenic processes he discovered in relation to light spectrum on plant root adhesion became known as the Tanada effect.

She is best known for her films Variety (1983) and Handsome Harry (2009) both of which received critical acclaim in North America and abroad.  Personal life  Gordon began making films in the late 1970s. It was upon her move to New York City in 1979 that she became more focused on full length narratives. She cites French New Wave filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard as a major inspiration to her as an artist and a filmmaker saying, \\"Having grown up through the '70s, I could not have found a more appropriate mentor. His radical approach to the use of sound and image helped shape me as much as the questions he asked the viewer to consider, most importantly, the relationship between truth and fiction.\\" She also lists Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love, R.W. Fassbinder, John Cassavetes and films like The Last Picture Show and Midnight Cowboy as inspirational for their portrayal of relationships and love. She considers the time she spent in New York in the early 1980s instrumental to her career - collaborating with other artists for the sake of creating art rather than making money was instrumental to her development as a filmmaker. She is a friend of actor Steve Buscemi and cast him in her film Handsome Harry because she felt as though it was a role unlike any he had ever played before. Gordon married Australian filmmaker Tim Burns and they have one daughter, Lili Burns.  Career  Gordon is said to be \\"known for her bold explorations of themes related to sexuality, violence and power.\\" Her film Variety explores the relationship between women, pornography and voyeurism. The title character of the film \\"turns the tables on men\\" by renegotiating the historically exploitative relationship between men and women with respect to pornographic films. She says, \\"My films have always focused on the visual aspects of storytelling. I've been drawn to stories in which color, texture and mood are as central to the narrative as character and plot.\\" Though much of her work is focused on women and the female experience, some of her recent work - most notably Handsome Harry - examines the social constraints placed on men and tensions between hetero-normative masculinity and homosexuality. In the film, described as \\"relentless\\" by a review in the New York Times, the main character is struggling to confront the emotional and physical trauma he and his friends inflicted on a homosexual friend while in the Navy many years prior.  Academia  Gordon holds a BA, MA, and MFA from The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and is now a part of the film department of Columbia University School of the Arts. Some of her films are now a part of permanent collections in several different museums including the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

She would later become Director at the Philadelphia regional office for the VBA. In 2010, she was named director of the VBA's Eastern Area Office, responsible for offices across 14 states. She volunteered in 2014 to head the St. Paul regional office. Controversy In 2014 Graves volunteered for a transfer from the Philadelphia regional office to the St. Paul regional office for an open position that held considerably less responsibilities. She and her peer Diana Rubens were allegedly informed by superiors, possibly by the former VA undersecretary for benefits Allison Hickey, of loopholes within the VA's employee transfer program that would allow for financial gain. In her move to Minnesota, Graves expensed nearly $130,000 in moving fees to the VA, which attracted the attention of the VA's inspector general. Upon investigation, it was ascertained that Graves had used her senior position at the Philadelphia office to pressure a subordinate to leave their job, thus opening the position in St. Paul. Graves then volunteered for the position with reduced responsibilities. However, she retained her $174,000 salary despite the lessened responsibilities. Graves and was transferred to a separate location and demoted while under investigation. Hickey resigned her post in October 2015 amid investigations into her role aiding Graves and Rubens in their transfer scheme. The VA announced it would review its transfer program due to the growing number of cases involving abuse of authority. Graves and Rubens both appealed their demotions with the Merit Systems Protection Board and pleaded the Fifth in hearings surrounding the allegations. The Inspector General recommended the Justice Department proceed with criminal charges. In January 2016 a judge overturned Graves' demotion. The reason given was that the VA was inconsistent in its discipline of both Graves and Rubens, since it had not previously disciplined other employees who had committed similar violations. The judge also cited Graves' superiors' knowledge of her intent as evidence that no wrong-doing had occurred. Graves was reinstated effective immediately and was awarded back-pay. The decision to overturn her demotion was widely criticized by both Democratic representative Tim Walz and Republican Jeff Miller who cite the VA's lack of accountability and transparency. She was reinstated to her previous St. Paul post with her increased salary, effective immediately. The VA declared in early February that it would punish Graves and Rubens without demoting either. \\"Rubens and Graves clearly should have been fired\\" observed Miller, who went on to iterate a complete lack of confidence in the VA's transparency and integrity. In November 2015, it was learned that Graves had received a bonus of almost $8,700 in 2014, \\"the same year she was under federal investigation for allegedly abusing her authority for personal gain\\". The VA stated it lacked the authority to \\"recoup more than $400,000 from two senior VA executives who manipulated the hiring system to get their jobs of choice and received hundreds of thousands in extra money to relocate\\". Veterans of the armed services expressed outrage at Graves' actions, along with the VA's refusal to fire her, to recoup the embezzled tax-payer dollars, or to seriously reprimand its employees that had broken the law. The American Legion expressed a similar dissatisfaction with the VA's lack of discipline and, noting their retention of ample salaries, called the scandal an \\"insult and a disgrace to all veterans\\". In addition, Pete Hegseth of Concerned Veterans for America accused Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald of ineffective leadership and of perpetuating a culture of dishonesty within the VA. Democrat Richard Blumenthal called the VA's reinstating of Graves and Rubens \\"an appallingly insufficient punishment\\". More broad criticisms have arisen about the accountability of federal employees, who are alleged to be very difficult to fire despite proven corruption and misconduct.

Ancient tragedians often focused on ideas such as mythology, love, passion and violence in their works and these are clearly reflected in epic, especially in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Tragic themes do not simply refer to subject matter however and can also be used in reference to the format of the writing, such as utilizing dramatic monologues, or soliloquies, metatheatre, and emphasizing time and place.  Tragedy in antiquity  The modern idea of tragedy evokes a very different image than it would in the time of Ovid. Today, the word tragic implies a sense of sad, unfortunate, or pitiful. However, the term at its most basic refers to the idea of tragedy as a poetic genre. Greek tragedy at its most basic refers to a form of theatre that was present in Athens in the 5th century BC. There are only three poets whose works have survived the centuries: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Tragic plays most often depicted well known myths of the time and utilized a minimal cast as well as a chorus. One of the most basic ways that we see tragedy in the Metamorphoses is in how Ovid borrows a variety of stories from ancient Greek and Roman tragedy and retells them in a way that in both unique to his style and pays homage to genre itself. Throughout the Metamorphoses Ovid plays with the concept of tragic appropriation, that is, taking themes, motifs, and structure from ancient tragedy and translating them into his own epic. This is not a new concept and has been seen before in the epic work of Virgil, the Aeneid, which is deeply rooted in tragedy and was most likely an important influence on Ovid's works. Themes Ovid utilizes a variety of tragic themes throughout the Metamorphoses. Some of these themes simply involve the subject matter, but some involve thematic and narrative devices. Both of these types are equally important to understanding how Ovid connects with and employs the idea of tragedy in his epic. =Metatheatre and theatricality= Metatheatre refers to when a drama calls attention to the fact that it is a drama. This can be shown through characters realizing they are dramatic characters, narrators blatantly stating that the actions are not real, or a variety of other devices. In the instance of the Metamorphoses tragedy itself is being translated into another genre, which is very metatheatrical in nature. In its classic usage, the success of the metatheatre elements is dependent on whether or not there is an audience. In this line of thought, the success of Ovid's transformations throughout the epic, and of the genre itself, is dependent on whether or not there are readers that understand his references. Though understanding the references made throughout the epic are not necessary for understanding the basic plots and subplots, having a prior knowledge of the myths depicted can help a reader to engage more fully with the text and to see how these connections come together. Actaeon The story of Actaeon is one of the first presented in the Metamorphoses that is very metatheatrical in nature. One of the first known appearances of this myth was in a tragedy written by Aeschylus in the 5th century BC, the Toxotides, or the Female Archers. The myth, as presented in the Metamorphoses shows Actaeon coming across the sight of Diana, or Artemis in the Greek tragedy, bathing herself. Upon being discovered, Actaeon is turned into a deer and eventually killed by his own pack of hunting dogs. Though the full text of Aeschylus' tragedy is lost to modern readers, it would have been known by the audiences of antiquity. Due to this prior knowledge, they would experience a juxtaposition of Actaeon's role in the Metamorphoses versus his role in the Toxotides. Audiences would already be aware of Actaeon's role as a tragic character, which enhances Ovid's telling of the story and lends itself to the metatheatre concept. Hecuba Hecuba is another character which ancient audiences would clearly recognize from the tragic stage. Hecabe is the star of two different tragedies by Euripides, the Trojan Women and the Hecuba itself. The Trojan Women features Hecuba and a variety of other women of Troy lamenting their losses after the city is taken and sacked. The women discuss their fates and the fates of others in Troy as they are divided up as the spoils of war. The action of the Hecuba follows this and shows Hecuba as a captive of the Greeks on their voyage home from Troy. In the Metamorphoses Ovid utilizes both of Hecuba's tragic appearances and combines them into one narrative. Hecuba's departure from Troy at the end of the Trojan Women is her entrance into the Metamorphoses and the action of both plays is touched on through her narrative in the epic. It can be seen here that since ancient audiences would already be well versed in her story, Ovid does not feel the need to go into detail about every piece of her history. This prior knowledge makes Hecuba's character metatheatrical in nature because it would not be possible without an audience. Polyxena Like Actaeon and Hecuba before her, Polyxena is a well known character from the tragic stage, whose story is modified or condensed in order to fit into the realm of Ovid's epic. Polyxena's most famous act is that of her death, depicted in the Trojan Women and discussed in the Hecabe. In both plays, Polyxena must be sacrificed by the Greeks in order to gain the favor of the wind and successfully sail home. In the Metamorphoses, Polyxena's lengthy lamentations from the Hecabe is condensed down to under fifty lines. However, in these fifty lines Polyxena becomes aware of her role as a tragic heroine and delivers her monologue as such. Once Polyxena is brought to the altar she \\"realized that she would be the victim of this cruel sacrifice, and not even then did she forget herself.\\" In this moment, though the action itself is speaking of Polyxena not forgetting that she is of noble blood, it also speaks to her remembering that this tragic role is the one she is meant to play throughout time. Whereas in Euripides version of her story, Polyxena's final words are retold by another, in this epic, Ovid lets her speak for herself, allowing for the metatheatre concepts to sink in a bit more. Throughout her short speech, Polyxena echoes the sentiments she has previously expressed in her Euripidean appearances, as well as expressing original thoughts and ideas. By expressing these thoughts, that have never been illustrated in tragedy previously, Poyxena takes control of her own narrative and ends her speech the way she would like, instead of through the mouth of another. =Dramatic monologue= The Metamorphoses places a large emphasis on the narrative device of the extended monologue. The epic features thirteen monologues that are a minimum of fifteen lines and are delivered by a wide variety of characters. The purpose of these monologues is exactly the same as their purpose in ancient tragedy: \\"to articulate thoughts, laments, questions, plans, and rationales\\" that would otherwise not be expressed in the action or that must be shown in a first person narration. Monologues in Ovid's epics, as in their tragic predecessors, aim to transform the character in some way by calling attention to their inner workings and emotions and how they affect the dramatic action surrounding them. Medea The speech given by Medea in Book VII of the Metamorphoses can be considered the poem's first fully dramatic monologue. The speech is over sixty lines of text and is the longest full speech in the entire epic given by a man or a woman. In Medea's speech she seems to react to her previous appearances in tragic texts and epic, weaving metatheatrical elements into her monologue as she becomes aware of herself. Medea truly is the narrator of her own story and in her own narration the reader is given a look at the rationale behind the actions of Medea throughout her other dramatic appearances. In the Metamorphoses Ovid continually stresses Medea's use of incantation and magic and her ability to create and destroy. In this vein it seems as though she feels responsible for creating a relationship with Jason and feels as though she must save him. Medea's continual return to incantation and the emphasis on language shows how she is able to use her power to create her own story. Where as in other texts, Medea is consistently able to outwit her opponents and gain victory through rhetoric, the Medea that is shown in the Metamorphosesis overtaken by emotion and cannot seem to accurately verbalize it. This direct contrast between the Medea that ancient audiences would know and the one they are presented with here shows how Ovid is taking, not only themes from tragedy, but characters as well, and translating them into his own version. Hecuba The dramatic speech given by Hecuba in Book XIII of the Metamorphoses is the last full monologue of the epic. Both the first and last full monologues of this epic are delivered by women, which lends itself to analyzing the development of the female portrayal throughout the piece. Medea's speech, previously discussed, is rash and scattered, illustrating her emotional distress, while also showing the beginnings of the female oratory in the poem. In contrast, Hecuba's speech is polished and refined, showing not only the dignity of the fallen queen, even in her darkest times, but also emphasizing the growth of the portrayal of women throughout the epic. Hecuba's lame over her daughters dead body also recalls back to the small speech given by Thisbe in Book IV. Though Thisbe is not given a full monologue, she makes use of the lines she is given to lament over the death of her love Pyramus. Hecuba draws on the tragic themes presented in Thisbe's lamentation and expands upon them, expressing the death of a daughter instead of a lover. Hecuba's speech opens with her asking the gods what else she could possibly lose, after having her family slaughtered, her city sacked, and herself taken as a prisoner. This theme of all being lost to war and death is a common one throughout the world of ancient tragedy. This theme is most clearly illustrated in Aeschylus' great trilogy the Oresteia and in Sophocles' trilogy on Oedipus. As in Hecuba's speech, characters from the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles both lament their great losses and what has led them to this point. One of the best examples of this theme that Ovid so clearly draws upon is the speech given by a messenger in Oedipus Rex that tells of the death of Jocasta and the blinding of Oedipus. This famous speech follows in the same theme of that given by Hecuba, previous actions and the fates that lead characters to destruction and death. Hercules The monologue given by Hercules in Book IX of the Metamorphoses is even more textually related to his previous appearances in tragic works. Whereas Medea and Hecuba spoke in a way that was based on their previous appearances but was fundamentally different in speech, Hercules' soliloquy is very thematically and rhetorically similar to the speech he gives in Sophocles' Women of Trachis. Hercules' speech in Sophocles' tragedy spans an extensive sixty plus lines and discusses not only his current condition after being poisoned by Deianira, but also details the twelve labors he has successfully completed prior to the poisoning and a variety of prayers to Zeus and Hades. The monologue given in Ovid's telling of the story is very similar in structure and content. In the Metamorphoses, Hercules' speech is cut down to under thirty lines, but still details his labors and current condition. However, in contrast to his Sopholcean speech, this Hercules places the blame for his poisoning on Juno and laments about how unfair his current condition is, instead of blaming Deianira and offering up prayers to the gods. =Mythology= Tragedy as a genre is generally devoted to the telling of Greek and Roman myths and legends, and within the genre of tragedy, individual plays work to retell individual myths or connected stories. At its core, mythology is an interconnected network of symbols, patterns and structures all working together to create a culture of values and ideas. Though mythology examines supernatural events, the subject matter also aims to connect these events to real world ideas and values. We see the myth of Icarus and Daedalus illustrated in the Metamorphoses teaching readers not to fly too close to the sun and let their pride and glory get the best of them. There is the myth of Lycaon's transformation into a wolf, which appears at the beginning of the epic, warning readers of the dangers of impiety and cruelty. We especially see the myths of Medea and Hercules in Ovid's epic, translating their stories from the tragic stage into the written tale. The whole of the Metamorphoses is built on the stories that have been told and retold throughout ancient history, these common knowledge myths that shape the culture of the times. Mythology is the main subject matter within the tragic genre, so it must be included by Ovid in the epic in order to effectively translate their tragic themes into his writing.

The reserved is situated in the Stavropolsky District of Samara Oblast. The reserve is important because of its scientific value in the biodiversity of its closely placed variety of habitats. In 2007, the Zhiguli Reserve was added to the UNESCO Middle Volga Biosphere Reserve, along with the surrounding Samarskaya Luka National Park. Topography The Zhiguli reserve covers the northern middle section of the Samara Bend peninsula. It is bordered on the north by the Kuybyshev Reservoir of the Volga River, and on the west, south and east by Samarskaya Luka National Park. The entirety of the terrain is mountains, with small sections of lowland forest and coast on the reservoir. The ridge within the reserve gradually increases from 250 m in height in the west, to 371 m in the center, then decreases to 250 meters on the eastern border. The ridge is cut by two valleys: the Bakhilova Polyana, and a ravine. Satellite image of the Samara Bend in the Volga River. The Zhiguli Reserve is the dark green on the north- central section of the peninsula. Climate and ecoregion Zhiguli is located in the East European forest steppe ecoregion. This ecoregion is a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south; it is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The climate of Zhiguli is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Flora and fauna The reserve is covered 94% by mixed coniferous-deciduous and deciduous forests. The remainder is grassland steppe and grass-forb meadows. The limestone and chalk mountains support some virgin steppe pine forest, with representative rocky steppe habitat, sphagnum bogs, floodplain oak and osokorevo-vetlovye forests, and willow thickets. Biodiversity is high and packed into a small area: although Zhiguli is only 0.16% of the Samara region, it contains over 1,000 of the 1,500 higher plant species of the region. 50 species of plants on the site are relics, surviving from previous geological ages. Among the mammals, the reserve is notable for its large number and variety of small rodents, such as the bank vole and the yellow-necked mouse. History The Zhiguli Reserve was first officially established in 1927, and has undergone changes in name, status and boundaries since that time. Originally formed as Srednevolzhskiy Reserve in 1927 for scientific research, it was reorganized and renamed Kuibyshev Reserve in 1938 with an expanded focus on forestry managed. During this time, exotic species were introduced, such as the Sika deer and the Amur Cork Tree (Phellodendron amurense), with damaging consequences for the pristine nature of the native plants and animals. During the 1940s, further degradation occurred as commercial oil drilling was introduced to the territory. The reserve was closed in 1961, but re-established in 1966. In 1977, the reserve was officially renamed in honor of Ivan Sprygin, the pioneering naturalist of the Samara Region, and the first director of the Zhiguli Reserve. Ivan Sprygin, pioneering botanist for whom the Zhiguli Reserve is officially named Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Zhiguli Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are two 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public, but require permits to be obtained in advance. The first public route is a car tour to Strelna Mountain, the other is a hike to the \\"Stone Bowl\\" (karst formation). Excursions must be made in the presence of reserve officers, and cannot last more than four hours.

The film, directed by Jack Olsen and produced by Sydney Newman, depicted the contemporary Canadian and international aircraft in production and on the drawing boards. The film's French version title is Avions √† r√©action.  Synopsis  In 1951, every major nation is involved in the development of jet aircraft. At international air shows, Great Britain demonstrates the revolutionary de Havilland Comet, the first jet airliner to fly and its nimble de Havilland Vampire jet fighter. The United States is introducing its swept wing Boeing B-47 Stratojet jet bomber into service while the Soviet Union has unveiled a secretive jet design, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter interceptor. Canada has become the latest entrant in the \\"blowtorch era\\" sweepstakes with Canadair's Canadair Sabre jet fighter entering large scale production at its Montreal plant, for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Based on the North American F-86 Sabre that has already proven itself in the Korean War, the Canadair Sabre will be Canada's front line \\"dogfighter\\". At Avro Canada in Malton, Ontario near Toronto, the company has invested in research and development and embarked on an ambitious program with Canadian-designed and built Orenda jet engine in development, and a jet- powered fighter and airliner going through flight trials. The first to fly is the Avro C.102 Jetliner jet airliner designed for intercontinental routes. The Avro XC-100 twin-engine jet night fighter prototype is rolled out for its successful maiden flight and will soon enter production for the RCAF. Other experimental designs include the Hiller YH-32 Hornet, ramjet-powered helicopter, the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin parasite fighter, deployed from the bomb bay of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, Gloster Meteor fighters equipped for aerial refuelling, delta wing Convair XF-92 and the Northrop YB-49 and Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 flying wing designs, all pointing a way to the future.
