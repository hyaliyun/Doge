It is characterized by increased amounts of serum dopamine and the absence of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine. Dopamine is released, as a false neurotransmitter, in place of norepinephrine. Other names for norepinephrine include noradrenaline (NA) and noradrenalin. This condition is also sometimes referred to as \\"norepinephrine deficiency\\". Researchers of disorders such as schizophrenia are interested in studying this disorder, as patients with these specific diseases can have an increase in the amount of dopamine in their system and yet do not show other symptoms of DŒ≤H deficiency. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a very rare form of dysautonomia. It belongs to the class of rare diseases, with \\"a prevalence of fewer than 20 affected individuals, all of Western European descent\\", as described in the scientific literature. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the DŒ≤H gene, which results in the production of a nonfunctional dopamine Œ≤-hydroxylase enzyme. Without this enzyme, the patients with DŒ≤H deficiency suffer from many clinical manifestations which greatly affect their daily lives.  Signs and symptoms  Dopamine beta (Œ≤)-hydroxylase deficiency is a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS works via two opposing branches, the sympathetic and parasympathetic, both of which antagonistically control involuntary processes that regulate bodily homeostasis. Problems related to DŒ≤H deficiency often first appear as complications shortly after birth. Postnatal episodes may include vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, muscle hypotonia, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia. Due to the deficiency of norepinephrine and epinephrine those affected by dopamine Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency may present with droopy eyelids (ptosis), nasal congestion, and hypotension. The most common complaint of individuals with dopamine Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency is orthostatic hypotension. The symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension are dizziness, blurred vision, or fainting upon standing. Therefore, DŒ≤H deficiency patients may have an inability to stand for a prolonged period of time. This phenomenon is especially pronounced when going from supine to upright positions, such as getting out of bed in the morning. It is also worsened by extreme climates due to loss of fluid through excessive sweating. The inability to maintain normal blood pressure makes it difficult for people with DŒ≤H deficiency to exercise (exercise intolerance). Males with DŒ≤H deficiency may experience retrograde ejaculation, a discharge of semen backward into the bladder due to dysmotility of their smooth muscle, which as innervated by the ANS. A subset of DŒ≤H deficiency patients present with hypermobility. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, another form of dysautonomia, also sees this comorbidity with hypermobility in the form of a rare connective tissue disorder called Ehlers Danlos syndrome. Another commonly experienced symptom is hypoglycemia, which is thought to be caused by adrenomedullary failure. In looking at the cardiovascular system, a loss of noradrenergic control is seen as T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram. Prolactin is frequently suppressed by excessive dopamine found in the patient's central nervous system. Excess dopamine can also affect digestion, producing vomiting and inhibiting motor signaling to the GI tract. Diagnosis  Treatment  = Lifestyle = Untreated individuals with DŒ≤H deficiency should avoid hot environments, strenuous exercise, standing still for prolonged time and dehydration. Care should be taken when changing position from horizontal to upright. = Medications = Since the conversion of dihydroxyphenylserine (Droxidopa; trade name: Northera; also known as L-DOPS, L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine, L-threo-DOPS and SM-5688), to norepinephrine bypasses the dopamine beta- hydroxylation step of catecholamine synthesis, L-Threo-DOPS is the ideal therapeutic agent. In humans with DŒ≤H deficiency, L-Threo-DOPS, a synthetic precursor of noradrenaline, administration has proven effective in dramatic increase of blood pressure and subsequent relief of postural symptoms. L-DOPS continues to be studied pharmacologically and pharmacokinetically and shows an ability to increase the levels of central nervous system norepinephrine by a significant amount. This is despite the fact that L-DOPS has a relative difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier when compared to other medications such as L-DOPA. When used concurrently, there is evidence to show that there is increased efficacy as they are both intimately involved and connected to the pathway in becoming norepinephrine. There is hope and evidence that L-DOPS can be used much more widely to help other conditions or symptoms such as pain, chronic stroke symptoms, and progressive supranuclear palsy, amongst others. Clinically, L-DOPS has been already shown to be helpful in treating a variety of other conditions related to hypotension including the following: * Diabetes induced orthostatic hypotension * Dialysis-induced hypotension * Orthostatic intolerance * Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy * Spinal Cord Injury related hypotension Empirical evidence of mild effectiveness has been reported using mineralocorticoids or adrenergic receptor agonists as therapies. Other medications that can bring relief to symptoms include: * phenylpropanolamine- due to pressor response to vascular Œ±-adrenoceptors * indomethacin Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is also a required cofactor for the Dopamine beta hydroxylase enzyme. Recent research has shown that vitamin C rapidly catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine through stimulation of the dopamine beta hydroxylase enzyme.  Prognosis  This is a form of dysautonomia but differentiated from familial dysautonomia by a lack of familial dysautonomic symptoms such as loss of sense of pain and smell. While L-threo-DOPS has been described as being \\"very effective for restoring noradrenergic tone and correcting postural hypotension, response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown.\\" Researchers have put together retrospective data collections in order to better under the progression of this orphan disease. Most studies show a perinatal period marked by inadequacy of the ANS to control blood pressure, blood sugar, and body temperature. The experiences of orthostatic hypotension, exercise intolerance, and \\"traumatic morbidity related to falls and syncope\\" have been documented later in lives of people with this condition. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation, outcome of these diseases, their impact on the quality of life of patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, a patient registry was established by the non-commercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).  Current research  Recent studies have explored the connection between DŒ≤H deficiency, Droxidopa treatment, and the effect on orthostatic tolerance and glucose homeostasis. It was found that Droxidopa increased acute and late glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and improved patients' insulin sensitivity. However, the use of Droxidopa was found to only produce \\"modest changes in glucose homeostasis\\" overall. This shows that treatment modalities other than Droxidopa should be pursued as possible adjuncts for the hyperinsulinemia seen in DŒ≤H deficiency.

Debuting on October 20, 1997, it aired its last episode on April 28, 2006. Reruns of the program continued to air until May 6, 2007. Plot Bear lives in the Big Blue House where he is caregiver for his friends bear cub Ojo, mouse Tutter, lemur Treelo, otters Pip, Pop, and narrator Shadow. He and his friends have many adventures together. Those normally include solving problems, sharing, cooperating with each other, and developing social/life skills. Each episode opens with the welcome song and appearance of the characters. Each show focuses on a theme (ex; \\"sleep\\", \\"doctors\\", \\"Thanksgiving\\") which folds into a lesson at the end. Songs and jokes accompany the episode. The character \\"Shadow\\" narrates a segment with shadow puppets in each episode. Most of the segments are in song, while some are simply a short story relating to the episode's theme. At the end of the program, Bear sings the goodbye song with Luna, the moon.

Bear also appeared as a celebrity in the 2002 revival of The Hollywood Squares; he notably appeared in Whoopi Goldberg's final episode. Locations * Woodland Valley ‚Äì Woodland Valley is the area/village in which events on the show are situated. The Big Blue House is the main landmark, but there is also a general store, post office, mall, library, movie theater, mouse school, and many other locations. Many of these are not seen (or not seen in much detail) until the fourth season. In \\"History, Herstory, Bearstory,\\" Jeremiah Tortoise reveals that his grandfather Hepahestus Tortoise was the town's first settler. He initially decided to call it Who'd Have Thought I Would Land in This Valley Valley, but decided it was too long and changed it to Would Land Valley. Jeremiah says he's been trying to get the official spelling changed for years. Sequoia City is a neighboring town of Woodland Valley. * The Big Blue House ‚Äì The Big Blue House is where most of the main action of the series Bear in the Big Blue House takes place. Located in Woodland Valley, it looks somewhat small from the outside, but large and roomy on the inside. Bear lives here and runs a sort of daycare/group-home. Tutter has his mousehole in the house, while most of the other young characters only spend the day here. The Big Blue House is often described as warm and cozy. The Big Blue House has five rooms. The kitchen and the living room are downstairs. Bear has his very own swing where he sometimes sits and reads in the living room. Tutter's mousehole is in the kitchen. The front-door, where Bear greets the viewers at the beginning of each episode, is also downstairs. Upstairs are the bathroom and Bear's bedroom. Finally, Bear stores various items in the attic. There's also a landing there where Bear visits each night to talk with his friend Luna, the moon. Bear once gave the following directions on how to reach the Big Blue House: just take the path that leads into the woods, make the right past the big oak, go right, past the pond and then you're there. * Otter Pond ‚Äì Pip and Pop often hang out at the Otter Pond. It is also home to Harry the Duck, his mom, and his sister, Hallie. Additionally, various other creatures sometimes hang out at the Otter Pond, including Benny, Christine, and Big Old Bullfrog. The general area of the Otter Pond is filled with plants, including bushes filled with berries. Bear and Ojo visit there to pick berries for triple-berry pie in \\"If at First You Don't Succeed...\\" The Otter Pond was the site of a special nighttime party in \\"And to All a Good Night.\\" * Woodland Valley Library ‚Äì The Woodland Valley Library is a place for everyone in Woodland Valley to go for research and resources. It is managed by Otto and Etta Otter. It is located directly in the center of the town. In addition to books, it also offers DVDs, CD-ROMs, Internet access and various other resources. Woodland Valley Library is featured in the two-part \\"Welcome to Woodland Valley\\" story. A tree falls on the library and the entire community works together to help get it cleaned up. There is damage to the collection and so donations are made. When Ojo discovers two unnamed opossums (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and Brad Garrett) living in the tree that fell, the tree itself is made into a part of the library as the Book Nook. The library is featured in the song, \\"Everything's Great About the Library.\\" Harry the Duck wonders what's so great about the library and so Tutter, Treelo, Pip and Pop sing a song to explain it. They tell him that there's something for everyone at the library, but the library is a place to read, so you have to keep your voices down; no disturbing allowed. * Woodland Valley Cinema ‚Äì The Woodland Valley Cinema is a local movie theater for everyone in Woodland Valley to relax and watch films. Annette is the owner of the movie theater and does all the jobs from box office to ticket taker. The screening room has three rows of seats in the auditorium and a concession stand. The concession stand accepts dollars and cents as payment instead of clams, Woodland Valley's official currency. Woodland Valley Cinema was first introduced in \\"Welcome to Woodland Valley.\\" However, in \\"Words, Words, Words,\\" the Woodland Valley Gazette says the movie theater is named \\"Woodland Valley Multiplex.\\" * Woodland Valley Post Office ‚Äì The Woodland Valley Post Office is Woodland Valley's own facility for posting, receipt, sorting, handling, transmission or delivery of mail. The post office also sells stamps for stamp collections and does clammygrams if asked. Jeremiah Tortoise works there in addition to running his general store. Most of the mail ends up arriving late due to Jeremiah Tortoise, who is slow at delivering the mail. In \\"A Strange Bird,\\" Bear received a two-week-old postcard from a penguin named Puck from the South Pole and finds out Puck is paying a visit to the Big Blue House today. The store accepts clams, Woodland Valley's official currency, as payment and it has to be exact change only. Woodland Valley Post Office was first introduced in \\"Read My Book\\" and was seen more in later episodes. * Mouse School ‚Äì The Mouse School is a fun place to learn for Tutter and his classmates, including Keisha, Luke, Lily, Rita, and Moss. Learning and other activities are overseen by Miss Maxwell. It's a one-room schoolhouse, but there's plenty of places to play and an occasional field trip. Tutter first begins attending Mouse School in the fourth season. He joins the school soccer team, coached by Bear, but considers quitting in \\"Show Your Stuff.\\" In \\"Teacher Appreciation Day,\\" Tutter joins with Lily to figure out a way to show Miss Maxwell how much the mice kids all appreciate her. Tutter holds a sleepover for his Mouse School classmates in \\"Tutter's First Big Sleepover Bash.\\" * Doc Hogg's Office ‚Äì Doc Hogg's Office is where Doc Hogg treats his patients on Bear in the Big Blue House. Bear, Tutter and Ojo visited the office when Tutter hurt his tail in \\"That Healing Feeling.\\" The office has a waiting room with toys and books to keep children entertained. * Sequoia City ‚Äì Sequoia City is a neighboring town of Woodland Valley, and Woodland Valley may be considered a suburb of it. They are known to have a baseball team called the \\"Big Bats.\\" Sequoia City is the hometown for two radio stations that reach Woodland Valley; WWTL (a news and weather station) and Bear's favorite music station WCHA-CHA. Sequoia City was one of the locations on a signpost in \\"The Great Bandini.\\" The other location names on that signpost (other than the library) have not been used again, but Sequoia City has been mentioned in other episodes. Bear and the kids of the Big Blue House went on vacation at a nice hotel in Sequoia City in \\"This Is Your Life, Bear.\\" * River City ‚Äì River City is a town mentioned on Bear in the Big Blue House. Not much is known about it, but Grandma Flutter was an all- star player for their baseball team: the River City Rodents. Cancellation Bear in the Big Blue House was initially produced from 1997 to 2003. The sudden death of Lynne Thigpen, who voiced 'Luna' the moon, led to production being put on hiatus for three years, along with a planned film. In 2005, two years after Thigpen's death, Tara Mooney, who voiced Shadow, told Irish radio station Today FM that \\"the crew's hearts just weren't in it anymore\\". After the hiatus and the spin-off Breakfast with Bear, a final run of new episodes aired on the Disney Channel in April 2006, with the very last episode airing on April 28, 2006. Repeats of the show ceased altogether in May 2007 (December 2010 in the UK). Thigpen was posthumously nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for voicing Luna the moon in Bear in the Big Blue House, but lost to Jeff Corwin.

The mountain range is located in Damnak Chang'eaur District of Kep Province, near the border with Kampot Province. This relatively isolated range became notorious as a battleground during the Cambodian Civil War, when it was a base for communist insurgent forces and the target of significant bombing by B-52s and other air strikes. The main north south railway line between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville runs along the base of the mountain. National road 33 between Kampong Trach and Kampot also runs nearby. However, there are few roads or paths within the mountains and only two permanent communities: Chamkar Bei and Rones villages.  History  Between 1975 and 1979, the area around Phnom Voar was the site of several killing fields and two prisons run by the Santebal ‚Äì the secret police of the Democratic Kampuchea regime. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Phnom Voar became one of the southern rebel bases for the remaining Democratic Kampuchea forces and on July 26, 1994, Phnom Voar rose to international attention as the site of a Khmer Rouge attack on a Cambodian train that resulted in the deaths of at least 8 people (three government soldiers, at least four Khmer Rouge and one civilian passenger)Reuters, 1994-08-01 and led to the mass-kidnapping of more than 100 hostages (including at least two Cambodians, three Vietnamese, and three westerners, all of whom were later killed).Amnesty International, Amnesty International Report 1995, https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/1995/en/ The exact circumstances of the deaths of the hostages remains unclear with some reports indicating that they died perhaps as early as September, 1994 or possibly after 15 October 1994.

It was then part of the Duchy of Greater Poland of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. Powidz was a royal town of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The town repelled Teutonic attacks in 1331 and 1454, and received numerous privileges from Polish kings. From the 15th century, Powidz was the seat of local starosts. In the 15th century, a school was created in Powidz, which was subordinate to the Krak√≥w Academy (present- day Jagiellonian University), the oldest and leading university of Poland. The town suffered in the 17th century as a result of the epidemic and the Swedish invasion. In 1793, as a result of the Second Partition of Poland, it was annexed by Prussia, in 1807 it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia. Many residents took part in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising (1794), November Uprising (1830), Greater Poland uprising (1848) and January Uprising (1863), and actively opposed Germanisation attempts. In 1918 local Poles joined the Greater Poland uprising (1918‚Äì19), in an successful attempt to re-join Poland, which just regained independence. During World War II, Powidz was under German occupation from 1939 to 1945. In late 1939 the Germans expelled 80 Poles, farm owners and activists along with their families, to the so-called General Government, and their houses were handed over to German colonists as part of the Heim ins Reich policy.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, Wysiedlenia ludno≈õci polskiej z okupowanych ziem polskich w≈ÇƒÖczonych do III Rzeszy w latach 1939-1945, IPN, Warszawa, 2017, p. 173 (in Polish) A Polish Air Force base was built in Powidz after 1953.

At that time he had an address in Abingdon.The Times, 17 February 1905 p10 He gained the seat for the Liberals at the 1906 general election but lost in January 1910. However he was soon adopted as Parliamentary candidate for Southwark West. Richard Causton had been Liberal MP for the constituency from 1888 to January 1910, when he lost to Conservative candidate William Henry Dunn. When Causton announced he did not intend to fight again Strauss replaced him and won the seat back from Dunn by the narrow margin of 18 votes, after a recount.The Times, 7 December 1910 p10 At the time of this victory, Strauss was described as a hop merchant in Southwark who took a prominent interest in the work of the Hops Committee (a Parliamentary Select Committee which considered questions relating to hop growing, production and consumption).The Times, 11 July 1908 p14 He was acknowledged as an authority on agricultural questions. and was particularly interested in the plight of smallholders and the promotion of their rights.The Times, 8 January 1910 p8 & 5 June 1911 p12 =1910‚Äì1918= In 1916, Strauss was a member of a deputation to the War Minister, Lord Kitchener to press for better defences against air raids on London.The Times, 28 January 1916 p8 Strauss‚Äô West Southwark constituency was abolished for the 1918 general election and he stood instead for the new seat of Southwark North.

Harrington agreed on the understanding that he was to be regarded as completely independent of party. Harrington had previously been a member of the recently formed right-wing National Party. Also standing against Strauss was George Isaacs for the Labour Party and Mr J J Gebbett, a representative of the National Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors or the Silver Badge Party,The Times, 12 December 1918 p9 an organisation which was later subsumed into the Royal British Legion. Strauss held the seat with a majority of 2,071 votes over Harrington with Isaacs third and Gebbett at the foot of the poll.The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004 p22 =1922‚Äì1924= Strauss stood at the 1922 general election as a Lloyd George National Liberal. He was opposed in a straight fight with Labour by Dr Leslie Haden-Guest, the secretary and doctor to the former Labour delegation to Soviet Russia in 1920 and a London County Councillor. The election took place against the backdrop of a set of poor local election results for Labour just two weeks before, when Labour lost all their councillors in Southwark.The Times, 3 November 1922 p15 Strauss held his seat with a majority of 1,112.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Elections Results 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p49 In 1923 Strauss, now described as a plain Liberal without prefix of suffix, again faced a straight fight against Labour's Leslie Haden- Guest. This time, despite the reunion of the Lloyd George and Asquithian Liberals, and the gains the Liberal Party made overall, Strauss was beaten, albeit by the narrow margin of 362 votes.The Times, 7 December 1923 p6 At the 1924 general election Strauss tried to win his seat back, this time in a three-cornered contest with Haden-Guest and Mr J J Llewellin for the Conservatives. Despite what was reported as a strenuous effort to regain his seat, Strauss lost by 1,030 votes, the intervention of the Unionist (who polled 3,305 votes) probably helping to deprive him of victory.The Times, 18 October 1924 p6 =By-election, 1927= Strauss was handed an unusual opportunity to re-enter Parliament in 1927 when Haden-Guest resigned from the Parliamentary Labour Party in protest against the party's opposition to government policy in China, which he believed placed British nationals in Shanghai at risk and was tantamount to an intervention in the Chinese Civil War. Haden-Guest then chose to resign also from Parliament and cause a by- election in which he sought re-election. He obtained the support of the local Conservative Party in Southwark but stood as an Independent Constitutionalist. He was opposed by Strauss for the Liberals and George Isaacs for Labour. Haden-Guest may not have anticipated the Liberal intervention in the by- election which he wanted to contest as a straight fight between a socialist and an anti-socialist candidate. He had envisaged his by-election as a chance to ask working class voters in particular to choose his brand of ‚Äòpatriotism‚Äô over the attitude of the Labour Party.The Times, 29 March 1927 p14 In the event, Strauss profited from the split in the socialist voteJohn Campbell, Lloyd George: The Goat in the Wilderness, 1922‚Äì1931; Cape, 1977 p162 gained the seat with a majority of 1,167 over Isaacs with Haden-Guest in third place with less than 20% of the poll. =1929= At the 1929 general election Strauss again faced George Isaacs as his Labour opponent, as well as a Conservative, Marcus Samuel. The election contest was obviously a bitter one as Strauss announced he was cancelling all his public meetings which he claimed were being systematically disrupted and speakers being howled down by Labour Party supporters.The Times, 28 May 1929 p9 This time Isaacs won the seat, by the narrow margin of 432 votes ‚Äì the intervention of the Conservative candidate again splitting the anti-Labour vote. =Liberal National= In 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by prime minister Ramsay MacDonald supported by a small number of National Labour MPs and initially backed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However most Liberals had concerns about supporting the National coalition over the long run because of the government's commitment to protectionism and tariffs in opposition to the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade. Despite these worries, the Liberal Party led by Sir Herbert Samuel agreed to go into the 1931 general election supporting the government. As a result, Strauss found himself the representative of the coalition against Labour in Southwark North at the election, Marcus Samuel having agreed to stand aside.The Times, 9 October 1931 p14 This time, with no Conservative to split the anti-Labour vote and the great popularity of the National Government as a result of the economic crisis, Strauss won back the seat in a straight fight with Isaacs by a majority of 5,992 taking 65% of the poll. As the initial crisis passed, the Liberal Party became increasingly anxious about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by Sir John Simon who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to give more open support to MacDonald's administration. Strauss was not one of the original members of this group but by 1932 he had become identified with it.The Times, 21 March 1932 p14 By October 1932, Strauss was writing openly to Herbert Samuel expressing the view that the Liberal Party could not be revived by adopting the slogan ‚ÄòBack to Free Trade‚Äô and that this policy was only one of a number of important issues which needed the government action.The Times, 6 October 1932 p7 Even though he was by now 73 years of age, Strauss again stood for re-election in Southwark North as a Liberal National at the 1935 general election. Having been deprived of the seat by small majorities in the past, Strauss was this time the lucky one, squeaking home in another straight fight with Isaacs by just 79 votes.The Times, 16 November 1935 p18 However his age and state of health told upon him and he decided to step down from Parliament at the next general election, though in fact he died before that election was held.The Times, 16 March 1939 p13 =Other public offices= Strauss served as a Justice of the Peace for the counties of London and Berkshire. He was also appointed a Freeman and Liveryman of the City of LondonThe Times House of Commons 1919; Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004, p22 and Warden of the Worshipful Company of Gardeners.The Times, 11 July 1910 p12 In 1925, Strauss was nominated as Sheriff of Berkshire.The Times, 13 November 1925 p22 Election promises court case In a case which, potentially, could have had far-reaching consequences for all democratically elected representatives, Strauss found himself in court in 1913 when one of his constituents, a Mr Arthur Macgillicuddy, brought an action against him to recover damages for alleged breach of contract, i.e. that Strauss had failed to carry out the promises on which he had been elected an MP. Mr Macgillicuddy, who conducted his own case, said he was seeking costs to cover his expenses (e.g. correspondence and printing) in bringing to Strauss‚Äô attention his failure to carry out his election pledges. However Judge Granger ruled that Macgillicuddy had no evidence of a contract or formal agreement with Strauss which Strauss could be found to have breachedThe Times, 20 May 1913 p3 and no doubt politicians everywhere breathed a sigh of relief. Financial troubles Towards the end of his life, Strauss experienced financial difficulties because of the collapse of the grain and seed companies with which he was associated. Huge debts had been built up and the businesses were subject to compulsory liquidation. The problems had been caused by an accumulation of factors including default by debtors due to the fall in the market price of grain, government interference with the companies‚Äô trade with the US, cash-flow difficulties and bad decision making in management.The Times, 30 August 1935 p21 While Strauss sought to distance himself from responsibility for these failures saying he had not been personally involved in the day-to-day affairs of the companies for many years, he was nevertheless brought low financially by it. His property and its contents at Kingston Bagpuize, in Berkshire where he had planted hop gardens and erected modern kilns producing high-class hopsJournal of the Institute of Brewing; Institute of Brewing, 1939 p426 had to be sold off to raise funds by the liquidatorsThe Times, 1 June 1935 p10 as did commercial properties in London.The Times, 15 June 1935 p24 In the 1935 general election campaign, Strauss had to issue a statement explaining his financial misfortunes and conceding that he was now ‚Äòan impoverished man‚Äô.The Times, 1 November 1935 p10 Death By late 1938, now in his late seventies and with deteriorating health, Strauss was obliged to enter a nursing home. He remained there for several months eventually dying on 25 March 1939.The Times, 27 March 1939, p14 By-election in North Southwark In the by-election for North Southwark, in the vacancy caused by Strauss‚Äô death, George Isaacs again took up the cudgels on behalf of the Labour Party, gaining the seat from the Liberal Nationals in a straight fight with Captain A H Henderson-Livesey by a majority of 1,493 votes.The Times, 18 May 1939 p16 References  External links  * 1862 births 1939 deaths Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies National Liberal Party (UK, 1922) politicians UK MPs 1906‚Äì1910 UK MPs 1910‚Äì1918 UK MPs 1918‚Äì1922 UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 UK MPs 1924‚Äì1929 UK MPs 1931‚Äì1935 People from Highbury People from Southwark People from Abingdon-on-Thames Politics of London Politics of the London Borough of Southwark Politics of Berkshire Alumni of King's College London People from Vale of White Horse (district) Jewish British politicians ","title":"Edward Strauss"},{"id":"21120073","text":"Meszna is a village in the administrative district of Gmina S≈Çupca, within S≈Çupca County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

In early 1785, King Bodawpaya of Konbaung dynasty sent an expedition force to take Jung Ceylon (Phuket) to prevent foreign arms shipments to Siam but the invasion force was driven back. In October 1785, Bodawpaya pursued an ambitious campaign to expand his dominions into the lands of the former Ayutthaya Kingdom. He launched a four-pronged invasion towards Chiang Mai, Tak, Kanchanaburi, and Jung Ceylon. The combined strength was about 50,000 men. The invasion forces faced heavy resistance from the Siamese forces and finally the war became a total disaster for Burma. The failed invasion ultimately turned out to be the last full-scale invasion of Siam by Burma. Invasion (1785) =Northern theatre= In mid-October 1785, King Bodawpaya armies attacked Lanna in northern Siam, where Kawila, Prince of Lampang, put up a brave fight and delayed the Burmese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When Phitsanulok was captured, Anurak Devesh of the Rear Palace, and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Burmese siege. =Southern theatre= In the south, Bodawpaya lay waiting at Chedi Sam Ong. The Front Palace (Maha Sura Singhanat) led his troops to the south the counter-attack the Burmese that came from Ranong through Nakhon Si Thammarat. The engagements occurred at Kanchanaburi. The Burmese also attacked Jung Ceylon (Phuket), where the governor had just died. Chan, wife of the governor, and her sister Mook gathered people to defend Mueang Thalang against the Burmese, after Francis Light, a British East India Company captain passing by the island. Light went ashore to warn of an impending invasion. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as the two heroines, Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon. The Burmese captured Songkhla. Upon hearing the news, the governors of Phatthalung Province fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha headed a force of villagers against the Burmese. His campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to Phraya Thukkharat by Rama I. =Retreat= Aside from the Burmese northern army which took Chiang Mai and swept down to Lampang, the Burmese southern armies were driven back, and in one case, nearly annihilated. All of the Burmese invasion armies withdrew in disarray in late-January 1786. Tha Din Daeng campaign (1786) King Bodawpaya renewed attacks in early 1786. This time, he didn‚Äôt divide his troops but instead formed into single army. Bodawpaya passed through the Chedi Sam Ong and settled in Tha Din Daeng. Maha Sura Singhanat marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called ‚ÄúTha Din Daeng campaign‚Äù. The campaign is commemorated by a park established by the Royal Thai Army from the town of Kanchanaburi.

The dynasty of Al Busaid (Al Busaidi) traces its roots to the tribe of Zahran (a branch of the Azd tribe) through a patrilineal ancestor, al-'Atik al-Asad b. Imran, who settled in Dibba (Dab√°), hence the band was also known as the \\"Azd of Daba\\". Like other Qahtani, the Azd originally hailed from Yemen and migrated north after the destruction of the Marib Dam. With the rise of Islam, the Azd established themselves into a leading force in the ensuing Muslim conquests and later in the realms of the Umayyad Caliphate through the celebrated general Al Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah (Abu Said), the progenitor of the Al Busaid tribe. Significantly, it is with the Azd that most early sections of pre-Islamic universal chronicles of Arabs begin. Rise to power Ahmad bin Said Al Busaidi, a shrewd military tactician, was the governor of Sohar when a Persian fleet attacked the town. He held out for nine months, finally forcing the Persian commander of Nader Shah's army to come to terms and leave the country altogether within a few years. He was elected imam in 1744, marking the last time Oman was occupied by foreign parties and the beginning of a new unified state. It was also the start of a dynasty that has lasted to the present day, making it one of the oldest surviving royal dynasties in Arabia and the first to gain independence. His descendants did not take the religious title of Imam, but Sayyid, an honorific title held by members of the royal family to this day, thus relinquishing all pretense of spiritual authority while fostering Muslim scholars and promoting Islamic scholarship. Trade flourished during Ahmed's thirty-nine-year reign and the Omani navy developed into a formidable force in the Indian Ocean second only to Great Britain and capable of purging Persians forces from the entire region and protecting Ottoman vessels in the Gulf of Oman, Indian Ocean and the Pirate Coast of Trucial Oman. When he died in 1778, the ulema replaced Ahmed with his son, Said bin Ahmed, who was very religious but shrank from administrative duties. Since the tenets of Ibadhism allowed for the division of duties between leaders along religious, administrative and military lines, he removed himself to Rustaq until his death in 1811. His son Hamad bin Said moved the capital from the interior city of Rustaq to the coastal Muscat in 1783 and took the title of sultan, implying purely coercive power. He was a capable leader for eight years and facilitated reform policy in the initial stages of the transition but died suddenly in 1792 of smallpox. =Alliance with the British Empire= Sultan bin Ahmed assumed control of the government after the death of his nephew and strengthened the already powerful fleet by adding numerous gunships and sleek cargo vessels. He also needed a strong ally to help him regain control of Mombasa from the Mazrui clan, fight off the movement spreading from what is now Saudi Arabia and to keep the Qasimi tribes from the Persian city of Lingeh out of Oman. He found this able ally in Great Britain, who by this time was a powerful maritime nation with an empire expanding all over the world. In the late 18th century, the second British Empire was at war with France and knew that the French emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, was planning to march through Persia and capture Muscat on his way to invade India. In 1798 Britain and Oman agreed a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Sultan bin Ahmed pledged himself to British interests in India, and his territories became out of bounds to the French. He allowed the British East India Company to establish the first trading station in the Persian Gulf, and a British consul was posted to Muscat. As well as defeating Bonaparte, the British had another motive for the treaty with Oman: they wanted to put pressure on the sultan to end slavery, which had been declared illegal in England in 1772. At this time, the trade from Africa to Oman was still buoyant, and Zanzibar's position as an important trade centre was bolstered further when the supply of ivory from Mozambique to India collapsed because of excessive Portuguese export duties. The traders simply shipped their ivory through Zanzibar instead. Omani warships were in constant skirmishes up and down the gulf, which kept the sultan preoccupied. It was in the course of one of his sorties during an incursion abroad a ship in the Persian Gulf in 1804 that Sultan Sayyid was shot in the head by a stray bullet, he was buried in Lingeh. =Said bin Sultan (Said the Great)= The death of Sultan bin Ahmed sent the country into a state of shock and inter-family rivalries. Dissident tribes and outside agitators who all conspired to make the role of supreme commander a speculative proposition at best. Sultan's eldest son Said was merely thirteen, too young to take the reins of his country, \\"so the elders called upon another nephew Badr bin Saif to act as regent in the boy's behalf until he came of age.\\" The decision to enlist Badr was unfortunately a bad one, as he had political aspirations of his own. The royal house turned against him but he refused to relinquish his hold of power without a struggle. Said, now sixteen, conspired to have him assassinated. On a pretext to inspect the munitions at Nakhal Fort, Badr went to Barka and met Said at Bait al Nu'man castle. There he was killed in a dramatic duel to the death with daggers. A wounded Badr escaped but was finished off by Said's horsemen. Said immediately assumed the government and held it until his death fifty-two years later. He announced to the British that he had assumed power, but they were slow to respond. They acknowledged the young monarch a year later when they realized that their fortunes were best served by courting him. During the reign of the renowned Sultan Said bin Sultan, the progenitor of the Al Busaidi dynasty, he took Oman to its zenith as a commercial and political maritime power: extending its borders to include Mombasa and parts of the east African coast, Zanzibar, Pemba Island, Mafia Island, Lamu Archipelago, Cape Delgado (northern border of the current Mozambique), Bandar-Abbas and the southern Iranian coast, Gwadar province of Balochistan (bought by Pakistan in 1958) and, for a short time Bahrain. He was counted among the best leaders as his reputation spread to the crown heads of Europe and became known as Said the Great. Few Arab leaders of any time were as well known and respected as Sheikh Said. Trade flourished and Muscat became a key market for the Persian Gulf. The celebrated explorer Richard Francis Burton called him \\"as shrewd, liberal and enlightened a prince as Arabia has ever produced,\\" and an Italian physician who served him for a time said: \\"His constant love of justice, and distinguished clemency, the effects of which are felt, not only by his own subjects, but even by his domestic slaves.\\" In 1832, he made the island of Zanzibar his second capital and set about establishing what is present-day Stone Town. A merchant prince and capable warrior, he spent much of his time at sea depending on mercantile and maritime resources for his power in both Oman and Zanzibar. Recognizing the suitability of Zanzibar climate and soil, he initiated large scale cultivation of cloves (an essential meat preservative in Europe prior to the advent of refrigeration) and soon after sought slaves as cheap labor to plant and harvest the biennial crop. He is also noted for revitalizing the production of rice and sugar cane as well as the export of ivory and gum copal. Such was his enterprise and commercial skill that it could probably be said that he established the first international market on the island of Zanzibar; subsequently many countries signed commercial treaties and opened consulates. He even introduced a copper coinage to amplify the existing silver coinage of Maria Theresa thalers and Spanish dollars. Treaty with the United States On 21 September 1833 a historical treaty of friendship and trade was signed with the United States of America. It was the second trade treaty formulated by the U.S. and an Arab state (Morocco being the first in 1820). The United States and Oman both stood to benefit, as the U.S. ‚Äì unlike Britain and France ‚Äì had no territorial ambitions in the Middle East and was solely interested in commerce. On 13 April 1840, the ship Al-Sultanah docked at New York, making it the first Arab envoy to ever visit the New World. Her crew of fifty-six Arab sailors caused a flurry of excitement among the three hundred thousand residents of that thriving metropolis. Al-Sultanah carried ivory, Persian rugs, spices, coffee and dates, as well as lavish gifts for President Martin Van Buren. The visit of Al-Sultanah lasted nearly four months, in which time the emissary, Ahmed Bin Na'aman Al-Kaabi (whose portrait can still be seen in the Oman and Zanzibar display of the Peabody Museum in Massachusetts) and his officers were entertained by state and city dignitaries. They received resolutions passed by official bodies, were given tours of New York City and saw sections which would, a few decades later, become colonies of Arabic-speaking immigrants. Among Bin Na'aman's hosts was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, in whose home he met Governor William H. Seward and Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson. The visit of Ahmed Bin Na'aman to America was a happy one, and when he prepared to leave, the United States completely repaired Al-Sultanah and presented him with gifts for his Sultan. End of Said's Reign Said made periodic visits to Muscat, leaving his eldest son Khalid as Governor of Zanzibar in his absence. Khalid had a predilection for French goods and named his principal country estate Marseilles, after the Mediterranean port. When Khalid died of tuberculosis in November 1854, an order came from Said in Muscat appointing another son, the 20-year-old Majid, as governor. In September 1856, Said sailed for Zanzibar on his ship Kitorie in the company of his nineteen-year-old son, Barghash bin Said. He began to suffer severe pains from an old battle wound in his thigh followed by an attack of dysentery. He died on board the ship on 19 October 1856 at the age of sixty-five. Division of Zanzibar and Oman Schisms within the ruling family were apparent after the death of Sultan Said bin Sultan, as his sons who had their own rivalries and ambitions for controlling the throne quarreled over the empire. Realizing that Majid would be unaware of their father's death, Bargash came ashore secretly and tried to take control of the palace at Mtoni and the fort in Zanzibar town, but he was unable to muster enough supporters and his attempt was thwarted. On 28 October 1856, Majid proclaimed himself Sultan of Zanzibar. A ship was sent to Oman with the news, but Said's elder son Thuwaini, who was appointed heir apparent on 23 July 1844 and had long acted as his father's Governor in Muscat and commander- in-chief of the Saidi forces, refused to acknowledge Majid and immediately tried to regain Zanzibar by force of arms. As a direct result of this struggle, the government of British India, concerned with the stability in the area, acted as arbitrator in the dispute. The Governor-General of British India, Lord Canning ruled in his arbitration that the empire was to be divided into two separate sultanates: the Sultanate of Zanzibar with its dependencies to Majid bin Said, Said's former Governor of the East African dominions, and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman to Thuwaini bin Said. On 10 March 1862, the Zanzibar Guarantee Treaty was signed in Paris by Britain and France, whereby both parties agreed to respect the independence of the Sultan of Oman and the Sultan of Zanzibar. Recognizing the economic loss caused to Oman by the severance of the Zanzibar connection, Thuwaini insisted Majid pay 40,000 Maria Theresa thalers annually as compensation but the payment fell into arrears and ceased a year later. =Recent history= State rule shifted consecutively in Zanzibar from the hands of the heirless Majid to three of his brothers until the Zanzibar revolution of 1964, led by the island's black African citizens. The revolutionaries overthrew of the last Sultan of Zanzibar, Jamshid bin Abdullah. Zanzibar became a Marxist republic overnight, the clove industry was nationalised and the Sultan's Hospital was consequently renamed the Vladmir Illych Lenin Hospital (now known by the politically neutral name of the Coconut Palm Infirmary). Jamshid and his family fled to England in 1964 and settled into exile in a modest home in Portsmouth, England. He was pardoned by Zanzibar President Salmin Amour on the 46th anniversary of the 1964 uprising and declared free to return as an ordinary Zanzibari citizen, but remains barred from settling in Oman. In 1868, the royal house in Oman took a brief turn through a distant line of the family when Imam Azzan bin Qais started rebelling against Thuwaini bin Said with the help and encouragement of the Wahhabis in 1864. Azzan eventually managed to expel Thuwaini's eldest son Salim bin Thuwaini, seizing power in October 1868. Under Azzan, the country briefly reverted to being an imamate, rather than a sultanate. Although he was accepted by a significant portion of the Al Hinai tribe, his subsequent attempts to subdue the interior alienated the Ghafiri tribe, who in 1870 instigated a general revolt led by Salim's uncle Sayyid Turki bin Said. Turki contrived to keep the office within the immediate family and re-establish his father's sultanate; having secured the political and financial backing of the British, he managed to execute Azzan, bringing the revolt to a successful end in January 1871. Succession continued through his great-grandson, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who rose to power by overthrowing his father, Said bin Taimur, in a palace coup in 1970. Qaboos died on 10 January 2020 after 50 years in power. He was replaced by his cousin, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, after a letter, written by Qaboos himself, designated Haitham as his chosen successor. Honorific titles In Oman, Sayyid is a title used by some members of the House of Al Busaid dynasty . The absolute ruler of the country retains the title Sultan with members of the royal family eligible for succession to the throne given the title Sheikh, and these may also use the title Sayyid should they wish to. However, the title Sheikh supersedes Sayyid, so it is not a widely used practice. Members of the extended family or members by marriage carry the title Sayyid or Sayyida for a female. Such titles are hereditary through paternal lineage or in some exceptional circumstances may be given as an honorary title by royal decree.

The fire started at 04:15 on 10 October 1956, and quickly the entire depot was ablaze. The fire department was not alerted until 04:23, and little could be done to save the trams or the depot. One tram and trailer survived from within the fire-proof paint shop. Trondheim Sporvei had never discarded its old trams, that were stored at Voldsminde Depot, and eleven old trams were in service within the day. In addition, eight buses were borrowed from Oslo within the week. Damage was at NOK 9 million, of which 8 million was for the rolling stock. A proposal to replace the tramway with trolleybus was discarded by the city council. The depot was rebuilt, and 28 new Class 7 trams were ordered, in addition to 15 trailers from Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and H√∏nefoss Karosserifabrikk, respectively. The bogies and motors were salvaged, and reused on the new trams.  The fire  During the night of 10 October 1956, two mechanics and eight cleaners were working at depot 2. At 04:03, one of the cleaners noticed smoke, and shouted to the mechanics that they should turn off the overhead current. The current was kept on and the pantographs kept up so it would be easy to get out of the trams in case of a fire. All the workers were in the annex, while the fire had started in the main wing. Two of the trams at the back were ablaze. One of the mechanics ran to turn off the power, while the other went to phone the fire department. Based on the requirements of the insurance policy, the depot was always to be manned, and in case of a fire trams were to be driven out. At this point in time such actions would still have been possible, but were not done due to the confusion. Both the mechanics and five of the cleaners succeeded in evacuating from the building before a gas tank exploded, killing the last three women in an inferno. The three deceased were Sigrid Dahl (45), Inger Skj√¶rli (41) and Harriet Skoglund (57).Kjenstad, 2005: 174‚Äì75 Just as the inferno occurred, an engineer from the Norwegian Institute of Technology passed by. He asked the mechanics if they had contacted the fire department, but he thought they were acting as if in shock, and ran the home to call the department himself. When he placed the call at 04:23, it was the first message of the fire that reached the fire department. At the same time, the chief mechanic came from his nearby apartment to drive out trams, but it was too late. When the fire department arrived, the main wing's roof was ablaze. Smoke divers were used to try to locate the three people who had not escaped. Half an hour later the whole main wing roof collapsed. The rest of the firemen's efforts were concentrated on rescuing the workshop at the end of the building, which had fire-proof gates. The fire was the largest in Trondheim since World War II.Kjenstad, 2005: 175  Material casualty  The Dalsenget Depot was used for the operative stock, while the Voldsminde Depot was used for reserve stock. Of the 46 trams, 26 were located at Dalsenget. This included all the sixteen brand-new Class 6 trams. Nineteen trams not located at Dalsenget were saved. Of the twenty trailers, sixteen were burned, while four were saved. Of these, two were used Belgian trailers that needed to be configured before entering service. A track cleaning tram was also destroyed in the fire, while the one museum and one welding tram both survived.Kjenstad, 2005: 177 The building and trams were all insured. Only the roof of the depot was destroyed, and a new roof would have to be built for ; because it needed to be a costlier fire-proof solution, the insurance only covered NOK 663.000.Kjenstad, 2005: 186 In addition, a fire- proof gate would be constructed between the main wing and the annex of the building.Kjenstad, 2005: 189 The company was paid NOK 8 million in insurance for the lost rolling stock.Kjenstad, 2005: 187  Troubled operations  At the other depot, at Voldsminde, the company had a fleet of 19 trams and four trailers. During the night and morning, these were immediately taken into service. Some were not in proper operating condition, having been untouched since 1951, while others had only been there a year. In the course of the day, eleven of the trams were made available for operation. One of the Class 5 bogie trams that was still in regular service had survived because it had overnighted in the other depot. All the ten Class 2 and seven of the Class 3 trams could be put into service in the course of a few days. Behind the fire- proof doors at the paint shop at Dalsenget was a single Class 4 tram with a trailer that had survived the fire.Kjenstad, 2005: 175‚Äì78 Trondheim Sporvei contacted Oslo Sporveier and Bergen Sporvei to organize renting buses. Since Trondheim used a different gauge than Oslo and Bergen, it was not possible to borrow any trams. The company did not ask to borrow buses from the other bus companies in town, nor trams from the other tram company, Graakalbanen, who operated trams that ran on part of the track of the city tramway. Eight buses were sent from Oslo, and arrived on 14 October by train. The buses would run in between the remaining trams to create a five-minute headway on all three routes. The buses were introduced on 16 October. Only long and a lot smaller than the trams, the H√∏ka/Leyland buses had seating for 22 or 34Kjenstad, 2005: 178‚Äì80 It was not until 14 November that the company was ready to get the two Belgian trailers into service. They needed to be rebuilt, but the company only had a single tram, the Class 4 (nicknamed the Happy Widow), that had enough power to haul the large trailers. All the old trams were smaller than those that had burned up, and they had wooden, instead of leather, seats. With less trams and lower comfort, ridership dropped 22% the following year. To compensate, the ticket price was increased from NOK 0.30 to 0.40 for adults, and from 0.15 to 0.20 for children.Kjenstad, 2005: 180‚Äì81 The bus operation was not profitable, and suffered a loss of NOK 123,000 until it was terminated on 1 July 1957. The headway had been down to eight minutes due to lack of stock, but by the fall of 1957, the company increased it to seven minutes again.Kjenstad, 2005: 197‚Äì98  New stock  Immediately after the fire had occurred, some politicians launched the idea of instead investing in a trolleybus system. Similar replacements had been done in Bergen and Oslo. Director Fredrik Kleven of Trondheim Sporvei calculated that this suggestion would cost NOK 1.5 million more per year, that operation of trams. 40 more people would be needed, because more buses would be needed due to their lower capacity. Also, the centenary would have to be rebuilt, the tracks removed, and trolleybuses had only a 15-year life expectancy compared to the 35 years of a tram. Buses would have to run more frequently, and could clog up the city streets.Kjenstad, 2005: 185 Kleven recommended that there be ordered 28 trams and 17 trailers, but this was later reduced by two trailers. Costs could be reduced since the bogies, motors, transformers and compressors from the fire could be salvaged, and reused by the new trams. Final decision would be taken by the city council, since Trondheim Sporvei was a municipal agency. The chief of administration recommended 24 October that only the 8 million from the insurance be used for new stock, but also said that NOK 4 million could be borrowed. On 1 November, the city council voted in favor of the suggestion, giving the tram company's board freedom to strike the deal.Kjenstad, 2005: 186‚Äì88 An invitation to a tender was sent to Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and H√∏nefoss Karosserifabrikk (H√∏ka) for fifteen chassis and bogies; the bid was won by Str√∏mmen. The remaining ten trailers were offered to Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and H√∏ka; the latter had the cheapest deal and won.Kjenstad, 2005: 189‚Äì90 Delivery started from Str√∏mmen on 27 April 1957.

Her career peaked with good performances in the 2002‚Äì03 World Cup, but she never succeeded in the Olympic Games, and spent most of her career in the shadow of Kari Traa. Background Ingrid Berntsen hails from Filtvet, and is the younger sister of skier Hedda Berntsen. She made her international debut in December 1995, in a European Cup race in S√∂lden when she finished among the top three before the season was over, with a third place in Altenmarkt-Zauchensee in January 1996. Career In February in La Clusaz she made her World Cup debut. She continued racing in both cups, and in March 1997 she finished among the World Cup top fifteen for the first time, with a 14th place at Hundfj√§llet. She then missed the 1997‚Äì98 season. She returned in early 1999, and her first placement among the top 10 came in January 1999, with a fourth place in the dual moguls race in Whistler Blackcomb. In the World Championships staged in Meiringen-Hasliberg in March the same year, she finished 20th in moguls and ninth in dual moguls. In the 1999‚Äì00 season, Berntsen finished five times among the top 10; with three ninth places in dual moguls and two 10th places in moguls. In January 2001 she finished with a career best seventh place in the moguls competition in Deer Valley. In the World Championships staged in Whistler later that month, she only finished 21st in moguls and 17th in dual moguls. In January 2002, she again opened her season by recording a career best placement, finishing fourth in the moguls competition in Tignes. In March she finally won her first World Cup event, a dual moguls race in Madarao. Ingrid Berntsen was scheduled to compete in freestyle skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics, while her sister Hedda was a candidate for the alpine skiing team. By competing in different sports at the same Olympic Games, the sisters were historic in a Norwegian context. Ingrid entered the moguls event, but did not reach the final, finishing 17th. Countryfellow Kari Traa won the race. Berntsen continued her career with better performances in the 2002‚Äì03 season. She finished second in her third race of the season, in Madonna di Campiglio in December, and followed with another second place in Ruka the next week. Before the season was over, she had finished among the top five an additional seven times. In the World Championships staged in Deer Valley in February, she finished fifth in moguls and fourth in dual moguls. She then ended the season with a second place in a skicross World Cup race. However, due to injuries she did not retain her form, came the 2003‚Äì04 season. She performed consistently, but mostly finished in the range between 10 and 20. She then missed the entire 2004‚Äì05 season due to injury. The plans she harbored to compete more in skicross were effectively ruined. Berntsen returned in the 2005‚Äì06 season, the goal of the season being the 2006 Winter Olympics. Having recorded two sixth places as her season's best, she entered the Olympic moguls race and finished 19th. She rounded off the season with three decent World Cup competitions in the moguls, as well as a third place in halfpipe. In the 2006‚Äì07 season she recorded four top-five placements, in both moguls, dual moguls and halfpipe. In the World Championships staged in Madonna di Campiglio in March 2007, she finished 10th in moguls and 12th in dual moguls. This was her last international competition. In 2008, her sister Hedda, having retired as an alpine skier in 2003, successfully took up skicross.

They are known from fossils dating to the Upper Paleocene through the Middle Eocene of North America and Europe, with possible Late Cretaceous representatives.A lithornithid (Aves: Palaeognathae) from the Paleocene (Tiffanian) of southern California All are extinct today; the youngest specimen is the currently unnamed SGPIMH MEV1 specimen from the mid-Eocene Messel Pit site. Lithornithids had long, slender, bills for probing. They closely resembled modern tinamous. They possessed a rhynchokinetic skull with relatively unfused cranial bones, a weakly fused pygostyle and a splenial. The unguals were more curved than in tinamous and probably allowed better perching in trees. The order Lithornithiformes was erected by Dr. Peter Houde in 1988. Initially, only three genera (Lithornis, Paracathartes, and Pseudocrypturus) and eight named species were included. Promusophaga (Harrison & Walker, 1977) originally considered a stem-turaco, is considered synonymous with Lithornis vulturinus. Fissuravis may also belong to the clade,Gerald Mayr, Paleogene Fossil Birds and several unnamed remains are known.

Some studies recover them as a paraphyletic assemblage leading to modern paleognaths, but more recent examinations group them in a single, natural group basal to the rest of Palaeognathae.Nesbitt, Sterling J.; Clarke, Julia A., The anatomy and taxonomy of the exquisitely preserved Green River Formation (early Eocene) lithornithids (Aves) and the relationships of Lithornithidae. (Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, no. 406), 2016-06-30 Of issue is Paracathartes, which differs radically from other lithornithids and has been suggested to more closely related to extant paleognaths,Houde, Peter W. (1988). \\"Paleognathous Birds from the Early Tertiary of the Northern Hemisphere\\". Publications of the Nuttall Ornithological Club (Cambridge, MA) though it is recently recovered as a derived lithornithid. Lithornis itself may be paraphyletic in relation to Paracathartes and Pseudocrypturus. Paleobiology In a study about ratite endocasts, Lithornis ranks among the taxa with well developed olfactory lobes. This is consistent with a nocturnal, forest-dwelling lifestyle, though as much all volant birds it retains large optical lobes. Unlike modern tinamous, at least Lithornis has toe claws and reversed halluxes that allow for efficient perching. Several egg fossils have been attributed to lithornithid birds. Both Lithornis and Paracathartes have entire nests assigned to them.Houde, Peter W. (1988). \\"Paleognathous Birds from the Early Tertiary of the Northern Hemisphere\\". Publications of the Nuttall Ornithological Club (Cambridge, MA) 22. Their eggshells are, perhaps unsurprisingly, noted as being \\"ratite-like\\". Studies on lithornithid feathers shows that some species had gloss similar to that of cassowaries.

Top: the laser fires at t=0 forming a fast \\"red\\" ion and slow \\"blue\\" ion of the same m/z, Middle: the red ion takes the lead since it has a greater velocity (and kinetic energy) but since it is farther from the acceleration plate at voltage +V, it gains less energy than the blue ion. Bottom: The blue ion has gained sufficient energy such that it arrives at the detector at the same time as the red ion. Delayed extraction is a method used with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer in which the accelerating voltage is applied after some short time delay following pulsed laser desorption/ionization from a flat surface of target plate or, in other implementation, pulsed electron ionization or Resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization in some narrow space between two plates of the ion extraction system. The extraction delay can produce time-of-flight compensation for ion energy spread and improve mass resolution.  Implementation  Resolution can be improved in time-of-flight mass spectrometer with ions produced at high vacuum conditions (better than few microTorr) by allowing the initial packet ions to spread in space due to their translational energy before being accelerated into the flight tube. With ions produced by electron ionization or laser ionization of atoms or molecules from a rarefied gas, this is referred to as \\"time-lag focusing\\".

Ions produced with greater kinetic energy have a higher velocity and during the delay time move closer to the extraction electrode before the accelerating voltage is applied across the target or pulsed electrode. The slower ions with less kinetic energy stay closer to a surface of the target electrode or pulsed electrode when the accelerating voltage is applied and therefore start being accelerated at a greater potential compared to the ions farther from the target electrode. With the proper delay time, the slower ions will receive enough extra potential energy to catch the faster ions after flying some distance from the pulsed acceleration system. Ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will then drift through the flight tube to the detector in the same time.

Swirski is the author of twelve books of American literature and culture, Stanislaw Lem, and theory of knowledge. Having gone through several printings, the book is by now a staple in American popular culture studies. It furnishes a series of analyses of the relation of popular fiction to high literary culture. In his work, Swirski challenges the highbrow vs lowbrow categorization of literary culture, and popular culture in general by focusing attention on what he terms the nobrow taste culture, whereby \\"authors simultaneously target both extremes of the literary spectrum\\". In the first half of the book, Swirski details the historical facts behind the functioning of popular fiction, and discusses the concept of genres and the nobrow aesthetics. He does this by tracing the socio-historical development of the book publishing industry and scouring the publishing statistical data from sources such as UNESCO and the American Book Industry Study Group. Supported by statistics, illustrations, and case studies, the author asks for a more serious examination of popular literature. Because of its mass appeal, critics and academics are quick to conclude that popular literature is lowbrow art. Swirski asserts that in fact some of the best works in the twentieth century come from authors who refuse to succumb to either the highbrow/academic literary formulae, or to the formulaic popular genres sold at the \\"bestseller- and-moccacino\\" bookstore chains. He demonstrates his arguments in the second half of the book by analyzing three \\"nobrow\\" works: Karel ƒåapek's War With the Newts (1936), Raymond Chandler's Playback (1958), and Stanislaw Lem's The Chain of Chance (1976). All three, and many others mentioned and discussed in this book, are exemplary of the nobrow cultural formation which spans the twentieth century.

Archaeological evidence shows that Ein Avdat was inhabited by Nabateans and Catholic monks. Numerous springs at the southern opening of the canyon empty into deep pools in a series of waterfalls. The water emerges from the rock layers with salt-tolerant plants like Poplar trees and Atriplexes growing nearby. Etymology Ein () is Arabic for spring or water source. Avdat () derives from the nearby city of Avdat that stood south of the canyon. Avdat was named after the Nabataean King Obodas I who, according to tradition, was buried there. History =Prehistoric era= Habitation during the prehistoric era is attested to by numerous flint artifacts found in the area believed to be 80,000‚Äì90,000 years old and part of Mousterian culture. The flint in the outcrops nearby was utilized for arrows and points. Ostrich egg shells and onager bones shed light on the fauna of the time. Man- made knives and other hand held implements date from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods. Remains of a small settlement consisting of several round structures dates from the Bronze Age. =Antiquity= During the Hellenistic period Avdat became a station along the Nabatean Incense Route, an ancient trading route from Egypt to India through the Arabian Peninsula. Agriculture developed during the early Roman era. Forts along the Incense Route developed into thriving cities with many public buildings and farms. In the Byzantine period, Ein Avdat was inhabited by monks who lived in caves. They carved out closets, shelves, benches, stairs, and water systems, and decorated the walls of the caves with crosses and prayers. UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization recognizes Avdat as a Heritage Site in part because of the uniqueness of the magnificent Byzantine Church. Dating from the third century, it is both one of the earliest and one of the best- preserved churches constructed before the recognition of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine. The church was badly damaged by Bedouin vandals in 2009. After the Muslim conquest of Palestine, the region was abandoned. =Modern era= After the establishment of Kibbutz Sde Boker in 1952 and the construction of Highway 40 to Eilat, a hiking trail was created. Ein Avdat has been designated a National Park of Israel. Geography View of Ein Avdat taken near Midreshet Ben-Gurion. The canyon of Ein Avdat is part of Nahal Zin, the largest Wadi or dry riverbed in the Negev. The 120 kilometer-long riverbed begins at the northwestern tip of Makhtesh Ramon and heads north before veering sharply eastwards. Ein Avdat was created by erosion. =Springs= Ein Avdat pools. The southernmost spring is Ein Ma'arif, featuring a series of waterfalls and pools. A Byzantine fortress overlooks the spring and adjacent agricultural land. Further north is Ein Avdat, a 15-meter high waterfall that flows into an 8-meter deep pool of water divided by a small artificial dam. Located near the northern entrance of the park is a spring called Ein Mor, named for the spice myrrh. Growing around the springs are Poplar trees and Atriplexes, commonly known as saltbush, which grows on riverbanks and can tolerate salinity. =Climate= Flash flood in Ein Avdat. According to statistics compiled by a weather station at Sde Boker, the summers are hot with almost no precipitation while the winters are cold with some rain. The lowest recorded temperature for January was . In the summer temperatures can reach over . The humidity is relatively high.

In 1942, Hibbs began a twenty-year association with the editorial staff of The Saturday Evening Post.Louis Galambos, et al. The Papers of Dwight D. Eisenhower: The Presidency; Keeping the Peace. Vol. XXI. Baltimore. Johns Hopkins University Press. 2001. p. 2062. During the Eisenhower administration, Hibbs persuaded the President to sign a contract calling for him to write four articles a year for publication in The Post beginning after Eisenhower left the White House. During Hibbs‚Äô final year with The Post, 1962, he served as senior editor and began working directly with General Eisenhower on articles he prepared for the magazine. Hibbs left The Post in January 1963 and joined the editorial staff of Reader‚Äôs Digest, owned by DeWitt Wallace. When Eisenhower‚Äôs contract with The Post expired in 1964, Hibbs was responsible for the General‚Äôs signing a new contract agreeing to write three articles a year for Reader‚Äôs Digest at a fee of $30,000 per article. Hibbs was the editor assigned to collaborate with Eisenhower in producing these articles. The general procedure followed in producing an Eisenhower article was begun when a topic, originated by the General, Hibbs, or The Reader‚Äôs Digest editors, was decided upon. Eisenhower and Hibbs then agreed to a meeting time several weeks in advance and proceeded to accumulate ideas and facts for the article. They would then meet several times at either Gettysburg or Palm Springs to discuss the article, working from an outline prepared by Hibbs. From these conversations, and the notes Hibbs compiled from them, a draft of the article was created. It was then sent to Eisenhower for his comments and editing before being submitted to the executive editor of The Reader‚Äôs Digest, Hobart Lewis, for final editing. Hibbs first met Eisenhower during the last year of World War II, when the General requested that reporters from the United States be flown to Europe to document the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps then being liberated by the U.S. Army. Hibbs and the other correspondents were shown the Dachau concentration camp and the Buchenwald concentration camp before being introduced to Eisenhower at his SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) headquarters. Following the war, Hibbs attempted to purchase for The Post the magazine rights to General Eisenhower‚Äôs memoirs, Crusade in Europe, but was unsuccessful when Eisenhower sold those rights to Life. Hibbs actively promoted the candidacy of Eisenhower for the Presidency of the United States in 1952. He wrote an editorial entitled \\"Will the Republicans Commit Suicide in Chicago\\" concerning the Taft-Eisenhower battle over the seating of Republican delegates from Texas. Hibbs was never a part of the inner White House Group during the Eisenhower administrations. However, he did remain an acquaintance of the President and was invited to attend stag dinners and other social functions. His close association with Eisenhower developed after the President left office and began writing articles for The Post and Reader‚Äôs Digest.

It was designed by architect Vlastimil Koubek, and was opened on May 31, 1973 as the Loews L'Enfant Plaza Hotel,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/01/archives/loews- hotels-expands.html named after Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the first surveyor and designer of the street layout of the city. The hotel sits atop L'Enfant Plaza, an esplanade and plaza structure erected above a highway and a parking garage in the Southwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. The plaza and hotel were approved in 1955, but construction did not begin on the plaza (on which the hotel sits) until 1965. The plaza and esplanade were completed in 1968. The start of construction on the hotel was delayed three years, and was completed in May 1973. The construction led to a lawsuit after it was found that the foundation of an adjoining structure had encroached on the hotel's property. The hotel suffered a serious fire in 1975 that claimed the lives of two people. L'Enfant Plaza Corp., which owned the hotel, sold the structure to Sarakreek Holdings in 1998, which in turn sold it to the JBG Companies in 2003. A legal battle ensued over the hotel's ownership. The hotel's original operator, Loews Hotels, was replaced after thirty-two years by Crestline Hotels & Resorts in 2005, which was in turn replaced by the Davidson Hotel Company in 2010. The hotel closed on December 3, 2013, for what was originally intended to be a year-long overhaul and upgrade of the entire property.Sernovitz, Daniel J. \\"L'Enfant Plaza Hotel Eyed for Closure, Major Overhaul\\" Washington Business Journal.

Zeckendorf named this mall L'Enfant Plaza after Pierre Charles L'Enfant,Yenckel and Frommer, p. 7. an architect responsible for planning the city of Washington.Resnick, p. 78 L'Enfant Plaza was approved for construction in April 1955.\\"2 Projects Promise Aid to Southwest.\\" Washington Post.

December 9, 1959. The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza, hotel, and office buildings. Construction was to have begun on January 1, 1961, but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L'Enfant Promenade, the short time-frame to prepare detailed construction plans, and because Congress had not granted air rights above 9th Street SW to the developers. Construction of L'Enfant Plaza and the hotel were then delayed another decade. Zeckendorf agreed to build the promenade, plaza, and all surrounding buildings as a single project in April 1961 and to pay $20 per .Eisen, Jack. \\"Building of Entire Southwest Plaza As One Job Offered by Zeckendorf.\\" Washington Post.

But Zeckendorf's vast real estate empire began to suffer severe financial difficulties in 1964, eventually going bankrupt the following year.Reich, 1997, pp. 143‚Äì144. With Zeckendorf unable to make good on his construction pledges, the Redevelopment Land Agency forced him to withdraw and sell his interest in L'Enfant Plaza in November 1964.Lardner, George. \\"Renewal Agency Sets Conditions For Withdrawal of Zeckendorf.\\" Washington Post.

The buyer of Zeckendorf's property and leases was the L'Enfant Plaza Corp. (also known as L'Enfant Properties). L'Enfant Plaza Corp. was a syndicate led by former United States Air Force Lieutenant General Elwood R. Quesada, and included Chase Manhattan Bank president David Rockefeller, D.C. businessman David A. Garrett, investment banker Andr√© Meyer, and the real estate investment firm Gerry Brothers & Co. Quesada said that if the Redevelopment Land Agency approved the sale, it would begin immediate construction of the promenade, the 1,400-car parking garage beneath it, and the plaza.

December 10, 1965, but the project was still hindered by delays. The federal government was building the James V.

The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co. (now Clark Construction Group). A major problem emerged during the hotel's construction. The Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, headquarters of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), had been constructed on a Redevelopment Land Agency site in November 1965.L'Enfant Plaza Properties, Inc. v. United States, 645 F.2d 886. John McShain, Inc., one of the largest federal building contractors in the Washington metro area, was the lead construction contractor. During the HUD building's construction, the footings for the western portion of the building were accidentally built over the property line.L'Enfant Plaza East, Inc. v. John McShain, Inc. 359 A.2d 5. The -thick footings for the HUD building were underground. L'Enfant Plaza Corp. sued John McShain, Inc. and the Redevelopment Land Agency for removal of the footings, stabilization of the HUD structure, and associated costs. The action spawned several lengthy court battles which lasted through the 1970s. The Loews L'Enfant Plaza Hotel opened with a three-day gala ending with its dedication on May 31, 1973.Rosenfeld, Megan. \\"Hoopla Over a Hotel.\\" Washington Post. June 1, 1973. The festivities began on May 29 with a birthday party for author Anita Loos attended by 260 Loews' executives, celebrities, and press‚Äîincluding actress Carol Channing singing \\"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\\" while seated on top of a tall cake. More than 1,500 people including Senator J. William Fulbright, Senator Jacob Javits, former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, and numerous business people, bankers, merchants, and construction company executives attended a reception at the hotel on May 30, and were permitted to roam freely throughout the facility throughout the evening. On May 31, Mayor of the District of Columbia Walter Washington, flanked by the Thomas Jefferson High School marching band and 40 high-kicking high school majorettes, cut the ribbon formally opening the hotel. The finished hotel had 372 rooms and occupied the bottom two \\"lobby floors\\" and the top four floors of the building. The building's final cost was $30 million.Meyer, Eugene L. \\"Rockefellers Big Investors in D.C.\\" Washington Post. September 22, 1974. =Operation= Quesada and the Rockefeller family each owned about 39 percent of L'Enfant Plaza Corp. Major Rockefeller investors included David Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Rockefeller Mauz√©. The hotel suffered a serious fire in 1975. On February 10, a fire broke out in a 12th floor storeroom which killed a hotel maid and injured three others.Smith, J.Y. \\"1 Killed, 3 Injured in D.C. Hotel Blaze.\\" Washington Post.

An important national conference was also held at the hotel by the American government in 1980. In the late 1980s a supposed secret meeting was held at the hotel by three Republicans‚ÄîRichard V. Allen, Laurence H. Silberman and Robert McFarlane‚Äîwith an Iranian emissary. From its opening until May 2005, the hotel was managed by Loews Hotels.\\"After 32 Years, a D.C. Hotel Manager Is Moving On.\\" Washington Post. May 23, 2005. For the next five years, it was managed by Crestline Hotels & Resorts, but the Davidson Hotel Company assumed control of its operations in July 2010. In September 1996, the Dutch Company Sarakreek Holdings NV (a real estate investment firm), Sarakreek Holding N.V. (itself a subsidiary of the Tiger/Westbrook Real Estate Fund of New York City), purchased the hotel and all but the West Building at L'Enfant Plaza for $185 million.Haggerty, Maryann. \\"Dutch Company Agrees to Buy L'Enfant Plaza Complex.\\" Washington Post.

Stanford Hotels Corporation, a privately owned firm, successfully bid $48 million for the structure. After a definitive sale agreement was reached in 1998, Sarakreek backed out of the deal. Hotels Stanford sued in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates (CAB-1413-99, 1999), Superior Court Judge Leonard Braman ruled that Sarakreek was not in breach of contract.Tillman, Zoe. \\"D.C. Court of Appeals Revives 12-Year-Old Hotel Sale Fight.\\" Legal Times. April 21, 2011. Accessed 2013-08-19. Stanford Hotels appealed. Various motions delayed the appellate hearing until 2009. In 2011, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals overturned the ruling of the Superior Court. The case was remanded to the Superior Court with orders to determine whether specific performance was warranted.Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates, 18 A.3d 725 (2011). Subsequently, after a second trial, Judge Braman ruled on July 31, 2013, that Sarakreek was in violation of its preliminary 1998 agreement to sell. The JBG Cos. was ordered to sell the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel to L‚ÄôEnfant DC Hotel LLC. L‚ÄôEnfant DC Hotel LLC submitted its offer to buy to the court on August 9.Sernovitz, Daniel J. \\"The JBG Cos. Ordered to Sell L'Enfant Plaza Hotel.\\" Washington Business Journal. August 16, 2013.

The company said it would immediately shut down the hotel, and engage in a year-long renovation. The hotel was not accepting any reservations that extended past December 2, 2013. Hotel industry experts told the Washington Business Journal that the hotel had many years' worth of deferred maintenance. The JBG Cos. had spent only about $2 million in maintenance from 2005 to 2013, and Stanford Corp. estimated the property needed at least $28 million in modernizations. L‚ÄôEnfant DC Hotel LLC also agreed to the honor the collective bargaining agreement which The JBG Cos. had with UNITE HERE Local 25. About 125 to 135 people, most of them with 20 years of job tenure at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, were affected by the closure. The labor union said it was in discussion with L‚ÄôEnfant DC Hotel LLC to win the company's guarantee that the workers would be rehired and that the company would honor the workers' collective bargaining agreement when the hotel reopened.Sernovitz, Daniel J. \\"L'Enfant Plaza Hotel Overhaul Will Lay Off Over 120 for Over a Year.\\" Washington Business Journal. October 18, 2013. Accessed 2013-10-19.

Early life He was born November 5, 1923, in Hastings, Nebraska, the son of Clarence Leroy Coates and Mildred Creighton. He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Kansas in 1944. After completing his bachelor's degree, he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II from 1944-46. He then returned to the University of Kansas to obtain his master's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. Professional career He received his doctorate from the University of Illinois in 1953. He then taught electrical engineering and computer science at the universities of Illinois, Kansas and UT Austin and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before going to Purdue. He directed the Electronics Research Center and supervised the engineering computer facilities at Texas and started a graduate program in information sciences. At Illinois, he directed the Coordinated Sciences Laboratory, an interdisciplinary lab focused on computers, information processing and electronics. He was a research scientist at the General Electric Research Laboratory in New York City from 1956‚Äì63 and held five patents involving waveform recognition devices, circuit gates and accumulators on computer chips. He was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1974 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980. Coates joined the faculty at Purdue University in 1973 as head of the School of Electrical Engineering (now Electrical and Computer Engineering) where, for the next decade, he emphasized computer education and the development of computing facilities. He was a driving force behind the high performance computing and networking plan that led to the creation of the Engineering Computer Network (ECN) serving all of Purdue's engineering schools. He also initiated a degree program in computer engineering at Purdue. He returned to teaching in the computer field full-time in 1983 before retiring in 1988. Ben Coates died in Osprey, Florida on October 25, 2000, at age 76. In 2009, Purdue named the Coates supercomputing cluster, after him, continuing a practice of naming the machines for prominent figures in the history of computing at the university, which began with Purdue's Steele cluster. Like Steele, Rossman and Carter, Coates is part of the DiaGrid distributed computing network. Coates will be operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university's central information technology organization, and the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, ITaP's research and discovery arm.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 1, 2009. It was written by Michael Price and directed by Lance Kramer. The episode features cultural references to the television shows The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Brady Bunch, and Cheers, and the film Footloose. Since airing, the episode received mostly mixed reviews from television critics. Plot The episode starts as Marge and Homer celebrate the start of the new year of school (even though the start of the episode depicts the start of a new year of school, Bart and Lisa's classes remain the same). Bart is informed that he received a perfect score on a practice test for the upcoming Vice President's Assessment Test, by writing \\"Slurp My Snot\\" across his page. This enables him to attend a pizza party by helicopter. However, it all proves to be a ship-of-fools ruse to purge the school of all low-achievers. Bart actually failed the test and the helicopter is a disguised school bus. He, Nelson, Ralph, Kearney, Dolph, and Jimbo are driven to Capital City by Otto, along with Principal Skinner, who was pushed on board the bus by Superintendent Chalmers for the same reasons as the other passengers. On the way, Ralph stops for a bathroom break, and the bus is disassembled and stolen by vandals (while Otto is still sitting in it). The group attempts to walk the rest of the way, but they lose Ralph on a garbage barge. Skinner signals for a slingshot cargo ship to rescue Ralph with its crane, but he accidentally stuns the driver. Skinner rescues Ralph himself by jumping on board the Shipping Container hoisted by the crane and using the law of conservation of angular momentum. Eventually the container rotates into a position that allows Skinner, the boys, and Otto to run along its top and jump onto the barge. As it turns out, the barge is headed towards Springfield Elementary School. The boys now believe that education is impressive due to Skinner's saving the day, and so Skinner reads Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to the boys until they arrive, which they enjoy. Meanwhile, Homer is late making an insurance payment, and will not be insured until 3:00 PM, so he cannot hurt himself until then. Images of injuries flood his mind when he gets home, envisioning Marge's book club being killed by a series of freak accidents (and Marge making out with Lindsey Naegle). He has to keep the entire book club safe while he is still uninsured, but ends up throwing a knife in Mr. Burns' head at 3:01 as he randomly walks onto the Simpsons' property. Marge, however, is pleased to know what Homer can and cannot do. At school, Lisa is unable to focus on the test, as the thought of Bart being smarter torments her. When the test ends, she has not answered a single question, along with the fact that the test is nearly impossible (the choices to a question's answer all mean the same thing, and there is a penalty for guessing). However, Skinner returns just in time to cancel the test and lift the school's \\"ban on dancing\\". Production The clips where Homer remembers when he got hurt are flashbacks from 33 episodes: *\\"Homer at the Bat\\" *\\"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\\" *\\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\" *\\"Marge in Chains\\" *\\"Deep Space Homer\\" *\\"Bart Gets an Elephant\\" *\\"Homer Badman\\" *\\"King-Size Homer\\" *\\"Two Bad Neighbors\\" *\\"Homerpalooza\\" *\\"A Milhouse Divided\\" *\\"The Homer They Fall\\" *\\"Homer to the Max\\" *\\"Faith Off\\" *\\"The Computer Wore Menace Shoes\\" *\\"Tennis the Menace\\" *\\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" *\\"Simpsons Safari\\" *\\"Weekend at Burnsie's\\" *\\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\\" *\\"Helter Shelter\\" *\\"Pray Anything\\" *\\"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\\" *\\"Brake My Wife, Please\\" *\\"Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays\\" *\\"Blame It on Lisa\\" *\\"Lost Our Lisa\\" *\\"Lard of the Dance\\" *\\"Trilogy of Error\\" *\\"Million Dollar Abie\\" *\\"He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs\\" *\\"Dumbbell Indemnity\\" *\\"Treehouse of Horror XIII\\" When Homer finishes reminiscing, he remarks, \\"What a week!\\" Cultural references The episode ends with the characters dancing in the same manner as the characters at the conclusion of the 1984 film Footloose; the scene is also set to Kenny Loggins' titular song from the film. Ralph believes a rat is the character Elmo from PBS's Sesame Street, while Skinner reads the students Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The episode's couch gag includes the family recreating scenes from sitcoms from different decades: The Honeymooners from the 1950s, The Dick Van Dyke Show from the 1960s, The Brady Bunch from the 1970s and Cheers from the 1980s. As an in-joke, Sideshow Bob walks in on the Cheers segment of the gag dressed as Dr. Frasier Crane; both characters are played by Kelsey Grammer.Bates et al., pp. 1024-1025 Homer's premonition of the massive accident in his house is similar to the premonitions seen in the Final Destination franchise. Otto hums Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries while believing he is flying a helicopter, a reference to the helicopter attack sequence in the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. The \\"Ode to Joy\\" segment of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's \\"Fantasie Impromptu 66\\" and \\"Gonna Fly Now\\", the theme from the 1976 film Rocky are both played in the episode, while Ralph sings \\"Wannabe\\" by the Spice Girls. Reception Since airing, the episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote: \\"I'm sorry, but 'How The Test Was Won' was about as low as things get these days‚Äîthe worst of the season by far, and quite possibly one of the worst episodes I've watched in this brave 'new' era of yellow people.\\" He gave the episode a C-. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict commented: \\"Despite three strong set-ups and a great first act, the episode barely got off the ground, crash landing long before its what-the-heck Footloose finale. There might have been enough time for Homer hilarity if they hadn‚Äôt dedicated so much time to the meandering and ultimately boring story of Skinner trying to keep his dull charges safe after they get stranded in Capital City.\\" Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.8/10, calling it \\"a smart, very funny half hour\\" and praising the couch gag and Homer's sub-plot but adding that the ending \\"didn't quite live up to what preceded it\\". The episode was also named the best of the season by the website.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 8, 2009. In the episode, the Simpsons lose their house, but Ned Flanders buys it and offers to rent it back to them. However, when they turn out to be less-than-reliable renters, Flanders kicks them out. \\"No Loan Again, Naturally\\" was written by Jeff Westbrook and directed by Mark Kirkland. Maurice LaMarche guest starred in the episode. It was seen by 5.99 million viewers. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics. The name of the episode references a 1970s song \\"Alone Again (Naturally)\\" as well as the fourteenth episode of The Simpsons' eleventh season, \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\", which also centered largely around interactions between Homer and Ned. Plot The Simpsons throw a Mardi Gras party, having invited most of the town. Marge asks Homer to invite Ned Flanders, which he reluctantly does. As they clean up the party the following morning, Lenny asks how they pay for the huge yearly party. Homer gleefully confesses that he borrows from a home equity line to do so, calling his home a \\"sucker\\" for getting stuck with the bill. Marge and Homer visit their mortgage broker, Gil Gunderson, after receiving a letter and find out that their adjustable rate mortgage payment has increased drastically because of Homer's ineptitude. The Simpson home goes up for auction and after seeing the Simpsons' sorrow, Ned Flanders outbids Mr. Burns, purchasing the home for $101,000 and then offers to let the Simpsons move back in and rent the property from him. The Simpsons thank Ned with a song and a small celebration, when Marge notices the sink faucet dripping. Ned offers to fix it, as he is now their landlord and the repairs are his responsibility, along with some other items that he is obligated to correct. However, Flanders quickly tires of their constant requests for repairs. Despite Ned's best efforts, Homer gets mad at Ned and decides to go to the media and defame him as some corrupt slumlord. When Homer refuses to apologize for his ingratitude, Ned tells them they must leave at the end of the month. The Simpsons bring Grampa home since if someone older than 65 lives with them, they will not be evicted, but Flanders invites Grampa to live with him in his house instead. Homer could not compete with Ned who offers to feed him 'people food'. The Simpsons return home from a walk to find their items on the lawn. The family spends a night at the town's homeless shelter wondering how they will ever rebound. Flanders interviews a couple of potential tenants when he sees a picture from the move- in celebration and is reminded of the happiness and admiration of the Simpsons. Realizing that he should allow them to move back in, he sends the potential tenants away and the Simpsons return to their home, causing their other neighbors, who utterly despise them, to move out. Homer responds \\"I really hate this neighborhood\\".

Club gave the episode a B+ writing, \\"This episode's story was actually fairly original, which surprisingly doesn't happen all that often.

Ma√±as is often included as a member of the generation of neorealist Spanish writers from the 1990s, along with Juan Gracia, Gabriela Bustelo, Ray Loriga and Luc√≠a Etxebarria. His books have been translated into several languages.  Books  Ma√±as achieved popular acclaim upon the publication of his literary debut Historias del Kronen. The novel, a finalist for the Premio Nadal literary prize in 1994,http://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Premio%20Nadal%20Finalist became a cult classic, particularly after the film adaptation by Spanish director Montxo Armend√°riz. Three novels similar in style and content followed Historias del Kronen: Mensaka (1995), Ciudad Rayada (1998) and Sonko95 (1995). Autorretrato con negro de fondo (1999), together with Historias del Kronen, form the \\"Kronen Tetralogy\\" that Ma√±as wrote about in the note at the end of Sonoko95, as follows: > I like to say that these four novels are punk novels or \\"nobelas\\". I was > thinking at that time that \\"punk\\" ‚Äîand when I used this concept I had in > mind the music of the Ramones and the example of groups like the Velvet > Underground‚Äî was the best way to describe what I was trying to do in > writing. I thought that it was a good comparison that helped bring out the > aesthetic qualities ‚Äîspeed, authenticity and rawness‚Äî that I aim for in a > novel. Over time I continued exploring the possibilities of this brilliant > comparison and expanding on the idea, which is turning out to be more > serious and useful than I had expected. For me a \\"nobela\\" melds all of the > heteroglossic elements that modern fiction either ignores or puts between > quotation marks. All of this \\"noise\\" ‚Äîand by \\"noise\\" I mean anything from > bastardized spellings to colloquial mistakes and any kind of slang or > language that is usually avoided in literature‚Äî is what a real novelist has > to turn to if he wants to revitalize and pump new blood into a genre > positioned like no other to give artistic shape to living language. Of the novels in the \\"Kronan Tetralogy\\" Sonko95 stands out for the appearance of some of the most prominent characteristics that would come define to Ma√±as' later works. In this respect, Sonko95 has a lot more to do with Soy un escritor frustrado, 1996, than with Historias del Kronen and Mensaka. In fact in Soy un escritor frustrado, themes which are absent from Jos√© √Ångel Ma√±as' first two novels, become permanent fixtures in Sonko95, Mundo Burbuja (2001) and Caso Karen (2005), in particular, his meta-literary character. Soy un escritor frustrado in fact describes his own writing process and he enjoys along the way reflecting on the highs and lows of success, which Ma√±as himself has famously experienced first hand. In Caso Karen, Ma√±as rails without mercy against the modern literary scene and its most relevant institutions: authors, agents, publishing houses, prizes and conferences. Like in old pastoral romances, many of the characters from Caso Karen are depictions of real people: in \\"Karen del Korral\\" Luc√≠a Etxebarria's personality traits are observed; \\"Carina Martinell\\" is Carmen Balcells; \\"Armando Sala\\" is Antonio Gala, etc. Additionally Caso Karen is structurally Ma√±as most complex work. In 2007 Manas published his first foray into historic fiction: El secreto del Or√°culo (Ediciones Destino), based on Alexander the Great, was shortlisted for the 'Espartaco' prize for best historical novel.http://www.joseangelmanas.com/noticias.html In Jos√© √Ångel Ma√±as' 2008 novel La pella, the writer has gone back to the style that made him famous, with his return to the world of realism. His first entry outside of the fields of fiction and narrative is Un alma en incandescencia (2008), a book of aphorisms published by the Riojan publishing house Editorial Buscarini. The book was illustrated and inspired by the French artist Franciam Charlot. = Film Adaptations = Historias del Kronen was Manas' first novel made into a movie and the screenplay earned him the respective Goya award.https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Goya_Awards/1996 In Montxo Armend√°riz' adaptation, some of the intellectual references from the novel are missing, such as, the endless appearances of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho in the conversations between Carlos and Roberto. Salvador Garc√≠a Ruiz realized the film version of Mensaka, which came out in 1998. Ma√±as' novel Soy un escritor frustrado was made for the big screen with the title Imposture, directed by Patrick Bouchitey, and premiered in 2005, the same year that Caso Karen was published.

The film was finished and originally intended for a theatrical run in 1991, however, it did not receive its release until September 2, 1994. Plot In 1961 the freshman class of Westwood High School in Los Angeles is profiled in Look magazine. In the article they are called the future of the country. Now it's four years later, and that class is experiencing their last day of school. That night, they all meet at the local teenage hangout, \\"Pop's Paradise Caf√©\\". Pops is scheduled for demolition in two days, to make way for a mall. Over the course of the night, we learn of the hopes, dreams and fears of a close-knit group of friends. Throughout the film, the soundtrack is provided by The Beard, a DJ at the local AM radio station. Pirate dreams of traveling the country, and his girlfriend, Sunshine, wants to move to San Francisco to become a flower child. Stick just wants to surf, but he's being shipped off to Vietnam in a few days. Finnegan wants to be a poet, and Babette dreams of a career as a singer, while Tracy simply dreams of finding love. Calvin is the first graduate of Westwood H.S. to earn a full scholarship to Princeton University. Mary Beth, whose adult persona serves as the narrator for the film, is arguing with her parents; she wants to go to University of California, Berkeley, while her parents want her to stay closer to home and attend UCLA. As the night progresses, the Watts riots begin. Calvin, who lives in Watts, fears for his grandmother's safety. Finnegan, whose family has unofficially adopted Calvin, drives him into the riot zone. When Finnegan is attacked by a group of rioters, Calvin sends him home, while he continues on to find his grandmother. We also learn that Stick is scheduled to report to basic training for the army in two days, after he has enlisted. When Finnegan gets back to Pops, he finds out that another of their friends, Morrisey, who has been distraught over the death of his brother several months earlier in the Vietnam War, has gone back to the high school to make some sort of protest. During the protest, he burns his draft card and is arrested. Later that night, Pirate learns that Sunshine is pregnant, and neither know what they want to do with the baby. Pirate finds out about a place where Sunshine can have an abortion. Finnegan, meanwhile, breaks up with his girlfriend, Tracy, due to her neediness and seeming lack of understanding. We also find out that Babette is going to attempt to get on a local, live rock and roll program, Shindig, the following night. The next day, his grandmother safe, Calvin returns to his job at Pops. Pirate and Sunshine struggle over what to do about the baby. Tracy is distraught over her break-up with Finnegan. And, Stick and Finnegan struggle with their positions on the draft and the war. As the evening draws to a close, they learn their friend, Morrisey, has hanged himself in his cell. Finnegan makes a decision to make a stand on his friend's behalf and returns to the high school, where he burns the bronze statue on the front lawn. Stick freaks out about his impending deployment but is calmed down by Pops and his friends. Babette, meanwhile, has lucked out and gotten her wish to perform on Shindig, singing \\"Leader of the Pack\\". Sunshine makes the decision, while speaking with Mary Beth, to keep the baby but not to tell Pirate. Sunshine and Pirate part ways in the parking lot of Pops, as she boards a Volkswagen Bus headed for the Bay Area. In the final scene, we learn the fate of all the characters from the movie, via a voice-over from Mary Beth: \\"Pop was right; they tore down the Paradise and put up a shopping mall. Of course, I‚Äôve never been there. I said we‚Äôd be best friends forever, and I will never forget you. Of course, I haven‚Äôt seen any of them since that night, except for Sunshine. Sunshine remains my best friend today, and I‚Äôm the godmother of her 25-year-old son, whose name is Pirate. Pirate never made it to Route 66. He was drafted into the Army and killed in action in the Mekong Delta. Babette hung out and toured in the music business for 10 years. Today, she produces a successful rock-n-roll show. Calvin graduated from Princeton and became a successful lawyer. In 1982, he was elected to the United States Senate. Poor Tracy, she was married three times and in and out of the Betty Ford Clinic. She was still seeking her own salvation. Stick won a Bronze Star for valor in Vietnam. Today, he owns a surf shop in Laguna Beach called Stick‚Äôs Paradise. The most popular course on campus at UCLA is called The Road to Freedom. It‚Äôs taught by Michael Finnegan. As for me, I said I‚Äôd never forget you, and I meant it. So, I wrote a book about the last night of Paradise, and I dedicated it to all of you. It‚Äôs called, There Goes My Baby.\\" Cast Reception Reception to the film was mixed. In August 1994, Variety said the film was a \\"riveting, infectious comic drama [that] has a real shot at sleeper success with proper support.\\"Aug. 25, 1994 review of There Goes My Baby from Variety TV Guide called it the \\"most overwrought celebration of coming of age in the 1960s since Arthur Penn's catastrophic Four Friends.There Goes My Baby: Review from TV Guide The film only grossed $123,509 at the box office. Notes The film was originally scheduled for release in 1991, but due to Orion's bankruptcy in 1991, its release was delayed until 1994. This made it unintentionally a modern social commentary, as the film deals with the 1965 Watts Riots, and was not released until after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The film portrays the 1965 Watts Riots as occurring on the last day of summer school and the first night of orientation for the following year, matching the fact that the riots occurred in August of that year.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 29, 2009. In the episode, Lisa befriends three teenaged Wiccans after getting lost in the woods during a game of hide-and-seek, and must clear her new friends' names when they are accused of cursing the townspeople with their supposed witchcraft. Meanwhile, Homer befriends Cletus after learning that he and his friends make their own moonshine. The episode was written by Kevin Curran, and directed by Bob Anderson and Rob Oliver. In its original airing, the episode had an estimated 9 million viewers and received a Nielsen rating of 4.2/10. The episode also received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot The Simpson family becomes helplessly stuck in traffic while returning from a ski vacation. To pass the time, Bart, Lisa and Maggie spend hours playing the repetitive and noisy game \\"Bonk-It\\", much to Marge and Homer's annoyance. Homer loses his patience and throws the toy out the window, where it is crushed by passing vehicles. By a twist of fate, another father throws his children's Bonk-It out of a car window, and it lands in the hands of the Simpson children. Eventually the batteries run out, but Bart plugs the toy into the car's cigarette lighter, causing it to play even faster. His patience long gone, Homer smashes the Bonk-It with his foot, but it becomes lodged under the brake pedal. He loses control of the vehicle, hits a deer reminiscent of Bambi and ends up on a frozen lake, where a mysterious person drags them out. When the family wakes up, they discover that the mysterious person who saved them was Cletus. Cletus tells Homer about moonshine, and invites him to taste the latest batch. Homer impresses Cletus and his hillbilly friends with his moonshine-tasting skills and is invited to be the judge of a moonshine competition. Meanwhile, Bart and Cletus's sons play with a box of grenades that Cletus's wife Brandine, a former soldier, had brought back from Iraq, and Lisa plays hide and seek with Cletus's daughters. They do not find her, and Lisa gets lost in the woods. Trying to find her way back, she encounters three girls who are Wiccans, practicing their full moon Esbat. Lisa is initially skeptical of their ability to cast spells, but becomes interested after she happens to mention in the witches' Circle that she wishes she did not have to hand in her unfinished art project, and her wish comes true when Miss Hoover is taken ill with a stomach virus. The girls ask Lisa to join their coven and she accepts, but on the night of Lisa's induction, Chief Wiggum turns up after being tipped off by Ned Flanders and arrests the three girls on suspicion of witchcraft. Outside the courtroom, the girls say a chant, asking their goddess to 'show their persecutors that they are blind'. Many of the townspeople then suddenly become blind, and blame the three girls, who are then put on trial. When the judge dismisses the case, the townspeople decide to take the law into their own hands, and wish to drown the girls in an impromptu witch trial. Lisa, however, proves that the real culprits behind the town's temporary blindness are Homer and his friends, who threw their moonshine in to the town's reservoir after thinking that they were about to be arrested by the police. The girls are released, and Homer entertains himself by using the witch-dunking chair to binge drink the moonshine water, but falls off the chair into the river. The episode ends with Lisa ice-skating on the frozen river to the song \\"Season of the Witch\\" while her skates carve a hole in the ice that frees Homer. Production The episode was written by Kevin Curran and directed by Bob Anderson and Rob Oliver. The episode also guest stars Neve Campbell as Cassandra. Cultural references Lisa uses Wiccapedia to learn about life as a witch. The title refers to the 1971 Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Guest star Neve Campbell is famous for starring in The Craft, a film with a similar theme to this episode. The way Cletus takes the family out of the frozen lake is similar to Deliverance and Misery. The sequence with Homer and Cletus exploring different moonshine locales, split into four different screens, is a parody of Sideways. Lisa is shown doing online research using a site called Wiccapedia. The last scene in the episode of Lisa figure skating on the frozen water is also reminiscent of the final scene in the film To Die For.  Reception  In its original American broadcast, \\"Rednecks and Broomsticks\\" was viewed by an estimated 9.02 million households and received a 4.2 Nielsen rating/10 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It was the most-watched show out of the four shows on Fox's \\"Animation Domination\\" line-up, but the second highest rated show of Animation Domination after Family Guy. The show was also the fourth most watched show on Fox that week after House, The OT, and Bones while being fourth in the Adults 18‚Äì49 viewing for the week after House, The OT, and Family Guy. Robert Canning of IGN stated in his review \\"In the end, for all the small bits that worked  Moleman operating on himself, Moe and the angry mob  \\"Rednecks and Broomsticks\\" was just too bland to be worthwhile.\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode A- praising the Sideways parody saying \\"a.) arose naturally from the story and b.) was all about moonshine, which is never not funny.\\".

The school (formerly called The Markham School for Human Development) was founded in 1989 by Harry Giles, CM, QC - a pioneer in bilingual French immersion in Canada and the founder of the Toronto French School. The Giles School offers classes for students from Pre-Kindergarten (daycare, age 2) to Grade 8. It is independent, non-profit, non-denominational no-gender, and co-educational. History The school began at The Donway Covenant United Church near Don Mills and Lawrence with a small number of students. After one year the school moved to another site and then moved again in 1991. In 1994, with increased enrollment, it opened a second branch to house older students. In 2008 The Giles School relocated to 80 Scarsdale Road in the York Mills and Leslie area of Toronto. This location provided a single building for all the school's students and offered room to expand. Admissions The Giles School follows an open admissions policy where all admissions are on a first come, first served basis. Students are accepted at age 2 through Grade 1 without pre-testing or screening and with no previous French experience. The school believes firmly that with well-crafted and properly executed approaches to learning, achievements of exceptional academic power and emotional versatility are possible for all children. The student population is limited to 170 with class sizes ranging from 10-16. Student to staff ratios are 8:1. Educational Philosophy The school was founded on an educational philosophy developed by Giles. It is based on six pillars: early enriched learning, languages (bilingualism and Mandarin), small classes sizes, highest national standards and love. Curriculum =Pre-Kindergarten= French is the core language for all subjects at the Pre-Kindergarten level. Starting at age 2.5, The Giles School French immersion programme teaches children letters, numbers and French vocabulary using interactive games, books and pictures. In mathematics, the goal is to have students counting aloud to 60 by the end of the year. Students are taught to recognize and write numbers up to 20. =Junior School= Starting in Grade 1, students are introduced their third language, mandarin. From Grades 2 to 3 children receive 45 minutes of English instruction everyday and from grades 4-6 children receive English for 1:30 a day; most core subjects are studied in French throughout the primary grades. =Half Middle School= French immersion is part of the curriculum until the end of Grade 6, at which point students have the option to continue. From Grades 4 to 6, French and English instruction share equal time. References Canadian Who's Who (2003), ed. Lumley, Elizabeth, University of Toronto Press.

It was founded in 1937 by former members of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, also a Swedenborgian church, after a doctrinal dispute led to the ousting of Rev. Ernst Pfeiffer of The Hague Society, a branch of the General Church located in the Netherlands. Headquartered in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, U.S., the Church maintains an international congregation, with ministries or societies in Africa, Europe, and the United States, and has a total membership of approximately 1,500. History The Church was founded in 1937, under the principal leadership of Rev. Theodore Pitcairn (son of PPG Industries founder John Pitcairn) and the Rev. Ernst Pfeiffer of The Hague Society in the Netherlands, by former members of the General Church of the New Jerusalem who had left as a result of a doctrinal dispute. The dispute in question centered on theological ideas proposed by a Dutch layman, H. D. G. Groeneveld, in De Hemelsche Leer (The Celestial Doctrine), a Dutch periodical started by Pfeiffer in 1929. Emanuel Swedenborg, whose writings compose the distinctive body of material used by the General Church, had proposed the idea that the Bible had, in addition to its intended material meaning, a spiritual meaning that had been revealed through the communications between Swedenborg and the angelic realm. The General Church placed paramount authority on the writings of Swedenborg, but Groeneveld went beyond this; he proposed that Swedenborg's theological writings themselves were nothing less than a Third Testament, and thus, according to Swedenborg's ideas, must also have an inner, spiritual meaning. In the United States, Pitcairn emerged as an early proponent of Groeneveld's perspective. In 1927, he wrote a short book entitled The Book Sealed with Seven Seals to introduce the idea to the American church. The Lord's New Church, in Bryn Athyn, PA In the 1930s, first the leadership of the General Church, and later, its Council of the Clergy, rejected the leading theses propounded in De Hemelsche Leer. Rev. Pfeiffer, whose Hague Society supported the periodical, was thus ordered to stop publication. When he refused, he was forced, in 1937, to leave the General Church by its leading Bishop, the Rev. George de Charms. This led other leading adherents of the theses, including Pitcairn, to resign that year as well. That same year, Pitcairn, Pfeiffer, and others proceeded to establish the Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma, centered in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, and The Hague, The Netherlands. Hierosolyma is a Hellenized pronunciation of a Hebrew word for Jerusalem. In 1939, Rev. Pitcairn established a non-profit corporation for the purposes of promoting and maintaining the new church. The events of the Second World War delayed formalization of the new Church's organization. Finally, in March 1947, the Church's international governmental structure was drawn up by a provisional international council composed of the laymen Groeneveld and Anton Zelling, and the Revs. Pfeiffer, Pitcairn, and Philip N. Odhner, and approved by Church members in America and Holland later that year. Teachings and practices The Church is a branch of what is commonly called the \\"New Church\\" or the \\"Swedenborgian Church\\", and is a post- Reformation form of Christianity that bases its teachings on the Old Testament (written in Hebrew), the New Testament (written in Greek), and the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (written in Latin), the last of which is referred to as the Latin Word. The Lord's New Church differs from the General Church, as its parent denomination is commonly called, and from other Swedenborgian branches, in that the former's members view Swedenborg's theological writings as a Third Testament. =The Three Essentials= The Church propounds three essential theological principles: # The acknowledgment of the Lord Jesus Christ in His Divine Human as the one only God of Heaven and Earth, in Whom is the Divine Trinity. # The acknowledgment of the Word of the Lord in its three Testaments, the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, which are the Third Testament. In this Third Testament the Lord has fulfilled His Second Coming, and all the Divine Truth of His Divine Human from firsts to lasts is present therein in fullness, holiness and power. What is said in this Testament concerning the Sacred Scripture or Word applies also to itself. # The life of faith, charity and love into the Lord that is of Heaven, being the Divine essence of eternal life in man and in the Church. =The Principles of Doctrine= The Church also identifies three 'Principles of Doctrine': # It is not the Word that makes the Church, but the understanding of it. The Church is according to its Doctrine and the Doctrine is out of the Word. However the Doctrine does not instaurate the Church, but the integrity and purity of the Doctrine, consequently the understanding (intellectus) of the Word. # The Doctrine is spiritual out of celestial origin not out of rational origin. # The Third Testament without Doctrine is as a candlestick without light, and those who read that Testament without Doctrine, or who do not acquire for themselves Doctrine out of the Third Testament, are in darkness as to all Truth. Church structure and organization The Church is essentially organized as an episcopal polity, a form of church governance which is hierarchical in structure, and in which the chief authority over a local Christian church rests with a bishop. The external governmental structure of the Church is based upon a portion of Swedenborg's writings that describes a 'circle of life' composed of a 'descending line' and an 'ascending line'; the priesthood corresponds to the former and the laity to the latter. The Lord's New Church, in Bryn Athyn, PA Headquartered in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, U.S., the Church has ministries or \\"societies\\" in Africa, Europe, and the United States. It has a worldwide membership of approximately 1500, with the majority of these residing in southern Africa. The Church operates two primary schools and one secondary school in Lesotho, Africa.thelordsnewchurch.org/lesotho The headquarters of the church, with its main church building, are located adjacent to the Pennypack preserve, west of the Pennypack Creek and the creek road trail. The Church is supported by a non-profit corporation of the same name.

After founding the Nashville Equal Suffrage League and serving as its president, she moved up through the ranks of the movement, serving as President of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association and then as Third Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she helped lead efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution ratified, giving women the right to vote nationwide. She is especially noted for her successful efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in her home state of Tennessee, the final state necessary to bring the amendment into force. Early life and family She was born Annie Willis Dallas in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1876 to a distinguished upper-class family. Her father, Trevanion B. Dallas, had moved to Nashville in 1869 and established himself as an entrepreneur in the textile industry. Her grandfather, Alexander J. Dallas, had been a commodore in the U.S. Navy, while his brother, George M. Dallas, served as Vice President of the United States under James K. Polk. Annie Dallas was educated at Ward's Seminary and Price's College for Young Ladies, both in Nashville. In 1902, in a quiet ceremony at Christ Church Cathedral, she married Guilford Dudley (1854‚Äì1945), a banker and insurance broker. Together they had three children, Ida Dallas Dudley (1903‚Äì1904), who died in infancy, Trevania Dallas Dudley (1905‚Äì1924), and Guilford Dudley, Jr. (1907‚Äì2002). Women's suffrage movement A few years after being married, Anne Dallas Dudley became involved in the temperance movement as a supporter of alcohol prohibition. Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley became convinced that women's place in society could only be improved if women were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process. In September 1911, Dudley, Daviess, Clark, and several other women met in the back parlor of the Tulane Hotel and founded the Nashville Equal Suffrage League, an organization dedicated to building local support for women's suffrage while \\"quietly and earnestly avoiding militant methods\\". Dudley was selected as the organization's first president. During her presidency, the league organized giant May Day suffrage parades, usually led by Dudley and her children. Dudley also helped bring the National Suffrage Convention to Nashville in 1914. At the time, it was one of the largest conventions ever held in the city. This photograph of Dudley with her children was widely circulated with suffrage publicity materials in an effort to counteract stereotypes of suffragists as mannish radicals. After serving as president of the local league for four years, Dudley was elected to head the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association in 1915. During this time she helped to introduce and lobby for a suffrage amendment to the state constitution. Although the amendment was defeated, a later measure to give women the right to vote in presidential and municipal elections was eventually passed by the state legislature in 1919. In 1917, Dudley became the Third Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she contributed significantly to advancing legislation on the issue of women's suffrage. In 1920, Dudley, along with Catherine Talty Kenny and Abby Crawford Milton, led the campaign in Tennessee to approve ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. On August 18, Tennessee became the 36th and deciding state to ratify the amendment, thereby giving women the right to vote throughout the country. Later life A Celtic cross stands in the center of the Dallas family burial lot. Following the success of the suffrage campaign, Dudley became the first woman associate chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Committee. She was also selected as the first female delegate-at-large to the Democratic National Convention in 1920. Dudley's involvement in politics declined significantly in subsequent years, with her efforts being focused on civic and charitable causes during the remainder of her life. She was an active worker for the American Red Cross during World War II and later served as board chairman of the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities. Dudley died unexpectedly on September 13, 1955, of a coronary occlusion at her home in Belle Meade, Tennessee. She was 78 years old. She is buried with her family at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville. Legacy Dudley's legacy has been honored in numerous ways. She is one of three women featured in the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Memorial in Knoxville, Tennessee, along with Lizzie Crozier French of Knoxville and Elizabeth Avery Meriwether of Memphis. She is featured along with ten other prominent Tennesseans in The Pride of Tennessee, the official Tennessee State Bicentennial Portrait which hangs in the Tennessee State Capitol. There is also a historical marker in Nashville's Centennial Park dedicated to her. Dudley was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1995. An apartment building completed in 2015 on Elliston Place in Nashville is named \\"The Dallas\\" in honor of her. On August 26, 2016, as part of Women's Equality Day, a monument by Alan LeQuire was unveiled in Centennial Park in Nashville, featuring depictions of Dudley, Carrie Chapman Catt, Abby Crawford Milton, Juno Frankie Pierce, and Sue Shelton White. In 2017, Capitol Boulevard in downtown Nashville was renamed to Anne Dallas Dudley Boulevard.

The funeral was the largest gathering of European royalty ever to take place, with representatives of 70 states, and the last before many royal families were deposed in the First World War and its aftermath. Organisation The lying- in-state of King Edward VII in Westminster Hall, 17-19 May 1910. King Edward VII had died on 6 May, and following a private lying in state in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace, on 17 May the coffin was taken in procession to Westminster Hall, where there was a public lying in state. This was the first to be held in the hall for a member of the Royal Family and was inspired by the lying in state of William Gladstone there in 1898. On the first day, thousands of members of the public queued patiently in the rain to pay their respects; some 25,000 people were turned away when the gates were closed at 10 pm. On 19 May, Kaiser Wilhelm II wanted to have the hall closed while he laid a wreath; however, the police advised that there might be disorder if that happened, so the Kaiser was taken in through another entrance while the public continued to file past. An estimated half a million people visited the hall during the three days that it was open. The funeral was held two weeks after the king's death on 20 May. Huge crowds, estimated at between three and five million, gathered to watch the procession, the route of which was lined by 35,000 soldiers. It passed from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall, where a small ceremony was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, before a small group of official mourners ‚Äì the late King's widow Queen Alexandra, his son King George V, his daughter The Princess Victoria, his brother the Duke of Connaught, and his nephew the German Emperor. The remainder of the funeral party waited outside the Hall, consisting of thousands of people. Big Ben, the bell in the nearby clock tower, was rung 68 times, one for each year of Edward VII's life. This was the first time it was used in this way at a monarch's funeral. The whole procession then proceeded from Westminster Hall, via Whitehall and the Mall, from Hyde Park Corner up to the Marble Arch, and thence to Paddington Station; from there, a funeral train conveyed the mourners to Windsor. The mourners used the Royal Train, which together with the funeral car built for Queen Victoria, was hauled by the GWR 4000 Class locomotive King Edward. From the station, the procession then continued on to Windsor Castle, and a full funeral ceremony was held in St George's Chapel. The funeral service followed the format used for Queen Victoria, except that it included the interment within the chapel, whereas Victoria had been interred at Royal Mausoleum, Frogmore. The liturgy was closely based on the Order for The Burial of the Dead from the Book of Common Prayer. Queen Alexandra had specifically requested an anthem by Sir Arthur Sullivan, Brother, thou art gone before us, however Archbishop Davidson and other senior clerics thought that the piece lacked sufficient gravitas and Alexandra was persuaded to accept instead His Body Is Buried In Peace, the chorus from George Frideric Handel's Funeral Anthem For Queen Caroline. The funeral directors to the Royal Household appointed to assist during this occasion were the family business of William Banting of St James's Street, London. The Banting family also conducted the funerals of King George III in 1820, King George IV in 1830, the Duke of Gloucester in 1834, the Duke of Wellington in 1852, Prince Albert in 1861, Prince Leopold in 1884, and Queen Victoria in 1901. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westport Banting.Todd Van Beck, \\"The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill\\", part II, in Canadian Funeral News (October 2012), Vol. 40 Issue 10, p. 10 (online ) Edward's body was provisionally buried in the Royal Vault at Windsor under the Albert Chapel. On the instructions of Queen Alexandra, a monument was designed and executed by Bertram Mackennal in 1919, featuring tomb effigies of the king and queen in white marble mounted on a black and green marble sarcophagus, where both bodies were buried after the queen's death in 1925 in the South Aisle. The monument includes a depiction of Edward's favourite dog, Caesar, lying at his feet. People in the procession Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII, photographed on 20 May 1910.

control sale and holding of gold in personal possession. However excessive demand for gold in India with negligible indigenous production is met with gold imports leading to drastic devaluation of Indian rupee and depletion of foreign exchange reserves to alarming levels. Devaluation of Indian rupee is also leading to steep rise in food commodity prices due to costlier petroleum products imports. In these circumstances, the gold import policy of India aims at curbing the gold imports to manageable level time to time by imposing taxes and legal restrictions. World gold output (in kilograms) Gold Control Act Post-Independence, the foreign exchange drain was accentuated in 1962 during the border dispute with China. Morarji Desai, then finance minister, came out with Gold Control Act, 1962, which recalled all gold loans given by banks and banned forward trading in gold. In 1963, the production of gold jewellery above 14 carat fineness was banned. In 1965, a gold bond scheme was launched with tax immunity for unaccounted wealth. All these steps failed to yield the desired result. Desai finally introduced the Gold Control Act, on 24 August 1968, which prohibited citizens from owning gold in the form of bars and coins. All existing holding of gold coins and bars had to be converted to jewellery and declared to the authorities. Goldsmiths were not allowed to own more than 100 g of gold. Licensed dealers were not supposed to own more than 2 kg of gold, depending upon the number of artisans employed by them. They were banned from trading with each other. Desai believed that Indians would respond positively to these steps and stop consuming gold and help conserve precious foreign exchange. New gold jewellery purchases were either recycled or smuggled gold. This legislation killed the official gold market and a large unofficial market sprung up dealing in cash only. The gold was smuggled in and sold through the unofficial channel wherein, many jewellers and bullion traders traded in smuggled gold. A huge black market developed for gold. Gold Smith were unorganised labour force and could not cope with the new developed situation. Only a few could get the licence to hold the gold, that also in very small quantity, with the result that the members of the Sunar caste, who were depending only on their traditional occupation of making gold ornaments, lost their business and their financial condition deteriorated and families shattered. Historical Gold price in INR In 1990, India had a major foreign exchange problems and was on verge of default on external liabilities. The Indian Government pledged 40 tons gold from their reserves with the Bank of England and saved the day. Subsequently, India embarked upon the path of economic liberalization. The era of licensing was gradually dissolved. The gold market also benefited because the government abolished the 1962 Gold Control Act on 6 June 1990. by Finance Minister Madhu Dandvate and liberalized the gold import into India on payment of a duty of Rs.250 per ten grams. The government thought it more prudent to allow free imports and earn the taxes rather than to lose it all to unofficial channel. From official imports of practically nothing in 1991, India officially imported more than 110 tonnes of gold in 1992, which now stands about 800 tonnes in a year. In September 1999, the Govt. of India launched a Gold Deposit Scheme to utilize the idle gold and simultaneously give a return to gold owners and reduce the country's reliance on imports. However, this plan was not widely accepted by the population. Gold ETFs are also operating in India from March 2007. Alarmed by the excessive gold imports by Indians despite the public holdings of gold is in excess of 30,000 metric tons, Indian Government introduced a new Gold Deposit Scheme with attractive benefits to the gold depositors in the year 2015 to recycle the available idling gold in the country for meeting internally the entire fresh ornamental gold demand. Government of India has nearly 550 tons of gold reserves which would help in kick starting the scheme. Crisis hedge not inflation hedge Gold price history in 1960‚Äì2014 When the inflation adjusted gold value is examined, gold is not an inflation hedge but crisis hedge. Some times, gold price apparently looks lower in US$ value but its price compared to corresponding crude oil price can be exceeding 25 times far higher than long term average of 15 times. In April 2020, one ounce of gold fetched more than 90 barrels of WTI crude oil in USA in the mid of Covid 19 pandemic as gold price shot up to 1788 US$/ounce. Thus during the lower oil prices period, gold acts as crisis hedge to overcome the loss of revenue from oil exports to the oil exporting countries. When oil prices are higher, it acts as crisis hedge to the oil importing countries to dispose oil stocks at profit and purchase gold with the accrued cash for replenishing oil stocks later during the lower oil price with respect to gold price. With the advent of shale oil production boom in USA, crude oil for the first time is being realistically priced in US$ irrespective of quantitative easing in USA and the agreement of USA with OPEC to transact their international crude oil exports in US$. However international gold price is fixed by the major gold importing countries like India as gold market is fully buyers market with global gold stocks amounting to 300 times of its annual consumption or 53 times of its annual production. In India, when the agriculture production is good, it will lead to slump in the agriculture commodity prices and raise in gold price due to demand from rural areas. Similarly, when agriculture commodity prices raise due to less production, gold prices would depress by lack of demand from rural areas. During good monsoon years, Indian government can sell its gold reserves at higher price catering to the gold demand from rural areas, to finance the surplus food grains purchase obligation at minimum support price (MSP) and the supply of adequate imported fertilisers to farmers. The depleted gold reserves could be purchased back later at lower price during the subsequent bad monsoon years with the funds after selling the food grain stocks at higher price to make up shortfall in the production. This analogy can be applied to all commodities and gold can be termed as super commodity with characters of international currency. Thus Indian Government or Reserve Bank of India can overcome the economic crisis by effectively managing / hedging the gold reserves vis a vis food grain stocks or fertiliser stocks or crude oil stocks. Gold trading daily turnover in the international commodity exchanges (NYMEX, TOCOM, HKMEx, DGCX, etc.) is of the order of 300 tons/day (nearly 110,000 tons/year) compared to 3000 tons/year global production. However, most of the trades are squared off without actual delivery. India being the dominant importer of gold, Indian government can exercise full control on international gold trading when all its gold imports are channelled through it and distributed through the commodities exchanges of India.  Current policy  Gold prices (US$ per troy ounce), in nominal US$ and inflation adjusted US$. India imports in excess of 1000 tons annually (including unofficially smuggled gold) with negligible local production. The annual gold imports are around 50 billion US$ next only to crude oil imports widening the trade deficit. In the years since 2001 to 2015, the official net gold imports are 269 billion US$ whereas the Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) invested only 157 billion US$ in Indian equities. Gold imports cost is nearly 3% of the GDP. Alarmed by the huge trade deficit in the year 2012, GoI introduced moderate customs duty (below 10%) on gold imports. Though the policy is fetching good customs income, the imports demand is not drastically coming down. It is due to the reason that world gold demand is mainly driven by Indians and its price is fixed by Indians in Indian rupees. Imposing customs tax on gold imports in India or devaluation of Indian currency, led to the softening of its international price but remained range bound in rupee terms. Customs duty imposition also led to increase in gold smuggling but narrowed the trade deficit to permissible limit as the smuggled gold would not get accounted as imports in trade deficit calculations. The gold imports are also serving to channelise undeclared earnings by exporters and importers of India. Invariably, exporters under invoice their exports whereas importers over invoice their imports to stash black money in tax haven countries. This stashed money abroad is routed to India by importing gold (official channel or smuggled) which can be disposed off in to Indian rupees as gold commands insatiable demand from rural India. This multiple malpractices by importers and exporters artificially widen the official trade deficit by three folds of the actual trade deficit subjecting Indian currency constantly at the risk of devaluation and de-rating of India by international rating agencies. It is estimated that unnecessary gold imports are retarding growth of Indian economy by at least 3% points. The customs duty forgone during the financial year 2013-14 on non-essential gold and diamonds import is Rs 48,635 crores which is constituting 16% of the total customs duty forgone.

E. Shaw Research to perform high-speed molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems on conventional computer clusters. The code uses novel parallel algorithms and numerical methods to achieve high performance on platforms containing multiple processors, but may also be executed on a single computer. The core and source code are available at no cost for non-commercial use by universities and other not-for-profit research institutions, and have been used in the Folding@home distributed computing project. Desmond is available as commercial software through Schr√∂dinger, Inc. Molecular dynamics program Desmond supports algorithms typically used to perform fast and accurate molecular dynamics. Long-range electrostatic energy and forces can be calculated using particle mesh Ewald-based methods. Constraints can be enforced using the M-SHAKE algorithm. These methods can be used together with time-scale splitting (RESPA-based) integration schemes. Desmond can compute energies and forces for many standard fixed-charged force fields used in biomolecular simulations, and is also compatible with polarizable force fields based on the Drude formalism. A variety of integrators and support for various ensembles have been implemented in the code, including methods for temperature control (Andersen, Nos√©-Hoover, and Langevin) and pressure control (Berendsen, Martyna-Tobias- Klein, and Langevin). The code also supports methods for restraining atomic positions and molecular configurations; allows simulations to be carried out using a variety of periodic cell configurations; and has facilities for accurate checkpointing and restart. Desmond can also be used to perform absolute and relative free energy calculations (e.g., free energy perturbation). Other simulation methods (such as replica exchange) are supported through a plug-in-based infrastructure, which also allows users to develop their own simulation algorithms and models. Desmond is also available in a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated version that is about 60-80 times faster than the central processing unit (CPU) version. Related software tools Along with the molecular dynamics program, the Desmond software also includes tools for minimizing and energy analysis, both of which can be run efficiently in a parallel environment. Force fields parameters can be assigned using a template-based parameter assignment tool called Viparr. It currently supports several versions of the CHARMM, Amber and OPLS force fields, and a range of different water models. Desmond is integrated with a molecular modeling environment (Maestro, developed by Schr√∂dinger, Inc.) for setting up simulations of biological and chemical systems, and is compatible with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) for trajectory viewing and analysis.

History The German national railways had already procured small locomotives of classes K√∂ I (up to ) and K√∂f II (up to for light shunting duties at small and medium- sized railway station. These locomotives were attached to their particular station and their use resulted in shortened travel times of mixed trains since the train locomotives did not need to complete all of the shunting work before the train could proceed to the next destination. After the Second World War the small locomotives of the K√∂f II class were in much demand and overused, but the use of a more powerful shunting locomotive such as the class V 60 was precluded, primarily for cost reasons: Small locomotives of the K√∂f type were cheaper to operate since the driver did not need to be a fully qualified locomotive driver. In the 1950s, in order to close the gap between the small locomotives (German:Kleinlok) and the V 60 the German Federal Railroad defined a new class of small locomotives - the K√∂f class III - as having a maximum power of ) and worked with the locomotive manufacturer Gmeinder to develop suitable locomotives. In 1959 8 prototypes were delivered and given the temporary class name K√∂f 10 (maximum speed 30 km/h) and K√∂f 11 (max. speed 45 km/h). 5 were of the K√∂f 11 type, the other 3 were K√∂f 10. The K in K√∂f indicates the locomotive is a small locomotive, the √∂ indicates diesel fuel (from the German for 'oil'), alternatives are b for petrol (German:benzol), d for steam (German:Dampf) meaning vapor, s indicates battery power. The third letter indicates the transmission type - f here indicates hydraulic transmission (German:Fl√ºssigkeitsgetriebe - \\"Fluid drive\\") - therefore the prefix K√∂f indicates a small locomotive with diesel engine and hydraulic power transmission. K√∂f 11 (Class 332) exampleThese 8 prototype models all differed in gearing and engine type for comparison purposes: this led to a standard locomotives with a Mannheim works engine of type RHS 518A with a nominal power of and hydraulic transmission of type L213U from Voith, drive to the wheels was by chain drive - these were given the classification name: K√∂f 11 With the introduction of the new numbering scheme in 1968 (see DB locomotive classification for more details) the 317 locomotives built to this specification (including the 5 K√∂f 11 prototypes) were given the class number 332, the 3 slower K√∂f 10 prototypes received class number 331 ;when the maximum speed was raised to 45 km/h by rebuilding in the 80s 331 001 and 002 were reclassified as type 332 and received the numbers 332 601 and 602 respectively from 1992 onwards. Experimental prototype locomotives K√∂f 11 numbers 001, 003, 004, 063 and 211 with other engine variations and gear variations received the numbers 332 701, 801, 702, 901 and 902 at the time of the reclassification. In 1965 Gmeinder introduced an advancement of the K√∂f 11 design in which the final drive of the power transmission had the chain drive replaced with drive shafts. These were given the classification K√∂f 12 (class 333 after 1968). 250 of this type were made. From 333 102 onwards the external appearance changed due to the installation of an improved cooler. K√∂f 12 (class 333) in Turquoise and yellow DB livery To further lower personnel expenditure cost of shunting services in 1984 the German Railways began experimenting with radio controls for shunting locomotives. The reason for this is that previously shunting involved the work of two men: the small locomotive operator and a person who performed coupling tasks and monitored the shunting operations - the two communicating by radio. By giving one person remote control of the train the task could be performed by one person. The persons performing this were given the new job title Lokrangierf√ºhrers in German. The engines 333 108, 114 and 138 were the first of the class to be fitted with the remote control equipment and from 1988 the rebuilding of locomotives of the class 333 began which were given the class number 335. Locomotives of the class 332 were not upgraded and from the middle of the 1990s onwards were phased out. Only classes 333 and 335 remain in service with the German Railways (Deutsche Bahn). Design The drivers cabin rests on the outside frame and is removable; thus the overall clearance of the locomotive can be easily reduced for transportation on an open wagon to another place. This avoids these low speed locomotives holding up other traffic when they have to be transported. The buffer beams are impact absorbing and are relatively simply replaced - for example in the case of them being damaged by over enthusiastic shunting operations. A hydraulic reversing gear is situated between the final drive and hydraulic transmission system. In class 332 the hydraulic transmission consists of a clutch and hydrostatic drive, in the 333 of two torque converters For braking the locomotives have a continuous air pressure brake of Knorr design, and in addition, a hand brake for the locomotive which works on the front wheel set. Because the speed of operation of the air compressors which supply the air brake is dependent on the engine speed, one can frequently observe at train stations the locomotive's engines being run (in neutral) at full power to give more braking force. Class 335 The automatic coupling device is visible Locomotives of class 335 differ from class 333 by having indicator lamps which indicate the status of the vehicle to a remote operator as well as an additional box for the remote control on the outside of the drivers cab rear wall Class 335 also have an automatic shunting coupling of a claw type which can also be remoted drawn up out of the way for normal manual screw coupling to take place. In 2001 due to reduced demand for radio controlled locomotives in 24 class 335 locomotives where converted back to class 333; the ordinal number was increased by 500 (thus 335 025 would become 333 525). These small locomotives do not have the fully safety package that is mandatory on other German Railways locomotives. However the later members of the class 333 locos have some form of automatic train protection fitted. Variants In short the different variants can be describe thus: *Class 331 (K√∂f 10) top speed 30 km/h - Chain drive *Class 332 (K√∂f 11) top speed 45 km/h - Chain drive *Class 333 (K√∂f 12) top speed 45 km/h - Shaft drive *Class 335 (created post 1968 hence no K√∂f classification number) top speed 45 km/h - Shaft drive - remote controlled  See also  *Deutsche Reichsbahn *List of DRG locomotives and railbuses *Kleinlokomotive *DRG Kleinlokomotive Class I *DRG Kleinlokomotive Class II References External links  Deutsche Bundesbahn locomotives B locomotives Railway locomotives introduced in 1959 Standard gauge locomotives of Germany Diesel-hydraulic locomotives of Germany ","title":"DB Class K√∂f III"},{"id":"21121373","text":"Fuzzy Logic Recordings is a Canadian independent record label, founded in 2002 and based out of Toronto, Ontario.

As of December 31, 2019, the company owned interests in 225 operating data center facilities totaling 34.5 million rentable square feet in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Australia. The companies largest operating areas are: Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago, New York State, Silicon Valley, and London. The company is a member of The Green Grid and has helped pioneer concepts of energy efficient and energy conserving data center design. History The company was formed in 2004 by GI Partners, which contributed 21 data centers that it acquired through bankruptcy auctions and from distressed companies at a 20‚Äì40% discount to replacement cost. On November 4, 2004, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time, the company owned 23 properties comprising 5.6 million square feet. In August 2006, the company acquired a property in Phoenix, Arizona for $175 million. By March 2007, GI Partners had sold all of its shares in the company. In January 2010, the company acquired 3 data centers in Massachusetts and Connecticut for $375 million. In January 2012, the company acquired a 334,000 square foot data center near Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport for $63 million in a leaseback transaction. The company also acquired a data center in San Francisco for $85 million.

Somers, a case in which Digital Realty fired an employee who had complained internally about the elimination of supervisory controls and the hiding of cost overruns. After he was fired, the employee sued the company, saying he was protected by whistleblower provisions in Dodd-Frank. However the Supreme Court, citing specific language in Dodd-Frank, ruled that these protections only applied to whistleblowers who had first notified the SEC. In December 2018, the company acquired Ascenty for $1.8 billion. At the time, Ascenty operated eight data centers in Brazil.

Rosenbloom, and directed by Patrick McGoohan. It was an adaptation of Good's stage musical of the same title, which itself was loosely adapted from William Shakespeare's Othello. It was not a critical success.  Production  Shakespeare's tragedy of revenge and racism had been retitled for the London stage and relocated from Venice to Piccadilly; for the film, the location of the drama was moved to the New Mexico desert; filming took place in Espa√±ola and Santa Fe. The title comes from Act III, Scene III of Shakespeare's play, in which Othello declares his love for Desdemona, \\"Perdition catch my soul / But I do love thee! And when I love thee not, / Chaos is come again.\\" Although much of the plot remains intact, Othello, the \\"noble Moor\\" becomes the pacifist leader of a hippie commune, Iago appears to be the Devil incarnate who \\"fits all the negative stereotypes of dropouts with his scruffy beard and unwashed look\\" and Desdemona becomes a \\"white round-faced girl with granny glasses\\". Patrick McGoohan had earlier starred in the successful 1962 modernisation of the Othello story, All Night Long, which had been moved to 1960s London and fuelled by jazz music. AllMovie's reviewer points out that \\"perhaps he thought lightning would strike twice in moving it to a gospel show in the Southwest. He was terribly wrong.\\" Catch My Soul would be the only film to be directed by McGoohan, although he later directed some episodes of Columbo. In an interview with Premiere magazine in 1995, McGoohan gave some insight into why the film had failed: Of the cast, Richie Havens was well-known from his appearance at Woodstock Festival, but this was his first acting role; Lance LeGault had some experience, but not playing major roles; likewise Season Hubley and Susan Tyrrell. Tony Joe White was already fairly well known as a musician. Allmovie's Craig Butler was moved to comment \\"Laughable also describes every dramatic performance, as do horrible and unbelievable.\\"  Cast  *Richie Havens - Othello *Lance LeGault - Iago *Season Hubley - Desdemona *Tony Joe White - Cassio (\\"a wino from Baton Rouge, Louisiana\\") (requires login) *Susan Tyrrell - Emilia *Delaney Bramlett *Bonnie Bramlett *Raleigh Gardenhire *Billy Joe Royal *Wayne Waterhouse Reception The film appeared at the same time as Jesus Christ Superstar. It failed as an arthouse film, was retitled \\"Santa Fe Satan\\", and reissued as a drive-in exploitation film. Critical reviews of Catch My Soul were generally negative, Time Out's reviewer describing it as Leslie Halliwell was equally scathing, his description being AllMovie's Craig Butler was able to say that \\"some of the musical performances, especially from Richie Havens and Tony Joe White are quite good, and much of the music is worth hearing ... removed from the movie.\\" Nevertheless, his overall assessment is \\"a train wreck of a movie that inspires awe and that makes one appreciate a time when awful movies could be so bad in such an interesting way.\\"  Soundtrack  A soundtrack album was issued by Metromedia to tie-in with the film. The New York Times reviewer, in line with others, commented \\"Forget the movie and get the soundtrack album.\\" ;Track listing # \\"Othello, Pt. 1\\" - Tony Joe White.

Carom billiards (often simply called \\"billiards\\" in many varieties of non-British English) is a type of billiards in which the table is bounded completely by cushions, and in which (in most variants) three balls are used. Pool, also called \\"pocket billiards\\", is a form of billiards usually equipped with sixteen balls (a cue ball and fifteen object balls), played on a pool table with six pockets built into the rails, splitting the cushions. The pockets (one at each corner, and one in the center of each long rail) provide targets (or in some cases, hazards) for the balls. The two types of billiards have developed into a wide array of specific games with widely divergent rules, and require equipment that differs in some key parameters. Skill at one type of billiards-family game is widely applicable to the other, but expertise usually requires at least a degree of specialisation. A few games, such as English billiards are hybrids, using carom balls on large pocketed tables, and snooker, a non-pool-based pocket game, also uses such tables.  Background  Cue sports evolved from ancient outdoor stick-and-ball games, generally referred to (retroactively) as \\"ground billiards\\", a game similar in various respects, and closely related to, modern croquet, golf and field hockey. Billiards has been a popular game since the 15th century. Carom billiards was long the most popular type of billiards, and remains an important international sport. Carom games, especially three-cushion, are intensely popular in many parts of Europe, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America. In former times, extremely complicated and difficult carom games such as 18.2 balkline were played in world championship matches by players whose skill at very fine manipulation of the balls in nurse shots was so great that the serious playing field often consisted of only 4 major players for decades at a time. The carom world opened up in the latter half of the 20th century and grew to its current level of much broader international competition with the rise of three-cushion billiards, which had more action, simpler rules and easier basic play, but more difficult true mastery due to the elimination of nurse shots. Along with snooker and perhaps nine-ball (see below), three- cushion is expected to become an Olympic sport within perhaps a decade. Pocket tables are known from the earliest days of billiards, being adaptations of lawn holes and croquet-style hoops to the indoor version of the game. The most common modern pool game, eight-ball evolved beginning around 1900. Today, numbered stripes and solids are preferred in most of the world, though the British-style variant (known as blackball) uses simplified colours. Eight- ball, in one variant or another, is played world-wide, is a pastime of millions of amateur league players, and draws intense competition at professional and amateur tournaments using the standardized World Pool- Billiard Association rules. However, the most intense competition in pool is in the game nine-ball, which has been the professional game of choice since the 1970s, with the decline of straight pool (also known as 14.1 continuous). Nine-ball grew in popularity because of its speed, the increased role played by luck, and its suitability for television.  Equipment  = Balls = Billiard balls vary from game to game, and area to area, in size, design and number. Though the dominant material in the making of quality balls was ivory until the late 1800s (with clay and wood being used for cheaper sets), there was a need to find a substitute for it, not only due to elephant endangerment but also because of the high cost of the balls. This search led to the development of celluloid, the first industrial plastic, and balls have been made of various plastic compounds ever since, from now-obsolete materials such as bakelite, to modern-day phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic. Carom billiards balls are larger in size than pool balls, and come most often as a set of two (one plain white and one coloured or marked) and a red (or two object balls in the case of the game four-ball). Carom balls are 61.5-mm (2 in) in diameter and weigh the same, between 205 and 220 g (7.23 to 7.75 oz) Internationally standardized (sometimes called \\"American-style\\" or \\"Kelly\\") pool balls, used in any pool game and found throughout the world, come in sets of 16, including two or of numbered object balls, seven (1-7) and seven (9-15), a and a white cue ball. \\"Casino-style\\" balls, used in Britain and other countries where the blackball variant is more common, come in unnumbered suits of and . The balls are arranged differently depending on the game; usually in a triangular , although a diamond shaped rack may be used in the game of nine-ball. Standard pool balls are 2.25 inch (57 mm) in diameter and are all of the same weight. Casino-style balls are often smaller at 2 inch (51 mm), and may feature a smaller, lighter cue ball. Some coin-operated tables use a slightly different sized cue ball to allow for the cue ball to be separated by ball-return mechanisms, while others use magnetic or optical ball separators. The game of snooker requires smaller balls, and several additional balls with special values. = Tables = There are many sizes and styles of billiard tables. With the exception of some variants of bumper pool, and some novelty tables, all billiard tables are rectangles that are twice as long as they are wide. Quality tables have a multi-slab slate bed over which the cloth (baize) is stretched. Less-rigid materials are prone to game-affecting changes due to humidity, and even permanent warping, as well as other problems. The international standard for carom billiard tables is a playing surface (measured from to rail cushion) of 2.84 by 1.42 m (112 by 56 in, or 9.32 by 4.66 ft), +/- 5 mm, though many (especially American) tables for amateur use are 10 x 5 ft (3 by 1.5 m). The slate beds of profession-grade carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8- or 9-footers, referring to the nominal length of the playing surface's long side. The internationally standardised size for professional play is 9 by 4.5 ft (274 by 137 cm). In former times, 10 by 5 ft (3 by 1.5 m) and even 12 by 6 ft (3.7 by 1.8 m) tables were common, but today these are used only for snooker, the carom- pocket hybrid known as English billiards, and some other regional variants, such as Russian pyramid and Finnish kaisa. Ten-foot pool tables mostly date from the early 20th century or earlier, but can occasionally still be found in older pool halls. Pool tables as small as 6 by 3 ft. are available for homes and cramped public spaces, but are not commonly preferred. Pool table beds are usually not heated. Snooker tables use smaller pockets compared to pool tables and rounded cushions at the poker openings. = Cloth = The and of all kinds of billiard-type tables (carom, pool, and snooker) are covered with a tightly- woven cloth called baize, generally of worsted wool, although wool-nylon blends are common and some 100% synthetics are in use. Baize is principally a Commonwealth term, with \\"cloth\\" being preferred in North American English. It is often erroneously referred to as \\"felt\\", which is not woven. Faster-playing 100% woolen cloth is most commonly used on home tables and in high-end pool halls. The cloth plays because it is smoother, thinner, more tightly-woven, and less fuzzy, providing less friction and thus allowing the balls to roll farther across the table bed. Billiard cloth has traditionally been green for centuries, representing the grass of the ancentral lawn game. Some have theorised that the colour may serve a useful function, as (non-colour-blind) humans supposedly have a higher sensitivity to green than to any other colour. However, no known studies have demonstrated any noticeable effect of cloth colour on professional or amateur play. Today, billiard cloth is available in a wide array of colours, with red, blue, grey, and burgundy being very common choices. In recent years cloth with dyed designs has become available, such as sports, university, beer, motorcycle and tournament sponsor logos. There is no core difference between carom and pool cloth. Serious players of both types of cue sports generally prefer fast cloth, as it requires less force when shooting, allowing a more accurate and \\"finessed\\" , and better ability to and thus or . off of cushions are also more accurate with faster cloth, and a tighter, thinner cloth retains less moisture. The principal difference is that the vast majority of pool tables encountered by the general public (i.e. in taverns and average pool halls) have cloth that is considerably thicker, coarser and slower, with the result that average recreational players have little understanding of the finer points of the effects of fast cloth on the game, and tend to shoot too hard when playing on better-equipped tables. Snooker cloth, on the other hand, has a notable directional nap (except on most US-based tables, which use napless cloth), and compensating for the effect of this nap on ball speed and trajectory is an important element in mastery of the game. = Racks = Carom billiards games generally do not make use of ball racks. Depending upon the specific game in question, the balls may be released randomly, or set in very specific positions at the beginning of the game. In most pool games, the object balls are tightly (placed within a usually wooden or plastic ball rack and moved into position) at a specific location on the table (which can vary from game to game). In internationally standardized games such as nine-ball and eight-ball, the of the rack (the ball furthest from the racker, pointing toward the end of the table from which the will be taken) is placed on the , a that is at the intersection of the lateral middle of the racking end of the table, known as the , and the table's longitudinal center, known as the ); the game-winning \\" is in the center of the rack. In many games there may also be other racking requirements, such as the 1 ball at the apex. In some regional versions, the money ball must go on the foot spot. Some pool games, such as Chicago, are not racked at all, but as in many carom games have specific spotting locations for the balls. Snooker makes use of both tactics, with the pack of 15 being racked much as in pool, and the special each having certain spots assigned to each. There are two main types of racks; the more common which is used in eight-ball, fifteen-ball, straight pool and many other games, and a , is used in nine-ball. Special hexagonal racks are available for seven-ball, but the diamond rack can actually be used, sideways, for racking this game. = Cues = All cue sports (with the exception of cueless offshoots known as finger billiards and hand pool) are played with a stick known as a cue stick, or simply cue. A cue may be either a one-piece tapered stick, or a two-piece cue that screws together. The is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by the player's shooting hand, while the is narrower, usually tapering to a 10 to 15 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) rigid terminus called a , where a is affixed to make final contact with balls. Cues can be made of different varieties of wood depending upon the cost factor. Traditionally hand-crafted cues are often spliced with various decorative hardwoods like cocobolo, and further decorated with inlays of attractive or valuable materials such as silver, mother of pearl, or semi- precious stones. Some are designed with modern materials (e.g. fiberglass or graphite carbon fibre reinforcements) and techniques (including vibration damping) in ways similar to high-end golf clubs. There are various cue aids. Chalk, which comes in hard, dyed, paper-wrapped cubes, must be periodically applied to the tip of the cue during every game to prevent miscuing, especially when attempting to impart spin to the ball. \\"Chalk\\" is not actually chalk (calcium carbonate) at all, but a mixture of silica and aluminium oxide. The , also known as or bridge stick, is a cue-like stick with a head on it upon which the cue can be rested in a groove or crook; this is used to give support to the cue in shots not reachable by or too awkward for the . A tip tool or scuffer is an abbraisive or micro-puncturing hand-held tool that is used to prevent the tip from becoming too hard and smooth from repeated cue ball impacts to properly hold chalk. or a may be used on the bridge hand to keep the smooth; this is especially helpful in humid environments. Carom billiard cues are typically shorter, at usually 54 to 57 in (137 to 145 cm), than pool and snooker cues, which average 57 to 59 in (145 to 150 cm), but the exact dimensions are a matter of player preference. Carom cue ferrules and tips are most often 11 to 12 mm in diameter, versus a butt diameter of 32 33mm, while pool tips average around 12.5 to 13.5 mm (butt 31 to 32 mm), with snooker tips at typically 9.5 to 10.5 mm (butt 30 to 31 mm). Many skilled pool players prefer to shoot with a snooker-sized tip, but few professionals do so, including the former snooker pros who have long dominated women's nine-ball. Cue weight is another factor that varies more as a matter of player preference. Non-custom carom cues available from most makers range from 17 to 20-oz, with the average being about 17.5-oz. Stock pool cues are available sometimes from 15 to 22 oz, though few serious players use anything, and many manufactures provide nothing, outside the 18 to 20-oz range, and the most common weight is 19 oz. Snooker cues are often graded as simply \\"light\\" (17 to 18 oz) or \\"heavy\\" (19 to 20 oz). Carom cues most often have a ferrule of brass, although phenolic resin and fiberglass are becoming more common. Pool cues usually have a ferrule of phenolic resin or fiberglass, although metal was formerly very common. Most snooker cues have a brass ferrule. Personal carom and pool cues are both typically jointed at the half-way point in the piece, while snooker cues most commonly are around two-thirds shaft and one third butt, requiring a longer carrying case. Carom cues usually have a wood- to-wood joint, with a delicate threaded wooden pin, on the principle that this produces a better feel and weight balance, while pool cues most often have a metal joint and pin, since pool games tend to involve considerably more force, necessitating reinforcement. Snooker cues usually have a sunken metal joint, providing both strength and wood-to-wood contact. Carom and snooker cues are more often hand-made, and are more costly on average than pool cues, since the market for mass-produced cues is only particularly strong in the pool segment. High-end hand-made but non-custom carom and snooker cues are largely products of Europe and Asia, while their pool counterparts are mostly North American products. The bulk of machine-made cues are sold by American brands, but are outsourced from non-US labour pools. In the extreme carom discipline known as artistic billiards, a master practitioner may have 20 or more cues, of a wide range of specifications, each customised for performing a particular shot or trick.  Goals  The aim of virtually all carom billiards games to amass a predetermined score (25, 50, 1000, etc.) before the opponent does so, or amass a greater score than the opponent within a predetermined about of time. In most such games, one successful shot earns one point, with no penalty for a miss, but some games, such as Italian five-pins, provide various different scoring and opportunities. Some pool games work on the principle of a point per ball up to a pre-set score (14.1 continuous or straight pool, for example), while others have point-scoring systems based on the number shown on the ball, lowest-score wins systems, or last-man-standing rules. The most popular pool games today, however, are \\"\\" games, in which a specific ball must be pocketed under particular conditions in order to win. The most popular pool game in the world (but unfortunately the one with the least consistent rules from area to area) is eight-ball, in which each player attempts to pocket a particular () of balls, and then finally the 8 ball. In nine-ball and its variant seven-ball, there are no suits, and each player must always shoot the lowest-numbered ball on the table first, and either attempt to eliminate all of them in turn to pocket the namesake money ball on the last shot, or use the lowest-numbered ball in some way to pocket the money ball early. A game increasingly popular among professionals is ten-ball, which is played with the same core rules, except that (in the internationally standardized version) the 10 ball cannot be pocketed early for an easy win. Some games combine aspects of both carom and pocket billiards. English billiards is played with carom balls on a snooker-sized table with larger pockets, and there are various ways to earn different amounts of points. Russian pyramid is played with even larger balls, pockets barely large enough to admit them, and the goal of pocketing the cue ball by caroming it off of numbered object balls into a pocket to earn the point value of the numbered balls struck. Snooker is played by amassing points for pocketing balls with specific values, and losing points for various fouls.  Rules  The World Pool-Billiard Association in concert with the Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB) and various other governing bodies have established worldwide rules for a number of carom billiards games, including three-cushion, straight rail and five-pins. While there are, of course, locally popular games of various sorts that differ from region to region, the main games in the carom field are totally standardised. In the realm of pool, there are many associations which have issued rules for the various games over the years. Eight-ball in particular is a thorny issue. WPA and its regional and national affiliates like the Billiard Congress of America (BCA), professional tournament series like the International Pool Tour (IPT), and amateur leagues like the Valley National Eight-ball Association (VNEA, which despite its name is multi-national) and the American Poolplayers Association/Canadian Poolplayers Association (APA/CPA) all have different rulesets. By far, most professional pool play uses the WPA/BCA rules, and while some progress has been made moving league rules toward the WPA standard, some such as the APA/CPA have wildly diverging rulesets for eight-ball. Meanwhile, millions of individuals play informally using colloquial rules which vary not only from area to area but even from venue to venue. Nine-ball, on the other hand, has been the paramount gambling and tournament pool game for several decades, and has globally almost completely standardised on the same rules in both professional and amateur play. Snooker has long since also been completely standardised, (however it does have a version known as American snooker that has simplified rules) as has been English billiards; with so.

He was formerly co-owner of UkrSibbank and president of FC Metalist Kharkiv (2005-2012). Yaroslavsky is the president of DCH (Development Construction Holding) and one of the most influential people in Ukraine according to Ukrainian and Eastern European media. In 2016, Forbes ranked him among the top ten richest people in Ukraine. In November 2018, Russia imposed sanctions against 322 citizens of Ukraine, including Yaroslavsky.  Achievements  In 2018 and 2019, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky received the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of O. M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy and V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, the best Ukrainian university according to World University Rankings 2018, for the personal weighty contribution to the development of Kharkiv and many years of support for the city's leading universities included in the world rankings. He regularly meets with students to talk about business and life. In 2019, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba and one of the richest people in the world, had a conversation with students in Kharkiv at Oleksandr Yaroslavsky's invitation. For many years, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky has been systematically giving support to universities in Kharkiv and helping to improve the quality of education: DCH and Kharkiv Tractor Plant (KhTP) have signed a strategic partnership memorandum with V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University (KhNU) and National Technical University \\"Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute\\". With the comprehensive organizational and financial support from Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, students and faculty members created the Megapolis Technology Transfer Center at O. M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy. This center helps to create a business space to develop technological and social innovative ideas that can be integrated into day-to-day business activities of enterprises and organizations. Thanks to Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, students, graduate students and professors of KhNU can now use the electronic publication database of the world's most famous university press‚ÄîOxford University Press. Oleksandr Yaroslavsky paid for a subscription worth about UAH 1 million for his hometown university that can now access the English-language academic papers written by the world's most talented scientists of Oxford University in the fields of natural sciences, medicine, mathematics, humanities and social sciences, economics and finance, and jurisprudence. Oleksandr Yaroslavsky provided financial support to erect monuments to outstanding historical figures associated with KhNU within its territory: Nobel Prize winners Ilya Mechnikov, Lev Landau and Simon Kuznets, as well as the classic of Ukrainian literature Petro Hulak-Artemovskyi. A monument to the famous architect Oleksii Beketov (the university bears his name) was erected on the territory of O. M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy.  Early life  Oleksandr Yaroslavsky was born in Zhdanov (now Mariupol) in the south of the Ukrainian SSR. Both of his parents were doctors. A few years later, his parents moved to Kharkiv. The future businessman graduated as a technologist from the Kharkiv Academy of Public Nutrition and then spent 3 years doing military service in the Soviet Army in Hungary. Upon being demobilized, he took jurisprudence courses provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and spent a year working as an inspector in the Kharkiv Department Against Misappropriation of Socialist Property (so called OBKhSS). In 1989, he graduated from the Odesa Institute of Technology as a Candidate of Technical Sciences and worked at the Kharkiv Institute of Food Technology. The collapse of the Soviet Union became a new reference point in his career.  Business  Oleksandr Yaroslavsky was the Vice President of Geya JSC until 1996 and then became the Vice President of the Ukrainian representative office of Triverton International (until 1997). Since 1998, he was the President and principal shareholder of JSCIB UKRSIB Group. In 2006, he ceded control of UkrSibbank to BNP Paribas and focused on consolidating his assets within a single legal entity‚ÄîDCH Group‚Äîsolely owned by him. In 2010, UkrSibbank was completely controlled by BNP Paribas that worked closely with DCH on workout issues. Today, DCH is one of the most powerful business groups in Ukraine, including financial institutions, industrial facilities, in particular, mining enterprises (e.g. Ukrainian Mining Company), development companies, luxury real estate (in particular, Vozdvizhenka, the elite residential complex in Kyiv). Oleksandr Yaroslavsky's key interests include protecting the investments of his foreign partners (BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Apollo). Both of these companies, along with DCH, have their own shares in the network of Karavan shopping centers. DCH renovated the Kharkiv International Airport. The state financed the renovation of the airfield, and Oleksandr Yaroslavsky constructed a new terminal, which is currently the only private terminal in Ukraine, and renovated old airport buildings. Over the past 25 years, this has been the first project of its kind in Ukraine. The new terminal of the Kharkiv International Airport was inaugurated on August 28, 2010. On February 25, 2011, DCH closed the sale of Merefa Glass Company Ltd. to the Turkish company Sisecam in a deal amounting to EUR 32 million. In early March 2011, DCH sold OJSC Azot to Dmytro Firtash. The deal value was not disclosed, but Oleksandr Yaroslavsky said that he was satisfied. According to experts, it was about USD 800 million. Oleksandr Yaroslavsky also invested in the construction of the first luxury hotel in Kharkiv. Kharkiv Palace 5* opened on December 5, 2011. During Euro 2012, it was the HQ for UEFA. Oleksandr Yaroslavsky regularly attends the World Economic Forum in Davos. Together with Victor Pinchuk, he co-hosted the Ukrainian Lunch in 2011. With the Ukrainian delegation, he participated in the Yalta European Strategy (YES) in 2011 and 2013. In 2016, he bought back a controlling stake in Kharkiv Tractor Plant (KhTP), which he sold to Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska in 2007. In 2017‚Äì2018, he bought Dniprovsky Metallurgical Plant and Sukha Balka Mine from the Russian businessman Roman Abramovich. In 2020, DCH will begin to construct the industrial technology park Ecopolis KhTP within the territory of KhTP, which will include an industrial park, a technology park, a distribution center for online trading, a logistics center, a shopping cluster, research, educational and medical centers. In 2020, DCH will construct the airport terminal at the Dnipro Airport. In 2020, DCH plans to enter the road construction and repair market in Ukraine. Construction Projects in Dnipro  In the spring of 2020, DCH group starts a project to build a modern terminal at the Dnipro International Airport in the format of public-private partnership, as was done with the modernization of the Kharkiv International Airport: the state finances the modernization of runways and take-off and landing service systems, and the private investor creates airport infrastructure at his own expense. After the renovation and construction of a new 3,200 m runway, the airport in the Dnipro International Airport will be able to accommodate modern air liners of all types, including Boeing 777. The new international terminal and VIP terminal will have a high airport capacity‚Äîup to 3‚Äì4 million travelers a year. Ecopolis KhTP Ecopolis KhTP is one of the DCH's most ambitious projects that involves redeveloping the territory of the Kharkiv Tractor Plant (KhTP) into a multi-functional business ecosystem. The investments in this project amount to USD 1 billion until 2033. The total area of Ecopolist KhTP will exceed 150 hectares within Kharkiv; the area of buildings and facilities will be more than 550 thousand square meters. The existing KhTP will become one of the anchor residents of Ecopolis. The technology park will be the residence of the Kharkiv IT industry: it will house a business incubator, a startup accelerator and a distribution center for online trading. The research center will include an agriculture hub, and the educational cluster will include higher education institutions and a business school, including the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, the Karazin Business School, the Confucius Institute, etc.  FC Metalist  Oleksandr Yaroslavsky became the owner of FC Metalist in 2006. Under his leadership, the club set a national record by winning the bronze medal of the national championship for six consecutive years. During this period, Metalist also qualified for the semi- finals of the Ukrainian Football Cup twice and consistently participated in the UEFA Cup, reaching the quarter-final stage in 2012. Kharkiv was one of the four Ukrainian cities that hosted Euro 2012 (three matches of the European tournament). In addition, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky initiated a modernization program for city's sports infrastructure, including the reconstruction of the Metalist Stadium. In total, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky invested USD 300 million in the preparation of Kharkiv for Euro 2012. Implemented projects: 1. Reconstruction of the Metalist Stadium in the public-private partnership (with Oleksandr Yaroslavsky contributing 30%). The stadium opened on December 5, 2009. 2. Construction of a modern training center for FC Metalist‚Äî100% financed by Oleksandr Yaroslavsky (this was a training camp during Euro 2012). 3. Construction of a children's football academy‚Äî100% financed by Oleksandr Yaroslavsky. During the preparation and hosting of Euro 2012, this was used as the UEFA volunteer center. In December 2012, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky sold FC Metalist to Sergey Kurchenko. EURO 2012 Museum On his 60th anniversary (December 5, 2019), Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, the main investor who contributed to the preparation of Kharkiv infrastructure to host guests and matches during Euro 2012, held a grand opening ceremony at the first stage of construction of Euro 2012 Museum. On this day, the renovated Metalist Stadium, the home arena of FC Metalist that was owned by Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, marked the 10th anniversary since its inauguration. This event of 2009 marked the start of an ambitious project: Kharkiv, which was only a reserve city and had powerful competitors, and Oleksandr Yaroslavsky joined the fray to host Euro 2012 matches. The businessman plans to invest up to USD 1.5 million in the museum and its collection that is replenished with championship artifacts. It will feature documentary photo and video materials, memorabilia related to the hosting of Euro 2012, European football stars and UEFA regional headquarters. Advanced interactive solutions based on augmented and virtual reality technologies enable museum visitors to once again plunge into the atmosphere of the unforgettable sports festival that opened a new era in the development of Kharkiv. \\"This is a unique case with a single center that managed the construction of infrastructure and huge private investments\\", Martin Cullen, Euro 2012 Operations Director and now Executive Director of UEFA Events SA, commented on the idea of creating a championship museum in Kharkiv. \\"For us, the DCH initiative is very interesting, we believe in its success. This project is focused on the little-known social facet of sporting competitions and their impact on the development of host cities. We hope that the national teams that played in Kharkiv during Euro 2012‚ÄîDenmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal‚Äîwill help the future museum by providing exhibits, and the museum will delight residents and guests of Kharkiv for a long time.\\"  Political activity  In 2002‚Äì2006, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky was a People's Deputy in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of IV convocation as a member of the Party of Greens of Ukraine. From 2012 to 2020, he was in conflict with Hennadiy Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv.  Charity  In October 2010, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky and Dmytro Firtash (owner of DF Group) bought the painting \\"In Love\\" by the scandalous British artist Damien Hirst for EUR 1,750,000 euros, which was a record for the Ukrainian auction business, at a charity dinner hosted by the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. The proceeds went towards expanding the joint project between the ANTIAIDS Foundation and the Clinton Foundation. Together with John Elkann, a representative of the Agnelli dynasty, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky participates in projects that aim to develop youth football. He also supports other charitable projects (e.g. the R—ñdny DIM Foundation).  Personal life  = Family = Oleksandr Yaroslavsky is married and has five children. In 2015, Maryna Sventytska, the wife of Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, won the competition of the most beautiful wives of Ukrainian millionaires. = Hobby = He practices yoga, plays tennis and is keen on scuba diving and skiing. Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, a huge fan of rugby, sponsors the Olympus Rugby Club (Kharkiv). Olympus is one of the leading rugby clubs of Ukraine and a talent factory for the national rugby team. This club is a fifteen-time rugby union champion of Ukraine, ten-time rugby sevens champion of Ukraine, nine-time winner of rugby union cup of Ukraine and seven-time winner of rugby sevens cup of Ukraine. Partners Oleksandr Yaroslavsky is known as having friendly relations with Oleg Deripaska, Roman Abramovich and many other international business representatives. In addition, the businessman has smooth or friendly relations with representatives of the Ukrainian business elite. For example, Pavlo Fuks and Ihor Kolomoyskyi played table football at a grandiose party on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of Oleksandr Yaroslavsky. Victor Pinchuk and Hennadiy Boholiubov, Ihor Kolomoyskyi's business partner, visited the party too. In addition, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky put an end to the protracted conflict with Hennadiy Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv. At the birthday party of the founder of DCH, Pavlo Fuks gave a toast and conveyed greetings and congratulations to the hero of the occasion from the mayor of Kharkiv who wished him every success. Pavlo Fuks also said that Hennadiy Kernes would like to award the title of Honorary Freedom of the City of Kharkiv to Oleksandr Yaroslavsky on the city day (August 23).

It was filmed in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Plot Special Agent Jennifer Beck (Jennifer Beals) is an intrepid FBI agent who is assigned to solve the case of a multimillionaire couple's missing daughter. As the clues begin to reveal themselves, Beck, who has a secret gift of clairvoyance, tries to connect the kidnapper to the girl's mother, who is having an affair with her husband's business partner/best friend. It is revealed that the business partner and mother had recently hired a hit man to kill the father. The father was supposed to be in New York for a period of time in the past, but returned early before the hit man could kill him. Now, it seems like that same hit man has kidnapped the daughter instead and is making it look like the business partner is the kidnapper. The mother confronts the partner with a gun and an intense argument rages between the two causing the partner to accidentally shoot and kill the mother. The FBI run in and shoot the business partner believing that not only did he kill the mother, but the daughter must be dead as well. The father resigns from his job and apparently plans to leave the country hearing about the deaths of all of his loved ones. Agent Beck still feels that something is not right about this case. By touching the different objects in custody such as the teddy bear and cell phones, she realizes the father set up the kidnapping after finding out his wife and best friend were planning his murder. The girl is safe in the care of a nanny that had worked for the parents, but disappeared months earlier, in Chile.

It was directed against the area Hancewicze-Morocz-Lenin-≈Åuniniec, a thinly populated area of about 4,000 square kilometers southwest of S≈Çuck on the southern border of the Regional Commissariat White Ruthenia. It came in the sequence of three actions (including Erntefest I and Erntefest II) that had taken place in January further to the northeast, in the area of S≈Çuck-Osipowicze; it claimed over 12,000 victims. Background The aim of this operation, carried out by Curt von Gottberg, was to prevent any further advance of partisans from the northern Polesie region who had entered the Regional Commissariat White Ruthenia and the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, from the east and to prevent damage to the Brze≈õƒá-Homel railway along the Prypeƒá River; domination of this area was of key importance. According to the reconnaissance reports of the commander of Sicherheitspolizei and SD Minsk, a careful estimate suggested a population of 10,000 people and a number of 'bandits', a total in the order of 34,000 men. Allegedly, there existed a veritable Soviet republic with command offices, centers of recruitment and the military training of young men; also, new sports arenas, churches and schools. The population of the area was from the start saddled with collective liability and its extermination was planned. 'Given the current weather it must be expected that in all villages of the mentioned area the bandits have found shelter', was the feeble justification of the Dirlewanger Special Battalion. Two members of a propaganda company sent as observers, put it rather more clearly: In order to keep the bands from once more gaining a foothold in this area, the order had been issued to turn this area into a no mans land. Oskar Dirlewanger in 1944. The operation The preamble of Operation Hornung was the destruction of the S≈Çuck ghetto on February 8, 1943 by the almost completely employed unit of the commander of security police and SD Minsk with the help of several other police units.Memorial Unveiled in Slutsk Brings in Somber New Year They murdered more than 3,000 people there.\\"Holocaust\\". Jewish Heritage Research Group in Belarus Within the following week, the area of the operation was concentrically crossed by 13 battalions and numerous smaller units of the participating forces in five combat groups. The population, which was to be murdered at the end of the operation, was pacified with the assurance that only actual partisans were being targeted. But there was hardly any fighting. On February 14/15, the tactic was changed, as had been established already before the operation, and the last and in this case longest phase began. The wounded Oskar Dirlewanger was replaced by , the deputy commander of Special Battalion Dirlewanger, who issued the following order: Combat Group Binz of Police Regiment 23 (SS-Polizei Regiment 23)details on Police Regiment 23 issued the following radio message: The order had not been issued by a major of the Schutzpolizei, (gendarmerie), Siegfried Binz, however, but at a higher level. At first there had been a total collection of agricultural products for the final phase of the operation, which boded no good for the population. All participating combat groups in the operation area adopted this procedure, not only Combat Group Binz. Last but not least, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, according to his own statements, arrived at the (Headquarters of?) Combat Group Staff von Gottberg on February 15 probably a day earlier, and thus in time to give the order himself or at least be present when it was issued. Until then, apart from the Jews of S≈Çuck, 2,483 people had been killed. This was also one of the first operations in which the SS-Special Battalion Dirlewanger took part since Bach-Zelewski had put it at von Gottberg's disposal. Its deputy commander, Magill, was head of SS for special tasks at Bach-Zelewski's staff and had been specifically detached to von Gottberg. Magill thus had the chance to continue in this region what he had already begun with the SS Cavalry Regiment 2 in 1941. Other units taking part in Operation Hornung included a detachment of Einsatzgruppe B with the collaboration of the Rodionov battalion, which in turn came from the rear area of Army Group Centre and was noted for its brutality. The contemporary Wehrmacht commander in White Ruthenia, Bronislaw Pawel, stated that the immediate direction of the operation had been carried out by von Gottberg but that the overall direction had resided with Bach-Zelewski. Extermination There are several sources and accounts for the ensuing extermination campaign. Two Wehrmacht propagandists reported the attempt to turn this area into no mans land: This was carried out by slaughtering the population of the villages and farms located in this area down to the last infant. All houses were burned down. Cattle and food stocks were collected and taken out of the area. They also mentioned the panic that had spread, even among the hardened Belarusian auxiliary policemen, who still spoke about it months thereafter: Descriptions of German cruelty, for instance cramming women and children into burning houses, spread rapidly among the civilian population. Survivors from this region have movingly described how they felt when placed inside a dead zone. Gana Michalowna Grincewicz remembered: In my fear it seemed to me that no one was left in the world, that all had been killed. This action stands out for the extermination of many large villages by the Germans. 1,046 people died in Lenin, 780 in Pusiczi, 787 in Adamowo There are several places called –ê–¥–∞–º–æ–≤–∞ (Adamova) in Belarus, but apparently none called –ê–¥–∞–º–æ–≤–æ (Adamovo).

It seems likely that the location will remain uncertain. and 426 in Kopacewiczi. A final total of 12,718 dead, among them 3,300 Jews, (from S≈Çuck), were recorded. Only 65 prisoners were mentioned. Indeed, the SS and police deported only 72 people as a labor force in the course of fighting in the Regional Commissariat White Ruthenia in February 1943. Between November 1942 and March 1943, no more than 3,589 persons had been made available to the so-called Sauckel Commission in the course of eleven major operations, during which at least 33,378 people were murdered.Christian Gerlach, Kalkulierte Morde.

Its total taxpayer cost was roughly 8% of the Finnish GNP, making it the most severe of the contemporary Nordic banking crises. The crisis has been attributed to a combination of macro-economic turbulence, weak regulation, and bank-specific problems.Liisa Halme: The 1990s banking crisis in Finland: main causes and consequences, lessons for the future . 2002. Governmental intervention included bank takeovers, direct monetary assistance and temporary blanket guarantees to the banks.Managing the banking crisis: The Finnish banking crisis of the 1990s and its management . Finnish Ministry of Finance. Background Until the 1980s, the Finnish financial market was tightly regulated: the Bank of Finland controlled interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and import and export of currency. High interest rates caused a chronic excess in potential demand vs. available supply of debt. Thus, interest rates were relatively high (Helibor ca. 10‚Äì15%http://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/julkaisut/selvitykset_ja_raportit/yleistajuiset_selvitykset/historiallisia_aikasarjoja/pages/default.aspx), the so-called Suomi-lis√§ \\"Finland surchange\\" versus foreign less regulated markets. In the early 1980s the financial market was mostly deregulated, leading to a massive credit expansion largely based on foreign debt. Soaring stock and real estate prices attracted frantic speculative activity by banks, private companies and individual investors. Banks aggressively expanded their borrowing in foreign currency, including even banks such as Osuuspankki or the S√§√§st√∂pankki group that did not do that earlier. For this, the period of the late 1980s is colloquially known in Finland as kasinotalous ('casino economy'). Banks became speculators The banks started to actively participate in profit-seeking, high-risk operations such as company takeovers and foreign investments, for which they had little experience. The most active role was played by savings banks and their mutually-owned central institution SKOP (S√§√§st√∂pankkien keskusosakepankki), which wanted to break free from the \\"old-fashioned\\" retail banking business. Some of SKOP's operations were very large compared to the bank's equity, and would later cause great losses: in 1987 it acquired Tampella (a Finnish heavy industry manufacturer that went bankrupt in 1990), and in 1988 it granted 400 million FIM of credit to a Virgin Islands hotel project. SKOP's strategy was to use massive short-term credit, readily available from the money market, to finance their operations and long-term investments on the stock market and in corporate loans. This was often highly profitable during the boom, but also caused increasing losses when interest rates rose (Helibor exceeding 15% at times), the stock market turned down, and debtors started defaulting on their loans. The director of SKOP, Christopher Wegelius, was charged but was cleared of charges after a lengthy process. He was a key witness in the trial that resulted in the impeachment and conviction of then-Minister of Trade and Industry Kauko Juhantalo of corruption. Another bank that collapsed was STS (Suomen Ty√∂v√§en S√§√§st√∂pankki), another savings bank central joint venture. With approval by STS management, well-connected trade union and socialist party politicians could borrow money without criteria, and reinvest in various ventures, many of which ultimately failed. Notable established, STS-owned businesses to collapse were EKA, a retail store chain, and Haka, a construction company. Ulf Sundqvist, who was chairman of the SDP until resignation in 1993, was held financially responsible for these loose policies that contributed to the downfall of STS Bank, along with other members of the board. His failure to pay the compensation led to a conviction of debtor's dishonesty. Sundqvist became a personification of the crisis. Culmination of the crisis On several occasions during 1990, SKOP had to resort to overnight debt from the Bank of Finland to cover its liquidity position, as it was unable to raise sufficient funds from the interbank market. SKOP's liquidity position finally collapsed on 19 September 1991, when other banks would not buy its money market debt papers at all. The Bank of Finland took over the control of SKOP and bought the majority of its shares. Bad debt was stripped from STS and transferred to the government's bad bank Arsenal, and the remaining parts were sold to another major bank, KOP (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki), which absorbed them completely. Government intervention and aftermath In 1992, to stabilize the financial sector and to prevent a credit crunch, the government gave a 7.1 billion FIM (‚Ç¨1.2 billion), initially zero-interest convertible loan to Finnish banks. Most of the banks (with the notable exception of SKOP) later paid back this loan. A special state-funded Government Guarantee Fund (Valtion vakuusrahasto) was also set up to support the savings banks, many of which were first consolidated and then broken up; the healthy parts were sold to commercial banks. Ownership of defaulted or nonperforming assets was transferred to a bad bank, OHY Arsenal. The government founded the company Sponda to manage the property obtained as collateral. Unlike Arsenal, which was gradually wound down, Sponda was gradually privatized and continues today as a private company. The total public expenditure in support of the banks has been estimated as roughly 50 billion FIM (‚Ç¨8.4 billion), the vast majority of which was spent on the savings banks. Commercial banks raised capital from their stockholders to cover their losses. The two largest Finnish commercial banks, Suomen Yhdyspankki and Kansallispankki, merged in 1995 to become Merita (later Nordea).

It is now in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, Netherlands. Andromeda represents Rembrandt's first full length mythological female nude history painting and is taken from a story in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Mythology In Metamorphoses, Andromeda (mythology) is the daughter of an Ethiopian king and queen, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia was very boastful about her beauty, and asserted that she was more beautiful than Juno, the queen of the gods and the Nereids. Insulted by Cassiopeia's assertions, Neptune sent a sea monster to the Ethiopian coast. Neptune then could only be appeased upon the sacrifice of Andromeda, the kings beautiful virgin daughter, to the sea monster. Andromeda was chained naked to rocks by the coast, awaiting the sea monster. Perseus, passing by, had noticed the beautiful girl and made a deal with her parents that he would save her, should he be allowed to have her hand in marriage. The king and queen agree and Andromeda was spared.Ovid, book iv, myth ix. Damsel in distress This painting depicts a classic example of the damsel in distress. In this theme a beautiful young woman is placed in a perilous situation, usually involving a monster or being trapped in captivity. The damsel can then only be rescued by a hero, whom of which she usually ends up marrying. In this painting, Andromeda has a distressed look on her face as she is completely shackled and unable to move. Although Perseus does not make an appearance in this painting, in similar works we can see Perseus being portrayed in a heroic and graceful light, shown through the use of warm colors and heroic poses. Depiction of beauty Many artists such as Titian have depicted this story by showing Andromeda, her rescuer Perseus, and the sea monster all in the same composition. Her beauty as described in her source material can be seen in some of these other works, along with Perseus' role as her rescuer. In this work, Rembrandt shies away from classical conventions by showing her not as a glamorous beauty but as a frightened naturalistic looking girl. No other figure is included, but her alarmed look out of the picture space to the right creates narrative tension. The painting is an example of Rembrandt's rejection of idealized beauty. Since he did not believe true beauty existed naturally, he painted women as he saw them; naturally imperfect and flawed.Clark, p. 11. Rembrandt's subsequent nude mythological paintings from this period Diana Bathing and Dana√´ show his evolving portrayal of the nude.

History The Miami Tribe of Oklahoma is an Eastern Woodlands tribe, who traditionally spoke the Miami-Illinois language, a language of the Algonquin family. The name 'Miami' derives from Myaamia (plural Myaamiaki), the tribe's autonym (name for themselves) in their Algonquian language; it appears to have been derived from an older term meaning 'downstream people‚Äô. Some scholars contended the Miami called themselves the Twightwee (also spelled Twatwa), supposedly an onomatopoeic reference to their sacred bird, the sandhill crane. However, recent studies have shown that Twightwee derives from the Delaware language exonym name for the Miamis, tuw√©htuwe, a name of unknown etymology.Costa, David J. 2000. Miami-Illinois Tribe Names. In John Nichols, ed., Papers of the Thirty-first Algonquian Conference, pp. 30-53. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Some Miami have stated that this was only a name used by other tribes for the Miami, and not their autonym. They also use Mihtohseeniaki, \\"the people.\\" The Miami continue to employ this autonym today. Miami society was divided into clans, led by hereditary chiefs. They had a patrilineal system of kinship, with descent and inheritance passing through the paternal lines. Children were considered born into their father's clans but clan mothers were highly influential who had approval over hereditary chiefs. They constructed villages with long houses, occupied by related families. The Miami were farmers and were known for developing a unique type of white corn. Traditionally, they played double ball, the moccasin game, and darts. Like all tribes who had reservations in what became Oklahoma, in the late 19th century the Miami endured their communal lands being broken up by the Dawes Act, which allotted land to individual households with the thought to encourage assimilation as farmers. In practice, it resulted in the loss of much tribal land, as speculators took advantage of the Miami. Similarly, the Curtis Act of 1898 ended tribal government and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs became an intermediary administration. The Miami persevered and in the 1930s, they re-organized their own tribal government under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, independent of the Peoria people. The Miami ratified their constitution on August 16, 1939, which established a representative government with elected council and chief.\\"Constitution of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma.\\" Native American Constitution and Law Digitization Project.

These reported apparitions have been the subject of controversy. An initial investigation report in 1951 was signed by six Roman Catholic bishops and declared the Lipa apparitions as \\"non- supernatural\\". Despite the local bishop's attempt to re-open the investigation, in 2016 the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith upheld the earlier ruling. Life Castillo came from an educated and religious family that may have influenced her interest in religious works. She was the youngest of seven children of former Batangas Governor Modesto Castillo. At the time of the apparitions, Teresita's father was Judge of the Court of Industrial Relations. The Castillos were very influential in Batangas province, Philippines. Castillo celebrated her 21st birthday by \\"escaping\\" early in the morning at five from her father's house to enter the Carmelite Monastery of Lipa. Teresita's entrance into the monastery was not well received initially by the family, who tried all means to get her back.

Castillo said that around 5:00 p.m. on September 12, 1948, the Feast of the Holy Name of Mary, she saw a vine in the garden shake though there was no wind at all. A woman's voice told her to kiss the ground and return for fifteen consecutive days.Farrow, Mary. \\"The curious case of the Lipa Marian apparitions\\", Catholic News Agency The next day, September 13, Monday, again at five in the afternoon, Castillo returned to the place, knelt down and intended to say the Hail Mary. She had only reached the phrase \\"full of grace\\" when again the vine moved. A beautiful lady appeared, a golden rosary hanging on her right hand. The lady's dress was simple and pure white, held at the waist by a narrow cloth belt. Her feet were bare and resting on clouds about two feet above the ground. On September 14, Tuesday, the first shower of rose petals took place. Some nuns found fresh rose-petals of exceptional sweetness, strewn around their rooms or outside their doors. Meantime, Mother Prioress Mary Cecilia of Jesus decided to consult Alfredo Obviar, auxiliary bishop of Lipa and spiritual director of Carmel. The bishop instructed her to tell Castillo to ask from the Blessed Virgin some proof that the apparition was from heaven. Days, after the first shower of petals, total blindness afflicted the postulant. The prioress heard a voice telling her that the only way Castillo's blindness would be healed was for her to kiss the eyes of the postulant. So, one day in the presence of Obviar, the prioress lifted the veil of Castillo and imparted a kiss on her eyes. Instantly, Castillo's blindness was cured. Obviar doubted no more that the apparitions were heavenly. In her last apparition to Castillo, the Blessed Virgin identified herself: \\"I am the Mediatrix of All Grace..\\"Lesaba, Marrah Erika. \\"Lipa bishop lifts ban on ‚ÄòOur Lady‚Äô\\", Philippine Daily Inquirer, November 18, 2009 Reportedly, many conversions and healings occurred.

She later assisted in compiling and transcribing an English-Tagalog dictionary. The prioress of Carmel, Cecilia Zialcita, was transferred to another convent. On 22 January 1951, Auxiliary Bishop Obviar, the spiritual director of Carmel Lipa, was installed as Apostolic Administrator of the new Diocese of Lucena.

In 1951 the Philippine church hierarchy declared that there was no supernatural intervention in the reported happenings in Lipa. Verzosa's successor, apostolic administrator Rufino Santos, ordered that no petals be given to anyone by the Lipa Carmelite community and the statue of Our Lady of Mediatrix be withdrawn from public view. Verzosa, who allowed the apparitions to be publicized and for the Mediatrix to be venerated, was stripped of all administrative duties, remaining a bishop in name only. Though he had used his family's wealth to rebuild the churches and schools of war-torn Lipa, he was accused of mishandling the war reparations and finances of the diocese. He lived in exile at his Vigan home, reduced to rolling tobacco leaves to augment the family income.

She operated for ten years on the Portsmouth to Fishbourne route before transferring to Wightlink's route from Lymington to Yarmouth. After 37 years of service, she was broken up in 2010. History MV Caedmon was built in 1973 for Sealink by Robb Caledon Shipbuilders Ltd in Dundee, Scotland. The ship was named 'Caedmon' after the Anglo-Saxon poet C√¶dmon. Caedmon served on the Portsmouth to Fishbourne route for the first ten years of her life. For several weeks in 1979, she operated as a single-ended vessel after her prow was washed away during a storm. When the Saint-class ships were put into service in 1983, Caedmon joined her sister ships, and , on the Lymington - Yarmouth route. All three passed to Wightlink after the privatisation of Sealink in 1984. In 2008-09, on the introduction of three new Wight class ferries on the Lymington to Yarmouth route, the three 'C' class ships were withdrawn from service. They were sold for scrapping and initially laid up at Marchwood,, before being towed to Esbjerg, in Denmark. Cenred,Caedmon and then Cenwulf were dismantled at Smedegaarden in May 2010. Layout The car deck had a ramp fore and aft, allowing full ro-ro operation. The under car deck passenger accommodation cabins on all three boats, was not used for the last 20 years. Twin 6 cylinder turbocharged Mirrlees Blackstone engines mounted at 45 degrees across each engine room drove Voith Schneider cycloidal propellers. Unlike the earlier pioneer C-class ship Cuthred, the main engines were not additionally loaded by a generator, so larger Voith Schneider units were fitted and there was considerably more propulsive power. Electrical supply was provided by two 6 cylinder Dorman/ English Electric gensets. Fuel consumption was approximately 36 gallons (163 litres) per hour.

Description The cap is red-brown or chestnut-brown with a paler margin, very sticky when moist, and has a diameter of . The overall shape of the cap is bell-like when young, later flattening to a more irregular convex shape in maturity, and often developing a lobed appearance. The margins of the caps are usually turned inwards. The gills are crowded together, adnate or emarginate in attachment to the stipe, and white or a light ochraceous yellow with dark brown stains when old or bruised. The stipe is long by thick, roughly spindle-shaped (fusiform), with red-brown fibrils and a sharply defined zone of white color at the stalk apex, especially in more mature specimens. The flesh is white or cream, smelling strongly of meal, with a bitter taste.Gryzyby‚ÄïFungi of Poland Spores have a roughly spherical or ellipsoid shape, are hyaline, smooth, non-amyloid, and have dimensions of 5.5‚Äî7.0 x 4.5‚Äî5.5 ¬µm.

Both the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the Professional Corporation in Quebec appreciated the importance of continuing education and consultation with National Specialties Societies, and supported the establishment of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons in order to represent what were then 2000 general surgeons across the country.  Organization  The Canadian Association of General Surgeons (CAGS) is the main national organization representing the interests of General Surgeons in Canada. The mission for CAGS is \\"The Canadian Association of General Surgeons promotes the training, education, continuing professional development, thoughtful practice and research essential to the provision of the exemplary surgical care Canadians expect and deserve\\". The vision of CAGS is that \\"The Canadian Association of General Surgeons is the voice of the specialty of General Surgery in Canada\\". CAGS is sponsoring society of the Canadian Journal of Surgery. CAGS offers its members a range of educational opportunities, supports surgical research, and provides a forum for Canadian General Surgeons to discuss the issues that challenge the specialty of General Surgery. CAGS sponsors a yearly meeting called the Canadian Surgery Forum. This meeting is held in a different major Canadian city each year. It also administers a yearly in-training examination administered for all residents enrolled in Canadian general surgery training programs free of charge. This examination is also offered at a fee for any CAGS member at the annual Canadian Surgery Forum. In support of research, CAGS operates a research fund called the Canadian Surgical Research Fund (CSRF). This fund was created in the 1980s to promote research by general surgeons and general surgery residents in clinical and basic science. The CSRF currently funds two research projects per year and sponsors an annual research retreat for general surgery residents across Canada. CAGS is composed of many committees including the examination committee, the resident committee, the international surgery committee, as well as various subspecialty committees (such as the oncology committee and the head and neck surgery committee).

Banque Transatlantique's head office is in Paris, and it has subsidiaries in Brussels and Luxembourg (Banque Transatlantique Luxembourg, est. 2002), a branch in London, and representative offices in Geneva, Hong Kong, Montreal, New York, Singapore and Washington, DC. Former headquarters of Banque Transatlantique; today the building is the headquarters for Danone (17 boulevard Haussmann, Paris) Today, Banque Transatlantique seeks to develop and expand its services in several key areas: #International Asset Management: Transat Online enables clients to bank remotely. Transat Expat Sant√© provides health insurance coverage abroad. Lastly, Cap Transat provides a set of tailored banking and investment products to meet the needs of an internationally managed account. #French Nationals Living Abroad: Services for expatriates remains one of the bank's core products. For instance, Transat-Service provides room reservations, vacation planning, social integration, etc. #Private Wealth Management: The bank offers expertise in private wealth management, and since 2002, has operated a subsidiary, It has also created new mutual fund products and offers life insurance products. #Stock Option Plans Management: In 2000 the bank created StockPlan, which helps firms manage employee stock option plans. Today, StockPlan manages stock options plans of 60 groups representing over 130 companies and almost 45,000 employees worldwide. #Business Market: The bank offers company HR departments services tailored to expatriates. The bank helps organize the transfer of salaries to anywhere in the world and can organize bank accounts both in France and abroad. The bank created a department in 2006 solely dedicated to company senior executives. History =Founding and Development= Eug√®ne P√©reire, son of Isaac P√©reire, founded Banque Transatlantique in 1881; it had 609 shareholders and total assets in excess of 50,000,000 francs. He created the bank in response to the French government's decision to cease state funding of transatlantic ventures. Thus, Pereire formed a private bank to complement his main management stake in the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique, which he and his brothers had founded in 1855 as the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime. Pereire envisioned a \\"Saint-Simonian banking philosophy\\" for the bank: its mission, first and foremost, was the economic and industrial development of nations. The bank began financing enterprises both within France and abroad. The bank's largest undertakings began at the turn of the century when the new gas and electricity industries created a demand for distribution. Through the creation of energy transporting companies in Tunisia in 1884 and Morocco in 1911, the bank was able to finance the provision of gas and electricity to the capital and many surrounding regions in France. The bank also encouraged foreign investment by financing many public works projects that are still visible today, most notably in Casablanca, and by organizing a parliamentary visit to Tunisia in 1883. In 1884, Banque Transatlantique founded the Banque de Tunisie on the base of a pre-existing agency. The bank is mentioned in Alfred Nobel's will.https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/full-text-of-alfred-nobels- will-2/ The bank continued to expand abroad, not without some drama. In 1902, eruption of Mount Pel√©e in Martinique destroyed its branch in Saint-Pierre, Martinique. In 1911, the bank founded Banque Commerciale du Maroc. =World War I, the Great Depression and World War II= Conscription during World War I halved the bank's staff. Still, by the end of the war it had developed new investment strategies and positions in Africa through the African Commerce Bank. During the 1920s, Banque Transatlantique experienced a period of expansion with the creation of a real estate company in the Opera quarter and the acquisition of Union Financiere. Despite the Great Depression, the bank was able to make some strategic moves. A key acquisition, in 1933, was the purchase of Dosseur et Cie. This bank specialized in serving the banking needs of French diplomats. The acquisition would in time provide the bank with a new direction. For many years thereafter Banque Transatlantique maintained an office in the Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris and branches, even if only a room in a consulate, in every outpost where the diplomats and officers, doctors and schoolmasters who represented France overseas, had personal business that needed a banker's attention.Joseph Fitchett, \\"Selling Old-Style Service; Expatriates Are Target Market For Paris Bank\\", International Herald Tribune, May 18, 1995. The bank also helped found the Antwerp Diamond Bank in 1934. In step with modernization, Banque Transatlantique sponsored several grand expositions highlighting the technological innovations of the age such as The International Exposition of Science and Technology in Modern Life (1937). Though The Great Depression spared none, the bank's clients included, Banque Transatlantique managed to stay afloat and, furthermore, experience significant growth. In 1941, CIC acquired control of BT, together with two subsidiaries, Banque de Tunisie and Banque Commerciale du Maroc. This occurred in response to the German Occupation in France requiring the liquidation of Jewish firms.Oliver Rathkolb, Revisiting the National Socialist Legacy: Coming to Terms with Forced Labor, Expropriation, Compensation, and Restitution, Aldine Transaction, 2004, p.149. Instead of liquidating, the bank allowed the CIC to take a majority stake in the bank, and after the war, welcomed back its former Jewish employees who went abroad. However, integrating into the CIC meant that the bank had to abandon its status as a commercial bank and could no longer operate branches that would compete with CIC's branches. the bank therefore concentrated on two lines of business. On the one hand it became a merchant bank serving financial, commercial, and industrial companies. On the other hand, it turned its attention to individual clients. The Bank became known as \\"the Diplomat‚Äôs Bank\\" as it focused on providing services to French expatriates and foreign nationals living in France. =The 1950s to the 1980s: new directions= While the CIC was establishing branches in Paris and the surrounding regions, Banque Transatlantique was turning its attention abroad, striving to improve its services to diplomats and foreign nationals by:  expanding its clientele to include teachers, industry consultants, technicians, expatriated business executives, etc.  The creation of a specialized department providing services such as wealth management and French and foreign real estate investment. After 1968 Banque Transatlantique began to increase its presence in the international arena. Philipe Aymard opened the bank's capital to foreign investors wishing to establish a presence in Paris but not necessarily a subsidiary or branch, thereby establishing a number of links or alliances. A number of international banks bought stakes in Banque Transatlantique. Bank of Montreal in 1968 took a 5% stake. Four Nordic banks currently hold a 10% stake, with a \\"revolving\\" administrator representing them in council, and Credito Italiano purchased a 20% holding in 1974 from CIC. =The 1980s: Specialization= Banque Transatlantique's relationships with its clients evolved dramatically in the 1980s to better address their needs in an increasingly complicated and globalized financial system. The crises resulting from the Yom Kippur War (1973) and the Iranian Revolution (1979) were beginning to abate as the organization of international monetary policy began to shift because of the dollar's decline as a concerted effort on the parts of central banks in the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Great Britain in addition to the decline in the price of crude oil because oil producing countries ceased augmenting the price. It was within this context that France decided it needed to address its relatively pitiful level of investment and encourage banks to shift towards providing services. In response and to better meet the needs of a growing clientele, in 1986 Banque Transatlantique established a representative office in London, where a very large French community is present to this day. Next, it created the Helder Immobilier company in 1989 so that its internationally mobile clients could manage, research, buy, and sell real estate across the world. Banque Transatlantique also began focusing more on its individual clients through offering personalized retirement products and tailored insurance. At the same time the bank maintained its original services such as cash flow and database management for firms. By the end of the 1980s, Banque Transatlantique had expanded its roster of representative offices with an office in Singapore, as well as a desk on the island of Jersey. It had also created and sustained several new investment institutions such as GTI (Cash Management Services for Companies); Banque Transatlantique Monaco, specializing in providing investment services for French nationals living in Africa and throughout the Mediterranean; and four investment companies (Short Term Arbitrage, Options and Performance, First Arbitrage, and Secure Arbitrage). =The 1990s: Crisis and Recovery= The early 1990s turned out to be a difficult decade for banks. Banque Transatlantique responded by placing more emphasis on its role as the bank for individuals living abroad by expanding its international scope. In 1995 it established its Washington, DC representative office and a new German department. Two years later it opened an Australian desk; two years after that it opened a representative office in Sydney, Australia that it later closed. In alliance with Credito Italiano, the bank offered a wide range of services and benefits to both businesses and individual clients. In addition, the bank further focused on expatriates by promoting its relationship with the Alliance fran√ßaise and supporting a host of cultural activities from seminars to the opening of an International French School in Philadelphia. The difficulties the 1990s presented for Banque Transatlantique largely involved issues of wealth management. This was one factor behind the bank setting up a trust company on the island of Jersey. A severe drop in housing prices caused the bank significant losses in its subsidiary UFICO, which became Transat Finance in 1997. Still, profitability in other areas, agreements between the banks and a network of English real estate companies, and the bank's partnership with the agency AICI allowed the bank to stay solvent. Switching over to the Euro in 1998-1999 cost the bank an estimated 15.2 million francs. The bank worked with its clients to help them through this enormous and unprecedented transition by providing software to prevent credit risks imposed by both the currency switch and the millennium bug as well as by offering new information systems based in euros. =The new millennium= In 2000 the bank transferred its headquarters to 26, Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt. Two years later the bank acquired the wealth management service BLC Gestion, relying on its experience and expertise in markets to direct its more growth oriented portfolios. Then it purchased a 60% stake in Mutual Bank Luxembourg, which specializes in private wealth management services. Then, in 2008, after 25 years in London, Banque Transatlantique upgraded its representative office there to a branch. The next year, saw the bank establishing a Financial Advisory company in Singapore and a representative office in New York.

The technology shows promise as a clinical tool for in situ detection of dysplastic, or precancerous tissue. Introduction A/LCI combines low-coherence interferometry with angle-resolved scattering to solve the inverse problem of determining scatterer geometry based on far field diffraction patterns. Similar to optical coherence domain reflectometry (OCDR) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), a/LCI uses a broadband light source in an interferometry scheme in order to achieve optical sectioning with a depth resolution set by the coherence length of the source. Angle-resolved scattering measurements capture light as a function of the scattering angle, and invert the angles to deduce the average size of the scattering objects via a computational light scattering model such as Mie theory, which predicts angles based on the size of the scattering sphere. Combining these techniques allows construction of a system that can measure average scatter size at various depths within a tissue sample. At present the most significant medical application of the technology is determining the state of tissue health based on measurements of average cell nuclei size. It has been found that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases. Several recent studies have shown that via cell nuclei measurements, a/LCI can detect the presence of low- and high-grade dysplasia with 91% sensitivity and distinguish between normal and dysplastic with 97% specificity. History Since 2000, light scattering systems have been used for biomedical applications such as the study of cellular morphology as well as the diagnosis of dysplasia. Variations in scattering distributions as a function of angle or wavelength have been used to deduce information regarding the size of cells and subcellular objects such as nuclei and organelles. These size measurements can then be used diagnostically to detect tissue changes‚Äîincluding neoplastic changes (those leading to cancer). Light scattering spectroscopy has been used to detect dysplasia in the colon, bladder, cervix, and esophagus of human patients. Light scattering has also been used to detect Barrett's esophagus, a metaplastic condition with a high probability of leading to dysplasia. However, in contrast with a/LCI, these techniques all rely on total intensity based measurements, which lack the ability to provide results as a function of depth in the tissue. =Early a/LCI models= Path of light in a Michelson interferometer.The first implementation of a/LCI used a Michelson interferometer, the same model used in the famous Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. The Michelson interferometer splits one beam of light into two paths, one reference path and one sampling path, and recombines them again to produce a waveform resulting from interference. The difference between the reference beam and the sampling beam thus reveal the properties of the sample in the way it scatters light. The early a/LCI device used a movable mirror and lens in the reference arm so that researchers could replicate different angles and depths in the reference beam as they occurred in the collected backscattered light. This allowed isolation of the backscattered light at varying depths of reflection in the sample. In order to transform the data into measurements of cell structure, angular scattering distributions are then compared to the predictions of Mie theory‚Äîwhich calculates the size of spheres relative to their light scattering patterns. The a/LCI technique was first validated in studies of polystyrene microspheres, the sizes of which were known and relatively homogeneous. A later study expanded the signal processing method to compensate for the nonspherical and inhomogeneous nature of cell nuclei. This early system required up to 40 minutes to acquire the data for a 1 mm¬≤ point in a sample, but proved the feasibility of the idea. =Fourier-domain implementation= Example results of Fourier-domain a/LCI Like OCT, the early implementations of a/LCI relied on physically changing the optical path length (OPL) to control the depth in the sample from which data are acquired. However, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to use a Fourier domain implementation to yield depth resolution in a single data acquisition. A broadband light source is used to produce a spectrum of wavelengths at once, and the backscattered light is collected by a coherent optical fiber in the return path to capture different scattering angles simultaneously. Intensity is then measured via a spectrometer: a single frame from the spectrometer contains scattering intensity as a function of wavelength and angle. Finally the data is Fourier transformed on a line-by-line basis to generate scattering intensity as a function of OPL and angle. In the resulting image, the x axis represents the OPL and the y axis the angle of reflection, thus yielding a 2D map of reflection intensities. Using this method, the acquisition speed is limited only by the integration time of the spectrometer and can be as short at 20 ms. The same data that initially required tens of minutes to acquire can be acquired ~105 times faster. Schematic description SLD, sample and reference light are generated by fiber splitter (FS), while lenses L2, L3, and L4 provide collimation. The beamsplitter (BS) combines sample and reference arm light, which is then incident on the imaging spectrometer. On the right is the optical geometry of probe tip with illumination fiber (DF), lens L1, and collection fiber (FB). The Fourier-domain version of the a/LCI system uses a superluminescent diode (SLD) with a fiber-coupled output as the light source. A fiber splitter separates the signal path at 90% intensity and the reference path at 10%. The light from the SLD passes through an optical isolator and subsequently a polarization controller. It has been shown that control of light polarization is important for maximizing optical signal and comparing angular scattering with the Mie scattering model. A polarization-maintaining fiber is used to carry the illumination light to the sample. A second polarization controller is similarly used to control the polarization of the light passing through the reference path. The output of the fiber on the right is collimated using lens L1 and illuminates the tissue. But because the delivery fiber is offset from the optical axis of the lens, the beam is delivered to the sample at an oblique angle. Backscattered light is then collimated by the same lens and collected by the fiber bundle. The fibers are one focal length from the lens, and the sample is one focal length on the other side. This configuration captures light from the maximum range of angles and minimizes light noise due to specular reflections. At the distal end of the fiber bundle, light from each fiber is imaged onto the spectrometer. Light from the sample and reference arms are mixed by a beamsplitting cube (BS), and are incident on the entrance slit of an imaging spectrometer. Data from the imaging spectrometer are transferred to a computer via universal serial bus interface for signal processing and display of results. The computer also provides control of the imaging spectrometer. Clinical device prototype Picture of portable a/LCI system with handheld fiber probe on the right and the optical engine on the left. The computer is not shown.The a/LCI system has recently been enhanced to allow operation in a clinical setting with the addition of a handheld wand. By carefully controlling the polarization in the delivery fiber, using polarization-maintaining fibers and inline polarizers, the new system allows manipulation of the handheld wand without signal degradation due to birefringence effects. In addition, the new system employed an anti-reflection coated ball lens in the probe tip, which reduces reflections that otherwise limit the depth range of the system. The portable system uses a 2 ft by 2 ft optical breadboard as the base, with the source, fiber optic components, lens, beamsplitter, and imaging spectrometer mounted to the breadboard. An aluminum cover protects the optics. A fiber probe with a handheld probe enables easy access to tissue samples for testing. On the left side sits a white sample platform, where tissue is placed for testing. The handheld probe is used by the operator to select specific sites on the tissue from which a/LCI readings are acquired.

It was directed by Ketan Mehta and starred Milind Soman. Plot By 2123, humans have conquered the solar system and established space stations on several planets. The earth is governed by World Government, headquartered at Delhi. As the series begins, Maya is traveling from Earth to Mars and during the journey is hit by a meteor and an unknown life-form is carried onto the spacecraft. After a successful landing on Mars she meets Astro Guru (Shrivallabh Vyas), oldest and wisest man in the world. He is also a scientist and astrologer and is trying to integrate physics and philosophy. After that Maya travels to Io, the moon of Jupiter, where she is to be the new jailer of the most secured prison in the solar system. It holds the 12 most dangerous criminals of the Universe in an incapacitated state. The unknown life-form enters the prison through Maya's boots and the criminals are awakened. They are aided by an ensuing meteor shower on Io. All 12 criminals escape the prison using their abilities to disable the security system on the prison. Captain Vyom (Milind Soman), a super soldier, is assigned by World Government and Vishwapramukh - the world President (Tom Alter) to capture the fugitives. He is unaware of his parents and considers himself an orphan. He was raised in a monastery in Ladakh and has acquired superpowers by training in Yoga. He chooses a team of exceptionally-powered soldiers to fight the criminals. The team includes Pablo - the pilot, Lieutenant Maya (Kartika Rane) - expert in criminal psychology, Captain Blaze (Sanjay Singh) - the weapons expert, Dr. Zen (Divya Palat) - the medic, Fuller (Sanjeev Vatsa) - the engineer, Syd-E - the android (Shehzaad Saeed), and Surya (Jeto Sanjana). They travel through space in a spaceship named Ulka (‡§â‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ - meaning meteor) developed by Fuller. The series evolves as they come across the criminals one by one and capture them. Some of them were killed while others were captured and sent back to the prison. In the end, Captain Vyom has to travel back in time to pursue the 12th inmate Vikaal (Played by Rahul Bose) who tries to kill Chandrakanth Shastri who would later become Astro Guru, to rewrite history. The story takes a turn while on mission to save Dr. Shastri from Vikaal, Vyom encounters his look alike Dr. Om Swaroop (Milind Soman). Refusing to go back to the present even after completing the mission, he sets out to find the whereabouts of his look alike person. Soon, Vyom finds out that Dr Swaroop is actually his biological father and seeks more knowledge about his mother. It was revealed that the whole conspiracy of turning the brightest scientists of the galaxy into the evil side and then later plot to rescue them from the Io prison was orchestrated by Kaala Saaya - the Emperor of Parajeevs. Parajeevs are an advanced alien race of body parasites from seventh dimension. Their ultimate aim is to harvest a special fluid found only in human brains, that will help them to live thousands of years. He sends his daughter Parchhayee (Nethra Raghuraman) to earth in order to kill Dr. Om Swaroop as he was the only one with knowledge of advanced weaponry, G-gun to defeat the Parajeevs. But Parchayee gets cold feet as she start to fell in love with him and deviates from the mission given to her by her father. She helps Dr. Om from the assaults and later he was taken to other dimension where the Parajeevs would not reach. Capt. Vyom who is still in the past and having complete knowledge of using G-gun help defending the earth from the first war against the aliens successfully. This event results in uniting the World Nations and eventually makes way to the formation of world Government. Meanwhile, Parchayee who is in exile with Dr. Om, becomes mother of Vyom making him half-alien. In present time, Kaala Saya, the emperor of Parajeevs (Aliens) sends his Parajeev agent to sabotage the spaceship Ulka. He was captured by Dr. Zen, and was imprisoned in a glass bowl. After completing his mission Vyom returns to present and interrogates the Parajeev, but he did not yield. After listening to the conversation between Capt. Vyom and Dr. Zen regarding the parentage of Vyom, the Parajeev offers to help them in reaching the Seventh Dimension where the Parajeevs live, and then to defeat them. He demands an audience with Astro Guru saying he will reveal the secrets of inter-dimensional travel, and ways to defeat the Parajeevs only to Astro Guru. After revealing the secrets to the virtual form of Astro Guru, the Parajeev commits suicide. Astro Guru then entrusts Captain Vyom and his crew to embark on another mission to collect four essential objects that would help them to reach the seventh dimension and to defeat the Parajeevs. These 4 objects are:- a weapon to defeat the Parajeevs, a jewel that will act as a compass for the inter-dimensional travel, a herb that would enable humans to breath in the seventh dimension, and a fuel that will enable Ulka for inter-dimensional travel. The crew splits into groups to collect those objects. Maya teams up with Capt. Blaze in search of the weapon, while Dr. Zen and Capt. Pablo was entrusted to bring the herb, Engineer Fuller and android Syd-E was sent to collect the fuel, while Capt. Vyom takes the responsibility of finding the jewel/ compass alone. Maya and Zen were stunned and kept as captive during their missions, while their partners returned to Ulka with the objects they sought. Engineer Fuller was consumed by a man-eating tree while collecting the fuel for the spaceship, while his partner Syd-E returns with the fuel. Captain Vyom then sets out to defeat the Parajeevs. On his way, he was taken to another dimension where his father and mother lives. They give Vyom a crystal that will weaken the shield of Kaala Saaya. Eventually Captain Vyom confronts the emperor of Parajeevs - Kaala Saya, Vyom with the possession of the crystal weakens the emperor and is later revealed as the grandson of Kaalya Saaya. Kaala Saaya recognizes Vyom as the heir to the throne of seventh dimension, and finally convinces to take the responsibility as the new emperor. The series ends with Vyom the new emperor of Parajeevs, recollecting his past life adventures and hoping to meet his parents again in another dimension. Meanwhile, Maya and Dr. Zen agree to go on a date with Blaze and Pablo, respectively.

First self-published and now published by Asmodee Editions, it is played with non-standard playing cards. An expansion and all-in set have been published. Rules The game revolves around matching cards with identical symbols, and it has some similarities to the children's game Slapjack. Complexity is added by some visual similarities between some of the symbols, as well as additional rules. Various Jungle Speed Totems from different editions of the game Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player face down, ensuring that all players have an equal number of cards in their stacks. A wooden (or rubber) cylinder called a Totem is placed in the center of the table, equidistant from all players. Any remaining cards that cannot be distributed equitably are placed under the totem in an area known as the Pot. Players take turns playing the top card from their stacks in a clockwise rotation. Each player does this by flipping their card over in the direction of their opponents, so that their opponents get the first glance at their card to avoid unfair advantage. The card is then quickly placed in front of the player's pile. Thus players form discard piles in front of their piles of cards as the game progresses. When a player plays a card that matches the symbol of another player's top card, the two players must duel to grab the totem in the center as quickly as possible. The loser of the duel takes both players' played cards (their discard pile plus the card currently in play), as well as any cards in the pot, and places them at the bottom of his deck. The loser of the round plays the next card. There are also three special effect cards that come into play. *Fast Grab: Blue arrows pointing inwards. All players may reach for the totem. The player who successfully grabs the totem puts his discarded cards in the pot and plays the next round. *All Flip: Blue arrows pointing outwards. The player who plays this card counts to three. On three, all players play a card simultaneously, with any other special cards having their effect. In the event this causes a duel between three or more players, the winner of the round may choose who the loser will be, or what duel type is played for. Any additional duels left over are void for the next round. *Color Match: Multicolored arrows pointing inwards. For the remainder of the round (i.e. while the card is still exposed), duels are based on matching colors, and symbol duels do not apply. Once the round ends, normal play resumes. Not used in games with three players or less. Jungle Speed being played If a player commits one of the following errors, or Fouls, they must take all the cards currently in play (the discard piles of all the other players plus all the cards in the pot) and place them at the bottom of their deck. *Grabbing the totem when you are not supposed to according to the active rules. This is the most common error, due to several symbols being similar to each other. *Knocking over, dropping, or otherwise disturbing the totem *Uncovering the top card towards themselves *Using violence against other players to obtain the totem (e.g. knocking an opponent's hand away, blocking their access to the totem, a knee in the box, etc.) *Returning the totem upside down after a duel (with side of the totem with \\"Jungle Speed\\" on it facing down) The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards and have them passed onto other players or the pot. Alternate versions Prawo D≈ºungli an unauthorized Polish version of the game. =New Edition= Asmodee released a new edition in 2011 with an updated design for the cards and, in some markets, a plastic totem for added safety. The expansions are made to be used with this edition of the game. =Expanded Version= The expanded version adds several new symbol variations, as well as new effect cards: *Inner Hands: Hand shaped arrows pointing inwards. All players place one of their hands on top of the totem as quickly as possible without making it fall over. The first to place their hand on the totem is the winner of the round, while the last person is the loser. *Pass it Forward: Blue arrows circulating. Players now match using the cards played by the player on their left. This remains in effect until the next round (i.e. while the card is still exposed), or until another effect card is played. =The Lapins Cretins version= A special version of the game released in France, based on Ubisoft's Raving Rabbids (The Lapin Cretins) series of video games. The game features designs based on the game and comes in a Rabbid shaped sack, which also includes a bonus figurine that is implemented into the game. The key difference is that, after the totem has been grabbed, any player may then grab the Rabbid and give one of the cards in their discard pile to the other player. *Rabbid Hunter (Lapin Chasseur): Rabbids reaching for the totem. Same as Fast Grab. *Hot Rabbid (Chaud Lapin): Totem-shaped Rabbids reaching for a Rabbid. All players reach for the Rabbid figure. The totem may fall over, but must not be grabbed. The player who successfully grabs the Rabbid distributes their discard pile to the other players, beginning with the player of their choice and moving clockwise. *BWAAAAAAAH: Totem-shaped Rabbids with their fingers sticking up. When this card is played, all players must stick their hands over their heads with two fingers sticking up and yell \\"BWAAAAAAH!\\" The last person to do so must take the discard piles of all the players, as well as any cards in the pot. *The Beat (La Battue): A full coloured card showing a totem and several Rabbids with their eyes shut. When this card is played, the players put their decks aside so that the table is clear. All players shut their eyes whilst the player who played the card places the totem anywhere on their table (provided it is reachable by all players). When said player says 'OK', the other players must try to reach the totem with their eyes shut, the winner placing his/her discard pile under the pot. The player who placed the totem will look to see if anyone has their eyes open. Anyone who does must take all the players' discard piles and whatever is under the pot. =Common House Rules= A variety of common but unofficial house rules exist for the original Jungle Speed game. *No Holds Barred: One of the most common house rules is the waiving of the rules against violence over the totem. Violence is encouraged, with the only actually banned move is any contact with the opposing player with the hand not holding the totem. Despite this lack of rules, behavior such as biting, scratching, hair pulling, or attacking sensitive areas such as testicles are strongly discouraged. The struggle can continue until one player holds the totem alone. *Sanctioned Dueling: This rule goes into effect when more than two players have matching cards under the current rules. Whichever player is able to gain control of the totem puts their cards in the center pot, and may then request the other members of the duel to put a finger on a body part. In some variations, this is always the ear, while in others the player running the duel may choose a body part. The players may not grab for the totem until the player running the duel removes their hand from the totem. At this point, the duel continues as normal, and if there are still multiple players with matches the winner of the previous duel sanctions the next one. When no more matches exist, the player who most recently lost a duel continues play as normal. *Ultra Disrespect: In this version the totem is essentially treated as a deity, with disrespectful language or jokes targeted at it, as well as touching it in any way besides to resolve a match, constituting the same punishment (taking all discarded cards) as if one had knocked it over or placed it upside-down. *\\"B-11 rules\\": In this version of the game, the player who touched the totem last is responsible for any disrespectful actions, rather than the person that caused it to fall. This can lead to situations where one player physically manipulates another into disrespect, adding a new layer to the game.

Often referred to as \\"landscape art under glass\\", the Garfield Park Conservatory occupies approximately inside and out and contains a number of permanent plant exhibits incorporating specimens from around the world, including some cycads that are over 200 years old. Along with the Lincoln Park Conservatory on Chicago's north side, the Garfield Park Conservatory provides significant horticultural collections, educational programs and community outreach efforts.\\"Paradise Under Glass: Chicago's Historic Conservatories,\\" Annual Conference of the Alliance for Historic Landscape Preservation, 1999  Conservatory history  The first conservatory in Garfield Park In the late 19th century, each of the three large West Side parks had its own small conservatory and propagation greenhouses. After 20 years of use, these conservatories had fallen into a state of disrepair and had become obsolete. The 'new' conservatory, completed in 1907 In 1905, Chicago's West Park Commission's general superintendent and chief landscape architect, Jens Jensen, demolished the three smaller greenhouses in Humboldt, Douglas, and Garfield parks to create what was intended as \\"the largest publicly owned conservatory under one roof in the world\\" in Garfield Park. Many of the original plantings came from the three smaller Westside conservatories. Constructed between 1906 and 1907, the Garfield Park Conservatory was designed by Jensen in collaboration with Prairie School architects Schmidt, Garden and Martin and the New York engineering firm of Hitchings and Company. It represents a unique collaboration of architects, engineers, landscape architects, sculptors, and artisans. Jensen conceived the conservatory as a series of naturalistic landscapes under glass, a revolutionary idea at the time. The simple yet strong shape of the structure, which is meant to emulate the haystacks of the Midwest, complements the collection of plants and foliage that it houses. View of the Palm Room Today, the conservatory still follows the original tenets of Jensen. One of the most popular rooms is the first presented to visitors, the Palm Room. In it are over 7 dozen varieties of palm trees of the over 2,700 varieties known to exist today. Of particular importance is the double coconut palm, first grown by employees of the conservatory in 1959. The double coconut palm is found only off the coast of South Africa in its native environment and produces what is believed to be the largest seed of any plant in the world, weighing up to . The double coconut palm at the conservatory died of currently unknown causes in February 2012. Because of the species' rarity in the wild, and the challenges of cultivation, it is not expected to be replaced. After many decades of neglect, the conservatory underwent a multimillion-dollar restoration in 1994. The non-profit Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance formed to help maintain the structure and provide programs and services for visitors. In a hailstorm on the night of June 30, 2011, the conservatory suffered catastrophic damage to glass in showrooms as well as production houses where plants are grown or stored. Five recently renovated showrooms contained laminated glass and therefore sustained less damage. Some areas reopened to the public July 3. The Fern Room reopened December 1, 2011, and the remaining areas opened January 24, 2012. In 2012, the conservatory won the National Medal for Museum and Library Services. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Garfield Park Conservatory was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

Later, with the introduction of radio, code letters were also used as radio call signs. History In 1857, the United Kingdom sponsored the Commercial Code of Signals for the Use of All Nations at Sea, which introduced four letter flag signal codes to identify individual ships. The first vessel to be reported in Lloyd's List by her letters was the Mallard (LDPN), off Deal, Kent whilst on a voyage from London to Calcutta, India. The Commercial Code of Signals, c. 1900, was modified to become the International Code of Signals. By the 1860s, individual ships were being allocated code letters in the United States and Europe. From 1874, code letters were recorded in Lloyd's Register as part of each individual vessel's entry in the register. Generally, code letters allocated to a ship remained with that ship, although there are known cases where new code letters have been allocated following a change of port of registry or owner. Code Letters were sometimes reallocated once a ship had been struck from the register, but no two ships bore the same code letters at the same time. With the introduction of radio for communications, code letters were used also as radio call signs.This website has a transcript of radio communications between (OXKA) and FV Johannes Kr√ºss (DEQW). Flags used Code letters used the twenty-six flags that represent the letters of the alphabet, plus the ten flags that represent the digits 0 - 9 also have been used. The substitute flags have not been used for call signs. left Each flag has own name. If the ship's call sign is \\"3EJH2\\" (Panama Flag) the seamen never say \\"Three E J H Two\\". They say \\"Three Echo Juliet Hotel Two\\" to avoid misunderstanding as every country seamen have own pronunciation of letters and during speech over radio letters can be inaudible. If call sign has 4 characters, the first character or figure of ship's call signs means country code for the ships registered under this country flag. If call sign has 5 characters, the first two characters or figure plus character of ship's call signs means country code for the ships registered under this country flag. The variations 4 or 5 characters due to 36 characters (26 letters + 10 digits) are not enough for all countries. For or the Soviet Union was used character \\"U\\" as the first character in call signs: cargo ship Metallurg Anosov had call sign \\"USMW\\" . In case that the ship changes the flag she has to change call sign also. For example, the ship Heinrich Arp: Code Letters \\"RDWL\\" (1923-34) were changed to Code Letters \\"DHKV\\" (1934-45) and from 1946 once more to the Soviet Union Ship's call sign (unknown, but first character was \\"U\\"). If the ship is scrapped or sunk, her call sign can be given to another ship and, usually after a long time. The last three characters of ship's call sign usually mean nothing, but can be one of them used as a code of the government Shipping Companies if the country has more than one Shipping companies.

It became independent in 1821 and has been a republic since the end of Spanish rule. Development of an independent nation (1838‚Äì99) Detail of an 1860 map of Central America. For Honduras, the period of federation had been disastrous. Local rivalries and ideological disputes had produced political chaos and disrupted the economy. The British had taken advantage of the chaotic condition to reestablish their control over the Islas de la Bah√≠a. As a result, Honduras wasted little time in formally seceding from the federation once it was free to do so. Independence was declared on November 15, 1838, and in January 1839, an independent constitution was formally adopted. Francisco Moraz√°n then ruled only El Salvador, and in 1839 his forces there were attacked by a Honduran army commanded by General Francisco Ferrera. Ferrera was defeated but returned to attack again in the summer, only to suffer another defeat. The following year, Moraz√°n himself was overthrown, and two years later he was shot in Costa Rica during a final, futile attempt to restore the United Provinces of Central America.Haggerty and Millet (\\"The development of an independent nation, 1838‚Äì99\\"). For Honduras, the first decades of independence were neither peaceful nor prosperous. The country's political turmoil attracted the ambitions of individuals and nations within and outside of Central America. Even geography contributed to its misfortunes. Alone among the Central American republics, Honduras had a border with the three potential rivals for regional hegemony‚ÄîGuatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. This situation was exacerbated by the political division throughout the isthmus between liberals and conservatives. Any liberal or conservative regime saw a government of the opposite ideology on its borders as a potential threat. In addition, exiled opposition figures tended to gather in states whose governments shared their political affiliation and to use these states as launching pads for efforts to topple their own governments. For the remainder of the century, Honduras's neighbors would constantly interfere in its internal politics. After the fifteen-month interim presidency of Francisco Zelaya y Ayes (1839‚Äì40), conservative General Ferrera became independent Honduras's first elected president. Ferrera's two-year term (1841‚Äì42) was followed by a five-year period in which he alternately named himself president or allowed the congress to name an interim president while he maintained control of the country by holding the post then known as minister of war. Ferrera's last notable act was the unsuccessful attempt to depose the liberal Moraz√°n as president of El Salvador. In 1847 Ferrera allowed fellow conservative Juan Lindo to assume the presidency. Under Lindo's presidency, a new constitution was adopted in 1848, and some effort was made to promote education, but any effort to make substantial improvements in the country's situation was doomed by continuing turmoil. Jose Santos Guardiola was the president of Honduras from 1856 to 1862. During Lindo's presidency (1847‚Äì52), the British began pressuring Honduras for the payment of debts and other claims. In 1849 a British naval force briefly occupied the port of Trujillo, destroying property and extorting 1,200 pesos from the local government. The following year, Lindo's own vice president revolted and was prevented from seizing power only through the military intervention of El Salvador and Nicaragua. All this turmoil may help to explain why Lindo refused an additional presidential term and instead turned over power in 1852 to the opposition liberals, headed by Trinidad Caba√±as (1852‚Äì55). Three years later, the conservative government of Guatemala invaded Honduras and ousted Caba√±as, installing in his place the conservative leader, Jose Santos Guardiola. The fighting between liberals and conservatives was temporarily set aside because of the 1855 appearance in Central America of an American filibuster, William Walker, who established himself as president of Nicaragua in 1856. Caba√±as briefly considered seeking Walker's aid in attempting to return to power. Instead, armies from all the countries of Central America joined to oppose Walker, who was forced to abandon Nicaragua in 1857 and return to the United States. In 1859 the British agreed to a treaty that recognized Honduran sovereignty over the Islas de la Bah√≠a (Bay Islands). Some of the British settlers in the area objected to this transfer and appealed to Walker for help. Walker evidently thought that his return to Central America would be welcomed by the Honduran liberals, who were once again trying to oust Guardiola. Walker landed on the Honduran coast in 1860 but found little support and encountered determined opposition from both the Hondurans and the British. He surrendered to the British, who promptly handed him over to Honduran authorities. A few days later in 1860, he died in front of a Honduran firing squad. The return of the Islas de la Bah√≠a and the death of Walker ended the immediate threat to Honduran territorial integrity, but other Central American nations continued to be involved in Honduran internal affairs. Guardiola was assassinated by his own honor guard in 1862, and the following decade witnessed the presidency change hands almost twenty times. General Jos√© Mar√≠a Medina served as president or dictator eleven times during that period, but Guatemalan intervention in 1876 drove him and his conservative supporters from power. upright From 1876 until 1882, liberal president Marco Aurelio Soto governed Honduras with the support of Guatemalan strongman General Justo Rufino Barrios. Soto succeeded not only in restoring order but also in implementing some basic reforms in finance, education, and public administration. But in 1883, he too fell into disfavor with Barrios and was forced to resign. His successor, General Luis Bogr√°n, survived in office until 1891 when General Ponciano Leiva (who had ruled briefly three times from 1873‚Äì76) was returned to power in a manipulated election. Although a liberal, Leiva tried to rule as an absolute dictator, dissolving the fledgling Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras, PLH) and deporting its leaders. The result was another round of civil conflict from which the reconstituted PLH ultimately emerged victorious. The PLH was led by Policarpo Bonilla, with the support of Nicaragua's liberal dictator, Jos√© Santos Zelaya. When Bonilla assumed power in 1894, he began to restore a limited degree of order to the Honduran political scene. Another constitution was promulgated in 1895, and Bonilla was elected to a four-year term. Bonilla's administration revised civil codes, improved communications, and began an effort to resolve the long-standing boundary dispute with Nicaragua. Bonilla also ensured that in 1899, at the end of his term, he would be succeeded by his military commander, General Terencio Sierra. The combined impact of civil strife and foreign interventions had doomed Honduras to a position of relative economic and social backwardness throughout the nineteenth century. The country had remained overwhelmingly rural; Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, and San Pedro Sula were the only towns of any size. In the early 1850s, the total population was estimated at 350,000, the overwhelming majority of whom were mestizos. By 1914 the population had grown to only 562,000. Opportunities for education and culture were limited at best. Mid-nineteenth century records indicate that Honduras had no libraries and no regularly published newspapers. Two universities were maintained, although their quality was questionable. By the 1870s, only 275 schools, having approximately 9,000 pupils, existed in the entire country. In 1873‚Äì74, the government budgeted only the equivalent of US$720 for education, a sum designated for the national university. Economic situation At the end of the colonial period, Honduras' economy was based largely on mining, cattle raising and the export of tropical hardwoods. Unlike most of its neighbors, Honduras did not develop a significant coffee industry, and one of the results of this was that much of its export wealth ended up being generated by foreign firms, often creating little local capital. For much of the nineteenth century, Hondurans looked to mining as a means of improving their economic position.Dario Euraque, Reinterpreting the Banana Republic: Region and State in Honduras, 1870‚Äì1972 (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1996) pp. 3‚Äì13. The mining industry had fallen into severe neglect in the first decades of the century, however. Many mines had been abandoned and flooded. During the years following independence, efforts to revive the industry were generally frustrating for both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Effort after effort was abandoned because of civil disturbances, lack of transportation, and poor health conditions. Mining was revived somewhat in the 1880s, when liberal reforms made foreign investment in mining interesting. A key factor in this revival was the activity of Washington S. Valentine's New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC), which had expanded rapidly and had become a major economic and political power within Honduras, not only in silver mining, but in railroad building (the InterOceanic Railroad).Euraque, Banana Republic, pp. 9‚Äì12. Owing in part to the company's efforts, the Honduran government had allowed foreign mining companies to operate in Honduras with a minimum of restrictions and a virtual exemption from taxes. By 1889 the company was annually shipping bullion with a value of over US$700,000 to the United States. Profits from this operation were extremely high; the company's dividends for the first half of 1889 totaled US$150,000. The NYHRMC's success attracted other companies to Honduras, and gold and silver exports became the principal source of foreign exchange for the rest of the century. The NYHRMC's success stood alone, however; most of the nearly 100 other companies were total failures. The Yuscar√°n Mining and Milling Company sold over US$5 million in stock but failed to begin effective production. By the end of the nineteenth century, the brief mining boom was in decline, although the NYHRMC would remain a major factor in the Honduran economy until the mid-twentieth century. Although mining had provided foreign exchange, the vast majority of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, put a damper on efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bah√≠a, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit for the rest of the nation almost imperceptible. =Growth of the banana industry (1899‚Äì1906)= As bananas emerged as an export after the 1870s, first from the Bay Islands and the mainland, foreign (mostly U.S.) shipping companies began taking the crop to the United States. In 1889 the Vaccaro brothers of New Orleans, founders of what would become the Standard Fruit and Steamship Company (later known as Standard Fruit Company, and then as Dole), shipped their first boatload of bananas from Honduras to New Orleans. The fruit found a ready market, and the trade grew rapidly. By 1902 local railroad lines were being constructed on the Caribbean coast to accommodate the expanding banana production.Haggerty and Millet (\\"The growth of the banana industry\\"). The economic dominance and political influence of these companies was so great from the late 19th until the mid 20th century that Honduras became the original model for the banana republic.The original term, used by U. S. author O. Henry, applied to a fictional country called \\"Anchuria\\" in his book Cabbages and Kings (1904). Banana production in northern Honduras began in the 1880s and was largely in the hands of local people. A census of 1899 revealed that northern Honduras that over 1,000 people in the region between Puerto Cortes and La Ceiba (and inland as far as San Pedro Sula) were tending bananas, most of them small holders.Soluri, Banana Culture: Agriculture, Consumption, and Environmental Change in Honduras and the United States (Austin: University of Texas Press: 2005) The fruit companies received very large concessions of land on which to grow bananas, often forcing small holders who had been growing and exporting bananas off their land or out of business. In addition, they brought in many workers from the British West Indies, especially Jamaica and Belize, both to work on the plantations, but also as lower managers and skilled workers. The companies often favored the West Indian workers because they spoke English and were sometimes better educated than their Honduran counterparts. This perception of foreign occupation, coupled with a growing race-prejudice against the African- descended West Indians led to considerable tension, as the arrival of the West Indians drove demographic change in the region.Glen Chambers, Race Nation and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890‚Äì1940 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010). Standard Fruit was joined by new rivals, Samuel Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company, and the United Fruit Company, all of which tended to be vertically integrated, owning their own lands and railroad companies and ship lines such as United's \\"Great White Fleet\\". Through land subsidies granted to the railroads, by 1920 they controlled vast tracts of the best land along the Caribbean coast. Coastal cities such as La Ceiba, Tela, and Trujillo and towns further inland such as El Progreso an La Lima became virtual company towns. Political issues and U. S. intervention For the next twenty years, the U.S. government was involved in quelling Central American disputes, insurrections, and revolutions, whether supported by neighboring governments or by United States companies. As part of the so- called Banana Wars all around the Caribbean, Honduras saw the insertion of American troops in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.http://www2.truman.edu/~marc/resources/interventions.html For instance, in 1917 the Cuyamel Fruit Company extended its rail lines into disputed Guatemalan territory. upright Although the peaceful transfer of power from Bonilla to General Sierra in 1899 was important as the first time in decades that such a constitutional transition had taken place, that year was a watershed in another, even more important, sense. Sierra's efforts to perpetuate himself in office led to his overthrow in 1903 by General Manuel Bonilla, who proved to be an even greater friend of the banana companies than Sierra had been. Companies gained exemptions from taxes and permission to construct wharves and roads, as well as permission to improve interior waterways and to obtain charters for new railroad construction. Conservative Manuel Bonilla was an opponent rather than a relative or friend of Sierra's liberal predecessor, Policarpo Bonilla. During Manuel Bonilla's term in office, he imprisoned ex-president Policarpo Bonilla for over two years and took other steps to suppress his political opposition, the liberals, who were the only group with an organized political party. The conservatives were divided into a host of personalist factions and lacked coherent leadership. Manuel Bonilla made some efforts to reorganize the conservatives into a \\"national party.\\" The present-day National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH) traces its origins to his administration. Manuel Bonilla promoted some internal improvements, notably road building. He improved the route from Tegucigalpa to the Pacific coast. On the international front, he concluded friendship pacts with Nicaragua and later with Guatemala and El Salvador. Of perhaps greatest significance was the work accomplished during Manuel Bonillo's administration to delineate the long-disputed border with Nicaragua. The area, called the Mosquitia region, was located in the eastern part of the country in the department of Gracias a Dios. The area was large but virtually unpopulated except for small groups of Miskito who owed little allegiance to either nation. In 1894 a treaty provided for the establishment of a boundary commission, composed of representatives of Honduras and Nicaragua, to resolve the dispute. By 1904 the commission had been able to agree on only the lower part of the boundary. In that year, to reach agreement on the upper part, the representatives of the two nations picked King Alfonso XIII of Spain as a neutral, third member of the commission, in effect making him the arbiter. His decision, announced in 1906, gave the bulk of the disputed territory to Honduras, establishing the upper boundary line along the R√≠o Coco. At the time, both governments accepted the decision, but in 1912 Nicaragua raised new objections. The dispute was finally resolved in favor of the 1906 arbitration only in 1960. In 1906 Manuel Bonilla successfully resisted an invasion from Guatemala, but this was his last major success. The friendship pact with Guatemala and El Salvador signed in 1906 was interpreted as an anti-Nicaraguan alliance by the Nicaraguans. Nicaragua's powerful President Zelaya began to support exiled Honduran liberals in their efforts to topple Manuel Bonilla, who had become, in effect, the Honduran dictator. Supported by elements of the Nicaraguan army, the exiles invaded Honduras in February 1907 and established a provisional junta. With the assistance of Salvadoran troops, Manuel Bonilla tried to resist, but in March his forces were decisively beaten in a battle notable for the introduction of machine guns into Central American civil strife. Expanded role of the United States (1907‚Äì1919) Until the early twentieth century, the United States had played only a very limited role in internal Honduran political clashes. Because there was not a resident United States minister in Tegucigalpa, the minister to Guatemala had been accredited for that position. The presence of the United States in the Caribbean increased following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898), however. The decision to build a canal through Panama and expanded commercial activities led to a more active role for the United States government, as well as for United States companies.Haggerty and Millet (\\"The expanded role of the United States\\"). By 1907 the United States looked with considerable disfavor on the role Zelaya of Nicaragua was playing in regional affairs. When the Nicaraguan army entered Honduras in 1907 to overthrow Bonilla, the United States government, believing that Zelaya wanted to dominate the entire region, landed marines at Puerto Cort√©s to protect the North American bananas trade. Other United States naval units prevented a Nicaraguan attack on Bonilla's last position at Amapala in the Golfo de Fonseca. After negotiations conducted by the United States naval commander, Manuel Bonilla sought refuge on the USS Chicago, and the fighting came to an end. The United States charg√© d'affaires in Tegucigalpa took an active role in arranging a final peace settlement, with which Zelaya was less than happy. The settlement provided for the installation of a compromise regime, headed by General Miguel D√°vila, in Tegucigalpa. D√°vila was a liberal but was distrusted by Zelaya, who made a secret arrangement with El Salvador to oust him from office. This plan failed to reach fruition, but the United States, alarmed by the threat of renewed conflict in Central America, called the five Central American presidents to a conference in Washington in November. The opening session of the Central American Peace Conference, 1907. The Central American Peace Conference of 1907 made a major effort to reduce the level of conflict within the region. A Honduran proposal to reestablish the political union of the Central American states failed to achieve acceptance, but several other measures were adopted. The five presidents signed the General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1907 pledging themselves to establish the permanent Central American Court of Justice, which would resolve future disputes. The treaty also committed the five countries to restrict the activities of exiles from neighboring states and provided the basis for legal extraditions. Of special interest was a United States-sponsored clause that provided for the permanent neutrality of Honduras in any future Central American conflicts. Another convention adopted by all five states committed the signers to withhold recognition from governments that seized power by revolutionary means. The United States and Mexico, which had acted as cosponsors of the conference, indicated informally that they would also deny recognition to such governments. From the point of view of the United States Department of State, these agreements represented a major step toward stabilizing Central America in general and Honduras in particular. The first test of the new treaty involved Honduras. In 1908 opponents of President D√°vila, probably supported by Guatemala and El Salvador, invaded the country. Nicaragua supported the Honduran president, and war seemed imminent. Perhaps motivated by the possibility of United States intervention, however, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to the new Central American court. The court ultimately rejected the Honduran and Nicaraguan complaints, but in the meantime the revolt collapsed, thus briefly restoring peace to Honduras. Along with fighting off efforts to overthrow him, President D√°vila made some attempts to modernize Honduras. He invited a Chilean officer to establish a regular military academy, which failed to survive beyond his time in office. Like his predecessor, D√°vila encouraged the activities of the banana companies. The companies, however, were less than totally happy with him, viewing his administration as ineffective. In addition, rivalry among the companies became a factor in Honduran politics. In 1910 D√°vila's administration granted the Vaccaro brothers a generous rail concession that included a provision prohibiting any rival line within twenty kilometers. This concession angered Samuel Zemurray of the newly formed Cuyamel Fruit Company. Zemurray had encouraged and even helped finance the 1908 invasion and was to continue to make trouble for the D√°vila administration. Despite the failure of the 1908 uprising, the United States remained concerned over Honduran instability. The administration of William Howard Taft saw the huge Honduran debt, over US$120 million, as a contributing factor to this instability and began efforts to refinance the largely British debt with provisions for a United States customs receivership or some similar arrangement. Negotiations were arranged between Honduran representatives and New York bankers, headed by J.P. Morgan. By the end of 1909, an agreement had been reached providing for a reduction in the debt and the issuance of new 5 percent bonds: the bankers would control the Honduran railroad, and the United States government would guarantee continued Honduran independence and would take control of customs revenue. The terms proposed by the bankers met with considerable opposition in Honduras, further weakening the D√°vila government. A treaty incorporating the key provisions was finally signed in January 1911 and submitted to the Honduran legislature by D√°vila. However, that body, in a rare display of independence, rejected it by a vote of thirty-three to five. An uprising in 1911 against D√°vila interrupted efforts to deal with the debt problem. The United States stepped in to mediate the conflict, bringing both sides to a conference on one of its warships. The revolutionaries, headed by former president Manuel Bonilla, and the government agreed to a cease-fire and the installation of a provisional president who would be selected by the United States mediator, Thomas Dawson. Dawson selected Francisco Bertrand, who promised to hold early, free elections, and D√°vila resigned. The 1912 elections were won by Manuel Bonilla, but he died after just over a year in office. Bertrand, who had been his vice president, returned to the presidency and in 1916 won election for a term that lasted until 1920. A railroad station in La Ceiba, c. 1915. The relative stability of the 1911‚Äì20 period was difficult to maintain. Revolutionary intrigues continued throughout the period, accompanied by constant rumors that one faction or another was being supported by one of the banana companies. Rivalry among these companies had escalated in 1910 when the United Fruit Company had entered Honduras. In 1913 United Fruit established the Tela Railroad Company and shortly thereafter a similar subsidiary, the Trujillo Railroad Company. The railroad companies were given huge land subsidies by the Honduran government for each kilometer of track they constructed. The government expected that in exchange for land the railroad companies would ultimately build a national rail system, providing the capital with its long-sought access to the Caribbean. The banana companies, however, had other ideas in mind. They used the railroads to open up new banana lands, rather than to reach existing cities. Through the resultant land subsidies, they soon came to control the overwhelming share of the best land along the Caribbean coast. Coastal cities such as La Ceiba, Tela, and Trujillo and towns further inland such as El Progreso and La Lima became virtual company towns, and the power of the companies often exceeded the authority wielded in the region by local governments. For the next two decades, the United States government was involved in opposing Central American revolutions whether the revolutions were supported by foreign governments or by United States companies. During the 1912‚Äì21 period, warships were frequently dispatched to areas of revolutionary activity, both to protect United States interests and to exert a dampening effect on the revolutionaries. In 1917 the disputes among the companies threatened to involve Honduras in a war with Guatemala. The Cuyamel Fruit Company, supported by the Honduran government, had begun to extend its rail lines into disputed territory along the Guatemalan border. The Guatemalans, supported by the United Fruit Company, sent troops into the area, and it seemed for a time that war might break out. United States mediation ended the immediate threat, but the dispute smoldered until 1930 when a second United States mediation finally produced a settlement. The development of the banana industry contributed to the beginnings of organized labor movements in Honduras and to the first major strikes in the nation's history. The first of these occurred in 1917 against the Cuyamel Fruit Company. The strike was suppressed by the Honduran military, but the following year additional labor disturbances occurred at the Standard Fruit Company's holding in La Ceiba. In 1920 a general strike hit the Caribbean coast. In response, a United States warship was dispatched to the area, and the Honduran government began arresting leaders. When Standard Fruit offered a new wage equivalent to US$1.75 per day, the strike ultimately collapsed. Labor troubles in the banana area, however, were far from ended. World War I had a generally negative impact on Honduras. In 1914 banana prices began to fall, and, in addition, the war reduced the overall amount of agricultural exports. The United States entry into the war in 1917 diverted ships to the war effort, making imported goods, such as textiles, scarce. The shortages of goods in turn led to inflation, and the decline in trade reduced government revenues from tariffs. The banana companies, however, continued to prosper; Standard Fruit reported earnings of nearly US$2.5 million in 1917. Despite its problems, Honduras supported the United States war effort and declared war on Germany in 1918. The threat of renewed instability (1919‚Äì24) Rafael L√≥pez Guti√©rrez served as president of Honduras from 1920 to 1924. In 1919 it became obvious that Bertrand would refuse to allow an open election to choose his successor. Such a course of action was opposed by the United States and had little popular support in Honduras. The local military commander and governor of Tegucigalpa, General Rafael L√≥pez Guti√©rrez, took the lead in organizing PLH opposition to Bertrand. L√≥pez Guti√©rrez also solicited support from the liberal government of Guatemala and even from the conservative regime in Nicaragua. Bertrand, in turn, sought support from El Salvador. Determined to avoid an international conflict, the United States, after some hesitation, offered to meditate the dispute, hinting to the Honduran president that if he refused the offer, open intervention might follow.Haggerty and Millet (\\"The threat of renewed instability, 1919‚Äì24\\"). Bertrand promptly resigned and left the country. The United States ambassador helped arrange the installation of an interim government headed by Francisco Bogr√°n, who promised to hold free elections. However, General L√≥pez Guti√©rrez, who now effectively controlled the military situation, made it clear that he was determined to be the next president. After considerable negotiation and some confusion, a formula was worked out under which elections were held. L√≥pez Guti√©rrez won easily in a manipulated election, and in October 1920 he assumed the presidency. During Bogr√°n's brief time in office, he had agreed to a United States proposal to invite a United States financial adviser to Honduras. Arthur N. Young of the Department of State was selected for this task and began work in Honduras in August 1920, continuing to August 1921. While there, Young compiled extensive data and made numerous recommendations, even persuading the Hondurans to hire a New York police lieutenant to reorganize their police forces. Young's investigations clearly demonstrated the desperate need for major financial reforms in Honduras, whose always precarious budgetary situation was considerably worsened by the renewal of revolutionary activities. In 1919, for example, the military had spent more than double the amount budgeted for them, accounting for over 57 percent of all federal expenditures. Young's recommendations for reducing the military budget, however, found little favor with the new L√≥pez Guti√©rrez administration, and the government's financial condition remained a major problem. If anything, continued uprisings against the government and the threat of a renewed Central America conflict made the situation even worse. From 1919 to 1924, the Honduran government expended US$7.2 million beyond the amount covered by the regular budgets for military operations. From 1920 through 1923, seventeen uprisings or attempted coups in Honduras contributed to growing United States concern over political instability in Central America. In August 1922, the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador met on the in the Golfo de Fonseca. Under the watchful eye of the United States ambassadors to their nations, the presidents pledged to prevent their territories from being used to promote revolutions against their neighbors and issued a call for a general meeting of Central American states in Washington at the end of the year. The Washington conference concluded in February with the adoption of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1923, which had eleven supplemental conventions. The treaty in many ways followed the provisions of the 1907 treaty. The Central American court was reorganized, reducing the influence of the various governments over its membership. The clause providing for withholding recognition of revolutionary governments was expanded to preclude recognition of any revolutionary leader, his relatives, or anyone who had been in power six months before or after such an uprising unless the individual's claim to power had been ratified by free elections. The governments renewed their pledges to refrain from aiding revolutionary movements against their neighbors and to seek peaceful resolutions for all outstanding disputes. The supplemental conventions covered everything from the promotion of agriculture to the limitation of armaments. One, which remained unratified, provided for free trade among all of the states except Costa Rica. The arms limitation agreement set a ceiling on the size of each nation's military forces (2,500 men for Honduras) and included a United States- sponsored pledge to seek foreign assistance in establishing more professional armed forces. The October 1923 Honduran presidential elections and the subsequent political and military conflicts provided the first real tests of these new treaty arrangements. Under heavy pressure from Washington, L√≥pez Guti√©rrez allowed an unusually open campaign and election. The long-fragmented conservatives had reunited in the form of the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH), which ran as its candidate General Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino, the governor of the department of Cort√©s. However, the liberal PLH was unable to unite around a single candidate and split into two groups, one supporting former president Policarpo Bonilla, the other advancing the candidacy of Juan Angel Arias. As a result, no candidate secured a majority. Car√≠as received the greatest number of votes, with Bonilla second, and Arias a distant third. By the terms of the Honduran constitution, this stalemate left the final choice of president up to the legislature, but that body was unable to obtain a quorum and reach a decision. In January 1924, L√≥pez Guti√©rrez announced his intention to remain in office until new elections could be held, but he repeatedly refused to specify a date for the elections. Car√≠as, reportedly with the support of United Fruit, declared himself president, and an armed conflict broke out. In February the United States, warning that recognition would be withheld from anyone coming to power by revolutionary means, suspended relations with the L√≥pez Guti√©rrez government for its failure to hold elections. Conditions rapidly deteriorated in the early months of 1924. On February 28, a pitched battle took place in La Ceiba between government troops and rebels. Even the presence of the USS Denver and the landing of a force of United States Marines were unable to prevent widespread looting and arson resulting in over US$2 million in property damage. Fifty people, including a United States citizen, were killed in the fighting. In the weeks that followed, additional vessels from the United States Navy Special Service Squadron were concentrated in Honduran waters, and landing parties were put ashore at various points to protect United States interests. One force of marines and sailors was even dispatched inland to Tegucigalpa to provide additional protection for the United States legation. Shortly before the arrival of the force, L√≥pez Guti√©rrez died, and what authority remained with the central government was being exercised by his cabinet. General Car√≠as and a variety of other rebel leaders controlled most of the countryside but failed to coordinate their activities effectively enough to seize the capital. In an effort to end the fighting, the United States government dispatched Sumner Welles to the port of Amapala; he had instructions to try to produce a settlement that would bring to power a government eligible for recognition under the terms of the 1923 treaty. Negotiations, which were once again held on board a United States cruiser, lasted from April 23 to April 28. An agreement was worked out that provided for an interim presidency headed by General Vicente Tosta, who agreed to appoint a cabinet representing all political factions and to convene a Constituent Assembly within ninety days to restore constitutional order. Presidential elections were to be held as soon as possible, and Tosta promised to refrain from being a candidate. Once in office, the new president showed signs of reneging on some of his pledges, especially those related to the appointment of a bipartisan cabinet. Under heavy pressure from the United States delegation, however, he ultimately complied with the provisions of the peace agreement. Keeping the 1924 elections on track proved to be a difficult task. To put pressure on Tosta to conduct a fair election, the United States continued an embargo on arms to Honduras and barred the government from access to loans‚Äîincluding a requested US$75,000 from the Banco Atl√°ntida. Furthermore, the United States persuaded El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua to join in declaring that, under the 1923 treaty provision, no leader of the recent revolution would be recognized as president for the coming term. These pressures ultimately helped persuade Car√≠as to withdraw his candidacy and also helped ensure the defeat of an uprising led by General of the PNH. The PNH nominated Miguel Paz Barahona (1925‚Äì29), a civilian, for president. The PLH, after some debate, refused to nominate a candidate, and on December 28 Paz Barahona won virtual unanimous election. The restoration of order (1925‚Äì31) Despite another minor uprising led by General Ferrera in 1925, Paz Barahona's administration was, by Honduran standards, rather tranquil. The banana companies continued to expand, the government's budgetary situation improved, and there was even an increase in labor organizing. On the international front, the Honduran government, after years of negotiations, finally concluded an agreement with the British bondholders to liquidate most of the immense national debt. The bonds were to be redeemed at 20 percent of face value over a thirty-year period. Back interest was forgiven, and new interest accrued only over the last fifteen years of this arrangement. Under the terms of this agreement, Honduras, at last, seemed on the road to fiscal solvency.Haggerty and Millet (\\"The restoration of order, 1925‚Äì31\\"). Fears of disturbances increased again in 1928 as the scheduled presidential elections approached. The ruling PNH nominated General Car√≠as while the PLH, united again following the death of Policarpo Bonilla in 1926, nominated Vicente Mej√≠a Colindres. To the surprise of most observers, both the campaign and the election were conducted with a minimum of violence and intimidation. Mej√≠a Colindres won a decisive victory‚Äîobtaining 62,000 votes to 47,000 for Car√≠as. Even more surprising was Car√≠as's public acceptance of defeat and his urging of his supporters to accept the new government. Mej√≠a Colindres took office in 1929 with high hopes for his administration and his nation. Honduras seemed on the road to political and economic progress. Banana exports, then accounting for 80 percent of all exports, continued to expand. By 1930 Honduras had become the world's leading producer of the fruit, accounting for one-third of the world's supply of bananas. United Fruit had come increasingly to dominate the trade, and in 1929 it bought out the Cuyamel Fruit Company, one of its two principal remaining rivals. Because conflicts between these companies had frequently led to support for rival groups in Honduran politics, had produced a border controversy with Guatemala, and may have even contributed to revolutionary disturbances, this merger seemed to promise greater domestic tranquility. The prospect for tranquility was further advanced in 1931 when Ferrera was killed while leading one last unsuccessful effort to overthrow the government. Many of Mej√≠a Colindres's hopes, however, were dashed with the onset of the Great Depression. Banana exports peaked in 1930, then declined rapidly. Thousands of workers were laid off, and the wages of those remaining on the job were reduced, as were the prices paid to independent banana producers by the giant fruit companies. Strikes and other labor disturbances began to break out in response to these conditions, but most were quickly suppressed with the aid of government troops. As the depression deepened, the government's financial situation deteriorated; in 1931 Mej√≠a Colindres was forced to borrow US$250,000 from the fruit companies to ensure that the army would continue to be paid.

In 1955‚Äîafter two authoritarian administrations and a general strike initiated by banana workers‚Äîyoung military reformists staged a coup that installed a provisional junta and paved the way for constituent assembly elections in 1957. This assembly appointed Ram√≥n Villeda Morales as President and transformed itself into a national legislature with a 6-year term. In 1963, conservative military officers preempted constitutional elections and deposed Villeda in a bloody coup. The armed forces, led by Gen. Oswaldo L√≥pez Arellano, governed until 1970. Popular discontent continued to rise after a 1969 border war with El Salvador, known as the \\"Soccer War\\". A civilian President‚ÄîRam√≥n Ernesto Cruz of the National Party‚Äîtook power briefly in 1970 but proved unable to manage the government. In 1972, Gen. Lopez staged another coup. Lopez adopted more progressive policies, including land reform, but his regime was brought down in the mid-1970s by corruption scandals. The regimes of Gen. Juan Alberto Melgar Castro (1975‚Äì78) and Gen. Policarpo Paz Garc√≠a (1978‚Äì82) largely built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system of Honduras. The country also enjoyed its most rapid economic growth during this period, due to greater international demand for its products and the availability of foreign commercial lending. Following the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua in 1979 and general instability in El Salvador at the time, Hondurans elected a constituent assembly in 1980 and voted in general elections in 1981; the Liberal Party government of President Roberto Suazo C√≥rdova took office. The era of Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino, 1932‚Äì1954 Despite growing unrest and severe economic strains, the 1932 presidential elections in Honduras were relatively peaceful and fair. The peaceful transition of power was surprising because the onset of the depression had led to the overthrow of governments elsewhere throughout Latin America, in nations with much stronger democratic traditions than those of Honduras. Vicente Mej√≠a Colindres, however, resisted pressure from his own party to manipulate the results to favor the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras, PLH) candidate, Angel Z√∫√±iga Huete. As a result, the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH) candidate, Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino, won the election by a margin of some 20,000 votes. On November 16, 1932, Car√≠as assumed office, beginning what was to be the longest period of continuous rule by an individual in Honduran history. Lacking was any immediate indication that the Car√≠as administration was destined to survive any longer than most of its predecessors. Shortly before Car√≠as's inauguration, dissident liberals, despite the opposition of Mej√≠a Colindres, had risen in revolt. Car√≠as had taken command of the government forces, obtained arms from El Salvador, and crushed the uprising in short order. Most of Car√≠as's first term in office was devoted to efforts to avoid financial collapse, improve the military, engage in a limited program of road building, and lay the foundations for prolonging his own hold on power. The economic situation remained extremely bad throughout the 1930s. In addition to the dramatic drop in banana exports caused by the depression, the Honduran banana industry was further threatened by the outbreak in 1935 of epidemics of Panama disease (a debilitating fungus) and black sigatoka (leaf blight) in banana- producing areas. Within a year, most of the country's production was threatened. Large areas, including most of those around Trujillo, were abandoned, and thousands of Hondurans were thrown out of work. By 1937 a means of controlling the disease had been found, but many of the affected areas remained out of production because a significant share of the market formerly held by Honduras had shifted to other nations. Car√≠as had made efforts to improve the military even before he became president. Once in office, both his capacity and his motivation to continue and to expand such improvements increased. He gave special attention to the fledgling air force, founding the Military Aviation School in 1934 and arranging for a United States colonel to serve as its commandant. As months passed, Car√≠as moved slowly but steadily to strengthen his hold on power. He gained the support of the banana companies through opposition to strikes and other labor disturbances. He strengthened his position with domestic and foreign financial circles through conservative economic policies. Even in the height of the depression, he continued to make regular payments on the Honduran debt, adhering strictly to the terms of the arrangement with the British bondholders and also satisfying other creditors. Two small loans were paid off completely in 1935. Political controls were instituted slowly under Car√≠as. The Communist Party of Honduras (Partido Comunista de Honduras, PCH) was outlawed, but the PLH continued to function, and even the leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were later offered free air transportation should they wish to return to Honduras from their exile abroad. At the end of 1935, however, stressing the need for peace and internal order, Car√≠as began to crack down on the opposition press and political activities. Meanwhile, the PNH, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only the continuance of Car√≠as in office could give the nation continued peace and order. The constitution, however, prohibited immediate reelection of presidents. The method chosen by Car√≠as to extend his term of office was to call a constituent assembly that would write a new constitution and select the individual to serve for the first presidential term under that document. Except for the president's desire to perpetuate himself in office, there seemed little reason to alter the nation's basic charter. Earlier constituent assemblies had written thirteen constitutions (only ten of which had entered into force), and the latest had been adopted in 1924. The handpicked Constituent Assembly of 1936 incorporated thirty of the articles of the 1924 document into the 1936 constitution. The major changes were the elimination of the prohibition on immediate reelection of a president and vice president and the extension of the presidential term from four to six years. Other changes included restoration of the death penalty, reductions in the powers of the legislature, and denial of citizenship and therefore the right to vote to women. Finally, the new constitution included an article specifying that the incumbent president and vice president would remain in office until 1943. But Car√≠as, by then a virtual dictator, wanted even more, so in 1939 the legislature, now completely controlled by the PNH, obediently extended his term in office by another six years (to 1949). The PLH and other opponents of the government reacted to these changes by attempting to overthrow Car√≠as. Numerous efforts were made in 1936 and 1937, but all were successful only in further weakening the PNH's opponents. By the end of the 1930s, the PNH was the only organized functioning political party in the nation. Numerous opposition leaders had been imprisoned, and some had reportedly been chained and put to work in the streets of Tegucigalpa. Others, including the leader of the PLH, Z√∫√±iga Huete, had fled into exile. = 1940s = During his presidency, Car√≠as cultivated close relations with his fellow Central American dictators, generals Jorge Ubico in Guatemala, Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez in El Salvador, and Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a in Nicaragua. Relations were particularly close with Ubico, who helped Car√≠as reorganize his secret police and also captured and shot the leader of a Honduran uprising who had made the mistake of crossing into Guatemalan territory. Relations with Nicaragua were somewhat more strained as a result of the continuing border dispute, but Car√≠as and Somoza managed to keep this dispute under control throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The value of these ties became somewhat questionable in 1944 when popular revolts in Guatemala and El Salvador deposed Ubico and Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez. For a time, it seemed as if revolutionary contagion might spread to Honduras as well. A plot, involving some military officers as well as opposition civilians, had already been discovered and crushed in late 1943. In May 1944, a group of women began demonstrating outside of the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa, demanding the release of political prisoners. Despite strong government measures, tension continued to grow, and Car√≠as was ultimately forced to release some prisoners. This gesture failed to satisfy the opposition, and antigovernment demonstrations continued to spread. In July several demonstrators were killed by troops in San Pedro Sula. In October a group of exiles invaded Honduras from El Salvador but were unsuccessful in their efforts to topple the government. The military remained loyal, and Car√≠as continued in office. Anxious to curb further disorders in the region, the United States began to urge Car√≠as to step aside and allow free elections when his current term in office expired. Car√≠as, who by then was in his early seventies, ultimately yielded to these pressures and announced October 1948 elections, in which he would refrain from being a candidate. He continued, however, to find ways to use his power. The PNH nominated Car√≠as's choice for president‚ÄîJuan Manuel G√°lvez, who had been minister of war since 1933. Exiled opposition figures were allowed to return to Honduras, and the PLH, trying to overcome years of inactivity and division, nominated Z√∫√±iga Huete, the same individual whom Car√≠as had defeated in 1932. The PLH rapidly became convinced that it had no chance to win and, charging the government with manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This act gave G√°lvez a virtually unopposed victory, and in January 1949, he assumed the presidency. Evaluating the Car√≠as presidency is a difficult task. His tenure in office provided the nation with a badly needed period of relative peace and order. The country's fiscal situation improved steadily, education improved slightly, the road network expanded, and the armed forces were modernized. At the same time, nascent democratic institutions withered, opposition and labor activities were suppressed, and national interests at times were sacrificed to benefit supporters and relatives of Car√≠as or major foreign interests. Once in office, G√°lvez demonstrated more independence than had generally been anticipated. Some policies of the Car√≠as administration, such as road building and the development of coffee exports, were continued and expanded. By 1953 nearly one-quarter of the government's budget was devoted to road construction. G√°lvez also continued most of the prior administration's fiscal policies, reducing the external debt and ultimately paying off the last of the British bonds. The fruit companies continued to receive favorable treatment at the hands of the G√°lvez administration; for example, the United Fruit Company received a highly favorable twenty-five-year contract in 1949. Galvez, however, instituted some notable alterations from the preceding fifteen years. Education received increased attention and began to receive a larger share of the national budget. Congress actually passed an income tax law, although enforcement was sporadic at best. The most obvious change was in the political arena. A considerable degree of press freedom was restored, the PLH and other groups were allowed to organize, and even some labor organization was permitted. Labor also benefited from legislation during this period. Congress passed, and the president signed, legislation establishing the eight-hour workday, paid holidays for workers, limited employer responsibility for work- related injuries, and regulations for the employment of women and children. Labor unrest and political transition 1954‚Äì1957 The relative peace that Honduras had enjoyed for nearly two decades was shattered by a series of events during 1954, G√°lvez's last year in office. Tension throughout the region had been increasing steadily as a confrontation developed between the United States and the left-leaning government of President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm√°n in Guatemala. Part of the confrontation involved the expropriation of United Fruit Company lands and charges that the Guatemalan government was encouraging agitation among the banana workers. In 1952, the United States had begun considering actions to overthrow the Guatemalan government. Honduras had given asylum to several exiled opponents of Arbenz, including Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas, but G√°lvez was reluctant to cooperate in direct actions against Guatemala, and the plans were not activated. By early 1954, however, a major covert operation against Guatemala was being organized, this time with greater Honduran cooperation. One reason for the cooperation was the Honduran government's concern over increased labor tensions in the banana-producing areas, tensions that the fruit companies blamed, in part, on Guatemalan influence. Starting in early May 1954, the tensions escalated to strikes. First, a series of strikes broke out against United Fruit Company operations on Honduras's Caribbean coast. Within a few days, the strike spread to include the Standard Fruit Company operations, bringing the banana industry in the country to a near standstill. The strikers presented a wide range of grievances, involving wages, working conditions, medical benefits, overtime pay, and the right to collective bargaining. Initial government efforts to end the strike failed, and work stoppages began to spread into other industries. By May 21, the number of strikers was approaching 30,000, and the nation's economy was under severe strain. As the strike was spreading, Honduras was also becoming more deeply involved in the movement to topple the Arbenz government in Guatemala. In late May, a military assistance agreement was concluded between the United States and Honduras, and large quantities of United States arms were quickly shipped to Honduras. Much of this incoming assistance was passed on to anti-Arbenz rebels commanded by Castillo Armas. In June these forces crossed into Guatemala and after several days of political maneuvering but little actual fighting, Arbenz fled into exile, and Castillo Armas became president. With the spectre of foreign influence over the strike thus removed, negotiations began, and the strike ended in early July. Labor leaders who had been accused of having ties with Guatemala were jailed, and the final settlement, which met few of the original demands, was signed with elements more acceptable to the government and the fruit companies than to the workers. Despite the limited gains, however, the strike did mark a major step toward greater influence for organized labor in Honduras and a decline in the power of the fruit companies. = 1954 election = In the midst of these conflicts, the campaign for the 1954 elections continued. Unhappy with some of G√°lvez's gestures toward liberalization, Car√≠as, despite his advanced age, decided to run for president and secured the PNH nomination. This move, however, split the party, and more moderate members broke away to form the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario, MNR). Their nominee was former vice president Abraham Williams Calder√≥n. The split in the ruling party encouraged the PLH, who united behind Ram√≥n Villeda Morales, a Tegucigalpa physician who was seen as somewhat to the left of center in the party's political spectrum. Both the campaign and the election were remarkably free and honest. On October 10, 1954, approximately 260,000 out of over 400,000 eligible voters went to the polls. Villeda Morales won a large plurality with 121,213 votes, Car√≠as received 77,041, and Williams carried 53,041. The PLH also gained a plurality in the legislature. Under Honduran law, however, a majority of the total votes was required to be elected president; Villeda Morales lacked a majority by just over 8,000 votes. The stage was set for a repeat of the confusing paralysis of 1924 because the constitution required, first, that two-thirds of the members of the new legislature must be present and vote to choose a president and, second, that the victor must receive two-thirds of the legislature's vote. To complicate matters further, G√°lvez left for Miami (reportedly to obtain medical treatment, although some sources claim he merely fled the country), leaving the government in the hands of Vice President Julio Lozano D√≠az. Unable to reconcile their differences and unwilling to accept Villeda Morales as president, the PNH and MNR deputies boycotted the legislature, producing a national crisis. The constitution provided that in case of congressional deadlock the Supreme Court of Justice would select the president. Dominated as the court was by Car√≠as appointees, the PLH opposed such a course of action. At this juncture, Lozano D√≠az suddenly suspended the legislature and announced that he would act as president until new elections could be held. He declared that he would form a national government with cabinet members taken from all major parties and received pledges of support from all three candidates in the 1954 election. A Council of State, headed by a PLH member but including members of all three major parties, was appointed to replace the suspended congress until a constituent assembly could be chosen to write yet another constitution. Lozano D√≠az began his period as president with a broad base of support that eroded rapidly. He unveiled an ambitious development plan to be financed by international loans and increased taxes and also introduced the nation's first labor code. This document guaranteed workers the right to organize and strike but gave employers the right of lockout and forbade strikes in public services. The code also embodied some social welfare and minimum-wage provisions and regulated hours and working conditions. All these provisions gained him some labor support, but in later months relations between the president and labor began to sour. As time passed, it became clear that Lozano D√≠az had ambitions to replace the traditional parties with one that he controlled and could use to help prolong his hold on power. He reduced the Council of State to a consultative body, postponed elections, and set about forming his own party, the National Unity Party (Partido de Unidad Nacional, PUN). The activities of other parties were limited, and, in July 1956, Villeda Morales and other PLH leaders were suddenly arrested and flown into exile. A few weeks later, the government crushed an uprising by 400 troops in the capital. Public opinion, however, was becoming increasingly hostile to the president, and rumors of his imminent fall had begun to circulate. Following the August 1956 uprising, Lozano D√≠az's health began to deteriorate, but he clung stubbornly to power. Elections for the legislature in October were boycotted by most of the opposition, who charged that the process was openly rigged to favor the president's supporters. The results seemed to confirm this charge, as the PUN candidates were declared the winners of all fifty-six seats in the congress. The joy of their victories was short, however. On October 21, the armed forces, led by the commanders of the army and air force academies and by Major Roberto G√°lvez, the son of the former president, ousted Lozano D√≠az and set up a military junta to rule the country. This coup marked a turning point in Honduran history. For the first time, the armed forces had acted as an institution rather than as the instrument of a political party or of an individual leader. The new rulers represented younger, more nationalistic, and reform-minded elements in the military. They were products of the increased professionalization of the 1940s and 1950s. Most had received some training by United States military advisers, either in Honduras or abroad. For decades to come, the military would act as the final arbiter of Honduran politics. The military's largest problem was the holding of elections for a legislature and the selection of a new president. A system of proportional representation was agreed upon, and elections were held in October. The PLH won a majority, and in November, by a vote of thirty-seven to twenty, the assembly selected Villeda Morales as president for a six-year term beginning January 1, 1958.  Villeda Morales government, 1958‚Äì1963  The new PLH administration undertook several major efforts to improve and modernize Honduran life. Funds were obtained from the International Monetary Fund to stabilize the currency and from the World Bank to begin paving a highway from the Caribbean coast to the capital. Other efforts were undertaken to expand education. The greatest attention was devoted to passing a new labor code, establishing a social security system, and beginning a program of agrarian reform. The reform program produced increasing opposition among the more conservative elements in Honduran society. There were scattered uprisings during Villeda Morales's initial years in power, but the military remained loyal and quickly crushed the disturbances. Military support began to evaporate in the early 1960s, however. Waning military support was in part a result of rising criticism of the government by conservative organizations such as the National Federation of Agriculturists and Stockraisers of Honduras (Federaci√≥n Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras, Fenagh), which represented the large landowners. The shift in the military's attitude also reflected concern over what were viewed as more frequent rural disorder and growing radical influences in labor and peasant groups. Deteriorating relations with neighboring states, notably Nicaragua, also contributed to the tension. The major causes of friction, however, were the president's 1957 creation of the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil)‚Äîa militarized police commanded directly by the president rather than the chief of the armed forces‚Äîand the prospect of another PLH victory in the 1963 elections. The elections were scheduled for October 1963. As in 1954, the PLH was confronting a divided opposition. The PNH nominated Ram√≥n Ernesto Cruz, but a faction split off and ran the son of ex-president Car√≠as. The PLH ignored the wishes of their president and nominated Modesto Rodas Alvarado, a charismatic, highly partisan figure believed to be to the left of Villeda Morales. All signs pointed to an overwhelming victory for the PLH, an outcome that the military found increasingly unpalatable. = 1963 Honduran coup d'√©tat = Rumors of a coup began circulating in late summer of 1963. The United States endeavored to make clear its opposition to such action‚Äîeven dispatching a high-ranking officer from the United States Southern Command in the Panama Canal Zone to try to convince the chief of the armed forces, Air Force Colonel Oswaldo L√≥pez Arellano, to call off the coup. Villeda Morales also tried to calm military fears, taking the carbines away from the Civil Guard and opposing plans for a constitutional amendment to restore direct command of the military to the president. All these efforts failed. Before dawn on October 3, 1963, the military moved to seize power. The president and the PLH's 1963 presidential candidates were flown into exile, Congress was dissolved, the constitution was suspended, and the planned elections were canceled. Colonel L√≥pez Arellano proclaimed himself president, and the United States promptly broke diplomatic relations. Military rule and international conflict, 1963‚Äì78 =1963‚Äì1968= L√≥pez Arellano rapidly moved to consolidate his hold on power. Growing radical influence had been one of the reasons advanced to justify the coup. Once in power the government disbanded or otherwise attacked communist, pro-Castro, and other elements on the left. The Agrarian Reform Law was effectively nullified, in part by the regime's refusal to appropriate money for the National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario, INA). The country's two peasant unions were harassed, although a new organization of rural workers, the National Union of Peasants (Uni√≥n Nacional de Campesinos, UNC), which had Christian Democratic ties, actually expanded in the mid- and late-1960s. L√≥pez Arellano promised to call elections for yet another legislature, and early in 1964 his government was recognized by the new United States administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Shortly thereafter, military assistance, which had been suspended following the coup, was resumed. Close ties soon developed between the military government and the PNH. A key factor in the development of these links was PNH leader Ricardo Z√∫√±iga Augustinius, who became secretary of state for the presidency, the key cabinet position. Numerous other party members served in the government, giving it a civil-military character but widening the gap between the administration and the PLH. Also linked to the government was a secret organization used to attack the left and intimidate political opponents. Known as the Mancha Brava (Tough Spot), it reputedly drew much of its membership from the ranks of public employees. To give a semblance of legality to his government, L√≥pez Arellano promulgated a new constitution with a unicameral Congress. He then called elections for this new Congress. A general amnesty for political figures was decreed in November, exiles were allowed to return, and the PLH resumed political activity. The PNH had pledged throughout the campaign that if it gained control of the Congress, its members would select L√≥pez Arellano as president. The vote was held on February 16, 1965; the PNH won 35 seats, the PLH 29. The PLH charged the government with fraudulently manipulating the results, and some party leaders urged their supporters to boycott meetings of the assembly. The PLH was unable to agree on this tactic, and enough PLH members took their seats when the Congress convened on March 15 to provide the necessary quorum. The PNH delegates kept their promise and elected L√≥pez Arellano as president for a new six-year term, from 1965 to 1971. For a time, L√≥pez Arellano had success in foreign affairs. One of his government's first acts had been to join with Guatemala and Nicaragua in establishing the Central American Defense Council (Consejo de Defensa Centroamericana, Condeca), which was a military pact among these Central American states and the United States for coordination of counterinsurgency activities. El Salvador joined shortly thereafter, and in 1965 Condeca held its first joint military exercise on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. That same year, Honduras contributed a small contingent of troops to the Organization of American States (OAS) forces monitoring the election in the Dominican Republic. As the 1960s progressed, Honduras's relations with Nicaragua and with the United States improved, but increasing problems developed between Honduras and El Salvador. In May and June 1967, a series of incidents along the border aggravated tensions considerably. One incident involved the capture of two Salvadoran officers and thirty-nine enlisted men whose truck convoy had penetrated several kilometers into Honduras. The Salvadoran troops were finally returned over a year later, but the tensions continued to mount. =War with El Salvador (1969)= By 1968, the L√≥pez Arellano regime seemed to be in serious trouble. The economic situation was producing growing labor conflicts, political unrest, and even criticism from conservative groups such as Fenagh. Municipal elections were held in March 1968 to the accompaniment of violence and charges of open fraud, producing PNH victories but also fueling public discontent and raising the concern of the United States Embassy. Efforts at opening up a dialogue were made in mid-1968 but had little success. Later in the year a general strike was kept brief by government action that helped break the strike and exiled the leader of the major Caribbean coast labor federation. Unrest continued, however; in the spring of 1969 new strikes broke out among teachers and other groups. As the political situation deteriorated, the Honduran government and some private groups came increasingly to place blame for the nation's economic problems on the approximately 300,000 undocumented Salvadoran immigrants in Honduras. Fenagh began to associate Salvadoran immigrants with illegal land invasions, and in January 1969, the Honduran government refused to renew the 1967 Bilateral Treaty on Immigration with El Salvador that had been designed to regulate the flow of individuals across their common border. In April INA announced that it would begin to expel from their lands those who had acquired property under agrarian reform without fulfilling the legal requirement that they be Honduran by birth. Attacks were also launched in the media on the impact of Salvadoran immigrant labor on unemployment and wages on the Caribbean coast. By late May, Salvadorans began to stream out of Honduras back to an overpopulated El Salvador. Tensions continued to mount during June 1969. The soccer teams of the two nations were engaged that month in a three-game elimination match as a preliminary to the World Cup. Disturbances broke out during the first game in Tegucigalpa, but the situation got considerably worse during the second match in San Salvador. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. Actions against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several vice consuls, became increasingly violent. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near- hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador. The Mancha Brava, during the war with El Salvador had other purposes besides intimidating political party's. With the membership of Honduran civilians it was used against Salvadorian residents and temporary workers to exterminate any Salvadorian presence. Methods used against the Salvadorians was being hanged, castrated, removal of females breast and genital and burned alived during the early days of the war. Early on the morning of July 14, 1969, concerted military action began in what came to be known as the Soccer War. The Salvadoran air force attacked targets inside Honduras and the Salvadoran army launched major offensives along the main road connecting the two nations and against the Honduran islands in the Golfo de Fonseca. At first, the Salvadorans made fairly rapid progress. By the evening of July 15, the Salvadoran army, which was considerably larger and better equipped than its Honduran opponent, pushed the Honduran army back over eight kilometers and captured the departmental capital of Nueva Ocotepeque. Thereafter, the attack bogged down, and the Salvadorans began to experience fuel and ammunition shortages. A major reason for the fuel shortage was the action of the Honduran air force, which‚Äîin addition to largely destroying the smaller Salvadoran air force‚Äîhad severely damaged El Salvador's oil storage facilities. The day after the fighting had begun, the OAS met in an urgent session and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged on the night of July 18; it took full effect only on July 20. El Salvador continued until July 29 to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement. The war produced only losses for both sides. Between 60,000 and 130,000 Salvadorans had been forcibly expelled or had fled from Honduras, producing serious economic disruption in some areas. Trade between the two nations had been totally disrupted and the border closed, damaging the economies of both nations and threatening the future of the Central American Common Market (CACM). Up to 2,000 people, the majority Honduran civilians, had been killed, and thousands of other Hondurans in the border area had been made homeless. Airline service between the two nations was also disrupted for over a decade. = Post-war (1969-1972) = After the war, public support for the military plummeted. Although the air force had performed well the army had not. Criticism of the army was not limited to the public; junior officers were often vocal in their criticism of superiors, and a rift developed between junior and senior officers. The war, however, led to a new sense of Honduran nationalism and national pride. Tens of thousands of Honduran workers and peasants had gone to the government to beg for arms to defend their nation. Local defense committees had sprung up, with thousands of ordinary citizens, often armed only with machetes, taking over local security duties. This response to the fighting made a strong impression on a sector of the officer corps and contributed to an increased concern over national development and social welfare among the armed forces. The main key figure in the Salvadorian military victory was General Jose Alberto \\"Chele\\" Medrano. In charged and being main head of the National Guard (GN) he was the first to lead the wave of guards into Honduras. In order to infiltrate the Honduran government and reach the Honduran president Osvaldo Lopex Arellano, General Jose Alberto \\"Chele\\" Medrano disguised himself as a priest in order to have the Honduran president Confess with him. Disguised as a member of the Catholic Church with orders to go to the president himself he was able to gather information straight from the president himself, as the president confessed his intentions, struggles and fears to General Medrano. Once the information was gathered he returned to El Salvador with first hand information about the conflict, with those plans he was able to move quickly and where to move. Eventually He was the hero to the Salvadorian Military community and Salvadorian people. The internal political struggle had been briefly suspended during the conflict with El Salvador, but by the start of 1970 it was again in full swing. The government was under pressure to initiate administrative and electoral reforms, allow open elections in 1971, reorganize the military, and adopt new economic programs, including a revision of Honduran relations with the CACM. Labor, peasant, and business organizations were meeting together in what were known as the fuerzas vivas (living forces). Their representatives met with L√≥pez Arellano and proposed a Plan of National Unity, calling for free elections, a coalition cabinet, and a division of government posts and congressional seats. These proposals failed to elicit immediate response, but discussions continued. Meanwhile, a general political amnesty was decreed, the creation of the Honduran Christian Democratic Party (Partido Dem√≥crata Cristiano de Honduras, PDCH) was announced, and a decree was issued calling for presidential and congressional elections on March 28, 1971. After considerable discussion and debate the PHL and PNH parties responded to pressures from labor, business and the military. On January 7, 1971, they signed a political pact agreeing to establish a national-unity government after the March elections. The purposes of the pact were twofold. The first was to present a single slate of congressional candidates that would divide the Congress equally between the PLH and PNH (each party would run its own candidate for the presidency). The second goal was to promote the Minimum Government Plan (Plan M√≠nimo de Gobierno), which included achieving agrarian reform, increasing technical education, passing a civil service law, attempting to resolve the conflict with El Salvador, restructuring the CACM, and reforming government administration. A later agreement between the parties‚Äîthe \\"little pact\\" (pactito)‚Äîagreed to a division of government posts, including those in the Supreme Court of Justice. The 1971 elections were relatively free and honest. Both parties offered presidential candidates who were compromise choices of the major party factions. The PLH ran Jorge Bueso Arias, and the PNH nominated Ram√≥n Ernesto Cruz. Most observers anticipated a PLH victory, but the PNH ran a more aggressive campaign, making use of the mass media and of modern campaign techniques for the first time in Honduran history. On election day, Cruz scored an impressive victory, gaining 299,807 votes to 269,989 for Bueso Arias. However, a disturbing note for the PNH was that popular participation in the election had declined significantly from 1965. Only slightly over two-thirds of those registered to vote had done so, although the constitution made voting obligatory. At first, Cruz appeared to be living up to the terms of the agreements between the parties. He appointed five PLH members, five PNH members, and one military officer to his cabinet. L√≥pez Arellano remained as chief of the armed forces. As time passed, however, the split between PLH and PNH widened steadily. In order to deal with the budget crisis, Cruz pushed through a reluctant Congress a bill that cut tax benefits and import exemptions. This bill produced opposition from both business and labor sectors. In the area of agrarian reform, the president soon removed INA's dynamic director, Roberto Sandoval, and replaced him with a PNH member, Horacio Moya Posas, who slowed the pace of reform. The PLH protested this action and also argued that the appointment of PNH supporters to the Supreme Court of Justice violated the agreement. Finally, in March 1972, the president dismissed two of the PLH cabinet members. By mid-1972, the government had lost most of its non-PNH support. =Military rule and reform (1972-1978)= During the autumn of 1972, with the support of the military, the two parties attempted to revise the arrangements between the parties and the major labor and business groups. These efforts were not unsuccessful, and opposition to what was increasingly perceived as an ineffectual and divisive administration spread steadily. The virtual halting of agrarian reform and the killing of several peasants by the military in the department of Olancho had angered peasant groups. Labor and business were alienated by the ineffective efforts to deal with the problems of the economy. The PLH felt that its position within the government was steadily eroding and that its agreement with the PNH was regularly violated. In December peasant and labor organizations announced a hunger march by 20,000 individuals to Tegucigalpa to protest the government's agrarian policies. Supported by a prior agreement with the labor movement, the military on December 4, 1972, overthrew Cruz in a bloodless coup and once again installed L√≥pez Arellano as the president. Problems for the L√≥pez Arellano regime began to increase in 1974. The economy was still growing at a slow pace, partly because of the immense damage caused to the Caribbean coast by Hurricane Fifi in September 1974. The storm was the most devastating natural disaster in recent Honduran history, claiming 10,000 or more lives and destroying a vast number of banana plants. The disaster also increased calls for agrarian reform. The government's greatest problem, however, centered on another aspect of the banana industry. Honduras had joined other banana-exporting nations in a joint agreement to levy an export tax on that fruit. The Honduran tax had taken effect in April 1974 but was suddenly canceled four months later. Shortly thereafter, reports began to circulate that the United Fruit Company had paid more than US$1 million to Honduran officials to secure the repeal of the tax. Prominently implicated in these accusations were L√≥pez Arellano and his minister of economy and commerce. Reacting to these charges on March 31, 1975, the military relieved L√≥pez Arellano of his position as chief of the armed forces, replacing him with Colonel Juan Alberto Melgar Castro. Just over three weeks later, they completed the process by removing L√≥pez Arellano from the presidency and replacing him with Melgar Castro. These decisions had been made by the increasingly powerful Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Consejo Superior de las Fuerzas Armadas, Consuffaa), a group of approximately twenty to twenty- five key colonels of the armed forces who provided the institution with a form of collective leadership. In July 1976, the border with El Salvador was still disputed. In July, a minor upsurge of conflict there brought prompt OAS intervention, which helped to keep the conflict from escalating. In October, both nations agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration. This development raised hopes for a rapid peace settlement. Progress, however, proved slow; and tensions were raised again, briefly, in 1978, when the Honduran government abruptly canceled all permits for travel to El Salvador. The rise of guerrilla conflict in El Salvador, plus strong pressures from other nations, made a settlement increasingly urgent in subsequent months. In October 1980, with Peruvian mediation, the bilateral General Peace Treaty was finally signed in Lima, Peru. Trade and travel were soon resumed, but numerous problems, including final adjudication of some small parcels of territory along the frontier, remained for later consideration. Relations with Nicaragua had also become more difficult, especially after civil conflict had increased in that nation in the late 1970s. In March 1978, Honduran soldiers captured Germ√°n Pomares, a leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (Frente Sandinista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, FSLN), the guerrilla force fighting against the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua. Pomares was held until the end of June, but Nicaraguan requests for extradition were denied, and he was ultimately flown to Panama. As fighting in Nicaragua escalated in 1978 and early 1979, Honduras found itself in a difficult position. Honduras did not want to support the unpopular Somoza regime but feared the Marxist leanings of the FSLN. In addition, beginning in September 1978, Honduras had become burdened with an ever-growing number of refugees from Nicaragua. Return to civilian rule, 1978‚Äì82 Melgar Castro's hold on power began to dissolve in 1978. Charges of government corruption and of military links with narcotics traffic had become increasingly widespread, leading to accusations that the government had failed to adequately defend the country. Melgar's hold on power had weakened because he lacked support among large landowners. In addition, the Melgar government had seemed to be making little progress toward promised elections, leading to suspicions that it hoped to prolong its time in office. Right-wing political forces criticized the Melgar administration's handling of the Ferrari Case, which involved drug trafficking and murder of civilians and in which members of the military had been implicated. Unions and student organizations correctly interpreted the right wing's criticism as a prelude to a coup. When demonstrators took to the streets to support Melgar, right-wing elements within the military charged Melgar had lost control of public order and ousted him. On August 7, 1978, Melgar Castro and his cabinet were replaced by a three-member junta. Led by General Policarpo Paz Garc√≠a, chief of the armed forces, and including the air force commander and the chief of military security, the junta had close ties to the large landowners and moved to protect the military men involved in the Ferrari Case. From its inception, the government of Paz Garc√≠a had promised to return Honduras to civilian rule. In April 1980, the Honduran citizenry was summoned to the polls to choose delegates for a new Congress. The Congress would select an interim government and would establish procedures for presidential and congressional elections in 1981. Early indications for the 1980 elections pointed toward a victory for the PNH, headed by Ricardo Z√∫√±iga. The PNH appeared more unified and organized than the rival PLH, and most people assumed that the PNH would be favored by the ruling military. The PLH suffered from internal divisions and a lack of leadership. Former president Villeda Morales had died in 1971, and the party's leader after his death, Modesto Rodas Alvarado, had died in 1979. A split had developed between the more conservative followers of Rodas and the party's left wing, which had formed the Popular Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal del Pueblo, Alipo). In addition, a third party, the Innovation and Unity Party (Partido de Inovaci√≥n y Unidad, Pinu) had been registered and was expected to draw support away from the PLH. The PNH had succeeded in blocking the inscription of the PDCH, leading the PDCH adherents to join with groups further to the left in denouncing the elections as a farce and a fraud and urging popular abstention. The April 1980 election produced a record registration and voter turnout. More than 1.2 million Hondurans registered, and over 1 million voted‚Äîover 81 percent of those eligible. The high number of voters evidently favored the PLH, which won 49.4 percent of the votes cast. Under a complex apportionment system, the PLH won thirty-five seats in the Congress; the PNH, thirty-three; and Pinu, three. This result produced considerable debate over the composition of the next government. There was general agreement on naming Paz Garc√≠a as interim president, and the disputes centered on the composition of the cabinet. Ultimately, a PLH leader, Roberto Suazo C√≥rdova, was made president of the Congress, while the PLH also gained five of the seats on the new Supreme Court of Justice. The cabinet was divided among all three parties and the military; the armed forces received the Ministry of National Defense and Public Security, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the PNH acquired key economic positions. The Congress took more than a year to draft a new constitution and an electoral law for the 1981 presidential and congressional elections. The work went slowly, and the elections originally scheduled for August 1981 had to be postponed until November. In the interim, the National Elections Tribunal (Tribunal Nacional de Elecciones, TNE) unanimously granted the PDCH the legal status needed for a place on the 1981 ballot. Despite the presence of candidates for the Pinu and the PDCH on the November 1981 ballot, it was clear that the election would be essentially a two-party affair between the PLH and PNH. On November 29, 1981, a total of 1,214,735 Hondurans, 80.7 percent of those registered, voted, giving the PLH a sweeping victory. Suazo C√≥rdova won 636,392 votes (52.4 percent), the PNH 491,089 votes, and 48,582 votes were divided between the Pinu and the PDCH. The PLH also took control of Congress, winning forty-four seats; the PNH, thirty-four; the Pinu, three; and the PDCH, one. The PLH also won 61 percent of the municipal councils. Suazo C√≥rdova was inaugurated as president of Honduras in January 1982, ending nearly a decade of military presidents.

The adventure, written by Mike Mearls and James Wyatt, was published in 2008 by Wizards of the Coast, as a sequel to the adventures Keep on the Shadowfell and Thunderspire Labyrinth. The adventure is designed for character of levels 7-10 and the module code \\"H\\" stands for Heroic Tier. This module is set in a region of the world called the Nentir Vale, the details of which are given in the 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide. Synopsis Pyramid of Shadows presents an adventure wherein players find their way to a multi-levelled extradimensional pyramid built by the gods as a prison for the power-mad Tiefling wizard Karavakos. Karavakos' power - and personality - has been fractured into multiple parts in order to keep him bound within the prison. In a plot to obtain his freedom, Karavakos tricks players into hunting down and killing several splinter versions of himself within the pyramid, in order that Karavakos might regain the power they hold and break free of the prison. However, with the aid of the undying head of Karavakos' one time Eladrin lover Vyrellis, the players gain the opportunity to breach Karavakos' sanctum and defeat the wizard, which dissolves the pyramid and frees the players. Format Pyramid of Shadows is essentially a megadungeon, a single sprawling complex filled with monsters, traps and treasure. Because of the nature of the pyramid player characters cannot leave, return to a home base, or take up sidequests, so players will find themselves locked into the module until Karavakos is defeated and the pyramid is destroyed. The adventure is presented across two booklets. One booklet provides a general overview of the complex and introduces statistics for monsters that make their first 4th Edition appearance in this module. The second provides details of the module's tactical encounters, presented in the delve format where each encounter is depicted across two pages and contains all relevant maps and statblocks within that space.

According to the US State Department, \\"Honduras became host to the largest Peace Corps mission in the world, and non- governmental and international voluntary agencies proliferated.\\" As the 1985 election approached, the Liberal Party of Honduras interpreted election law as permitting multiple presidential candidates from one party. It claimed victory when its presidential candidates (who received 42% of the vote) collectively outpolled the National Party of Honduras candidate, Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero. Jos√© Azcona del Hoyo, the Liberal Party candidate who received the most votes of the Liberal Party candidates, assumed the presidency in 1986. With the endorsement of the Honduran military, the Azcona administration ushered in the first peaceful transfer of power from one civilian president to another in more than 30 years. Nationalist Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero won the following presidential election and took office in 1990. The nation's fiscal deficit ballooned during Callejas' final year in office. Growing public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living and with widespread government corruption led voters in 1993 to elect Liberal Party candidate Carlos Roberto Reina with 56% of the vote. President Reina, elected on a platform calling for a \\"moral revolution\\", actively prosecuted corruption and pursued those responsible for human rights abuses in the 1980s. He created a modern attorney general's office and investigative police force, increased civilian control over the armed forces, transferred the police from military to civilian authority, and restored national fiscal health. Liberal Carlos Roberto Flores Facuss√© took office in 1998. Flores inaugurated reforms and modernized the Honduran government and economy, with emphasis on helping Honduras' poorest citizens while maintaining the country's fiscal health and improving international competitiveness. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras, leaving more than 7,000 people dead and 1.5 million displaced. Damages totaled nearly $3 billion. Ricardo Rodolfo Maduro Joest of the National Party of Honduras won the 2001 presidential elections, and took office in 2002. Maduro deployed joint police-military forces and wider neighborhood patrols to fight crime and gangs. Maduro strongly supported the global war on terrorism and joined the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, contributing 370 troops for eleven months. Under Maduro Honduras also negotiated and ratified the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, received debt relief, became the first Latin American country to sign a Millennium Challenge Account compact with the U.S., and actively promoted greater Central American integration. Jose Manuel \\"Mel\\" Zelaya Rosales of the Liberal Party won the November 27, 2005 presidential election with less than a 4% margin of victory, the smallest margin ever in Honduran electoral history. Zelaya's campaign theme was \\"citizen power\\", and he vowed to increase government transparency and combat narcotrafficking, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Liberal Party won 62 of the 128 congressional seats, just short of an absolute majority. Honduras in the middle: United States policy and the Central American crisis =The Suazo C√≥rdova administration: Caudillo politics in the shadow of the military= President Roberto Suazo C√≥rdova took office at a time of extreme political ferment in Central America. The United States government wanted to halt or roll back what it considered to be pro-Soviet forces on the isthmus. The leftist insurgency of the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (, FMLN) in El Salvador had been underway for some two years, and the outcome of the struggle in that country was in doubt. In Nicaragua, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (, FSLN) was instituting social-democratic policies with considerable success for the poor majority.Context of '1990: Sandinistas Lose Nicarague Election to US-Backed Candidate' at historycommons.org Honduras ‚Äî poor in resources, lacking democratic traditions, and strategically located between two revolutionary governments ‚Äî almost inevitably drew the attention and involvement of Washington. Suazo C√≥rdova, a country doctor from La Paz, was a veteran of Honduran political infighting, but lacked the kind of experience that might have prepared him for an internationalist role as president of the republic. His initial approach to the question of Honduras' role appeared to stress coexistence rather than confrontation. This reflected Honduras's historical passivity in regional and international affairs and took into account the regional balance of power, which was unfavorable to Honduras. Suazo C√≥rdova's inaugural speech stressed self-determination and a desire to remain neutral in the face of regional upheaval. In keeping with this conciliatory approach, on March 23, 1982 Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgardo Paz Barnica proposed a peace plan to the permanent council of the Organization of American States (OAS), based on the following six points: general disarmament in Central America, reduction of foreign military and other advisors (then a point of contention with the Nicaraguan government), international supervision of a final agreement, an end to regional arms traffic, respect for delineated and demarcated borders, and the establishment of a permanent multilateral dialogue. The proposal met with little support from other Central American states, particularly Nicaragua. Gradually, the Suazo C√≥rdova administration began to perceive the FSLN government (commonly known as \\"Sandinistas\\") as an obstructionist as well as a subversive force that intended to undermine political stability in Honduras through intimidation, propaganda, and direct aid to insurgents. Consensus on this point in the Honduran administration and armed forces coincided with a significant expansion of the United States' role in Honduras both as policy adviser and as purveyor of military and economic aid. Brigadier General Gustavo √Ålvarez Mart√≠nez, who assumed the position of commander of the armed forces in January 1982, emerged as a hardliner against the Sandinistas. He publicly declared Honduras \\"in a war to the death\\" with Nicaragua; and believed such a war should be conducted under the auspices of a triple alliance between Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Some observers also believed that √Ålvarez had another tactic in his anti-communist strategy: covert domestic surveillance and extralegal executions. √Ålvarez's training in Argentina (where such \\"dirty war\\" tactics were common in the 1970s) lent credence to charges of forced disappearance and other forms of harassment against the Honduran left. √Ålvarez's main rival for the post of armed forces commander, Colonel Le√≥nidas Torres Arias, a former head of military intelligence, had assumed an attach√© post in Buenos Aires, after losing the struggle for command. From Argentina, Torres castigated √Ålvarez in the media, charging that he operated a personal death squad. The Honduran Committee for the Defense of Human Rights appeared to confirm Torres' charges to some degree, by reporting an increase in the number of political disappearances nationwide. According to foreign observers, the total numbers in no way rivaled those registered in El Salvador or Guatemala; the increase, however, was statistically significant for previously-tranquil Honduras. √Ålvarez's strong-arm tactics drew criticism, particularly from the foreign press and international human rights groups. At the same time, however, leftist subversive activity expanded in the early 1980s. Much of this increase was attributed to Sandinista support for like-minded Honduran groups such as the PCH, the Lorenzo Zelaya Popular Revolutionary Forces (, FPR-LZ) and the Honduran Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (, PRTC-H). Beginning with minor bombings, these groups eventually progressed to kidnapping and hijackings. A platoon-sized unit of Nicaraguan-trained PRTC-H members crossed the border from Nicaragua into the Olancho department in September 1983. A rapid response by Honduran troops isolated the PRTC-H column; 23 guerrillas surrendered and another 26 died in the mountains, many of starvation and exposure). A similar incursion in 1984 also failed to strike a revolutionary spark among the conservative Honduran peasantry. The perception of a genuine leftist revolutionary threat to Honduran stability enhanced Brigadier General √Ålvarez's power and heightened his profile, both in Honduras and the United States. The imbalance of power between the military and the nascent civilian government called into question the viability of Honduras's democratic transition. Some observers saw in √Ålvarez a continuation in the long series of military caudillos, who had ruled the nation since independence. A coup and reimposition of direct military rule appeared a virtual certainty to those who doubted Honduras's affinity for any form of democratic government. Others, however, pictured √Ålvarez more in the mold of Argentina's Juan Per√≥n ‚Äî a military-based caudillo, who successfully made the transition to populist civilian politics. Like most officers, √Ålvarez had ties to the PNH. √Ålvarez served as president of the Association for the Progress of Honduras (, APROH), a group made up mainly of conservative businesspeople and PNH leaders. The initial goals of APROH were to attract foreign investment and to block the growth of \\"popular organizations\\" (labor unions, campesino and other activist groups) such as those that supported the FMLN in El Salvador. APROH's acceptance of funding from the South Korea-based Unification Church proved controversial, garnering negative publicity for both the organization and √Ålvarez. The general's purportedly-popular following, moreover, was suspect. He seemed much more comfortable and adept at high-level political maneuvering than grassroots organization. Eventually, even his support within the armed forces proved to be inadequate to sustain his ambitions. Although √Ålvarez had appeared ascendant by 1982, some observers described the political situation in Honduras as a triumvirate, with Brigadier General √Ålvarez formulating national security policy and refraining from a direct military takeover of the government, President Suazo supporting √Ålvarez's policies in return for military tolerance of his rule and military support for his domestic policies, and the United States government providing the economic and military aid that helped sustain the arrangement. Some disputed the claim that Suazo was subservient to the military, pointing out that the president refused to increase the budget of the armed forces. That budget, however, failed to take foreign military aid into account. The increase in United States military aid from US$3.3 million in fiscal year 1980 to US$31.3 million in FY 1982, therefore, represented a substantial expansion in the military's role in government. √Ålvarez strongly supported United States policy in Central America. He reportedly assisted in the initial formation of the Nicaraguan Resistance (more commonly known as the Contras, short for contrarevolucionarios‚Äîcounterrevolutionaries in Spanish), arranged large-scale joint exercises with United States Armed Forces, and agreed to allow the training of Salvadoran troops by United States Special Forces at a facility near Puerto Castilla known as the Regional Center for Military Training (, CREM). The latter action eventually contributed greatly to √Ålvarez's ouster in early 1984. The other major factor in the √Ålvarez ouster was the general's attempt to streamline the command structure of the armed forces. Traditionally, a collegial board made up of field-grade officers consulted with the commander in the formulation of policy for the Honduran armed forces. √Ålvarez proposed to eliminate this organization, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (, Consuffaa), and to replace it with a board of eight senior officers. The reorganization would have concentrated and enhanced √Ålvarez's power over the military by allowing him to name his most-trusted commanders to a leadership board that would rubber-stamp his policy proposals. At the same time, the reorganization had promised to make the armed forces function more efficiently ‚Äî an important consideration if hostilities broke out between Honduras and Nicaragua. Alvarez's view on involvement in Nicaragua led directly to the 1984 rebellion by his officers. Most observers had expected Honduras to serve as one staging area for a United States military intervention in Nicaragua if such an operation took place. The flawed (but successful) Operation Urgent Fury on the Caribbean island of Grenada in November 1983 seemed to increase the likelihood of military action against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Although √Ålvarez supported a military solution to the \\"Nicaraguan problem\\", a significant faction of the Honduran officer corps held diverging views. These more-nationalistic, more- isolationist officers saw √Ålvarez as subservient to the United States, giving up more in terms of sovereignty than he received in aid. These officers also resented √Ålvarez's posturing in the media and his (apparent) aspirations to national leadership. On a more mundane level, certain officers also feared that √Ålvarez would force them out after he had solidified his power base within the officer corps. The prospect of early (involuntary) retirement, with its attendant loss of licit and illicit income, prompted a clique of senior officers to move against √Ålvarez on March 31, 1984, seizing him and dispatching him on a flight to Miami. The ouster of √Ålvarez produced a number of repercussions, both in Honduran domestic politics and in Honduras ‚Äì United States relations. The armed forces, which had appeared to be moving in a more activist and outward-looking direction under √Ålvarez, assumed a more isolationist stance toward regional relations and United States policy initiatives. Air Force Brigadier General Walter L√≥pez Reyes, the new commander-in-chief, demanded further increases in military aid in return for Honduran cooperation in regional affairs. After some equivocation, L√≥pez closed the CREM. He also scaled back Honduran-United States military exercises. On May 21, 1985, President Suazo C√≥rdova and United States President Ronald Reagan signed a joint communiqu√© that amended a 1982 annex to the 1954 Military Assistance Agreement between the two countries. Although the new accord allowed the United States to expand and improve its temporary facilities at Palmerola Air Base (near Comayagua), it generally limited Honduran cooperation in comparison with the terms of the 1982 agreement. By 1984 the armed forces under L√≥pez began to exert pressure on the United States-backed Contra forces, the bulk of which operated from bases in the southern departments of El Para√≠so and Olancho. Honduran foreign minister Edgardo Paz Barnica reflected the new attitude toward the Contras in January 1985, when he announced that the government planned to expel them from Honduras. Although that statement reflected bravado and frustration more than reality, the Honduran military took more active steps to pressure both the Contras and (indirectly) the United States government. In February 1985, the armed forces ordered the Contras to close a hospital that they had set up outside of Tegucigalpa. The Hondurans also ordered them to shut down an office that had been used to receive official visitors, mainly from the United States. Around the same time, Honduran troops turned back two United States Department of State employees from a planned visit to a Contra training camp; the troops told the Americans that they lacked a newly required permit to enter the area. =Honduras and the Nicaraguan conflict= President Suazo C√≥rdova had foreshadowed the Honduran ambivalence toward the Contras in a July 1983 letter to U.S. President Reagan, in which he stated that \\"our people are beginning to ask with greater vigor if it is convenient to our own interests to be so intimately linked to the interests of the United States if we receive so little in exchange\\". Although 1983 and 1985 public-opinion polls had shown that a majority of Hondurans supported United States policy in Central America, there was still a growing uneasiness over the country's role as reluctant host to Nicaraguan rebel forces. At the height of the conflict with the Sandinista Popular Army (, EPS), in the mid-1980s Contra forces reportedly totaled between 12,000 and 17,000 (depending on the source of the estimate); this level rivaled that of the entire Honduran armed forces. This fact ‚Äî and the continued close ties between Honduras and the United States ‚Äî made it doubtful that the armed forces would expel the Nicaraguan rebels from Honduran territory by force. However, the prospect of an EPS victory over the Contras (which most observers considered inevitable) raised the disturbing prospect of a foreign armed force trapped on Honduran soil. Most Hondurans believed that, under such circumstances, the Nicaraguans would fail to assimilate well into the Honduran population and would resort to banditry in order to survive. Honduran politicians had little faith in the willingness of the United States to assist them, should events take such a negative turn. Most believed that following a Contra defeat, Washington would cut its losses and withdraw all support from the group. Continued (and sharply increased) United States military aid to Honduras was the counterbalance to the prospect of United States withdrawal from the Nicaraguan conflict. For the years 1975‚Äì1980, total aid to Honduras had been US$16.3 million. From 1981 to 1985, the total reached US$169 million. Meanwhile, the percentage of the military budget coming directly (or indirectly) from the United States increased from 7% in 1980 to 76% in 1985. On March 22, 1986, approximately 1,500 EPS ground troops crossed the Honduran border and engaged Contra forces near the hamlet of Las Vegas. The EPS withdrew into northern Nicaragua without making contact with Honduran forces. Honduran officials acknowledged the incursion publicly, but only after United States spokespersons had trumpeted the incident as proof of the Sandinistas' aggressive intentions toward their northern neighbor. Shortly thereafter, the United States Congress approved US$100 million in military aid to the Contra forces. Other EPS incursions into Honduran territory followed, notably in December 1986 and June 1987. How much human suffering passed in the frontier region without public notice by any government remained unknown. As in decades past, the spillover of the Nicaraguan conflict into more-peaceful Honduras demonstrated the interrelatedness of all of the states of Central America. =The struggle for real democracy: the 1985 elections= The forced departure of Brigadier General √Ålvarez on March 31, 1984 ‚Äî and his succession by a group of officers who demonstrated less interest in political affairs than he did ‚Äî markedly changed the political situation prevailing in the country. President Suazo C√≥rdova, previously restrained by his trepidation about √Ålvarez, began to show signs of becoming a caudillo. Although the constitution forbade his reelection, Suazo C√≥rdova conspired to nominate , a fellow Rodista (the PLH faction founded by Modesto Rodas Alvarado) for the 1985 presidential election. Every politician in Honduras recognized the octogenarian Mej√≠a for what he was ‚Äî someone who would perpetuate Suazo's control of the presidential palace. Nevertheless, Suazo C√≥rdova promoted Mej√≠a's candidacy with every means at his disposal. The potential key to a Mej√≠a victory lay in the makeup of the supreme court of justice, which could (under the terms of the 1981 constitution) decide an election in which all candidates failed to receive a clear majority. As 1985 began, the Supreme Court contained a firm majority of Suazo C√≥rdova supporters. The leadership of the National Congress of Honduras, both PLH and PNH, recognized the self- serving scenario that Suazo C√≥rdova had put into place. Moreover, they realized that the constitution granted power to the legislature to remove Supreme Court justices for cause. The Congress proceeded to do just that, when 53 of its 82 deputies voted on March 29, 1985 to replace five of the nine justices because of alleged corruption. Five new justices quickly took the oath of office. During the debate over the justices' corruption, Suazo C√≥rdova had fulminated both publicly and privately‚Äîthreatening to declare a state of emergency and close the Congress if the five lost their seats on the court. Although he stopped short of carrying out that threat, troops surrounded the Congress building temporarily after the deputies announced their action and military police took Ram√≥n Valladares Soto (the new president of the Supreme Court) into custody. Arrests of the other four new justices followed. A lower- court judge charged the five with treason. On April 1, the judge filed treason charges against the 53 legislative deputies who had voted to replace the five justices. The proceedings against the deputies, if pursued to their conclusion, threatened to result in the revocation of legislators' legal immunity from prosecution. The Congress rapidly reacted to Suazo's counterattack. On April 3, 1985, the assembly passed by a 49‚Äì29 vote a motion censuring the president for his actions. In another action more calculated to curb the president's power, the legislature passed a bill establishing guidelines for primary elections within political parties. Had such guidelines been in place previously, the entire governmental crisis might have been avoided. Not surprisingly, Suazo C√≥rdova vetoed the bill almost two weeks later ‚Äî the day after the Rodista faction had endorsed his choice (Mej√≠a) as the official presidential candidate of the PLH. The resolution of the crisis demonstrated how little Honduras had progressed from the days when the military had (either directly or indirectly) guided events. During the early April days of the dispute between Suazo C√≥rdova and the Congress, Brigadier General L√≥pez had publicly declared himself and the armed forces \\"neutral\\". As events began to degenerate, however, the officer corps began to reconcile the antagonists. At first, the military sought to resolve the dispute through informal contacts. When that failed, the armed forces convened direct negotiations between presidential and legislative representatives, with military arbiters. By April 21, the talks produced an agreement. The leaders of Congress rescinded their dismissal of the five justices, dropping their demand for primary elections. Supreme Court President Valladares received his freedom. In a complicated arrangement, it was agreed that candidates of all political factions could run for president. The winner of the election would be the faction receiving the most votes within the party (PLH, PNH or any other) receiving the most total votes. This arrangement ignored the provision of the constitution stating that the president must be the candidate who receives a simple majority of the popular vote. Publicly, all parties expressed satisfaction with the outcome. Although threatened union strike action had influenced the negotiations, the strongest factor in their outcome had been pressure from the leadership of the armed forces. The unorthodox nature of the agreed-upon electoral procedures delayed adoption of the new regulations until late in November. By that time four PLH candidates, three PNH candidates and several other minor-party candidates had filed. The campaign appeared to pit two PLH candidates ‚Äî Mej√≠a and San Pedro Sula engineer Jos√© Azcona del Hoyo ‚Äî against the PNH's Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, in a contest which saw the two PLH candidates criticize each other as much as (or more than) they did the opposition outside their own party. The final vote count, announced on December 23, produced the result that the makeshift electoral regulations had made all but inevitable ‚Äî a president who garnered less than a majority of the total popular vote. The declared winner, Azcona, boasted less than 30% of the vote (compared with Callejas's 44%). But because the combined total of PLH candidates equaled 54%, Azcona claimed the presidential sash. Callejas lodged a short-lived protest, but it was probably less than a sincere effort to challenge the agreement brokered by the military. Azcona faced multiple national and regional problems as his inauguration took place on January 27, 1986. The new president's inaugural address noted the country's many social problems, promising \\"no magic formulas\\" to solve them. He also noted the growing national debt, and promised to adhere to foreign policies guided by the principle of non-intervention. Azcona's prospects for a successful presidency appeared dim ‚Äî in part, because his party's bloc in the Congress was still splintered (unlike the more-united PNH deputies on the other side of the aisle). Beyond such parochial concerns the crisis in Central America still raged on, presenting a daunting prospect for any Honduran leader. From Contadora to Escuipula: the crisis abates =The Contadora process= Although the crisis in Central America derived primarily from domestic pressures, the region's growing instability during the 1980s drew the attention and intervention of numerous foreign actors‚Äîchief among them the United States, the Soviet Union, and concerned nations of Latin America. The Contadora negotiating process (named for the Panamanian island where it was initiated in January 1983) sought to hammer out a solution among the five Central American nations through mediation by the governments of Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama. The negotiations proved arduous and protracted, and by mid-1985 the talks had bogged down. The Nicaraguan delegates rejected discussion of democratization and internal reconciliation, as an unwarranted intervention in their country's internal affairs. Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica maintained that these provisions were necessary to ensure a lasting settlement. Another major point of contention was the cessation of aid to insurgent groups, particularly United States aid to the Contras. Although the United States government was not a party to the Contadora negotiations, it was understood that the United States would sign a separate protocol agreeing to the terms of a final treaty in such areas as aid to insurgents, military aid and assistance to Central American governments, and joint military exercises in the region. The Nicaraguans demanded that any Contadora treaty call for an immediate end to Contra aid, whereas all other Central American states and mediating countries (with the exception of Mexico) downplayed the importance of such a provision. The Nicaraguan government also objected to specific cuts in its military-force levels, citing the counterinsurgency campaign and defense against a potential United States invasion. To break this impasse, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay announced in July 1985 that they would join the Contadora process as a \\"support group\\" in an attempt to resolve the remaining points of contention and achieve a comprehensive agreement. Despite the combined efforts of the original \\"core four\\" nations and the \\"support group\\", the Contadora process essentially halted during June 1986; the Central American countries failed to resolve their differences sufficiently to permit the signing of a final treaty draft. The United States Congress' approval of military aid to the Contras during the same month hampered the process, according to representatives of most of the mediating countries. Although the mediators vowed to continue their diplomatic efforts and convened negotiating sessions after the unsuccessful June 6 meeting in Panama City, the Contadora process was moribund. After the process stalled, the regional consensus seemed to be that a streamlined, strictly Central American peace initiative stood a better chance of success than one including countries outside the region. During the course of the Contadora negotiations, the Honduran government sought to achieve an agreement that would settle the Nicaraguan conflict in such a way as to assure eventual reassimilation of the Contras into Nicaraguan society. At the same time, the Honduran military had sought to maintain its expanded relationship with the United States. Paradoxically, the Honduran government found itself espousing positions similar to those supported by its traditional adversary, El Salvador. As a new democracy, Honduras also enjoyed support from the government of Costa Rica (a more-established democracy). The government of Guatemalan president Marco Vinicio Cerezo Ar√©valo established a more independent position, but still supported the concept of a diplomatic solution to Central America's troubles. =The Arias plan= The five Central American presidents continued to seek a strictly Central American diplomatic solution. They held a meeting in May 1986 in Esquipulas, Guatemala, in an effort to work out their differences over the revised Contadora draft treaty. This meeting was a precursor of the process that superseded Contadora in early 1987. The leading proponent and architect of this process was the president of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias S√°nchez. After consultations with representatives of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the United States, Arias announced on February 15, 1987, that he had presented a peace proposal to representatives of the other Central American states (except Nicaragua). The plan called for dialogue between governments and opposition groups, amnesty for political prisoners, cease-fires in ongoing insurgent conflicts, democratization, and free elections in all five regional states. The plan also called for renewed negotiations on arms reduction and an end of outside aid to insurgent forces. Including the Nicaraguan administration in the negotiations was a sensitive issue. The first formal negotiating session to include representatives of that government took place in Tegucigalpa on July 31, 1987. That meeting of foreign ministers paved the way for an August 6, 1987, gathering of the five Central American presidents in Esquipulas. The negotiations, reportedly marked by blunt exchanges among the leaders, produced an agreement that many had considered unachievable only months before. The agreement, signed on August 7, called for the cessation of outside aid and support to insurgent forces but allowed the continuation of such aid to government forces. As a democratic government free from domestic insurgent problems, Honduras could easily comply with the terms of the Esquipulas accord. The Central American Peace Agreement, variously referred to as \\"Esquipulas II\\" or the \\"Arias Plan\\", initially required the implementation of certain conditions by November 5, 1987. The conditions included establishing decrees of amnesty in those countries involved in insurgent conflicts, initiating dialogue between governments and unarmed political opposition groups (or groups that had availed themselves of amnesty), undertaking efforts to negotiate cease-fires between governments and insurgent groups, ceasing to allow outside aid to insurgent forces, denying the use of each country's national territory to \\"groups trying to destabilize the governments of the countries of Central America\\", and ensuring conditions conducive to the development of a \\"pluralistic and participatory democratic process\\" in all of the signatory states. Nicaragua's compliance with the Arias Plan was uneven by late 1988, and the process appeared to be losing momentum. The Nicaraguan government took a number of initial steps to comply with the treaty. These included allowing the independent daily La Prensa to reopen and the radio station of the Roman Catholic Church to resume broadcasting, establishing a national reconciliation committee including representatives of the unarmed opposition, and eventually undertaking cease-fire negotiations with representatives of the Contras. The optimism engendered by the signing of a provisional cease-fire accord on March 23, 1988, at Sapo√°, Nicaragua, however, had largely dissipated by July. During that month, the Nicaraguan government broke up a protest demonstration in the southern city of Nandaime, expelled the United States ambassador and seven other diplomats for alleged collaboration with the demonstrators, and again shut down La Prensa and the Catholic radio station. =Accord in Nicaragua= Talks continued among the Central American presidents as they sought to resolve the insurgencies in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and a series of summit meetings took place during 1989. The presidents agreed to a draft plan on February 14 of that year. The plan called for the demobilization and repatriation of contra forces within ninety days, in return for elections. Nicaraguan president Daniel Jos√© Ortega Saavedra agreed to hold an election in February 1990. A foreign ministers' meeting also produced agreement on foreign (but non-United States) observers to supervise the demobilization. The Central American leaders crafted the agreement largely without advice or guidance from the United States. Although the United States remained Honduras's leading supporter and ally, the United States administration gradually lost influence over events in Central America as the Esquipulas process played out. Having apparently neglected its relationship with President Azcona, the administration of George H.W. Bush (1989‚Äì1993) turned to a more established connection, that between the United States government and the Honduran armed forces. Although Brigadier General L√≥pez had been purged and exiled in February 1986, the armed forces maintained a pro-United States stance. After discussions with Bush administration envoys, the Honduran officer corps agreed that nonmilitary aid to the Contras should continue despite the February agreement. President Azcona (reportedly persuaded by the military) announced that humanitarian aid to the Contras would reduce the security threat to Honduras, and would not violate the terms of the February 1989 agreement. The 90-day timetable established by the February 1989 agreement proved unworkable. In order to avoid losing momentum, the five presidents reconvened in Tela, Honduras on August 5, 1989. Once again, the presidents negotiated without input from the United States government. They produced a new schedule for Contra demobilization, with a deadline of December 5, 1989. The Organization of American States (OAS) agreed to supervise the process. Although the Bush administration expressed disapproval of the new agreement, the White House and United States Congress agreed that the Contras' aid would be cut off if the Nicaraguan rebels failed to disband. The United States Congress approved US$49.7 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras through February 1990. The December 5 deadline also proved overly optimistic. As the date approached, the Central American leaders again scheduled a summit. The first site selected was Managua. That venue changed to San Jos√©, Costa Rica, however, after the discovery of arms in the wreckage of a Nicaraguan aircraft that had crashed in El Salvador. The Salvadoran government subsequently suspended relations with Nicaragua, and an aura of conflict overhung the summit. At one point Azcona stormed out of a session, after Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega refused to drop Nicaragua's International Court of Justice suit against Honduras over the Contras' use of Honduran territory. The Nicaraguan government had previously agreed to drop the suit if the December 5 demobilization deadline were met. As the summit broke up without agreement, the Central American situation once again appeared dangerously fluid. The unpredictability of events demonstrated itself once again in the Nicaraguan elections of February 1990. Contrary to most prognostications and opinion polls, opposition candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro handily defeated Ortega and the FSLN. Having been forced to hold free elections, the FSLN discovered that many Nicaraguans deeply resented the authoritarian rule of their revolutionary government. The Contra insurgency (which had plagued both Nicaragua and Honduras for years) slowly drew to a close. Although Honduran president Azcona had begun the process eventually culminating in the resolution of the Nicaraguan conflict, another president would occupy the presidential palace as the Contras left their camps in Honduras and headed south. The elections of November 26, 1989 were free of the makeshift electoral procedures that had rendered the 1985 balloting questionable. The PLH and PNH nominated one (rather than several) candidate each. Carlos Roberto Flores, a Rodista and prot√©g√© of ex-president Suazo C√≥rdova, won the PLH nomination and the right to oppose Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, who had also carried the banner of the PNH when he lost in 1985. Callejas's convincing victory, by 50.2 to 44.5%, reflected public discontent with the PLH government's failure to translate increased foreign aid into improvements in the domestic economy. Callejas became the first opposition candidate to win an election in Honduras since 1932. 1990s The nation's fiscal deficit ballooned during Callejas' last year in office. Growing public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living and widespread government corruption led voters in 1993 to elect Liberal Party candidate Carlos Roberto Reina with 56% of the vote. President Reina, elected on a platform calling for a \\"moral revolution\\", actively prosecuted corruption and pursued those responsible for human-rights abuses in the 1980s. He created a modern attorney general's office and an investigative police force, increased civilian control over the armed forces, transferred the police from military to civilian authority, and restored national fiscal health. Liberal Carlos Roberto Flores Facuss√© took office in 1998. Flores inaugurated programs of reform and modernization of the Honduran government and economy, with emphasis on helping Honduras' poorest citizens while maintaining the country's fiscal health and improving international competitiveness. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras, leaving more than 5,000 people dead and 1.5 million displaced. Damages totaled nearly $3 billion. 2000s Ricardo Maduro Joest of the National Party won the 2001 presidential elections, and was inaugurated in 2002. Maduro's first act as president was to deploy a joint police-military force on the streets to permit wider neighborhood patrols in the ongoing fight against the country's crime and gang problem. Maduro was a strong supporter of the global war on terrorism and joined the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq with an 11-month contribution of 370 troops. Under President Maduro's guidance, Honduras also negotiated and ratified the Dominican Republic ‚Äì Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), received debt relief, became the first Latin American country to sign a Millennium Challenge Account compact with the U.S., and actively promoted greater Central American integration. Jose Manuel \\"Mel\\" Zelaya Rosales of the Liberal Party won the November 27, 2005 presidential elections with less than a 4% margin of victory, the smallest margin in Honduran electoral history. Zelaya's campaign theme was \\"citizen power\\", and he vowed to increase transparency and combat narcotrafficking, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Liberal Party won 62 of the 128 congressional seats, just short of an absolute majority. Zelaya was overthrown by the military in June 2009 as part of the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. As a result, Honduras was expelled from the OAS.

The film is a non-traditional approach to the standard tales of fairy tale princesses, and it is known in Japan as one of the most successful animated feminist works.Taniguchi, Hideko. The Reception and the Adaptation of Diana Coles' The Clever Princess in Japan . Studies in Languages and Cultures, No. 25. Pp. 131-141. Kyushu University Institutional Repository (QIR). March 2010. Plot Under the rule of her solemn father the King, the young Princess Arete grows up in a lonely tower awaiting a suitor worthy of her. While the suitors accomplish countless treasure-collecting quests for the King, the princess begins to experience an awakening curiosity in the outside world. Sneaking out of the castle several times she begins to recognize that she has been missing out on life while locked away in the isolation of her tower. One night, Arete investigates the gifts given to her by her suitor, and finds a book telling her the stories of ancient witches and wizards creations. When her life is disrupted by the arrival of two very enthusiastic suitors, who she shows no interest in, Arete makes up her mind to escape into the wider world however she is caught by the guards and sent before her father. Just before she is brought to him, the King has met with a powerful sorcerer named Boax to discuss his proposal that Princess Arete be betrothed to the sorcerer. Although the King hesitates at first, he eventually gives in after Boax enchants her into becoming a traditional princess and accepting his advances. Boax then takes the princess to his far away castle prior to the wedding. There he reveals that he does not love her and that the only reason he has brought her here is to imprison her in a dungeon as he is familiar with a prophecy that a princess named Arete will have the power to take away his eternal life. As Arete sits in her new lonely surroundings, she slowly becomes friends with the one sympathetic person in Boax's castle - a villager named Ample. Ample explains to Arete that Boax has arranged with the nearby town that he will provide them with water for their fields so long as they feed him. Despite this arrangement, Ample reveals that she has begun digging her own well and that soon she will be free from dependence on Boax's magic. Encouraged by Ample to make a story, Arete at last loses the enchantment Boax had placed on her and regains her old spirits. Soon after she is released by Boax who still believes her to be enchanted and sent on a magical quest of her own. Returning in secret to Boax's castle, Arete instead discovers the source of Boax's magical ability to create water for the town. In trying to recover the source of the water, Arete is discovered by Boax who in a fit of despondency destroys his own castle and releases water into the land. It is revealed that he is not really a great wizard, and can only use limited power before his people were wiped out. As he runs to escape the water, his gem that gives him eternal life is destroyed, losing his eternal life, showing that the prophecy was indeed true. With the town's health restored, Arete is free to leave so she decides to first visit the golden eagle at the mountains to finally see it. She then goes abroad to be amongst the people of the Earth and to use her hands to make a life. The movie ends with Boax looking at his own hands thinking of Arete's words about the magic in people's hearts. Characters *Princess Arete (H≈çko Kuwashima) - The young princess of the kingdom. Arete is filled with great interest in life, however as a princess she is expected to live a life she considers hopelessly mundane. As she has grown up, her role in the kingdom has grown in importance and she is moved to live on top of a high tower to enjoy a privileged seclusion from the facts and practicalities of the real world. From here she can only look down upon the vital town below and dream of traveling the world that she has read about in a book she keeps hidden under her bed. This seclusion has engendered strong curiosity about her in the town, and knights compete daily for her hand by questing for magical objects created by an ancient race. To relieve her isolation, the princess sneaks out of the tower to visit the town. *Boax (Tsuyoshi Koyama) - A wizard who has suddenly arrived at the castle on a flying machine to claim the hand of the princess. In fact, Boax does not love the princess at all, and only plots to kidnap her because a prophecy foretells that only she has the power to take away his eternal life.

The plot of the film is changed substantially from the original, mostly because director Sunao Katabuchi, when he came on board the project, felt uncomfortable telling a feminist story from a male point of view, and thus focused on more general themes such as individualism, respect, and diversity. The storyline itself remains that of a princess living in a tower pursued by suitors, and a wicked magician who takes her away.

Early life  Babington was born in 1877 to Hume Babington JP (son of The Rev. Hume Babington), a landowner of 1,540 acres,Dictionary of Irish architectsBurke's Landed Gentry of Ireland, 1958, 4th Edition by L. G. Pine, Burke's Peerage: 'Babington of Creevagh', pg 42' and Hester n√©e Watt (sister of Andrew Alexander Watt) at Creevagh House, County Londonderry. He was educated at Glenalmond School, Perthshire and Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Gold Medal for Oratory of the College of History and Political Science in 1899. Babington was born into the Anglo-Irish Babington family that arrived in Ireland in 1610 when Brutus Babington was appointed Bishop of Derry. Notable relations include Robert Babington, William Babington, Benjamin Guy Babington and James Melville Babington and Anthony Babington. Political and legal career Babington was called to the Irish Bar in 1900. He briefly lectured in Equity at King's Inns, and it was during this time, in 1910, that he re-arranged and re-wrote R.E. Osborne's Jurisdiction and Practice of County Courts in Ireland in Equity and Probate Matters. He took silk in 1917.Babington, Sir Anthony Brutus He moved to the newly established Northern Ireland in 1921 and practised as a barrister until his election to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland as the Ulster Unionist Party member for South Belfast in 1925 and subsequent appointment as Attorney General for Northern Ireland the same year in the cabinet of Lord Craigavon. His appointment to the Privy Council of Northern Ireland in 1926 entitled him to the style \\"The Right Honourable\\". From 1929 Babington was the MP for Belfast, Cromac, the South Belfast constituency having been abolished. He was made an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple in 1930. Babington resigned from politics in 1937 upon his appointment as a Lord Justice of Appeal and was knighted in the 1937 Coronation Honours. In 1947, he chaired the Babington Agricultural Enquiry Committee, named in his honour, which was established in 1943 to examine agriculture in Northern Ireland.[Short, Brian. 2014. The Battle of the Fields: Rural Community and Authority in Britain During the Second World War, p. 334] The committee's first recommendation under Babington's leadership was that Northern Ireland should direct all its energies to the production of livestock and livestock products and to their efficient processing and marketing. Babington retired from the judiciary in 1949, taking up the chairmanship of the Northern Ireland Transport Tribunal, which existed until 1967, established under the Ulster Transport Act - promoting a car-centred transport policy - and which was largely responsible for the closure of the Belfast and County Down Railway. Babington endorsed the closure on financial grounds and was at cross purposes with his co-chair, Dr James Beddy, who advised against the closure, citing the disruption of life in the border region between the north and the south as his primary reason in addition to financial grounds.[Kennedy, M. 2000. Division and Consensus: The Politics of Irish Cross-border Relations, 1925-1969, p. 141] Babington also chaired a government inquiry into the licensing of clubs, the proceeds of which resulted in new regulatory legislation at Stormont. =Renaming Northern Ireland as 'Ulster'= Babington, whilst Attorney-General, was a proponent of renaming Northern Ireland as \\"Ulster\\".The Irish Times, 20 November 1937 reporting on a speech given by the Attorney General on Monday, 15 November 1937. Babington was critical of the newly proposed Irish constitution, in which the name of the Irish state was changed to 'Ireland', laying claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. He said: Babington continued by saying that it was of \\"great importance\\" that the \\"cumbersome name\\" of Northern Ireland that came into the Act of 1920 alongside Southern Ireland should be changed. He continued further remarking that \\"The name of Southern Ireland has been changed and it was time that the name of Northern Ireland should be changed to Ulster\\". =View on Irish unity= Michael McDunphy, Secretary to the President of Ireland (then Douglas Hyde), recalled Ernest Alton's correspondence with Babington on the question of Irish unity, in which Alton and Babington were revealed to be at cross purposes. The discussion was used as an example by Brian Murphy, in Forgotten Patriot: Douglas Hyde and the Foundation of the Irish Presidency, as an example of the office of the Irish President becoming embroiled in an initiative involving Trinity College Dublin and a senior Northern Ireland legal figure, namely Babington. Babington had written to Alton, then Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, expressing his view that, as Murphy summarises, \\"... Severance between the two parts of Ireland could not continue, that it was the duty of all Irishmen to work for early unification and that in his opinion Trinity College was a very appropriate place in which the first move should be made.\\"[Murphy, Brian. 2016. Forgotten Patriot: Douglas Hyde and the Foundation of the Irish Presidency.] When Alton arrived to meet with Hyde, it emerged, after conversing with Hyde's secretary McDunphy, that he and Babington were at cross purposes. \\"It soon became clear that the united Ireland contemplated by Mr [sic] Justice Babington of the Northern Ireland Judiciary was one within the framework of the British Commonwealth of Nations, involving recognition of the King of England as the Supreme Head, or as Dr Alton put it, the symbol of unity of the whole system,\\" wrote McDunphy. Personal life On 5 September 1907, he married Ethel Vaughan Hart, daughter of George Vaughan Hart KC LLD, of Howth, County Dublin (the son of Sir Andrew S. Hart) and his wife Mary Elizabeth Hone, a scion of the Hone family.Ireland, Civil Registration Marriages Index, 1845‚Äì1958, Vol 2, pg 457 They had three children: *Mary Hume Babington (5 June 1908 ‚Äì 24 February 2003),Ireland, Civil Registration Births Index, 1864‚Äì1958, Vol 2, pg 690Mary Hume Babington, ThePeerage.com who married T.G.

The 1970s were dubbed the \\"Me decade\\" by writer Tom Wolfe; Christopher Lasch was another writer who commented on the rise of a culture of narcissism among the younger generation of that era. The phrase caught on with the general public, at a time when \\"self-realization\\" and \\"self-fulfillment\\" were becoming cultural aspirations to which young people supposedly ascribed higher importance than social responsibility. Origins Jogging and other health and diet trends went mainstream with the Me generation. The cultural change in the United States during the 1970s that was experienced by the Baby Boomers is complex. The 1960s are remembered as a time of political protests, radical experimentation with new cultural experiences (the Sexual Revolution, happenings, mainstream awareness of Eastern religions). The Civil Rights Movement gave rebellious young people serious goals to work towards. Cultural experimentation was justified as being directed toward spiritual or intellectual enlightenment. The mid to late 1970s, in contrast, were a time of increased economic crisis and disillusionment with idealistic politics among the young, particularly after the resignation of Richard Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War. Unapologetic hedonism became acceptable among the young. By the mid-1970s, Tom Wolfe and Christopher Lasch were speaking out critically against the culture of narcissism. These criticisms were widely repeated throughout American popular media. The development of a youth culture focusing so heavily on self-fulfillment was also perhaps a reaction against the traits that characterized the older generation, which had grown up during the Great Depression. That generation had learned values associated with self-sacrifice. The deprivations of the Depression had taught that generation to work hard, save money and not spend it, and to cherish family and community ties. Loyalty to institutions, traditional religious faiths, and other common bonds were what that generation considered to be the cultural foundations of their country. Gen X'ers gradually abandoned those values in large numbers, a development that was entrenched during the 1970s. The 1970s have been described as a transitional era when the self-help of the 1960s became self- gratification, and eventually devolved into the selfishness of the 1980s. Characteristics Discos and nightclubbing became popular with Me generation singles during the 1970s. Health and exercise fads, New Age spirituality such as Scientology and hot tub parties, self-help programs such as EST (Erhard Seminars Training), and the growth of the self-help book industry became identified with the Baby Boomers during 1970s. Human potential, emotional honesty, \\"finding yourself\\", and new therapies became hallmarks of the culture. The marketing of lifestyle products, eagerly consumed by Baby Boomers with disposable income during the 1970s, became an inescapable part of the culture. Revlon's marketing staff did research into young women's cultural values during the 1970s, and the research revealed that young women were striving to compete with men in the workplace and to express themselves as independent individuals. Revlon launched the \\"lifestyle\\" perfume Charlie, with marketing aimed at glamorizing the values of the new 1970s woman, and it became the world's best-selling perfume. The introspection of the Baby Boomers and their focus on self-fulfillment has been examined in a serious light in pop culture. Films such as An Unmarried Woman (1978), Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), Ordinary People (1980) and The Big Chill (1983) brought the inner struggles of Baby Boomers to a wide audience. The self-absorbed side of 1970s life was given a sharp and sometimes poignant satirization in Manhattan (1979). More acerbic lampooning came in Shampoo (1975) and Private Benjamin (1980). The Me generation has also been satirized in retrospect, as the generation called \\"Baby Boomers\\" reached adulthood, for example, in Parenthood (1989). Forrest Gump (1994) summed up the decade with Gump's cross-country jogging quest for meaning during the 1970s, complete with a tracksuit, which was worn as much as a fashion statement as an athletic necessity during the era. The satirization of the Me generation's \\"me first\\" attitude perhaps reached its peak with the television sitcom Seinfeld, which does not include conscious moral development for its Gen X characters, but rather the opposite. Its plots do not have teaching lessons for its audience and its creators explicitly held the position that it was a \\"show about nothing\\". Persistence of the label The Me generation, for the most part, embraced entertainment and consumer culture. The term \\"Me generation\\" has persisted over the decades and is connected to Baby Boomers. Some writers, however, have also named the Millennials \\"the Me Generation\\" or \\"Generation Me\\", while Elspeth Reeve in The Atlantic noted that narcissism is a symptom of youth in most generations. The 1970s were also an era of rising unemployment among the young, continuing erosion of faith in conventional social institutions, and political and ideological aimlessness for many. This was the environment that precipitated gravitation toward Punk rock among America's disaffected young people. By 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president, a growing number of America's Baby Boomers had also begun turning toward conservative political and cultural priorities. As Eastern religions and rituals such as yoga grew during the 1970s, at least one writer observed a New Age corruption of the popular understanding of \\"realization\\" taught by Neo-Vedantic practitioners, away from spiritual realization and towards \\"self-realization\\". The leading edge of the Baby Boomers, who were counter-culture \\"hippies\\" and political activists during the 1960s, have been referred to sympathetically as the \\"Now generation\\", in contrast to the Me generation.

MiTEx mission patch The Micro-satellite Technology Experiment (MiTEx) is a microsatellite-based mission launched into geosynchronous orbit 21 June 2006 aboard a Delta II rocket. The USAF described the mission as a \\"technology demonstration\\" for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the United States Air Force (USAF) and the United States Navy (US Navy). MiTEx consists of three spacecraft; two inspection satellites, designated USA-187 and USA-188, and an experimental upper stage, designated USA-189. The two inspection satellites were initially used to inspect each other; however, they were later used to inspect DSP-23, a failed missile detection satellite, to find out why it stopped operating.  Development  MiTEx was developed with funding from the Microsatellite Demonstration Science and Technology Experiment Program (MiDSTEP). Funding for MiDSTEP (and thus MiTEx) is allocated to DARPA through the \\"Space Programs and Technology\\" element of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) \\"Advanced Technology Development\\" budget item. DoD budget documents from February 2008 show costs of MiDSTEP in 2007 of US$8 million, in 2008 of US$10 million, and in 2009 of US$8 million. Owen C. Brown was the program manager for the design, integration, test, launch, and demonstration of MiTEx, while he was a program manager in the Tactical Technology Office (TTO) at DARPA.  Launch  The satellites were launched from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 17 on 21 June 2006 at 21:34 UTC using a Delta II carrier rocket flying in a 7925-9.5 configuration. The two inspection satellites were lifted to geosynchronous orbit by a fourth stage of a new, experimental design. The stage was developed at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (USNRL), and it is reportedly equipped with photovoltaic arrays for power.  Mission  Because of their small dimensions (with a mass of each), the satellites are hard to detect in their geosynchronous orbit, and thus could approach and examine other satellites without being noticed. After completion of their primary mission, the satellites were parked on opposite sides of Earth. During the 2nd week of January 2009, the MiTEx satellites were commanded to approach DSP-23, which had failed two months earlier, and had started to drift by 1¬∞ East from its own parking position at 8.5¬∞ East. The MiTEx satellite parked over the mid- Atlantic rendezvoused with DSP-23 around 23 December 2008, followed by the 2nd MiTEx satellite one week later.

Most of his early works were oils but he also worked on murals and with watercolours. He was a founding member of the St John's Wood Clique and was well known for his humorous performances. Life and work Capital and Labour (1874) Marks was the fourth child of John Isaac Marks and Elizabeth (n√©e Pally). His father was a solicitor who later became a coach builder. One of his brothers was the writer John George Marks. Henry studied in small schools near Regent's Park and at Eythorne, Kent where he learned to paint heraldry symbols so as to assist his father in his carriage making business. In 1845 he worked for a friend of his father as a clerk in a warehouse. He later went to work with his father and around 1846 he attended evening classes at James Mathews Leigh's art school where he would become a friend of Frederick Walker (Marks' younger brother later married Walker's twin sister).Marks (1894) v1:76. For some time he worked for magazines like Home Circle producing wood-cut illustrations. After being rejected once, Henry enrolled successfully at the Royal Academy Schools in December 1851. In 1852 his father sold off the carriage-making business leaving Henry free to attend classes. He however decided to move to Paris with his friend Philip Hermogenes Calderon to study at the atelier of Fran√ßois Edouard Picot and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He returned in June 1852, leaving Calderon in Paris and first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1853, painting a scene from Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing: Dogberry Examining Conrad and Borachio. His works during the 1850s and 1860s were predominantly based on Shakespeare's plays and depicted medieval scenes. Marks' father emigrated to Australia leaving Henry to support his mother, three brothers and from October 1856, his wife, Helen Drysdale (1829-1892). He supplemented his income from painting by carrying out decorative work for various patrons. These included the Minton works, for the stained-glass manufacturers Clayton and Bell, by designing a frieze for the outside wall of the Royal Albert Hall, and for the house of the artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema. His early works on medieval themes included Toothache in the Middle Ages (1856) which was bought by the publisher Charles Edward Mudie with whom he became a friend. Marks' most important patron was Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. He was briefly an art critic for The Spectator, writing under the pen-name of \\"dry-point\\".Marks (1894) v2:1. Marks worked on decorations for the house of the Duke of Westminster at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, between 1874 and 1880. For this purpose he painted two canvasses long of Chaucer's pilgrims in the saloon, and twelve panels of birds in the drawing room. Science is Measurement, Marks' diploma work (1879) Marks was a founding member of the St John's Wood Clique in 1862 along with Calderon. The aim of the clique was to improve each other by critique and the motto framed by Calderon was \\"the better each man's picture, the better for all.\\" Marks was also an entertainer in the group with his fake sermons and songs. He was much loved in the club and was known as \\"Marco\\". He is shown in a cartoon A vision of the clique by Frederick Walker. Marks was a good friend of several of the cartoonists of Punch including John Tenniel and Charles Keene. In 1888 the Fine Art Society planned an exhibition on birds and Marks decided to use this opportunity to take up an intensive study of birds and he became a regular visitor at the zoo. In 1890 he had a private exhibition on his bird works.Marks (1894) v2:147-148. As his career progressed, he became increasingly interested in painting birds. Possibly his most famous painting is A Select Committee (1891) which is now in the Walker Art Gallery. He was elected as a member of the Royal Academy following his painting Convocation, which was exhibited in 1878. Both of these demonstrated his interest in birds, in the former parrots and in the latter adjutant storks and in general his paintings depicted large birds and the colourful parrots and he visited the London Zoo regularly to observe them. His early works were in oil (The Convent Raven, 1870) but many of his paintings of birds were watercolours, which he exhibited at the Old Watercolour Society or at the Fine Art Society. St Francis Preaching to the Birds (1870), was first sold for sold for ¬£450 and seven years later for ¬£1155. His diploma work Science is measurement depicting a scientist with measuring instruments before the skeleton of an adjutant stork is considered a classic. He got the idea of painting this scene while taking measurements for his earlier paintings. \\"In making studies of the birds, I went to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons to take measurements of the bones, their proportionate length, &c.; When I had obtained what information I needed, I came away, and crossing Lincoln's Inn Fields, it struck me that the occupation in which I had been engaged would furnish a good subject for the picture.\\" To paint this picture he asked for advice on obtaining a skeleton of the adjutant stork from Sir William Flower that could be kept at home so that he could study it at leisure. Flower suggested a taxidermy artist and skeleton preparer in Camden Town who supplied him with a suitable specimen. Marks ensured that he counted the vertebrae and measured them carefully to make sure it was accurate. The title was decided after much discussion with artists and scientists and he submitted it as his diploma picture for the Royal Academy of Arts.Marks (1894). v2:52-54. Abraham Dee Bartlett, superintendent at the London zoo, encouraged him to draw birds with accuracy rather than colour them with anthropomorphism. In later years he painted landscapes and seascapes based on studies in Southwold and Walberswick. A bookplate made by Marks for his wife, Mary, that demonstrates his love of drawing birds. Personal life Stacy Marks' bookplate Marks was married in 1856, to Helen Drysdale. Helen died in 1892, and the following year Marks married Mary Harriet Kempe, who was also a painter. Although baptised in an Anglican church, Marks was brought up as a dissenter. A childhood of listening to sermons led him to rebel in later age to religious and other forms of authority by lampooning clerics and preaching bogus sermons. In an interview to Strand Magazine in 1891 he recalled with his typical wit an anecdote: \\"I took home a picture to the Dook of Wellington one day, and, as I was taking it up in the hall, he comes by, and says, \\"Oh, you comes from Messrs. Bennett.\\" \\"Yes, sir,\\" I says. With that he passes on, and out comes at the front door a man dressed all in black, and comes up to me‚Äîhis butler, I suppose. He says, \\"Do you know who you were a talking to just now?\\" \\"Yes, sir,\\" I says, \\"Arthur Wellesley, better known as Dook of Wellington.\\" Then, why don't you say \\"Your Grace to him ?\\" \\"Grace ?\\" says I, \\" why should I say grace for? there's no meat here. Where's the viands? Why, I said sir to him‚Äîa common title of respect between man and man.\\" \\" Well,\\" says he, \\" you are a rum sort of customer, you are. What do you call the Duke ?\\" \\"What do I call him ?\\" I says ; \\"a wholesale carcase butcher! Look at his career. He begins by going to France to learn the art of war, and then he goes to India and kills thousands of natives who were only defending their own country, and at last turns his arms against the country where he first learned the art of war, and murders thousands more. A wholesale carcase butcher: that's what I call him.\\" Marks considered the Royal Academy of Arts to be a clique and wrote on its politics as a parody ballad. He published a two-volume autobiography towards the end of his life titled Pen and Pencil Sketches (1894). Death and legacy Marks died on 9 January 1898 in his London home and was buried in Hampstead Cemetery. His estate amounted to a little over ¬£9,600. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds three of Marks' finished watercolour studies of birds and eleven sketches for larger paintings. Some of his works are exhibited in the Parrot House of Eaton Hall.

This article deals exclusively with conception devices for human reproduction. Types =Ovulation predictors= There are many conception devices on the market today that can be used for predicting ovulation so that sperm can be introduced into the reproductive tract of a woman at the appropriate time, whether by sexual intercourse, including NI or by artificial insemination. Ovulation is the time of the month when the oocyte, or egg, is released by the woman. This is identified as the most fertile time in a woman's menstrual cycle. Introducing semen into the vaginal cavity during the ovulation time, called 'timing of intercourse' or 'timing of artificial insemination', is important for achieving a pregnancy. Where a donor is being used, timing is particularly important because donor sperm which is supplied by a sperm bank or a fertility clinic is expensive and it is crucial that it be used at the opportune time. Similarly, where a private donor is used, he will usually wish to supply his sperm for artificial insemination or to inseminate using intercourse at the optimum time of the month. One type of ovulation predictor is a saliva tester. To use it a woman spits onto a glass slide to observe when salt crystals are forming to identify when she is ovulating. The saliva salt crystal formation is known as \\"ferning\\", due to the visual similarity to a fern plant under the microscope as the saliva dries. This will show an increase in estrogen that is related to ovulation.Daniel, J., Lonergan, P., Sullivan, P., & Taylor, S. (1987). Evaluation of Determine: The Ovutest as a device for identifying optimal time for conception. Fertility and Sterility, 47(4), 590. There are devices that are like wrist watches or patches affixed to sensitive areas of the skin that measure subtle body chemical changes on the surface of the skin to help to identify time of ovulation.Myers ER. MD Assistant Professor, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Duke University Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) Results of Trial of Fertilite Ovulation Detection Device (OV- Watch Fertility Predictor). Data on file, HealthWatchSystems, Inc. Ov-Watch Clinical Trial Some devices also come with on-line help and support. A commonly used ovulation predictor is the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge urine stick or ovulation predictor stick that helps to identify the time of ovulation.[Brown, J.B., Holmes, J., & Barker, G. (1991). Use of the home ovarian monitor in pregnancy avoidance. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 165, 2008‚Äì2011 Ovulation Predictor Stick Use] A woman will urinate on an LH surge stick once or twice a day, starting a few days before suspected ovulation. Often the stick will show two lines indicating that ovulation is 24‚Äì36 hours away. =Basal thermometer= A basal thermometer is an ultra sensitive thermometer that tracks the body's minutest temperature shift. A basal body temperature (BBT) thermometer is often used by women to chart their basal body temperature chart and hence to predict their fertile period or ovulation. A basal thermometer is more reliable and accurate than a simple glass thermometer since glass thermometers are only accurate to .2 degrees Fahrenheit whereas a basal thermometer is generally accurate to .1 degrees Fahrenheit. The basal thermometer is used to chart a woman's fertile time of the month and is used in connection with a chart. The chart should show low temperatures before ovulation in the follicular phase, and higher ones after ovulation in the luteal phase. Using a basal thermometer in connection with a chart over several months should show the best times when conception can take place and enable the planning of intercourse or artificial insemination. However, times may vary slightly each month so that the user will need to check her temperature continually to ensure that she has the most accurate information. For this reason, some women prefer to use the basal thermometer in conjunction with other methods to ensure complete accuracy. Artificial insemination There are a number of methods of artificial insemination. Various devices may be used including: =Conception cap= A conception cap can assist to protect semen from the vaginal cavity and allow semen to pool against the cervical os.Pregnancy following use of the cervical cup for home artificial insemination utilizing homologous semen. MP Diamond et al. Fertility and Sterility, 1983 Apr:39(4): 480-4. Around the time of ovulation, a conception cap or cervical cap is filled with semen and placed on a woman's cervical os for several hours to maximize the time the semen is available to fertilise a waiting egg. Cervical caps are designed for conception and are different from the cervical caps used for contraception, although these may also be used as conception devices. A conception cap may also be used after intercourse or artificial insemination by e.g. a needle-less syringe, and serve to keep the semen in place against the cervix. Cervical caps are increasingly being used as a delivery system for semen from private sperm donors. They have the advantage over the use of needle-less syringes in that it is not necessary to wait until the semen liquifies before inserting the cap into the vagina, and the donor may ejaculate straight into the conception cap. However, a variation is a conception cap to which a narrow tube is attached through which liquefied or frozen and thawed donor semen is inserted by means of a catheter. The narrow tube is then removed. The advantage of this type of device is that it is inserted empty into the vagina and can be positioned around the cervix without risk of seepage of sperm. This device is growing in popularity because its use ensures that the donor's semen is deposited as close as possible to the cervix, and it can be kept there while the woman goes about her normal activities for several hours to aid conception. =Semen collectors= Semen collectors are sheaths (condoms) made specifically for conception and approved by the FDA. Collection condoms are condoms primarily used to collect semen during sexual intercourse. Contraceptive condoms are generally made of latex, and are designed for contraception and preventing spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Collection condoms are sterile and made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. They are usually non-lubricated and have a teat end or reservoir to collect the sperm.Semen Collectors Condoms for the collection of semen samples. Ross LO. Fertility and Sterility. 1995 Mar;63(3):681-2. Collection condoms may be used to facilitate the collection of semen by masturbation or they may be used to collect a semen sample through intercourse. Semen can also be collected by masturbation directly into a sterile container, such as a specimen cup which is usually a clear plastic container with a lid. Some semen collectors have an in-built test tube which allows the collection of the semen without the male having to touch the sample. After collection, the cup portion is removed and replaced by a screw top on the test tube. This device also ensures that none of the sample is lost when transferring it from one container to another. Donors may also use a female condom to collect a semen sample. When used in this way, a female condom may be known as a 'baggy'. A male collection kit usually consists of a collection condom, a specimen cup and, if required, a semen transporter. The latter comprises a sealed container for the sperm and a plastic box containing dry ice into which the container is placed so that it can be sent to a recipient. Transmission is generally by courier. Male collection kits are used for sending semen to a laboratory for analysis, for sending semen to a partner for artificial insemination if the male is absent, and, most commonly, by private sperm donors or sperm donors donating through an agency. A sperm agency will generally supply the male collection kit to donors. The kit allows donors to obtain sperm samples privately as opposed to in a fertility clinic, and samples may be obtained by sexual intercourse which usually results in greater fecundity. However, if sperm is being supplied by a private donor, the use of a collection kit does not guarantee that the sample actually derives from a particular person. =Needle-less syringe= A needle- less syringe may be used to insert donor or partner sperm into the vagina for intracervical inseminations (ICI). The syringe may be used by the recipient woman (self-insemination), or by a third party, often a nurse or doctor. With this type of syringe, it is necessary to wait until the semen liquifies before it can be used. Syringes are also available which are specially designed for DIY inseminations using a donor. These consist of a funnel which is connected directly to the syringe. The donor ejaculates into the funnel allowing the semen to drop directly into the syringe. A plunger is inserted and the syringe is then placed vertically to expel the air. The semen is pushed to the tip of the syringe which may then be inserted into the vagina. This type of syringe has the advantage over the standard needle-less syringe in that semen can be used for an insemination immediately after ejaculation, without having to wait for it to liquify. =Catheter= A specially designed catheter may be used to insert specially washed sperm directly into the uterus for intrauterine inseminations (IUI). The procedure is normally carried out by a physician and has a better pregnancy rate than ICI insemination. This method is commonly offered by fertility clinics using donor sperm because the increased pregnancy rate results in fewer donor samples being used for the same number of pregnancies. Semen used for IUI must first be 'washed' to provide a pure sperm sample: this prevents 'cramping' following the insemination. =Sperm separator= This invention consists of a sterile, disposable, compartmentalized swim-up column for the swimming-up of spermatozoa (developed by Prof. Zavos), at desired levels of dilution in a suitable media, and a swimming down of spermatozoa into compartments within the column. This device allows for the separation of semen samples in relation to sperm morphology, motility, progressive motility, speed, sperm concentration, fertilisation potential, and sex ratio. The device comprises a hollow, vertically supported column, having a closed lower end, and an open upper end. This device facilitates the use of particular concentrations of sperm for certain uses, e.g. IUI or assisted reproductive technology (ART), and it also allows for fertilisation by the use of gender-separated sperm, although the use of the separator for this purpose does not appear to be 100% reliable. =Vaginal speculum= A vaginal speculum is commonly used in artificial insemination procedures and are routinely used for IUI inseminations. The device consists of two shaped flanges which are inserted into the vagina and can be opened and locked in the open position to allow the cervix to be viewed. A syringe containing sperm or a catheter may then be inserted through the open speculum and into the opened vagina. This device enables sperm to be more accurately deposited near to the cervix or, in the case of IUI, directly into the womb. Disposable specula are manufactured from transparent plastic, while stainless- steel specula may be sterilised and re-used. =Sperm-friendly lubricant= Conventional lubricants contain chemicals which may damage sperm. Sperm- friendly lubricants have been developed which specifically aid conception by creating a chemical balance in the vagina which is conducive to fertilisation. Sperm-friendly lubricants are sometimes sold with an applicator so that the lubricant can be applied directly into the vagina. The lubricant may also be applied to a needle-less syringe or conception cap filled with sperm before it is inserted into the vagina. Sperm-friendly lubricants are commonly used for all forms of artificial insemination. If a pregnancy is being attempted by sexual intercourse where the partners are attempting to achieve a pregnancy, or by natural insemination (NI) with a sperm donor, a sperm-friendly lubricant should always be used rather than a normal sexual lubricant. Normal sexual lubricants may contain chemicals which can damage the sperm.

The borough got its \\"Ducktown\\" nickname mainly because of persistent flooding. Big money The team played independently against other teams from Pennsylvania's \\"coal country\\". During the 1920s the teams based here paid large amounts of money to talented pro football players. Many players from the National Football League came to play football in this region because of the amount of money paid out. In 1924 Gilberton, under the managership of Joe Keating and James Rafferty, Gilberton acquired three new star players just days before their season opener. The team signed Ben Shaw, Cecil Grigg, and Lou Smyth. All three players were members of the Canton Bulldogs of the NFL. Ironically in 1924 the team played in the Anthracite League, which was formed to combat the out-of-control hiring of top professional football talent. It is no wonder that league folded after the 1924 season. The team later played in the Eastern League of Professional Football from 1926 until the league folded in 1927.

Launched in September 1964, the Lightning Clubman was only in production until October 1965, resulting in a limited production run of 200 machines, so original Clubman models are highly sought after.

Racing success World motorcycle champion Mike Hailwood won the 1965 Hutchinson 100 Production race at the Silverstone racecourse on a BSA Lightning Clubman in heavy rain, beating the Triumph racing team's Bonnevilles. The 'Hutch' was the main production race of the season, so it was very important to manufacturers to establish the racing credentials of their latest range. Triumph Bonnevilles were ridden by World Champion Phil Read and Triumph employee/works rider Percy Tait. BSA Lightning Clubmans were ridden by Grand Prix champion Hailwood (with a large number 1 on the fairing) and factory rider Tony Smith. Conditions were poor and Smith was out of the race at slippery Stowe Corner. With little regard for the rain Hailwood was achieving laps of 83 mph to establish his winning lead.

Geoffrey, the Prior of Pentney, took the case to the Pope, and when it finally was dealt with, in the reign of Henry II, Bigod was excommunicated by the Pope, who imposed an interdict on the earldom. This created a tension between Henry, who opposed the interdict, and the Bishops of London and Norwich, who with the support of Thomas Becket were expected to enforce it.p139, Thomas Becket, Frank Barlow, University of California Press, 1990, .

Its northern terminus is at SR 129 near Millville, just west of SR 129's junction with U.S. Route 27. For its entire length, SR 748 is also known as Millville-Shandon Road. Route description Existing entirely within Butler County, SR 748 is not included within the National Highway System. SR 748 commences at its junction with SR 126 in the hamlet of Shandon. Starting out in a northwesterly direction, the highway passes through a residential neighborhood. Bending to the north, the highway enters into rural Morgan Township. The majority of SR 748 passes amid farmland, with the occasional patch of trees and numerous houses lining the roadway. After traveling due north, the highway bends to the northwest, meets Bell Road, then bends back to the north. SR 748 next bends to the northeast and then east-northeast, as it crosses Morgan-Ross Road, and into Ross Township. Following intersections with Kirchling Road and Layhigh Road, the state route bends back to the northeast, and crosses Fenton Road.

Throughout his life, he remained undaunted by modern innovations and the attempts of rivals to produce another type of music. He was best known for his radio collaboration with Fuad Hassad on the character of the Egyptian tradition of El-Missaharati. Life Mekawy was born in Cairo Sayeda Zeinab district of Al-Nasriya on May 8, 1927. When his father died, Mekawy cried for days. Later, the pain eased, but the tears kept flowing. Doctors were powerless either to diagnose his condition or to stop the tears. One day, however, he could no longer see. This affliction did not prevent him from learning the Qur'an or becoming an Azharite scholar. Having been trained in the art of reciting the Qur'an, Mekawy's voice could soar, gruff but powerful, to thrill his listeners. He sang solo using his lute at numerous concerts, though this is not what brought him fame, or confirmed his status as one of the most gifted and popular composers of oriental music. What brought him fame, however, was the unforgettable character of al-Missaharati, the man who announces the pre-dawn meal during the month of Ramadan, that he and Fuad Haddad created in 1951. A popular figure during the holy month, the Missaharati was given new life by Haddad's words and Mekawy's music. Composed to the beat of the traditional \\"Tabla\\" (Drum), it stirs up feelings of patriotism, nationalism and pride in Arab Muslim culture. The Missaharati represented an entire generation, expressing its suffering, frustrations and dreams. When Al-Missaharati was aired for the first time on the radio, it instantly became a symbol of national aspirations. It continues forty years later to help the faithful keep vigil, exhorting Muslims to rise for their pre-dawn meal. Touching his audience to the quick, Mekawy in fact, touched on all the important economic, social, intellectual and political issues directly concerning the less privileged classes. Critical of any national shortcoming, he was prompt to deride bureaucracy in his song Al-lstemara Rakba Al-Humara (\\"The Questionnaire on a Donkey\\"). But Ha'n hareb (\\"We Shall Fight\\"), which came out in 1956, and Al-Ard Bitetkalem Arabi (\\"The land Speaks Arabic\\"), composed after 1973, were also true expressions of pride in his country. More than anything, however, Mekawi will be remembered for his contribution to Egyptian folklor music and especially the operetta El Leila El Kebira (\\"The Big Night\\"), for which he wrote the music to the words of poet Salah Jahin. First conceived for the radio, describing the last and most important night of the \\"Moulid\\", a saint's festival, it was later adapted for the puppet theatre and aired on television, becoming an instant and lasting success with children and grown-ups alike. Mekawy died on the 11th anniversary of Salah Jahin's death. Of Salah Jahin, he used to say, \\"We get along like \\"Assal\\" with \\"Tehina\\", (molasses and sesame paste which always go together).

RNA probes can be produced by in vitro transcription of cloned DNA inserted in a suitable plasmid downstream of a viral promoter. Some bacterial viruses code for their own RNA polymerases, which are highly specific for the viral promoters. Using these enzymes, labeled NTPs, and inserts inserted in both forward and reverse orientations, both sense and antisense riboprobes can be generated from a cloned gene. Since James Watson and Francis Crick revealed the double helix nature of DNA molecule (Watson & Crick, 1953), the hydrogen bonds between the four bases are well known: adenine always binds to thymine and cytosine always binds to guanine. This binding pattern is the basic principle of modern genetic technologies. Joseph Gall and Mary Lou Pardue published a paper in 1969 demonstrating that radioactive marked ribosomal DNA can be used to detect its complementary DNA sequence in a frog egg, known as the first researchers who use DNA probes to perform in situ hybridization. RNA probes were proved to be able to perform the same function and also used with in situ hybridization. Fluorescent dyed probes replaced radio labeled probes due to the consideration of safety, stability, and ease of detection. Detecting a DNA sequence is similar to \\"looking for a needle in a haystack, with the needle being the DNA sequence of interest and the haystack being a set of chromosomes\\". The ability of the DNA helix to disassociate, re-anneal and the remarkable accuracy of base-pairing grants riboprobes the ability to locate its complementary DNA sequence on chromosomes.  Applications  There are two kinds of probes used during in situ hybridization: Riboprobes and DNA oligonucleotides probes. Riboprobes are essential in the study of embryo development in which DNA probes are insufficient. With labelled (fluoresce-dyed, for instance) antisense RNA probes hybridized with developing embryo's mRNA, tracking the expression of genes in different stages of development is possible. RNA probes can be used in detecting either whole embryo's development or just on tissue sections of interest. The ability of riboprobes to bind to transcribed mRNA makes RNA probes important in research on model organisms: Drosophila, zebrafish, chick, Xenopus and mouse. RNA probes can also be utilized in immunohistochemistry to identify tissue infection in embryos. Viral mRNA can be targeted by its antisense RNA probes, while infected tissues don't have complementary mRNA that can hybridize with probes; the unique mRNA sequence of each organism makes the detection of expression of certain gene highly effective and accurate. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)is the most widely used riboprobe technique. A target sequence and a probe are essential in FISH. First, the probe is labeled with either direct or indirect labeling strategy: hapten-modified nucleotides are used in indirect labeling, and fluorophore-modified nucleotides are used in direct labeling. The target DNA and probes are denatured and mixed, allows the re-annealing of DNA sequences. Indirect labeling requires an extra step to produce visualized signals that requires use of enzymatic or immunological system, but provides greater signal amplification than direct labeling. FISH probes can also be used in karyotype studies. DNA probes can be labeled with various fluorochromes which produce a unique color for each chromosomes. The probes are then hybridized with metaphase chromosomes, producing unique patterns on each chromosomes. This method is useful when people want to study the translocation, deletion and duplication of chromosomes on a larger scale comparing to site-specific FISH.

When tested in 1929 and 1930, it showed unsatisfactory handling characteristics and was rejected by the RAF in favour of the Hawker Fury biplane fighter. Development Specification F.20/27 was for a fighter operating in the daylight interception role. The main requirement was that the F.20/27 fighter would be able to overtake, in the shortest possible time, an enemy aircraft passing overhead at 150 mph (242 km/hr) at an altitude of 20,000 feet (6,096 meters).Colin Sinnott, The Royal Air Force and Aircraft Design 1923-1939, Frank Cass publishing, UK 2001. This put the emphasis on high speed and rate of climb. Design work on the Interceptor started in late 1927, and it made its first flight in early 1929, with Lieutnant L. G. Paget at the controls.James Goulding, Interceptor, Ian Allan Ltd., UK 1986. The Interceptor was a low-wing monoplane with an all-metal structure and wire-braced wings, covered mostly in fabric with the exception of the front fuselage. It had a fixed undercarriage. The single prototype was powered by an uncowled Bristol Mercury IIA, later replaced by a Mercury III. It was armed with two .303-inch (7.7-mm) Vickers Mk.II machine guns, installed in the sides of the fuselage with the breeches within reach of the pilot. The guns were synchronized to fire through the propeller, and heated to improve their operation at high altitude. The RAF had intended to call for four-gun armament in Specification F.20/27, but after an administrative mix-up it was sent out to manufacturers calling for only two guns. The handling characteristics of the Interceptor have been described as \\"alarming.\\"Tim Mason, British Flight Testing: Martlesham Heath 1920-1939, Putnam, UK 1993 In steep turns the elevator became ineffective, and the aircraft was prone to enter a spiral dive or a spin from such flight attitudes. The Mercury II engine suffered from persistent high oil temperatures. Test pilots gave a negative assessment of the Interceptor, causing it to be withdrawn from the F.20/27 competition. The aircraft continued to fly until 1935, but no orders were placed. Significant aerodynamic modifications were made to improve the handling characteristics, including a considerable increase in the height of the fin and rudder, to improve spin recovery. The troublesome Mercury engine was exchanged for a Bristol Jupiter VII, and later fitted with a Townend ring to reduce drag. The Interceptor and two of the competing F.20/27 designs, the Vickers Jockey and de Havilland DH.77, were historically important because they were monoplane fighter prototypes, after a long period during which the standard fighter design was a biplane. However, all three were found lacking in overall performance and handling during the test flights, showing that the aircraft designers had failed to reach the project goal. The F.20/27 competition was won by the Hornet, which entered service under the name Hawker Fury.

In addition to his many business interests, he was appointed the 7th Governor of the Montana Territory, serving from 1885 to 1887. Background Hauser was born to Samuel Thomas and Mary Ann (Kennett) Hauser in Falmouth, Kentucky on January 10, 1833. His early education occurred locally at the Chittenden School while both his father, a judge and lawyer, and a cousin who had graduated from Yale University, oversaw his later education. At the age of 19, Hauser went to work for the Kentucky Central Railroad. He then moved to Missouri in 1854, where he worked as a civil engineer for the railroads. He began as an assistant engineer for the Missouri Pacific and Northern Pacific railways and worked his way up to become chief engineer on the Lexington to Sedalia branch. Hauser married Ellen Farrar of St. Louis in 1871. The marriage produced two children: Ellen and Samuel Thomas Jr. Montana In early 1862, Hauser left his position with the railroads for Fort Benton, Montana from where he spent several months prospecting before arriving at the mines in Bannack later in the year. The next year his prospecting efforts took him down the Yellowstone River. His efforts proved successful and within a few years he owned six silver mines. He also built coal mines and several silver smelters, including Montana Territory's first smelter in Argenta. In addition to his mining interests, Hauser developed a number of other business activities. In 1865 he joined with Nathaniel P. Langford to establish a bank in Virginia City. The next year, Hauser founded the First National Bank of Helena. He later opened banks in Fort Benton, Butte, and Missoula. Hauser oversaw the build-out of the Utah and Northern Railway within Montana Territory, and also acquired a large real estate portfolio in support of his mining and ranching interests. In 1870, Hauser participated as a member of the Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition. He was also active in efforts to preserve the Yellowstone area and his lobbying efforts helped see the creation of the Yellowstone National Park. Politically he was aligned with the Democratic Party and served as a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention. Despite being a Democrat, Hauser's business influence was large within the territory that he even influenced the selection of Republican appointees. Governorship Hauser became the first territorial resident to be appointed Governor of Montana Territory after President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the position on July 3, 1885. He took office on July 14 of the same year. During his term of office, his many business interests consumed much of his time and many of his duties as governor were delegated to his personal secretary. As governor, Hauser was an advocate of free silver and supported relocating the territory's indigenous population to the Indian Territory in order to free land for settlers. To appease cattle interests within the territory he appointed a territorial veterinary surgeon while, in an effort to constrain territorial spending, vetoed the establishment of a territorial insane asylum. In order to free himself to concentrate on his business activities, Hauser submitted his resignation in December 1886. His last day in office came on February 7, 1887. Personal life, death and legacy The Hauser Mansion. Hauser built the Hauser Mansion in Helena; it is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hauser died in Helena, Montana on November 10, 1914 and was buried in the Forestvale Cemetery.

He is portrayed by Brian J. Smith. Matthew Scott holds the rank of First Lieutenant, and is described as a skilled and well-trained junior SGC member in his twenties, but is \\"mentally unprepared for the urgency of the situation\\" aboard the Destiny. Originally named Jared Nash, Scott was among the first characters to have been created in the series. Before being cast, Smith had not seen the Stargate series, but caught up with much of SG-1 afterward. The character has been well received by critics as well as some of the cast and crew of the series. Character arc In season one, Scott is said to be 26 years old. At age 4, his parents were killed in a car crash and he was raised by a priest whose alcoholism led to his death when Scott was 17. He originally planned to enter the priesthood until he slept with a girl, Annie Balic, and she fell pregnant. Though Annie told Scott she was not going to go through with the pregnancy she changed her mind and had a boy who she named Matt, after his father. In the present day, Scott is in a physical relationship with fellow Icarus Base officer Vanessa James (Julia Benson). After the base falls under attack, Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira) has him lead the expedition to the nine-chevron address after Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) dials it instead of Earth. Scott becomes the leader of the expedition's first off-world mission, where he finds lime to repair the CO2 scrubbers on the Destiny, having followed a strange, swirling cloud of dust to its location. While on the ship he develops a friendship, and later intimate relationship with Chloe Armstrong (Elyse Levesque). In the second half of the first season, Scott participates in an off-world mission with Chloe, Eli (David Blue) and Greer; during the mission, he and the team end up trapped underground, and Destiny leaves without them. After Destiny leaves the galaxy without them, the planet's Stargate mysteriously activates to Destiny and they step through, not knowing until later that it was the work of the blue aliens introduced in \\"Space\\". =Characterization= Actor Brian J. Smith believed Scott started out like something of \\"the background character in SG-1\\" and that in Universe he's \\"all of a sudden [...] this main character in this tragedy.\\" He describes Scott as \\"an emotional leader\\" and a \\"deceptively simple guy,\\" with a very intense and sad back story full of loss and challenges. Scott would also be \\"at his best\\" in the episode \\"Water\\", and be \\"at his worst\\" in the episode \\"Pain\\". He is shown to be fairly religious, which is proven by reciting the words to Psalm 23 in \\"Darkness\\". Smith commented that Scott views Colonel Young as a father figure, but throughout the first season he is \\"starting to see him becoming something ugly and demented,\\" though \\"he can forgive\\" and \\"he can learn.\\" Concerning Scott's relationship with Chloe, Smith believed that although \\"so much happened so fast,\\" behind the scenes, they share common hopes, dreams and fears, and tease and joke with each other. He also believed Scott would view Eli as \\"bizarre and weird, and doesn't quite know what to make of him,\\" but respects his brain power and friendliness, and doesn't think there is a sense of threat or competition between Scott and Eli concerning Chloe, since they both \\"understand the place that each of them have in Chloe's life.\\" Conceptual history Brian J. Smith, who originally didn't want to portray a regular in a television series, was attracted to Scott's backstory and the writing of the pilot. In the original casting call of the series, Matthew Scott was originally named Jared Nash. He was among the first of the main characters to have been created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper. Scott was created as a flawed hero, since the viewers could identify with this better than a \\"perfect hero\\"; in SG-1 and Atlantis, all the characters often knew the solution to various problems, but the creators didn't want this to be the case in Universe. Wright and Cooper also made the character religious because they avoided doing so in characters in the past. Before being cast, Brian J. Smith had been working as a stage actor in New York City for a year and a half and had seen a couple of Stargate episodes. When he was looking to start a television career, he saw himself to play for guest spots or multi-episode characters rather than series regulars. When he was approached for the role, he was attracted to the writing of the pilot episode and a talk with Robert C. Cooper, who outlined the new approach to shooting the series. He was also attracted to his character's backstory, and was impressed to see \\"a young man in his twenties portrayed this way,\\" and that the writers did not create Scott in other series where actors Smith's age are portrayed as egotistical, mindless, and sex-craved players. Smith taped his Stargate Universe audition and was invited to a screen test in Los Angeles. He received the news of being cast a few days after the screen test. He prepared for the role by doing military research, particularly by reading books based on the Vietnam War, and talking with Angelique McDonald, one of the series' Air Force advisers, about the nature of and how vulnerable First Lieutenants really are. He had not seen the Stargate TV series before being cast, but caught up with much of SG-1 afterwards. Smith has said that one of his favourite episodes in the first season was \\"Air\\", partly due to the filming in White Sands, New Mexico, but also said it was one of the most difficult to film, and \\"Life\\". When acting for the role, Smith wanted to make everything real. In an interview with SFX, Smith expressed being anxious and nervous over performing nude scenes in the series, stating \\"When you're doing a scene and you're very scantily clad, you can get a little bit nervous and don't know how it's going to turn out.\\" Reception According to Consulting Producer Joseph Mallozzi, Brian J. Smith was \\"always a pleasure to talk to\\", \\"extremely talented\\" and reminded him and the character as \\"a young Ben Browder.\\" Smith himself positively received his character, saying \\"I just like the kid, I like him a lot.\\" Fellow actor Jamil Walker Smith named Scott his favorite character. Mark Wilson of About.com called Brian J. Smith as Matthew Scott a \\"breakout performance\\", and that although Smith was relatively fresh out of Juilliard School, he is able to \\"bring to bear his own situation as a novice shouldering a significant portion of the weight of a show like this.\\" References External links * Matthew Scott at Syfy.com Fictional lieutenants Fictional orphans Fictional United States Air Force personnel Stargate characters Television characters introduced in 2009 cs:Seznam postav seri√°lu Hvƒõzdn√° br√°na: Hlubok√Ω vesm√≠r#Matthew Scott ","title":"Matthew Scott (Stargate)"},{"id":"21122861","title":"Eli Wallace"},{"id":"21122862","title":"Everett Young"},{"id":"21122875","text":"G√§rdet metro station is a station on the red line of the Stockholm metro, located in the district of Ladug√•rdsg√§rdet.

CSC provides both funding for Chinese citizens and residents to study abroad, and for foreign students and scholars to study in China. The agency predominantly provides scholarships to individuals, including in batches allocated to specific foreign universities. The CSC funds approximately 65,000 Chinese students studying abroad in a given year, and the same number of international students in China. About 26,000 Chinese students in the United States are receiving funding from the CSC. According to a 2020 report by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, certain CSC scholarships require that recipients \\"support the leadership of the Communist Party and the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics; love the motherland; have a sense of responsibility to serve the country, society, and the people; and to have a correct world view, outlook on life, and values system.\\" Among its largest or most well-known scholarship programs, the CSC manages the Chinese government award for outstanding self finance students abroad, which funds about five hundred students each year; and the National Construction High-Level University Postgraduate Program scholarship, which funds about 10,000 graduate students each year. Both scholarships are designed to persuade or compel Chinese students to return home after completing their studies; otherwise the Chinese government holds financial guarantors responsible. The CSC's elite-track funding mechanism for foreign exchange is the International Cooperative Program for Innovative Talents (ICPIT) program, which funds hundreds of special training programs arising from collaborations between top Chinese and international institutions.

The Caterpillar 789 dump truck is a model of large dump trucks, typically used in open pit mining, manufactured by Caterpillar Inc. The 789 has a capacity of 177 tonnes, and its engine can produce 1770 horsepower. While some competing products use hybrid drive, the Caterpillar 789 has an entirely mechanical drive-train. The first Caterpillar 789 trucks were introduced in 1986. The vehicle's controls are designed to work much like those of an ordinary truck. However, they have multiple mechanisms for the driver to slow or stop the vehicle. Next to the traditional brake pedal there is a second foot pedal to activate a secondary braking system. There is a lever to the right of the steering wheel, called the \\"retarding brake\\", used for less intense braking. Finally, the vehicle's drive-train will automatically change gears, while descending inclines, to help the driver keep its speed under control. Because the vehicle provides the driver with a limited view, with many blind spots, they are equipped with multiple proximity sensors, and closed circuit TVs cameras. Vehicles average 0.3 miles per gallon. Vehicle have six tires, that are in diameter, and cost $50,000 to replace.

United States International Trade Commission, 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001), was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified the law of repair and reconstruction (permitting the owner of a patented item to fix the item when it breaks, but not to essentially build a new item from the parts of an old one), holding that it was not a patent infringement for one party to restore another party's patented \\"one-use\\" camera to be used a second time. Facts A company called Polytech Enterprise Limited acquired used disposable cameras which had been manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. and sold by Fuji to consumers. Fuji owned several patents on the technology used in the cameras. Polytech refurbished the cameras through a process which included fitting the camera with new film, and in some instances with new flash batteries, repairing the camera case to exclude light following the film reloading operation, repackaging, and relabeling under the trademark of Jazz Photo Corp. The cameras were brought to China to be refurbished, and Jazz Photo then reimported them into the United States for sale. The United States Customs Service intercepted two shipments of these cameras, and sought to prevent their entry into the United States on the grounds that they infringed Fuji's patents. Jazz Photo objected, asserting that the patents were not infringed because, rather than build new cameras incorporating the proprietary technology, Jazz Photo had simply purchased Fuji's own cameras and repaired them. Opinion The Federal Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge Pauline Newman, concluded that Jazz Photo was correct. The court clarified the line between reconstruction - building a new copy of a patented invention - and permissible repair. The court indicated that \\"[w]hile ownership of a patented article does not include the right to make a substantially new article, it does include the right to preserve the useful life of the original article.\\" Jazz Photo Corp., 264 F.3d at 1102. The opinion then recounted the common law history of repair-reconstruction law, before finally determining that Jazz Photo's actions amounted to repair. The court held that Jazz Photo had legally acquired patented inventions, and, rather than infringe on Fuji's patent by reverse engineering, manufacturing, and selling a new product, it opted to refurbish existing items to extend their useful lives. Continued viability questioned In April 2014, the Federal Circuit sua sponte called for briefing and amicus curiae participation in an en banc consideration of whether Jazz Photo should be overruled in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Kirtsaeng case. The court ordered: > In light of Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2012), > should this court overrule Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade > Commission, 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001), to the extent it ruled that a > sale of a patented item outside the United States never gives rise to United > States patent exhaustion.

The family is filmed and to recoup scientific expenses the distribution rights for the footage are sold to a television station for broadcast as a domestic soap opera called Eternal Family. The show becomes highly popular in the outside world so when a plumbing disaster results in the family accidentally escaping, the television station and the residents of Champon City spare no expense to retrieve them. The story was written jointly by Morimoto and Dai Sato. Eternal Family represents Sato's debut as an anime screenwriter, and Morimoto's first foray into the field of broadcast media. In 2004 the OVA was collected for release on one DVD. Plot The storyline follows an actor named Ben and a group of six unrelated men and women who have been implanted with false memories that they are his family. They live together in a capsule with a pet dog and chicken and apart from Ben, none of them know anything about the outside world. The outside world, however, is intimately acquainted with their lives, as the artificial drama is broadcast live as a real-life soap opera in the simulated community of Champon City.Eternal Family .

Background Bred by the Comte de Dauger, she was sold in England for FF825 at the Tattersalls September yearling sale. She was purchased by trainer Thomas Carter, Jr., a member of the renowned English Racing Colony at Chantilly, in equal partnership with French scientist, Mr. H. Bouy of Senlis, Oise. Racing career =France= In her eighteen career races, Plaisanterie was beaten only twice, and both times by colts when she finished second by very narrow margins. Her first loss came at age two against colts in the Grand Criterium at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris when she ran second by a short head to The Condor. She would later reverse that form, defeating The Condor four times. At age three, Plaisanterie's second career loss came against older male horses at Longchamp in the Prix du Prince de Galles when she again was second by a short head. In three head-to-head meetings with the Prix de Diane winner Barberine, Plaisanterie won every time while winning the Prix de Dieppe, the Prix Seymour, and the Cambridgeshire Handicap. =International= In Germany on 24 August, she defeated her male counterparts in that country's most prestigious race, the Grosser Preis von Baden, beating The Condor by one and three-quarter lengths. In October 1885 Plaisanterie was sent to England to contest the \\"Autumn Double\\" at Newmarket Racecourse, consisting of the Cesarewitch Handicap and Cambridgeshire Handicap, both of which were open to colts and older horses. On 12 October she carried 98 pounds in the two and a quarter mile Cesarewitch. Plaisanterie raced prominently and took the lead in the closing stages to win by two lengths from the five-year-old mare Xema. The win, the first in the race by a French-trained horse, meant that Plaisanterie had to carry an extra fourteen pounds penalty for the nine furlong Cambridgeshire two weeks later. Starting odds of 10/1 Plaisanterie disputed the lead from the start. In the closing stages she was never in danger of defeat and won \\"very easily\\" from the five- year-old Bendigo with the favourite St. Gatien finishing fifth. Plaisanterie thereby became the second of only three horses to complete the Autumn Double since the races were inaugurated in 1839. Retirement and stud career Co- owner H. Bouy died unexpectedly on May 7, 1886 at age thirty-nine. At a subsequent dispersal auction, half-owner Tom Carter, Jr. paid FF150,000 for Plaisanterie. Retired to broodmare duty, Plaisanterie was bred five times to the Champion sire St. Simon and twice to another Champion sire, Orme. Her important foals include Childwick, Raconteur and Topiary. Her death was reported in October 1906.

The SCHS is the state's oldest and largest private repository of books, letters, journals, maps, drawings, and photographs about South Carolina's history. Location The SCHS is housed in the Fireproof Building located at 100 Meeting Street in Charleston, South Carolina. South Carolinian Robert Mills designed the Fireproof Building in 1822 to protect public records. It is the first fireproof structure in the nation built specifically to protect documents. The building is in the Palladian style with Doric porticoes facing north and south. A central three-story oval stairwell with cantilevered stone stairs is lit by skylights located in the cupola. Mills was the first professionally trained architect born in the United States. He was a federal architect under President Andrew Jackson and designer of many important buildings in Washington, D.C., including the Washington Monument. His Fireproof Building was named a National Historic Landmark in 1973, and major renovations were completed in 2002. In 2016-7 the building underwent a major renovation, intended to modernize all systems, provide a secure, climate- controlled environment for the storage of historic documents, and to provide both an events venue and a modern museum space. In the summer of 2018 the Historical Society will open completely revamped museum of the history of South Carolina and of the Fireproof Building itself. Publications The SCHS began to publish material on South Carolina history the year following its founding, in 1856, with three volumes of its collections prior to the Civil War. The SCHS now produces two publications, the South Carolina Historical Magazine and the Carologue. The South Carolina Historical Magazine, first published in 1900, is the only scholarly periodical entirely devoted to South Carolina history. In 1985 the Society began publication of the Carologue, a quarterly general-interest magazine of articles, illustrations, and photographs on state history, genealogy, preservation, and Society news. Collection The SCHS collections contain records from the pre-colonial period to the present; a wide variety of personal documents; diaries; records of scholarly research; and plantation, business, and church records. Also in the collection are maps and plats; architectural drawings; genealogical charts; over 30,000 photographs and prints; and 50,000 books, pamphlets, and serials.

Prehistory The \\"Horsham Point\\" - a Mesolithic arrowhead - is sometimes claimed as the birth of distinctly British culture since it is the earliest known artefact that postdates the separation (due to glacial meltwater filling the Channel) of Britain from the continent Middle Ages monument in St Mary's Church, Horsham, Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, 1781. The first mention of Horsham was in King Eadred's land charter of AD 947. The town had connections to the sale of horses and the name is believed to be derived from \\"Horse Ham\\", a settlement where horses were kept.. An alternative explanation is that \\"Horsham\\" is a contraction of \\"Horsa's Ham\\" named after the Anglo-Saxon warrior who was said to have been given lands in the area. Despite having been in existence for some 140 years at the time of the survey, Horsham is not mentioned in the Domesday BookAlbery, W. (1947) A Millennium of Facts in the History of Horsham and Sussex. 947-1947., Horsham, Horsham Museum Society either because it was never visited by inspectors, or was simply 'left out' of the final version. It lies within the ancient Norman administrative division of the Rape of Bramber and the Hundred of Singlecross. In ancient times Horsham was controlled by the powerful de Braose family. Later the Eversfield family, which had risen from Surrey County obscurity into a powerhouse of ironmasters and landowners, built Denne Park House, their seat. The family later represented Horsham in Parliament, and controlled the Eversfield Estate in St. Leonards-on-Sea, where the seaside promenade is named for the family. Horsham Castle, built by William de Braose in the late eleventh century, was abandoned around 1154. The castle earthworks can be found near Chennells Brook. Horsham had two weekly markets in the Middle Ages,Interview with Miss M. Page, Horsham resident 1933‚Äì2006, for many years Auctioneer's Clerk at the weekly livestock market: Horsham Museum Society Archive and was noted locally for its annual fairs. Modern era Despite a local iron industry which stayed until the 17th century and a prosperous brewing industry, Horsham remained primarily a market town serving the many farms in the area until the early 20th century, when other industry and residential developments began to proliferate. One of these was the manufacture of bricks from the Wealden clay on which Horsham sits. Warnham and Wealden Brickworks still operate two miles north of Horsham and there are disused workings throughout the area, notably at Southwater which is now developed as an education centre and leisure park. Register of birth from St. Mary's in Horsham. This records refers to Samuel Carpenter, born 1649, who emigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was a prominent citizen and leader. Horsham prospered during the Victorian era and early 20th century. The town, along with others, has been well documented photographically by Francis Frith. The pictures record many of the landmarks that are still in place today, although some, such the war memorial, Jubilee Fountain and Carfax Bandstand, have been moved. Horsham remained a prominent brewery town until 2000, when the King and Barnes Brewery was closed on merger with Hall & Woodhouse, brewers of Dorset. King & Barnes was formed in 1906 from the merger of King & Sons, maltsters existing from 1850 and G H Barnes & Co., brewers whose origins date back to 1800. The brewery remained in the King family hands until the merger in 2000 when production ceased permanently. Their most famous brews included: Sussex Ale, Wealden Ale, Broadwood, Festive and the seasonal Old and Christmas Ales. The last member of the King family involved in the company brewed in Horsham at W J King & Co (Brewers) and now brews at Firebird Brewery in Rudgwick. There are three other small brewers currently operating in Horsham: Hepworth's is run by a former head brewer at King & Barnes, and Welton's, a company who were formed in Capel, Surrey, about fifteen years ago, and have been in Horsham since 2004, and Kissingate Brewery. The town has grown steadily over recent years to a population of 55,657. This has been facilitated by the completion of both inner and outer town bypasses. The location of any new growth is the subject of debate. Plans by the District Council include a large neighbourhood directly adjacent to Crawley. Legal history The last man to die by pressing in the whole of England was John Weekes of Horsham. He was charged with robbery and murder of a woman along with three accomplices, one of whom was a small boy used to sneak inside the woman's house and open access for the other three. When police found stolen property in the possession of the men, they easily persuaded the boy into turning King's evidence. Two of the other accomplices were convicted, but when John Weekes had his turn to plead, he refused to say anything. Once the judges brought in eight witnesses who swore Weekes could talk and was not dumb, they gave him time in the cells. When he refused further to say a single word, the judges were forced to find him not guilty of murder. Instead, he was convicted of 'standing mute through malice'. Weekes was placed under three hundredweight boards, and the sixteen stone gaoler jumped on top of him. Local folklore continues the story, extending it to include the death of his executioner days later, sometimes in the same spot where the execution was carried out. Some think that he was a mute. Public executions generally took place at a place called North Heath, now a suburb of Horsham. The road to the execution site was known for many years as Gibbet's Road but was later renamed Giblet's Road with an extension now called Giblet's Way. The last man to be put to death for homosexuality in England was in Horsham in 1834.

The series premiered on HGTV Canada on September 29, 2008, and on January 1, 2009, on HGTV in the U.S. The program was a half-hour long for the first six seasons, and then expanded to an hour-long format starting with season 7. The show reverted to its half-hour format with the start of season 10. On March 8, 2016, it was named Best Lifestyle Program or Series at the 4th Canadian Screen Awards. About the show Real estate investor and contractor Scott McGillivray leads homeowners through the renovation of their first income property, to help offset mortgage payments, as well as increase the overall value of the home. In each episode, McGillivray offers design options, prepares plans for a conversion and manages the construction of a rental suite. McGillivray, who owns over 20 income-generating homes that he has converted and renovated himself, communicates confidence and skill to help lead homeowners through the ups and downs of renovating their income suite. Several episodes of the series have featured celebrity homeowners, including actress Helene Joy, musician Justin Rutledge, broadcaster Roz Weston and documentary filmmaker Jamie Kastner. Show format = Seasons 1-6 (2008-2012) = For the first six seasons, the show was a half-hour. In this format, McGillivray meets with the homeowners to see the space in its current form. McGillivray shows two options to the homeowners for a possible redevelopment, utilizing design software. Each potential option has an estimated return on investment by way of monthly rent received. McGillivray shares the homeowners' mortgage payment and subtracts the estimated market rents to provide a \\"lower\\" mortgage payment. One option is generally grander in scope, usually affording the homeowner the opportunity to make more in rent than the other option, but at a higher renovation cost. Once the homeowners decide on which option they prefer, the Income Property team goes to work to demolish and rebuild. The homeowners are usually involved in the renovation but then are kept out of the space during the final stages of completion to provide some element of surprise. Once the renovation is complete, McGillivray obtains an opinion of value from a real estate appraiser or real estate agent, both for the amount of rent that can be charged, as well as to the overall increase in value to the property. During the reveal of the newly redeveloped space, McGillivray shows the stagedIncome Property FAQs rental suite and provides the new value of the home and estimated rental incomeIncome Property to the homeowners. The closing of the show has McGillivray verbally discussing the features of the suite, much like a newspaper ad would do. Then the show provides an inter-title of the result after filming showing the amount of rent the homeowners actually got once the unit hit the market. In some episodes, the homeowners did not rent out for various reasons. In Canada, seasons 4 and 5 both aired during the same year, with season 4 airing in the spring of 2011, and season 5 airing in the fall. Seasons 4 and 6 saw two new episodes airing back-to-back each week, with the exception of the last three episodes of season 6, which aired once-per-week, successively. = Seasons 7-9 (2013-2014) = Starting with season 7, and through to season 9, the show expanded from its original half-hour format to a one-hour format, with one new episode airing each week. During the first half-hour, McGillivray follows potential new homeowners as they view three homes up for sale with income property potential. The second half-hour follows the same format as the original, with McGillivray showing the new homeowners two renovation options, the conversion of the space based on their choice, getting an opinion of value, and the reveal of the finished renovation/suggested rent/increased home value.Income Property A new opening sequence was created for the new hour-long format, which included the graphic \\"Buy it. Build it. Bank it.\\" Seasons 7 and 8 both aired during 2013 in Canada, with season 7 airing during the winter/spring, and season 8 airing in the fall. = Season 10 (2015) = Starting with Season 10, the show reverted to its original half-hour format, with two new episodes airing back-to-back each week, in Canada. It follows the same format as the first six seasons, except that after McGillivray shows the homeowners the options, he starts the renovation before the homeowners decide which option they will go with. Once he gets to a certain point, he then asks the homeowners which option they have decided on so that he can proceed. The opening sequence created at the start of the new hour-long format is still used, but has been edited, with some of the beginning removed, and the word \\"Buy it.\\" removed form the original \\"Buy it. Build it. Bank it.\\" graphic. The tenth season also saw the episode count increase from the usual 13 to 24. Four of these episodes (aired April 9 and April 16) see McGillivray tackling vacation rental properties. = Season 11 (2016) = Season 11 changes its focus to the rental market of vacation properties, with the tagline \\"On Vacation\\" added on to the Income Property title. Episodes retain their half- hour format from season 10, and feature Scott McGillivray guiding holiday homeowners through the process of building a vacation suite and banking the rental cheques. Specials = Reno to Riches = Airing April 4, 2011, one week prior to the start of the fourth season, this one-hour special finds Scott McGillivray revisiting ten Income Property homeowners to find out how much cash they‚Äôve collected and how it has transformed their lives.

No segment of the highway is included within the National Highway System. History State Route 177 was first designated in 1934 along its current alignment, replacing what was previously designated as State Route 224. The re-designation came as a result of the debut of U.S. Route 224 in Ohio that year, and the state's practice of not duplicating a state route designation for a U.S. highway designation.

History In the 19th century, knowledge about Buddhism was brought back from expeditions that explored the Far East but interest was mainly from authors, Buddhologists and philologists. In 1921, Dr. Christian F. Melbye founded the first Buddhist Society in Denmark, but it was later dissolved in 1950 before his death in 1953. In the 1950s, there was a revival in interest towards Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism. Hannah and Ole Nydahl founded the first Karma Kagyu Buddhist centers in Copenhagen. The third wave of Buddhism came in the 1980s, when refugees from Vietnam, Sri Lanka and China came to Denmark. Some Buddhist women, especially those from Thailand, came to Denmark seeking Danish husbands.The history of Buddhism in Denmark is written by J√∏rn Borup in Dansk Dharma. Buddhisme og buddhister i Danmark, H√∏jbjerg: Forlaget Univers, 2005. Demographics Accurate figures for the number of Buddhists in Denmark is not known, as it is illegal to record people's faiths in Denmark. However, according to J√∏rn Borup (Department of the Study of Religion, Aarhus University), there are approximately 30,000 Buddhists in Denmark today,J√∏rn Borup Who are these Buddhists and How Many of Them are There?: Theoretical and Methodological Challenges in Counting Immigrant Buddhists: A Danish Case Study, in Journal of Contemporary Religion 31, 1: 85-100, 2016 of which 80% are Asian immigrants. Of these, 9,000 are from Vietnam and 10,000 are from Thailand. Despite Buddhism being a minority religion, the Dalai Lama is the Danes' preferred religious role model. According to the latest Eurobarometer estimates, as of December 2018, 1.1% of Danish people are Buddhists. After Christianity and non-religious, Buddhism is the second largest religion in Denmark. Schools There are 43 Buddhist groups in Denmark, 15 of which have official status as 'recognized congregations'. While the number of members and users of the groups are typically small, the 'convert groups' mainly oriented towards Tibetan and Zen Buddhism outnumber the few Asian Buddhist groups, whose number of 'adherents' nevertheless are much higher J√∏rn Borup: At t√¶lle danske buddhister (in Danish),. =Theravada= Theravada Buddhism in Denmark is practised primarily by Thais and Sri Lankans and between 90 and 95% of the 10,000 Danish Thais are Buddhists. Thai Buddhist temples include the Watpa (Thai Language = ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏õ‡πà‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏ô‡∏Æ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏ô) in Copenhagen, Wat Thai Denmark Brahmavihara Buddhist Monastery (Thai Language = ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£‡πå‡∏Å‡∏û‡∏£‡∏´‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£) and the Wat Phra Dhammakaya Denmark (Thai Language = ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ò‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£‡πå‡∏Å) . These Buddhist √©migr√©s seem almost invisible in Denmark, partly because Buddhism is generally not an evangelical religion, and they rarely take part in the larger social debate, partly because they have low unemployment and crime rates and are therefore not particularly newsworthy subjects for the media. Especially the Vietnamese have attracted such positive views which might be related to their generally positive, cultural integration. Although not directly related to Buddhism as a practiced religion, Buddhism's contribution to popular culture, media and marketing should not be underestimated http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/religion-i-danmark/2015/buddhisme-medier-og- populaerkultur/. =Vajrayana= The first Tibetan Buddhist group was founded in Denmark by Hannah and Ole Nydahl. It belongs to the Karma Kagyu lineage, one of the major Tibetan schools. The very first center was opened in Copenhagen in 1972 and relocated in 1975 to its current location. To this day Diamond Way Buddhism has increased to nearly 600 centers worldwide. Although members of this group has not been growing for the last ten years, it is still the largest Vajrayana school in Denmark, with 500 Danish affiliates. =Zen= Zen is amongst the smallest schools of Buddhism in Denmark. It has five groups (both Soto and Rinzai) and no more than 100 practitioners. =Soka Gakkai International= The Soka Gakkai International organization was established in Denmark in 1983 and has approximately 800 members in 54 local groups. =Attempts at unity= In 1991, the Tibetan-born Lakha Lama tried to establish a trans-sectarian Buddhist umbrella organization called the Buddhist Forum and since 1993 it has been a member of the European Buddhist Union despite having only two hundred paying members. Another Lakha Lama project called Phendeling has subsequently taken over its role and now includes some non-Vajrayana Buddhist groups. Two groups, the Diamond Way Buddhism and Sokka Gakkai, have not been invited to join the umbrella organizations. In the early 1990s, there was a split between Ole Nydahl and the rest of the groups during the Karmapa controversy. One of two candidates was about to be chosen as the one new reincarnation of the 16th Karmapa. Ole Nydahl supported Trinley Thaye Dorje whilst Urgyen Trinley Dorje was supported by most other Buddhist groups and the Dalai Lama.Curren, Erik D. (2008)Buddha's Not Smiling, Uncovering the Corruption at the Heart of Tibetan Buddhism Today Alaya Press Visits by the Dalai Lama The exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama has visited Denmark several times. He first visited in 1973 to help inaugurate the first Karma Kagyu center founded by the Nydahls.Nydahl, Ole (1992) Riding The Tiger, Twenty Years on the Road - The Risks and Joys of Bringing Tibetan Buddhism to the West, Blue Dolphin Publishing. He came back in 1996 for an official visit, but was not met by the Danish prime minister at that time, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who said that he was too busy, which he said again the next time the Dalai Lama visited in 2000. However, he did meet him at the airport just before he left. In 2003, the Dalai Lama returned and was officially welcomed by Rasmussen's successor, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, with the backing of the entire government, despite protests from China.http://www.information.dk/164021 Article: Louise Wendt Jensen, Dalai Lama kommer til Danmark, Information (Danish Newspaper) 21. august 2008 (In Danish)http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20080812/politik/808120395/ Article: Dalai Lama til Danmark i maj 2009, Berlingske (Danish Newspaper) 12. august 2008 (In Danish) Notable Danish Buddhists *Hannah Nydahl *Ole Nydahl *Anne Louise Hassing *Tom McEwan References Bibliography * Borup, J√∏rn (2005).
