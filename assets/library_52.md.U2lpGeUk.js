Biography Frontman Jon Chang on the history of the band: \\"Discordance Axis was a three piece grind core band that started in NJ around 1992. The band started after myself and Rob's previous band disintegrated and we found Dave at a Human Remains show. We asked him to play a split 7\\" with us and it snowballed from there. The pattern was, we got together and wrote and recorded some material, then would part ways. We never really played live much because...well we couldn't manage to sell more than 500 copies of any of our records and we all had conflicting schedules. We get asked why we only toured Japan. That's easy. That's where all our records sold. And most of the bands we liked were from over there. Steve Procopio played live a lot with us and recorded the guitar tracks on the Necropolitan EP. Rob Marton plays guitar on every other recording we produced. Steve and Rob were two really gifted people and I feel fortunate to have played with both them and Dave. There's a much more detailed band history in the Original Sound Version and Jouhou reissue CD's that Hydrahead released, but in brief, Discordance Axis started in 1992 and broke up in 2001. All of our music has been re-issued on CD except for our tracks on the Necropolitan EP(because the master is lost) and our track from the Snarl Out Vol 2 7\\" comp record. Jon Chang now sings for Gridlink. Rob Marton writes lots of music but isn't in a band. Dave Witte plays for Municipal Waste (among others).\\" Style In the beginning the band played straightforward grindcore influenced by the likes of Napalm Death, but on later releases they showcased a very original style. Robert Marton played guitar lines that were both technical and dissonant, and added creative overdubs to augment the melodies. Dave Witte added complex rolls, fills, and jarring rhythmic shifts to the usual barrage of blast beats found in grindcore. Jon Chang alternated between a shrill shriek and a \\"gastrointestinal\\" roar, and based most of his metaphorical lyrics on novels and anime. The band had no bassist and released the majority of their full- length recordings in DVD cases rather than CD cases coming with unusually large booklets (normally with liner notes for each song longer than the lyrics).

It was originally planned for arcades. Prototypes of the game were tested at arcades, but the final arcade release was canceled (although a ROM image of the prototype was eventually dumped and works in MAME) and the game was later released for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and PC. Plot In the not-too- distant future, the United States fell like all great empires throughout history. Fifty states were broken into private territories after the Techno- Industrial Civil Wars. Technology and bio-engineering accelerated at such an incredible rate, and forced an industrial competition of corporate espionage. The government tried to keep control of the country by a single thread, but the effect of the giant corporations' white collar wars drove the economy into a tailspin. Neo-Amerika rises as the result of the government bankruptcy and technological companies takeover. To maintain order, The Secret Games Commission (SGC) is formed to organize tournaments deciding which organization gets to control all of Neo-Amerika, leading to the creation of Biological Flying Robotic Enhanced Armored Killing Synthoids (Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.) serving as the champions for each participating organization. Gameplay The game uses a fully polygonal fighting engine, with 8 different fighters, and 2 boss fighters. Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. uses a mix of hand-to-hand and long range combat. Each character has an assortment of special attacks, both close and long range, as well as \\"finishing attacks\\". Much like the Fatalities of the Mortal Kombat games, these moves can execute the player's opponents while some, like in Time Killers, will remove limbs. Also damage from powerful attacks can add up causing a limb to be destroyed as well. The game takes place in 3D fighting arenas. Emphasis was placed on mobility giving dashes a great range and in multiple directions. The face buttons are assigned to specific limbs. The shoulder buttons are used for dodging, flying, and basic long range attacks.  Reception  Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. received mixed reviews upon release. The PlayStation version currently has a rating of 60% on GameRankings while the Nintendo 64 version has a rating of 68%.

Hack-a-Shaq is a basketball defensive strategy used in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson adapted the strategy of committing intentional fouls (originally a clock management strategy) to the purpose of lowering opponents' scoring. He directed players to commit personal fouls throughout the game against selected opponents who shot free throws poorly. Nelson initially used the strategy against Dennis Rodman, a star power forward for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls. However, the strategy acquired its name for Nelson's subsequent use of it against Hall of Fame center Shaquille O'Neal.  Name  The term was coined when O'Neal played at LSU and during his NBA tenure with the Orlando Magic. At that time, the term referred simply to especially physical defense against O'Neal. Teams sometimes defended him by bumping, striking or pushing him after he received the ball to deny him an easy layup or slam dunk. Because of O'Neal's poor free throw shooting, teams did not fear the consequences of committing personal fouls.(1995, December 17). \\"Magic Don't Care For Hack-a-Shaq 'D, The Deseret News(1996, May 19). \\"WHY HACK-A-SHAQ? SHAQ'S A HACK AT FOUL LINE\\", The Charlotte Observer(1995, October 29).\\"Pop-a-shot or Hack-a-Shaq, Until free throws fall, Magic's O'Neal subject to punishment\\", Star Tribune However, once Nelson's off-the-ball fouling strategy became prevalent, the term Hack-a-Shaq was applied to this new tactic, and the original usage was largely forgotten. The name is sometimes altered to reflect the player being fouled, for example Hack-a-Howard when used against Dwight Howard, or Hack-a-DJ for DeAndre Jordan.  Background  = Strategy of repeated intentional fouling = Committing repeated intentional personal fouls is a longstanding defensive strategy used by teams that are trailing near the end of the game.Dudley, Carl A. (2006, January 26). \\"The Most Important Form of Official Communication: The Pre-Game Conference \\", International Association of Approved Basketball Officials, Board #134 Information Release \\"In a close match, with seconds ticking down and a team being down by one or two points, a coaching strategy could be to foul and stop the clock and make the other team earn their victory by way of the free throw.\\" Basketball, unique among major world sports, permits intentional fouling to gain a strategic advantage; in other sports, it is considered an unfair act or professional foul. Once the fouling team enters the penalty situation, the fouled team is awarded free throws. The typical NBA player makes a high enough percentage of his free throws that, over time, opponents' possessions that end with free throws will yield more points than possessions in which the opponents try to score a field goal. Even the highest-scoring NBA teams average only about 1.1 points per possession.Phoenix Suns 2005‚Äì2006 Season Statistics Giving such a team two free throws on each possession, the poorest free throw shooting teams make around 70% of their free throws and would score 1.4 points per possession.(2006, January 2). \\"Milwaukee Bucks/Chicago Bulls Preview\\", Yahoo! Sports \\"Chicago is one of the NBA's worst free-throw shooting teams at 70.7 percent.\\" So intentionally fouling tends not to reduce the opponent's score. However, fouls stop the game clock. If a team is trailing with time running out, intentional fouling may be the only hope. In normal game play, the opponents will stall and run out the clock, even at the expense of failing to score, to the extent that the shot clock allows. The trailing team fouls intentionally to end the opponents' possession as soon as possible, leaving more time on the clock for the opposing team to respond to any score. It may also hope that fatigue and pressure affect the ability of the free-throw shooter. When this strategy was originally employed in the NBA, the trailing team often made a point of fouling the opposition player who was the poorest free throw shooter in the game at that time, even if that player did not possess the ball. However, fouling \\"off the ball\\" became a problem for the league when Wilt Chamberlain‚Äîa player of superstar caliber but an atrocious free throw shooter‚Äîentered the NBA. = Wilt Chamberlain and the off-the-ball foul rule = Basketball great Wilt Chamberlain was a notoriously bad free throw shooter. Wilt Chamberlain was such a dominant player that he was sure to be on the floor near the end of any close game. However, he was such a poor free throw shooter (51%) as to be the natural target of a strategy of intentional fouling. The opposition was eager to send Chamberlain to the free throw line, and Chamberlain wished to avoid doing so. This led to a game of tag developing away from the basketball, players chasing Chamberlain as he tried to avoid being fouled. The NBA enacted a new rule on off-the-ball fouls‚Äîpersonal fouls against an offensive player who neither has the ball nor is trying to obtain it. On such fouls within the last two minutes of the game or in overtime, the offensive team is awarded the usual number of free throws and then possession of the ball. The new rule removed the benefit of fouling to gain possession of the ball and limited late-game intentional fouls to the ball handler. The current version of the rule contains an additional disincentive to off-the- ball fouls: The free throws need not be attempted by the player who was fouled; the fouled team can choose as shooter any player on the court at the time. > The reason they have that rule is that fouling someone off-the-ball looks > foolish . . . Some of the funniest things I ever saw were players that used > to chase [Wilt Chamberlain] like it was hide-and-seek. Wilt would run away > from people, and the league changed the rule based on how silly that looked. > :‚ÄîPat RileyBallantini, Brett. (November/December 2004) \\"A steal of a deal: > with Shaquille O'Neal in tow, Miami's president has set the Heat's sights on > one thing: winning an NBA title\\", Basketball Digest  Hack-a-Shaq  = Nelson's innovation = There are several late-game situations where committing an isolated intentional foul makes sense. For a team trailing, late in the game, stopping the clock is a higher priority than keeping the opponents from scoring. In other situations, intentional fouling does not make sense because it typically lets the opponents score more points. Intentional fouling every time the opponents get the ball was an innovation of Don Nelson in the late 1990s as coach of the Dallas Mavericks. He theorized that, if the opponents played an especially bad free throw shooter, intentionally fouling him might hold down his team's points per possession, compared to a conventional defense against them. Nelson used the strategy throughout the game, when the late-game penalties for off-the-ball fouls did not apply, such as the ball being given back to the fouled team. Nelson did not invent the strategy; his innovation was to take a strategy whose primary purpose had always been simply stopping the clock, and use it instead primarily to minimize the opposition's scoring. = Hack-a-Rodman = Nelson first used the strategy against Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls in 1997, who was making 38% of his free throws on the season. He could not use the strategy on every Bulls possession, as a player committing his sixth foul is disqualified from the game. He used the strategy selectively, and chose a little-used player, whose absence the team could tolerate, to commit the fouls. He believed that Rodman's horrific foul shooting would result in the Mavericks actually giving up fewer total points during those Bulls possessions than they would give up by playing a standard defense against the Bulls' efficient offense, led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. In that game, Rodman shot 9-for-12 from the free throw line, defeating the strategy, and the Bulls won the game. The strategy was thus largely forgotten, except that Maverick player Bubba Wells, who had been assigned to foul Rodman, set the all-time NBA record for fewest minutes played (3) before fouling out of a game.Hubbuch, Bart. (1999, March 5). \\"QUESTIONABLE CALLS: Nelson's coaching moves still up for debate\\", Dallas Morning NewsTurner, Broderick. (1999, November 8). \\"Shaq vents his frustrations on late-game fouls: Vowing to get back at Portland's Jermaine O'Neal, he also is mildly displeased at Mavericks coach Nelson's strategy.\\" Riverside Press-Enterprise Nelson used the strategy again in 1999, this time against Shaquille O'Neal, a career 52% free throw shooter. Other NBA coaches also did so to defend against O'Neal.(2000, May 24). \\"DUNLEAVY IMPRESSES A COACHING MAVERICK\\", The Oregonian So, even though it had been first used two years earlier against Rodman, the strategy became known for its use against O'Neal. = Problem for the league = As with Chamberlain decades earlier, intentional off-the-ball fouls against O'Neal became controversial. During the 2000 NBA Playoffs, both the Portland Trail Blazers and Indiana Pacers relentlessly used the Hack-a-Shaq defense against the Lakers. The NBA discussed expanding the off-the-ball foul rule to cover more than just the final two minutes of the game, or another rule change that would discourage the use of Hack-a-Shaq.(2000, May 23). \\"League will reconsider rule after Hack-a-Shaq marathon\\", Atlanta Journal- Constitution(2000, May 28). \\"IT DOESN'T FIGURE, SO LET'S SACK THE HACK\\", Los Angeles Daily News Ultimately, though, the NBA did not change any rules to discourage the Hack-a-Shaq strategy. An effective rebuttal was that the Lakers won both of the games where Hack-a-Shaq was notorious, suggesting that the strategy was too ineffective to require remediation.(2000, June 13). \\"A no- call for league: NBA won't change rule to stop foul strategy\\", Boston Herald Coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs used the Hack-a-Shaq strategy successfully in Game 5 of the Spurs' 2008 first round series against O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal made only 9 of his 20 free throws, dropping the Suns to 20-of-37 total on free throws. The Suns were eliminated from the playoffs in a 92‚Äì87 Spurs win. In May 2008, ESPN.com columnist John Hollinger named the Spurs Hack-a-Shaq use as the \\"Best Tactic\\" of the first two rounds of the 2008 NBA Playoffs. Hollinger wrote that Popovich was the \\"first to really master how to use this weapon to his advantage.\\" He explained that Popovich used the tactic \\"to eliminate 3-point attempts\\" and with 25 seconds or less at the end of quarters to get the ball back for the Spurs to gain the last possession. Hollinger stated \\"This should be a Eureka! moment for other coaches, and I expect it will be the league's most widely copied tactic next year.\\" In subsequent seasons, fans and media remained displeased with the continued use of the strategy, particularly in high-profile playoff games. In 2008, the NBA Competition Committee again considered rule changesAdande, J.A. (2008, May 8). \\"Commish: Fouling away from ball, replay to be reviewed\\", ESPN.com but did not achieve consensus.Stein, Marc (2008, May 29). \\"Fines will be imposed for clear cases of flopping\\", ESPN.com According to an ESPN study in 2016, offensive efficiency was higher than the Golden State Warriors when the Hack-a-Shaq strategy was used against a team. NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the competition committee would look into changing the rule before the start of the 2016‚Äì2017 season due to extended length of games. It takes only three or more Hack-a-Shaq fouls to add 11 minutes to the length of a game, and at the time such fouls were being committed at a rate of four times more often than the prior season.  Application against other players  The Hack-a-Shaq strategy is most effective against a player who shoots free throws poorly, but is so effective in other areas that the coach is reluctant to simply remove the player from the game. Few players other than O'Neal meet those criteria. Ben Wallace shot only 42% free throws over his career, the worst percentage in the history of the NBA among players with 1000 attempts. Bruce Bowen was also among the game's best defenders but among its worst free throw shooters. Because of their struggles at the free throw line, each man has at times become a target of the Hack-a-Shaq strategy. = Dwight Howard = On January 12, 2012, the Golden State Warriors hacked Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard intentionally throughout the game. The result was he attempted a record 39 free throws, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of 34 set in 1962. Howard entered the game making 42% of his free throws for the season and just below 60% for his career. He made 21 of the 39 attempts, and he finished with 45 points and 23 rebounds in the Magic's 117‚Äì109 victory. The following season, Howard was traded to the Lakers. In his first game back in Orlando on March 12, 2013, he made 25-of-39 free throws, setting Lakers records for free throws made and attempted while tying his NBA record for attempts. Howard made 16-of-20 free throws when he was fouled intentionally by the Magic. = Tiago Splitter = On May 29, 2012, the Oklahoma City Thunder used a so-called hack- a-Splitter strategy on Tiago Splitter during Game 2 of Western Conference Final of 2012 NBA Playoffs, who made 5 of 10 Free throw attempts from these fouls. = Josh Smith = On April 10, 2015, the San Antonio Spurs was reported to use this strategy on Josh Smith to keep the basketball away from the super-hot James Harden and San Antonio Spurs won this season game by 104‚Äì103. = DeAndre Jordan = DeAndre Jordan has been a victim of the Hack- a-Shaq strategy. During the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Howard, then with the Houston Rockets, was again targeted often by opponents, particularly during round 2 against the Los Angeles Clippers. During Game 2, Howard shot 21 (converting 8) out of the 64 free throws for the Rockets. In turn, the Rockets targeted DeAndre Jordan, who had been victim of \\"Hack-a-Jordan\\" or \\"Hack-a-DJ\\" since 2014,'Hack-a-Jordan' clouds Clippers' winIntentionally Fouling DeAndre Jordan Is Futile and in particular was fouled five times in two minutes during the previous playoff round against the San Antonio Spurs.Even in a win, the flaws in the Spurs' strategy of intentionally fouling DeAndre Jordan were exposed In Game 4, Jordan broke O'Neal's record for most free throw attempts in a half game with 28. = Andre Drummond = On January 20, 2016, the Houston Rockets used Hack-a-Drummond against Detroit Pistons center Andre Drummond, and Drummond went 13 for 36 from the free throw line. Those 23 misses are an NBA record for most free throws missed by a player in a game.http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400828522 However, the Pistons would still win the game 123-114. = Andr√© Roberson = In the 2016‚Äì17 playoffs, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Andr√© Roberson was a victim of this strategy against the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. Roberson shot 3/21 in the series. = Ben Simmons = On November 29, 2017, the Washington Wizards used what a newspaper called a \\"hack-a-Ben Simmons strategy\\" when trailing the Philadelphia 76ers by 24 points in the third quarter. The Wizards repeatedly fouled 76ers point guard Ben Simmons, giving him 29 free throws, 24 of them in the fourth quarter. Simmons was a notoriously bad shooter and had entered the game with a 56% free throw rate. He shot free throws even worse in this game, making 15/29 (52%). However, the 76ers held on to win the game, 118-113. Simmons' 31 points were a career high for him at the time.  Criticism  Detractors argue that deliberate fouling makes the game unpleasant to watch, violates the spirit or disrupts the rhythm of the game, puts the fouling team too quickly into the penalty situation, and disparages the team's defensive abilities. > All that did was allow us to set our defense. I think that's disrespectful > to their players. Basically, they were telling their players that they > couldn't guard us. :‚Äî Detroit Pistons forward Tayshaun Prince,(2005, > December 12). \\"Strategy doesn't work, Pistons top Clippers\\", The Detroit > News after Los Angeles Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy used the Hack-a-Shaq > strategy against Pistons center Ben Wallace in a game in December 2005 Many coaches have heeded these criticisms and doubted the effectiveness of the strategy in minimizing scoring. One imponderable is the effect on the psychology of the player fouled deliberately on the belief that he will not make his free throws. Some believe that frequently sending O'Neal to the foul line risked putting him \\"into a rhythm\\" and temporarily making him a better shooter. Jordan, Rivers Give Thoughts On Hack-A-DJ Strategy These factors, and the fact that there are only handful of players who satisfy the criteria for Hack-a-Shaq, mean that the strategy is uncommon in the NBA. A rule change starting in the 2016‚Äì17 NBA season put an additional constraint on deliberate fouling: Away-from-the-ball fouls now award the fouled team a free throw and possession of the ball in the final 2 minutes of each quarter, extended from the prior rule affecting only the final 2 minutes of the 4th quarter. The rule change sought to eliminate cases where teams would intentionally foul off-the- ball in order to gain the final possession of a quarter.

On 16 June 2007 WASG merged with The Left Party.PDS to form The Left (Die Linke). At the time of its merger with The Left Party.PDS, WASG party membership stood at about 11,600 members. The party ran for the first time in the 2005 state election of North Rhine- Westphalia, Germany's most populous state and a stronghold of the governing Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), with pastor J√ºrgen Klute as its front-runner. The party campaigned against what it considered \\"the neoliberal consensus\\" displayed by the governing centre-left political parties and the centre-right opposition alike. Some of its main issues were opposition to cuts in provision of social benefits and to the favourable taxation of the wealthy. In the first few months of existence, it received a large amount of news coverage, and had its first national convention from 6 May until 8 May 2005. Oskar Lafontaine, a former major figure on the left wing of the SPD, joined the new party officially on 18 June 2005, and became their North Rhine- Westphalia frontrunner for the general election on 18 September 2005. As the necessary steps for a merger with the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) could not be taken fast enough, he advocated an electoral alliance with WASG members on the PDS's list, to which the WASG and PDS leaderships in principle agreed on 10 June 2005. The title of this list was The Left Party.PDS, which to this end - as a matter of formality - was adopted by the PDS as its new name, because changing a name was comparatively easy. The anticipated fusion was later made official, with the WASG and The Left Party. PDS merging on 16 June 2007 to a party called simply The Left (Die Linke) or also, colloquially, \\"the Left Party\\" (without \\".PDS\\"). Programmatic orientation The draft programmatic orientation was strongly influenced by the memorandums of the Working group for Alternative Economical Politics which counted one of the party's leading figures, economist Axel Troost, among its members. The programme pleaded for a policy that strengthens domestic demand and centres around social justice; part of the programme is the return to a more progressive taxation. First and foremost, the tax breaks for large corporations and high incomes introduced by the SPD-Green coalition federal government starting from 1999 would have to be abolished and the federal tax on assets, which had ceased in 1997, reintroduced. The draft programme would have to be discussed until the spring 2005. Historical accounts =Pre- history/Association WASG= The party emerged from the association \\"Wahlalternative Arbeit und soziale Gerechtigkeit e. V.\\" which had been founded on 3 July 2004. The association itself had started as the merger of the groups Initiative Arbeit und soziale Gerechtigkeit (mainly by Bavarian union representatives) and the Wahlalternative (\\"Electoral Alternative\\", founded by people in Northern and Western Germany). Both groups had been founded in reaction to the government politics as laid down in the Agenda 2010 programme of the governing \\"Red-Green\\" coalition, which they consider as too neoliberal. The first meeting of the Wahlalternative took place on 5 March 2004 in the Berlin headquarters of the Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB). The association had 4,056 members on 11 September 2004, the number rising to over 6,000 members shortly before Christmas 2004. The first organisation in one of the states was founded on 17 July 2004 in the Saarland; the first convention in North Rhine-Westphalia took place on 17 October 2004, and it was decided to take part in the 2005 regional elections in that state in spite of the party's unclear financial situation. The association WAsG e. V., the party's \\"birthplace\\", continued to exist along with the party; its future purpose had still not been determined. It may be transferred into a political foundation similar to the ones kept by other German political parties. =News coverage= The nascent party drew attention in the mass media because the foundation of a new left-wing party might have led to a schism in the SPD. Forerunners to such a development were the secession of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) during World War I, the foundation of the Greens (although these were not founded by disaffected SPD members) in the late 1970s, and the Democratic Socialists (DS) party founded by Karl-Heinz Hansen and Manfred Coppik in the early 1980s. =Foundation= The federal assembly in Nuremberg of the association WAsG e. V. (20 and 21 November 2004) decided to found a party, something that had never been ruled out as a possible outcome by members of the provisional leadership. After the strike vote among members in December 2004, the party was officially founded on 22 January 2005 in G√∂ttingen. The party's name came into being as Arbeit und soziale Gerechtigkeit ‚Äì Die Wahlalternative (the abbreviation ASG later had to be changed to WASG, due to a lawsuit). =Internal conflicts= There was a lot of controversy about the new party's political orientation among its members. While some liked to establish it as a purely leftist party of socialist inclination, many others, especially union representatives and former SPD members, aimed to provide a home also for social conservatives and religious people who believe in a strong welfare state. The argument escalated in February 2005 (shortly after the party's foundation) but was soothed through a compromise that was satisfactory for everyone. The compromise calls for a strict accord with welfare state orientation without excluding more socialist-minded members from the party. =Regional election in North Rhine- Westphalia= The party decided to take part in the regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, on 22 May 2005. Eligibility was ensured in all regional counties, and pastor J√ºrgen Klute of Herne was the leading candidate of a 40-person-ticket. In this regional election the WASG reached 2.2% of the votes cast (approximately 182,000 votes). =Lawsuit against the abbreviation ASG= According to a decision made by the District Court of D√ºsseldorf, the party was no longer allowed to officially use its abbreviation \\"ASG\\". The party had been sued by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sozialp√§dagogik und Gesellschaftsbild (ASG). As a result the abbreviation WASG\\" has been unofficially adopted ‚Äì with an equally unofficial slight reordering of the words in its name to fit the new abbreviation. =Electoral alliance with the PDS= Federal elections results After the crushing defeat of his SPD in the state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Federal Chancellor Schr√∂der declared the intention of going for a general election as soon as possible, avoiding the completion of the regular term ‚Äì which was to run until September 2006 ‚Äì by the device of failing a Motion of Confidence vote, which took place on 1 July 2005. However, there are major constitutional issues which are to be settled by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. According to the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which incorporates lessons learned from the failed Weimar Republic, the Bundestag cannot dissolve itself or be dissolved by a political representative ahead of schedule, except under very rare circumstances. While the WASG hoped to gain a large enough membership and to raise enough money for an election campaign by the originally scheduled election date (some time in September 2006), it now faced the difficulty of an early election one year ahead of schedule ‚Äì occurring on the date of 18 September 2005. Polls predicted an election result of at most 3% for the new party, well below the electoral threshold of 5%. In that situation, the idea of an electoral coalition with the ideologically similar Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), led by Gregor Gysi, was put forward by Oskar Lafontaine. On 10 June 2005, the leaderships of WASG and the PDS agreed to form an electoral alliance for the then-upcoming federal elections in September 2005. According to the agreement, the parties would not compete against one another in any district, and followed a joint electoral manifesto. This was intended to benefit both parties, because the WASG is based primarily in western Germany, while the PDS, which was the legal successor to the East German Socialist Unity Party (SED), is strongest in the East. Lafontaine, the former chairman of the SPD, was the WASG's lead candidate. After a multitude of initial problems due to the somewhat restrictive German electoral law, the PDS re-christened itself as Die Linkspartei (The Left Party) and appeared on the ballot as either Die Linkspartei.PDS ‚Äì in the Eastern states ‚Äì or Die Linkspartei. ‚Äì in the Western states ‚Äì in line with the WASG's wishes. WASG candidates appeared on those electoral lists. As of 5 July 2005, the coalition was on 30% in the polls in the East (level with the CDU there), and 11% nationally.Neuwahlen: Linksb√ºndnis im Osten gleichauf mit CDU - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Politik In the Federal Election the Left Party gained 8.7% of the votes and 54 Members of the Bundestag, including 12 of the WASG. In March 2006, however, divisions emerged between the WASG and the PDS ‚Äì now The Left Party.PDS ‚Äì in Berlin and the East more generally, in the run-up to state elections, due to the continuing involvement of the PDS with the SPD in coalition governments which were instituting cut-backs. The WASG Berlin, against advice or pressure from the national party leadership, announced its intention to run separate lists in Berlin against the PDS. The WASG list won 2.9% of the vote in the 17 September elections. The fusion process brought a significant loss in party memberships of WASG.

He chose the dialogue form (as in the well-known Plato's works) to deal with the problem of the co-existence of the Stoic design of providence with the evil in the world. Dating and title The work cannot be precisely dated, but since it is addressed to Lucilius, who is the addressee of some of Seneca's final works including his Letters, and since the essay has similarities to letters 106, 108, and 109 then the work is usually considered a late one dating to around 64 AD. The full title of the work is Quare bonis viris multa mala accidant, cum sit providentia (\\"Why do misfortunes happen to good men, if providence exists\\"). This longer title reflects the true theme of the essay which is not so much concerned with providence but with theodicy and the question of why bad things happen to good people. Contents The dialogue is opened by Lucilius complaining with his friend Seneca that adversities and misfortunes can happen to good men too. How can this fit with the goodness connected with the design of providence? Seneca answers according to the Stoic point of view. Nothing actually bad can happen to the good man (the wise man) because opposites don't mix. What looks like adversity is in fact a means by which the man exerts his virtues. As such, he can come out of the ordeal stronger than before. So, in perfect harmony with the Stoic philosophy, Seneca explains that the truly wise man can never surrender in the face of misfortunes but as he will always go through them and even if he should fall he will continue fighting on his knees (\\"si cecidit de genu pugnat\\"). The wise man understands destiny and its design, and therefore he has nothing to fear from the future. Neither does he hope for anything, because he already has everything he needs ‚Äì his good behaviour. The conclusion is that actually nothing bad happens to good men. One just has to understand what bad means: bad for the wise man would be to have bad thoughts, to commit crimes, to desire money or fame. Whoever behaves wisely already has all the good possible.

Ragman appeared in the fifth season of the television series Arrow, played by actor Joe Dinicol. Publication history Ragman first appeared in the short-lived 1976-77 five- issue comic book series of the same name. He is one of a number of Jewish superheroes, and his continuity is tied to that of DC Comics' Golem, derived from the Golem of Prague of Jewish folklore.Ragman's Jewish heritage is discussed in the nonfiction book From Krak√≥w To Krypton, written by Arie Kaplan (Jewish Publication Society, 2008), p. 125 Ragman was created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Joe Kubert. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= A Vietnam veteran, Rory Regan had grown up helping his father, a junk man who owned a pawn shop named Rags 'n' Tatters. His father always dreamed of making a better life for Rory and constantly promised that someday he would make Rory rich. While drinking with his friends one night, his father discovered 2 million United States dollars stuffed inside an old mattress that had been pawned just recently. He and his friends decided to hide the money for Rory, since they were too old to truly benefit from it. The money turned out to be the loot from an armored car heist and when the hoods came to the shop to get it, they shot down some electrical wires and used them to torture Rory's father and his friends into revealing where the money was hidden. Rory arrived soon after and, seeing his father in agony, attempted to free him from the wires. A final shock of power ran through the old men and grounded out at Rory, knocking him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, his father and friends were dead and the hoods responsible were gone. Using a costume made out of old rags (his father had bought it from a stranger before he died and left a note saying Rory could wear it to a costume party) he became Ragman, \\"the Tatterdemalion of Justice.\\" Rory appeared to have gained the physical abilities of the men who were electrocuted as they were all touching as the final votlage of electricity flowed through them and into Rory. He gained an acrobat's agility, a strongman's strength, and a boxer's skills. In his Pre-Crisis incarnation, Rory Regan was Irish, not Jewish, as explicitly stated in the letters page of Ragman #3. =Post-Crisis= Rory Regan is a junk man, doing good in his community by buying used items from people who need money. The suit of rags that he wears, as mentioned above, was originally just a costume made from materials found around the rag shop, Rags'n'Tatters, that he shared with his father. This was retconned in a 1991-92 eight-issue limited series, and currently each of the patches in the suit is made from the soul of an evildoer that Ragman had punished and absorbed. The absorption of these souls caused a problem for Rory at one point, when the evil souls hungered for murder and finally freed themselves of Ragman. It was only with the support of Batman and Rory's old friend, Rabbi Luria, that he regained control, though at the cost of Luria's life. Ragman's powers have increased since then. Currently, he can absorb souls into his costume. With each new soul added, a rag is added. He can call upon the souls in his costume to lend him their attributes or power. He is also a very proficient magic user. Judgment and vengeance During the Day of Judgment limited series, Ragman is active in destroying many of the demons invading Earth. This would earn him the wrath of the Diablos, a group of demons who style themselves after the Mafia. Wanting to gain revenge for demons lost during the Day of Judgment, they attack Ragman, injuring him and tearing off parts of his costume. They mistakenly believe him to be dead. Ragman is one of the members of Shadowpact, a team that formed to confront the Spectre in DC Comics 2005 Day of Vengeance limited series, a lead-up to the seven-issue Infinite Crisis limited series. During the Infinite Crisis storyline, Ragman and Nightshade are seen standing side by side as part of the line of superheroes defending Metropolis from attack from dozens of villains. During the series Day Of Vengeance, Ragman is one of the few volunteers willing to take on the rampaging Spectre, who has decided that all magic is evil. During a planning session, he is taken aside by the Enchantress and given a mystical gun. She entrusts him with it, as it can kill her if she goes too far with her magic, a scenario that she believes is all too possible. He tells her if she truly turns evil, his costume will take her. He then tries to kiss her, but his feelings are not returned and Enchantress even mocks him for it in front of the other heroes. Shadowpact In the Shadowpact series, Ragman, along with his teammates, was trapped inside a shield of solid blood that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. Ragman and the rest of the team spend a very short period of time inside the shield, but due to magical after- effects, a full year passes outside. Various mystical heroes, such as Phantom Stranger and Rex the Wonder Dog keep watch outside the town's borders. While inside Riverrock, Rory met an evil counterpart of himself belonging to the supervillain group that had formed the shield, the Pentacle. His counterpart is named Bagman. He/it dresses in similar green garb, and can turn his body to goo and absorb people while in this form. While inside Bagman they either suffocate or they are digested. Bagman even mentioned how oddly similar the Shadowpact and the Pentacle are. Rory only survives this encounter because Bagman's boss does not want the heroes to be killed. After the Riverock encounter, Rory must deal with the severe disruption to his life, as everyone had thought he was dead. He, like most of the team, ends up having to find a new source of income, a place to stay and the oddity of encountering a memorial statue to the entire team. In Shadowpact #8, Rory was temporarily trapped in the limbo dimension of his own cloak. He met the soul of an ancient centurion working off his crimes. This man, Marcus Liberius, first saved him from the beating several other of the murderous souls were giving Rory. Marcus reveals that the cloak was actually the \\"Great Collector Artifact\\", which has been in existence in many forms since the time of Abraham. Ragmen in Rory's line have been in action since 1812 BCE. Marcus also helped Rory, who had become disenchanted with the job of collecting corrupted souls, to see that he is not a punisher but a redeemer  allowing a better afterlife for those who work for it. This work usually takes the form of suffering on Rory's behalf. For example, Rory had been recently blinded by magic. Marcus willingly takes this blindness on, adding to previous injuries he had suffered. This last sacrifice allows Marcus, in the full view of the rest of the Shadowpact, to ascend to a higher realm.Shadowpact #8 (February 2007) Rory, along with Nightmaster and Nightshade, attempted to teleport to Washington D.C to break up a bank robbery. They were trapped in mid-transit in the Land of Nightshades. =Trinity= In Trinity #18, Ragman appears to save a man from a gang of muggers, when reality has apparently been warped and there is no \\"Trinity\\" of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, and apparently never has been. Ragman is joined by a sidekick named Tatters, wearing a green tattered hoodless costume and mask. At first, he is seen confronting an alternate version of Green Arrow, a vigilante on the service of the wealthy who ignores the poor, and later, due to a chronal blast, is seen assuming Batman's position as premier vigilante of Gotham.Trinity Volume 2 (collecting Trinity #18-35, 424 pages, September 2009, Titan Books, , DC Comics, ) =\\"Battle For The Cowl\\"= Ragman briefly appears in The Network one-shot for the \\"Battle for the Cowl\\" storyline, assisting Cassandra Cain and the Huntress in tracking down a group of hostages around Gotham. After removing the duct tape from the mouth of a gagged woman, Ragman proceeds to counsel her for her apparent drug addiction, telling her that she will never truly be free until she takes hold of her life. =\\"Blackest Night\\"= During the 2009-2010 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Nekron completely shut down Ragman's suit by using the Black Lantern rings to reanimate all the souls attached to his body. =Suit of Souls= In October 2010, Ragman starred in the one-shot Ragman: Suit of Souls. It was written by Christos Gage and drawn by Stephen Segovia.DC Universe: The Source ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Ragman returns in SUIT OF SOULS Later, Ragman is shown aiding the JLA during their mission into Hell, where he helps Green Arrow defeat the demon Anger.Justice League of America 80-Page Giant (2011) =The New 52= Rory Regan is the owner of the book and antique shop Rags 'n Tatters who moonlights as the costumed vigilante Ragman. At his shop, Rory Regan appraised a Celtic amulet as being nearly 500 years old - and worth more than he could pay out. His customer's urgency and insistence in selling the amulet made him suspicious that it had been stolen, but the man insisted that it was just an heirloom. Reluctantly, Rory offered $750, and the man accepted, hurrying away. Despite getting a deal, Rory worried that he would regret the purchase. Above his shop, Rory was roused from his sleep by a ghostly voice, warning that he was needed. He hurried down stairs to find a pair of thugs attempting to steal an ancient artifact from his safe in the shop. Angry, he followed them in the uniform of Ragman. Rory followed the thieves to their employer, where the remaining cultists intended to use Clayface and the stolen artifact to resurrect Morgaine le Fey. At the cost of Clayface's discomfort, the Arthurian witch succeeded in returning to life in the present. While too late to prevent her revival, Ragman joined up with Etrigan and Batwoman to fight her, introducing himself as his alias. When Etrigan, desperate to destroy the witch, broke a gas main in the old house the ritual took place in and breathed his fire on it, Ragman, Batwoman, and the now-amnesiac Clayface had barely any time to get out of range of the resultant explosion, but managed it. According to Etrigan, who also survived, it was likely that Morgaine also managed to live through the explosion. Knowing that Clayface belonged in Arkham Asylum, but that Morgaine could easily break him free on a moment's notice from there, Ragman offered to assuage Batwoman's worries thereof by taking Clayface into his own custody, hoping to help him find his memories. The group parted ways, and Etrigan promised that when next the time came to fight, he would be there. Rory Regan dumped Clayface into his bathtub, for once thankful for being single and thus not needing to explain himself to anyone. Hungry, he checked his fridge and could not find anything appetizing, but was startled suddenly when Clayface appeared behind him and warned him that Morgaine would kill again. =DC Rebirth= Ragman returned to DC Comics in a six-issue series written by Ray Fawkes and illustrated by Inaki Miranda and colored by Eva de la Cruz, with covers by Guillem March. Powers and abilities Pre-Crisis, Ragman had the physical abilities of his father's friends: the strength of a circus strongman, the fighting ability of a heavyweight boxer and the agility of a world-class acrobat. Currently, Ragman can draw upon the physical powers of any number of the corrupted souls that make up his suit. This way he can increase his strength, speed and stamina dozens or even hundreds of times over, though he has stated that it is not easy to tap into a large number of souls at once (at the time, he made the comment that the most he had ever done was somewhere over 100). This also allows Ragman to avoid most wounds, as he can use one of his other souls to take the damage for him. Most significantly, having defeated an enemy, he can acquire new souls by absorbing them with the suit, although he can only do this for truly evil souls; as an example, he was unable to absorb the soul of supervillain Blue Moon because she was regularly sent to prison as her powers only worked at night, her time in prison counting as her having 'served her time' and preventing Ragman from 'punishing' her himself. He was also unable to attack Billy Batson as he was deemed \\"innocent\\", and thus couldn't be harmed. Taking a soul adds a new rag to the suit and thus adds to Ragman's power supply. However, Rory has mentioned that the process of acquiring a new soul gives him stomach cramps and nausea. Once a corrupted soul has helped him a certain number of times, it is allowed to pass on to Heaven, having earned redemption for the sins it committed in life that would have sent it to Hell if it had simply died in the normal manner. Also, Ragman possesses a number of minor magical powers, such as kinetically controlling the suit (i.e. entangling Eclipso with his cloak while grappling with her). The suit will also automatically materialize whenever he is in danger, and will normally teleport him to wherever he is needed. It has recently been revealed that the suit can take on other forms, such as weapons, and still collect souls. To date, it has taken the forms of a cloak in ancient Egypt, a spear during the Roman Empire and a dagger in 19th century England. Other versions =Cat- Man= Jay Garson Junior, who first appeared in Holyoke Publishing's Cat-Man #1 was the Golden Age Rag-Man. He first assumed his costumed identity when, after writing an article denouncing a gang of criminals, he is in a park and is shot at by one of them, only to have a tramp jump in front of him and save his life. After discovering that the tramp is his exact double, he switches clothes with him and makes it look like the criminals have succeeded in shooting him. Dressed in the tramp's tattered clothes, he then interrupts a meeting at the gang's hideout and apprehends them. Because Holyoke never renewed their copyright on him, the Rag-Man is in the public domain. =DC Animated Universe Comics= Ragman appears in Justice League Unlimited tie-in comic #15. =All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold= Ragman appears in All- New Batman: The Brave and the Bold #14 (February, 2012). After his father died, young Rory Regan inherited his family's antique shop, as well as the enchanted Ragman suit. Using the magical costume, Rory took up his family destiny to protect the Jewish community of Gotham from their enemies. Though he was considered a hero by his neighbors and by Gotham's other resident crime-fighters, Rory began to feel undervalued and unappreciated, feeling he could do better than protecting a few city blocks from muggers, vandals and the occasional skinhead. Rory began to openly resent his father for forcing him to remain in their neighborhood and look after the shop. One holiday season Batman pursued the super-criminal MacGuffin into Ragman's neighborhood. Over the course of the adventure, Batman helped Rory come to terms with his feelings toward his father and see the good he had done for his community. =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year Three, Ragman teams up with John Constantine and Klarion the Witch Boy to spring a trap on the despotic Superman. Ragman first takes Raven's form after she is tricked into luring Superman to her binding place in Gotham City. Superman though supposedly frees \\"Raven\\", who is later revealed to be Ragman as he warns Superman that his senses can be fooled and then proclaims that he can feel his murdering soul. He then uses the rags from his suit to bind Superman. While Constantine brags to Superman about the process, Superman manages to free himself. While Ragman believes that he is too strong, Constantine tells him that Superman's soul belongs within his suit with the rest of the corrupted souls. Before he ensnares Superman again, Superman uses his communicator to call onto Shazam. Ragman though is unable to harm Shazam, due to him being innocent, as Shazam orders him to release Superman. Ragman tries to reason with Shazam, but Shazam calls down his lightning, freeing Superman and stunning Ragman. The Spectre then appears and proclaims punishment on the tortured souls within his suit and destroys part of his suit, freeing them as he declares that their time has come. He then removes Ragman's mask as Rory calls out to Constantine for help, but he refuses to do so. The Spectre then kills Rory as Shazam watches in horror. In other media =Television= Ragman appears in Arrow, portrayed by Joe Dinicol. This version is the sole survivor of the nuclear destruction of Havenrock and wears ancient rags from the Devarim era. He first appears in season five episode \\"The Recruits\\", where he comes to Star City to seek vengeance by attacking Evan Wander and Janet Carroll, the Vice President and CEO of AmerTek, who developed the nuclear missiles that destroyed Havenrock. While contesting with Tobias Church/Charon, Oliver Queen / Green Arrow convinces him to let his quest for vengeance go to become a hero and he agrees to join Green Arrow's team.https://www.yahoo.com/news/arrow-recap-ragman-becomes-olivers-first- recruit-120015879.html In \\"Bratva\\", when the team travels to Russia, Rory is willing to risk his life to stop a nuclear bomb by enclosing it within his suit. Though he survives, he reveals that his rags have lost their power. Considering himself a liability without his powers, Rory leaves the team, but tells Felicity Smoak that he will return.

Pallottines are part of the Union of Catholic Apostolate and are present in 45 countries on six continents. The Pallottines administer one of the largest churches in the world, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro in C√¥te d'Ivoire. History Vincent Pallotti was born in Rome in 1795. The Society as a community of priests and brothers was founded in Rome by Pallotti in 1835. Together with a group of associates and collaborators, he developed in the city of Rome a large structure of apostolic activity, which included assisting the poor, the sick, and marginalized; founding orphanages, institutions of charity, and shelters; and ministering to soldiers, workers, students, and prisoners. The Society, as a community of priests and brothers, was founded in Rome by Pallotti in 1835.\\"Saint Vincent Pallotti\\", Societas Apostolatus Catholici Vincent Pallotti died on January 22, 1850, without having seen the full development of his work. His closest collaborators continued his mission, ensuring further development of the Society. Vincent Pallotti was beatified in 1950 and canonized On January 20, 1963, by Pope John XXIII.Pallotti Portal, Catholic Apostolic Center Apostolate Pallottine fathers Not long after the death of his wife, Marianne, in 1880, English poet Coventry Patmore contacted the Pallotines about establishing a church in Hastings. St Mary Star of the Sea Church opened on 2 July 1883 and as of 2019 is still served by the Pallottines.St. Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church, Hastings The Pallottine mission to Kamerun was established in 1890 in the German colony of Kamerun, today's Cameroon. The Fathers opened a number of missions and schools until 1916, when with the Kamerun Campaign of World War I, they relocated south to Spanish Guinea. After the war, the Pallottines were replaced by the French Holy Ghost Fathers. The Pallottines returned to Cameroon in 1964.DeLancey, Mark W. and DeLancey, Mark Dike (2000): Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon (3rd ed.). Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, p. 70 In the present day, the Pallottines have expanded their missionary apostolate to Taiwan and the Philippines. The Society conducts parishes, schools, missions, clinics, retreat houses, all types of charitable works, and the scientific Institute for Catholic Church Statistics in Poland.Institute for Catholic Church Statistics In 1915 the Society founded the St. Paulusheim Gymnasium in Bruchsal, Germany and in 1954 the Bishop Eustace Preparatory School in Pennsauken, New Jersey. The Pallottines also founded and direct the Catholic Apostolate Center in Washington, D.C., which develops programs to help strengthen the Society's mission. Irish Pallottines The Irish Pallottine Province, now known as the Mother of Divine Love Province, came to Ireland in 1909. The Pallottine College in Thurles, Co. Tipperary, served as a seminary for the Irish Province with students also being trained in theology in the nearby St. Patrick's College, Thurles. The Irish Pallottines have served in England, Argentina, United States, Rome (Church of San Silvestro in Capite) and East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania), as well as being entrusted with the running of two parishes, Corduff and Shankill, in the Archdiocese of Dublin. The provincial headquarters was in Argentina but moved to London in 1928, before moving to Dublin in 1978.

It also spoke for the interests of the 21 million Canadians who are members of libraries. CLA members worked in all four types of libraries: academic (college and university), public, special (corporate, non-profit and government) and school libraries. Others sat on boards of public libraries, work for companies that provide goods and services to libraries, or were students in graduate level or community college programs. CLA's Mission Statement was: \\"CLA is the national voice for Canada's library communities. As members, we: * champion library values and the value of libraries * influence public policy impacting libraries * inspire and support member learning * collaborate to strengthen the library community\\" The statement highlights the Association's advocacy role on behalf of the Canadian library and information community. As of January, 2016, the organization claimed it had 924 paid members, although it is unclear whether this means personal members, or total membership (including corporate, associate, institutional, and honorary members). The executive council claims it had spent several years dealing with the difficulties of declining membership, efficiency, and financial power. On January 27, 2016, the CLA membership formally voted to disband the organization. The last CLA Forum was held in June 2016 in Ottawa, Ontario. History The Canadian Library Association (CLA) was founded in Hamilton, Ontario in 1946, and was incorporated under the Companies Act on November 26, 1947. Freda Farrell Waldon was its first president, serving in the year 1947. CLA is a non-profit voluntary organization, governed by an elected Executive Council, which is advised by over forty interest groups and committees. In May 2002, the membership was at a grand total of 2,721, including 2216 personal, 505 institutional, and 187 associate members. As of December 2014, the last time at which information was available, total membership in the CLA (through its various membership types) was 1,283: * Personal ‚Äì 957 * Institutions ‚Äì 249 * Corporate ‚Äì 50 * Associate ‚Äì 27 On June 2016, the CLA was dissolved and its functions taken by several associations, including the Ontario Library Association and the Canadian Federation of Library Associations.  Committees  The CLA was supported by two types of committees: advisory committees and standing committees. As the need arose, new committees were formed by the Executive Council. Existing CLA members were primarily considered in the member selection process. = Advisory committees = The Executive Council created advisory committees to address topics of strategic professional interest to the CLA. These committees were either long-term or short-term. Some of the advisory committees that supported the CLA were: * Copyright Advisory Committee * Information Policy Advisory Committee * Intellectual Freedom Advisory Committee * School Libraries Advisory Committee * Royal Society of Canada: Brief Development Team for CLA Submission = Standing committees = The Executive Council created long-term standing committees to actively govern the CLA. These committees contributed to the continuing operation of the CLA, and included: * Conference Standing Committee * Elections Standing Committee * Finance Standing Committee * Member Communications Standing Committee * Monograph Publications Standing Committee * Nominations Standing Committee * Participation Standing Committee * Resolutions Standing Committee Student chapters Recognizing that there was a need for close association between the Canadian Library Association and students in library school, the Canadian Library Association always encouraged students to join CLA, network and become involved active members of the library community. In March 1999, CLA's first Student Chapter was officially launched at the University of Western Ontario. Since that time, Student Chapters were launched at the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, University of Alberta, McGill University and Dalhousie University and in 2006 at the Nova Scotia Community College Institute of Technology Campus.\\"Canadian Library Association Student Chapters\\" . Student chapters of the Canadian Library Association allowed for professional development and networking opportunities for students enrolled in library and information science programs.

Description The nostalgic, melancholic songhttps://news.avclub.com/50-years-later-a-look-back-at-sinatra-s- influential-i-1798284099 recounts the type of girls with whom the singer had relationships at various years in his life: when he was 17, \\"small-town girls ... under the village green\\"; at 21, \\"city girls who lived up the stairs\\"; at 35, \\"blue-blooded girls of independent means\\". Each of these years he calls \\"very good\\". In the song's final verse, the singer reflects that he is older, and in the autumn of his years, and he thinks back on his entire life \\"as vintage wine\\". All of these romances were sweet to him, like a wine from a very good (i.e., vintage) year. Inspiration Ervin Drake's inspiration to write the song was his then wife-to-be, Edith Vincent Bermaine. She was a showgirl, whom he had dated, and eventually married twenty years after the song was written. Notable recordings The Kingston Trio introduced the song on their album Goin' Places (1961).

Biography Buckhantz began his television announcing career as Sports Director at WTTG, a Fox affiliate in Washington, D.C. as well as NFL games for Fox. A District native, he grew up in Arlington, Virginia, where his father owned a construction company. He attended James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. One of his earlier jobs in sports was with WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, where he covered the Braves and the Hawks and eventually became the night-time sports anchor. Buckhantz currently resides in Washington, D.C. He married Shelley Lawrence on May 8, 2011. Shelley has two children from a previous marriage, Jake and Olivia Lawrence. Buckhantz has spent 23 years as the Wizards' play-by-play announcer, alongside Phil Chenier and later, Kara Lawson, on NBC Sports Washington (formerly HTS from 1984-2001 and Comcast SportsNet from 2001-2017) until his departure after the 2018-19 NBA season.

The existence of such motion was first proposed by Erwin Schr√∂dinger in 1930 as a result of his analysis of the wave packet solutions of the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons in free space, in which an interference between positive and negative energy states produces what appears to be a fluctuation (up to the speed of light) of the position of an electron around the median, with an angular frequency of , or approximately radians per second. For the hydrogen atom, zitterbewegung can be invoked as a heuristic way to derive the Darwin term, a small correction of the energy level of the s-orbitals. Theory =Free fermion= The time-dependent Dirac equation is written as : H \\\\psi (\\\\mathbf{x},t) = i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} (\\\\mathbf{x},t) , where \\\\hbar is the (reduced) Planck constant, \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},t) is the wave function (bispinor) of a fermionic particle spin-¬Ω, and is the Dirac Hamiltonian of a free particle: : H = \\\\beta mc^2 + \\\\sum_{j = 1}^3 \\\\alpha_j p_j c , where m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, p_j is the momentum operator, and \\\\beta and \\\\alpha_j are matrices related to the Gamma matrices \\\\gamma_\\\\mu , as \\\\beta=\\\\gamma_0 and \\\\alpha_j=\\\\gamma_0\\\\gamma_j . In the Heisenberg picture, the time dependence of an arbitrary observable obeys the equation : -i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\left[ H , Q \\\\right] . In particular, the time-dependence of the position operator is given by : \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_k(t)}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\left[ H , x_k \\\\right] = \\\\hbar c\\\\alpha_k . where is the position operator at time . The above equation shows that the operator can be interpreted as the -th component of a \\"velocity operator\\". To add time-dependence to , one implements the Heisenberg picture, which says : \\\\alpha_k (t) = e^\\\\frac{i H t}{\\\\hbar}\\\\alpha_k e^{-\\\\frac{i H t}{\\\\hbar}}. The time-dependence of the velocity operator is given by : \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_k(t)}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\left[ H , \\\\alpha_k \\\\right] = 2\\\\left(i \\\\gamma_k m - \\\\sigma_{kl}p^l\\\\right) = 2i\\\\left(p_k-\\\\alpha_kH\\\\right) , where :\\\\sigma_{kl} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\left[\\\\gamma_k,\\\\gamma_l\\\\right] . Now, because both and are time- independent, the above equation can easily be integrated twice to find the explicit time-dependence of the position operator. First: :\\\\alpha_k (t) = \\\\left(\\\\alpha_k (0) - c p_k H^{-1}\\\\right) e^{-\\\\frac{2 i H t}{\\\\hbar}} + c p_k H^{-1} , and finally : x_k(t) = x_k(0) + c^2 p_k H^{-1} t + \\\\tfrac12 i \\\\hbar c H^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\alpha_k (0) - c p_k H^{-1} \\\\right) \\\\left( e^{-\\\\frac{2 i H t}{\\\\hbar}} - 1 \\\\right) . The resulting expression consists of an initial position, a motion proportional to time, and an oscillation term with an amplitude equal to the Compton wavelength. That oscillation term is the so- called zitterbewegung. =Interpretation= In quantum mechanics, the zitterbewegung term vanishes on taking expectation values for wave-packets that are made up entirely of positive- (or entirely of negative-) energy waves. This can be achieved by taking a Foldy‚ÄìWouthuysen transformation. Thus, we arrive at the interpretation of the zitterbewegung as being caused by interference between positive- and negative-energy wave components. In quantum electrodynamics the negative-energy states are replaced by positron states, and the zitterbewegung is understood as the result of interaction of the electron with spontaneously forming and annihilating electron-positron pairs.Zhi-Yong, W., & Cai-Dong, X. (2008). Zitterbewegung in quantum field theory. Chinese Physics B, 17(11), 4170.  Experimental simulation  Zitterbewegung of a free relativistic particle has never been observed directly, although there is strong evidence in favor of its existence. It has also been simulated twice in model systems that provide condensed-matter analogues of the relativistic phenomenon. The first example, in 2010, placed a trapped ion in an environment such that the non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger equation for the ion had the same mathematical form as the Dirac equation (although the physical situation is different). Then, in 2013, it was simulated in a setup with Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates. Other proposals for condensed-matter analogues include graphene and topological insulators.

In March 2012, she was a candidate for The Left in the 2012 German presidential election against Joachim Gauck, which she lost 126 to 991. Biography =Early life= Klarsfeld is the only child of Helen and Kurt K√ºnzel, who was an insurance clerk. Her parents were not Nazis, according to Klarsfeld; however, they had voted for Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. Her father was drafted in the summer of 1939 into the infantry. From the summer of 1940, he fought with his unit in France and was moved in 1941 to the eastern front. In the following winter, because he had contracted double pneumonia, he was transferred back to Germany and worked as an accountant. Beate spent several months in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ with her godfather, who was a Nazi official. The Berlin apartment in which she lived was bombed and relatives in Sandau gave shelter to Beate and her mother. In 1945, her father was released from British captivity and joined them. The house and property in Sandau were seized by the Polish government, and the family returned to Berlin. From the age of about fourteen years, Beate began frequently to argue with her parents, because they did not feel responsible for the Nazi era and regretted the injustices and material losses they suffered, and while blaming the Russians, felt no sympathy for other countries.Beate Klarsfeld: Wherever they may be, 1972, Seite 3-4, holocaust-history.org; accessed 12 March 2012. =Move to Paris= Klarsfeld with her husband Serge visiting Jerusalem (2007) In 1960, Beate K√ºnzel spent a year as an au pair in Paris. By her own admission, at that time politics and history were completely foreign to her. However, in Paris she was confronted with the consequences of The Holocaust. In 1963, she married the French lawyer and historian Serge Klarsfeld, whose father was a victim of the Auschwitz concentration camp exterminations. Klarsfeld said that her husband helped her to become, \\"a German of conscience and awareness\\".Spiegel-Gespr√§ch, a.a. They had two children: Arno David (born 1965) and Lida Myriam (born 1973).Vgl. After changing employment she worked from 1964 as a secretary at the new German-French Youth Office. There she published Deutsche M√§dchen au pair in Paris, a guide for German au pair girls in Paris. During an unpaid leave year, after the birth of her son, she became increasingly engaged in feminist literature and the emancipation of women in Germany. By the end of 1966, she moved with her family, her mother-in-law and the three-member family of Serge's sister into an apartment together.Beate Klarsfeld: Wherever they may be, 1972, Seite 16-21, holocaust-history.org; accessed 12 March 2017. =Action against Kiesinger= While the Klarsfelds were in Paris after the government crisis in October and November 1966, Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU member) was chosen as the new German chancellor of a coalition of the political parties CDU and SPD. In a January 14, 1967 essay for the French newspaper Combat, Klarsfeld, who was then a foreign member of the SPD, came out against the Kiesinger chancellorship in favour of Willy Brandt. In these and other pieces for Combat in March and 27 July of that year she accused Kiesinger of having made a \\"good reputation\\" for himself \\"in the ranks of the Brown Shirts\\" and \\"in the CDU\\". At the end of August she was fired by the French-German Youth Office, at which the Klarsfelds initiated legal action against the decision and redoubled their journalistic campaign against Kiesinger.Sascha Lehnartz: To draw attention to Kiesinger's Nazi past, Beate Klarsfeld initiated a campaign with various public actions. Kiesinger registered as a member of the Nazi Party in late February 1933 and by 1940 had risen to deputy head of the political broadcasting department at the Foreign Ministry that was responsible for influencing foreign broadcasts in favor of German politics. Kiesinger was responsible for the connection to the Reich Propaganda Ministry. Klarsfeld accused Kiesinger of being a member of the board of Inter Radio AG, which had been buying foreign radio stations for propaganda purposes. According to her, he also was principally in charge of the contents of the German international broadcasts which included anti- Semitic and war propaganda, and had collaborated closely with SS functionaries and Franz Alfred Six who were responsible for mass murders in Eastern Europe. After becoming aware of the genocide of the Jews, Kiesinger continued to produce the anti-Semitic propaganda.The Kiesinger Record , Kapitel aus: Beate Klarsfeld: Wherever they may be, 1972, Seite 26‚Äì35. These allegations were based in part on documents that Albert Norden published about the culprits of war and Nazi crimes. On 2 April 1968, from the public gallery in the Bonn Bundestag (German parliament), Klarsfeld shouted \\"Nazi Kiesinger, resign!\\" at Kiesinger, and was arrested to be released soon after. According to archives, she traveled to East Berlin in the end of April 1968 in order \\"to discuss the preparation of actions against Kiesinger and obtain appropriate support\\" there with the National Council, the supreme body of the National Front. On 9 May she was in West Berlin, for a demonstration of the extra-parliamentary opposition about Kiesinger's Nazi past. A press conference was scheduled for 10 May. On 14 May, Klarsfeld wanted to organize a \\"Kiesinger-Colloquium\\" in Paris. The West Department of the SED Central Committee immediately informed Walter Ulbricht, its chairman, of Klarsfeld's plans. Subsequently, the National Council was instructed \\"to provide any relevant assistance to Mrs Klarsfeld\\". She was eventually supported by the publication of a brochure with a circulation of 30,000 copies. However, the financial help she wished for was not granted.Jochen Staadt: Bundespr√§sidenten-Kandidatin Klarsfeld ‚Äì Besuch der alten Dame In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 4. On 9 May, Klarsfeld, G√ºnter Grass (who had urged Kiesinger in an open letter to resign in 1966), Johannes Agnoli, , Jacob Taubes and Michel Lang (a student from the \\"Jewish Working Group for Politics\\") led a panel discussion in front of about 2,000 to 3,000 students in the main lecture theatre of the Technical University of Berlin. Grass was initially booed from the audience before starting his speech. Klarsfeld, who presented Kiesinger as a major threat to Germany and the National Democratic Party of Germany promised those present to try to slap him publicly. This was not taken seriously by representatives of the SDS and a part of the audience and was laughed at. Grass' thesis was that a withdrawal by Kiesinger would be a prerequisite for an efficient fight against the NPD, was contradicted by Agnoli and Krippendorff.Philipp Gassert: Kurt Georg Kiesinger, 1904‚Äì1988, DVA, 2006. The conference ended with a 3/4 majority urging Kiesinger to resign.Beate Klarsfeld: Wherever they may be, 1972, Seite 46-47. In mid-1968, as a witness in a lawsuit, Kiesinger claimed he had not heard about the murder of Jews until 1942 and first believed any of it from foreign reports towards the end of 1944. During a CDU party conference in West Berlin on 7 November 1968, Klarsfeld mounted the podium of the Berlin Congress Hall, slapped Kiesinger, and shouted \\"Nazi, Nazi, Nazi\\".Beate Klarsfelds privater Feldzug, Die Zeit vom 25. A few days later, during an interview with Der Spiegel she maintained that she had already planned the slap on 9 May 1968. She said that she had wanted to express that part of the German people - especially the youth - who were opposed to a Nazi being the head of the Federal Government.Amtsgericht Tiergarten verurteilte Beate Klarsfeld wegen Ohrfeige auf Bundeskanzler Kurt Georg Kiesinger zu Freiheitsstrafe von 1 Jahr. Berlin was selected as the site because Klarsfeld and her husband expected she would only be punished mildly as a French citizen because of the four-power status of the city. The following day on 7 November 1968, Klarsfeld received a 1-year custodial sentence in an accelerated hearing, but due to her part- French nationality she didn't actually have to go to prison.Klaus Dahmann: Beate Klarsfeld: Die \\"Nazi-J√§gerin\\", dw.de; accessed 25 April 2017. Her defense attorney was Horst Mahler. The judge justified the scale of the penalty - it was the best possible under an accelerated procedure - on the grounds that political beliefs should not be demonstrated with violence, and that the fact the injured was the Chancellor, had not influenced his judgment. Klarsfeld appealed against the verdict. In recognition of her action, the writer and later Nobel Prize laureate Heinrich B√∂ll sent red roses to her in Paris. G√ºnter Grass, however, deemed Klarsfeld's action \\"irrational\\" and criticized B√∂ll's reaction. During a wave of violent actions and attacks by the student movement following the judgment against Klarsfeld, the judge's windows were pelted with stones, which the SDS called \\"an adequate response to a unparalleled terror judgment\\". In late 1969, Klarsfeld's sentence was reduced to four months in prison, which were suspended on probation. Klarsfeld justified the act in a poem that she recorded on November 23, 1968. Accordingly, Klarsfeld when asked, explained that her slap was on behalf of 50 million dead of World War II and that the future generations must understand the \\"repulsive face of ten million Nazis\\". In her opinion, Germany needed the slap to prove the guilt of the Nazi followers, to avenge dead Russians and German youth soldiers, to sympathize with concentration camp victims, to clean the occupied countries and daughter crew opponents as Manolis Glezos, the glory of the Scholl siblings, to reconcile with the Jewish, Russian and Polish people, for a joint anti-fascism, for an association \\"freed from the urge for hegemony\\" of \\"three or two\\" Germany, for \\"socialism and peace, for the other nations of the respected world\\" and respect for women among the bombing and torture victims of the Holocaust.Die Geschichte einer Ohrfeige, Audiodatei, Neues Deutschland, 8.Beate Klarsfeld: Ohrfeige f√ºr Pg. 2633930 (PDF; 128 kB) In: elan, Dezember 1968 (mit Klarsfelds Rede und der Schriftstellererkl√§rung dazu) Klarsfeld was accompanied by her mother on 11 November 1968 in Brussels where two days later Kiesinger was to speak on the evening of 13 November 1968 to the Grandes Conf√©rences Catholiques. She was advised to leave the country by the Belgian police. In 1969 she joined the Waldshut constituency federal election campaign as a direct candidate of the Party of Democratic Progress action against the direct candidate of the CDU, Chancellor Kiesinger. Kiesinger received 60,373 votes, Klarsfeld 644.Alfred Grosser: Geschichte Deutschlands seit 1945. =Other activities= Beate Klarsfeld (1970) In February 1971 Klarsfeld demonstrated in front of the Charles University in Prague against \\"Stalinisation, persecution and anti-Semitism\\". As a result, she was temporarily banned from entering the GDR.Miriam Hollstein: Das Chaos bei der Kandidatenk√ºr der Linken, welt.de; accessed 12 March 2017. That same year in Germany, with her husband and several other people, she tried to kidnap Kurt Lischka, who was responsible for the deportation of some 76,000 Jews from France. Lischka was living openly under his own name in Cologne. Klarsfeld planned to deliver him to justice in Paris, as a previous conviction in France blocked further legal action against Lischka in Germany. Although the kidnapping was unsuccessful, it served to draw media attention to Klarsfeld's cause. She turned herself in to the German authorities, saying that they must arrest either her or Lischka. In 1974 she was sentenced to two months' imprisonment for the attempted kidnapping, with Lischka testifying at her trial. After an international outcry, her sentence was suspended. Lischka remained at large until 1980, when he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. In the 1970s, Klarsfeld repeatedly pointed to the involvement of the FDP politician Ernst Achenbach in the deportation of Jews from France.Zeitungsartikel zur B√ºrobesetzung am 4. In 1976, she succeeded in her political activity. She ended her activity as a lobbyist of Nazi criminals shortly before her scheduled deployment as West German representative in the European Community in Brussels. In 1984 and 1985 she toured the military dictatorships of Chile and Paraguay, to draw attention to the search for the suspected Nazi war criminals Walter Rauff and Josef Mengele. In 1986 Klarsfeld spent a month in West Beirut, Lebanon, and offered to go into custody in an exchange for Israeli hostages . Beate Klarsfeld 1986 in 1986, she campaigned against the candidacy of former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, the Austrian Federal President, who was accused of having been involved in war crimes as an officer of the Wehrmacht. She attended his campaign events and after his election she disrupted his appearances in Istanbul and Amman, where she was supported by the World Jewish Congress.Manfred Bleskin: \\"Das ist eine Anerkennung meiner Arbeit\\", Interview mit Beate Klarsfeld, N-tv, p. 17. On 4 July 1987, a resolution took heed of Klarsfeld's initiative and condemned SS war criminal Klaus Barbie (known as the Butcher of Lyon). Barbie was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. This success credited Klarsfeld as the \\"main result\\" of their actions. As early as 1972 they had uncovered his whereabouts in Bolivia. Her gift was the foundation of the memorial Maison d'Izieu (Children of Izieu), in memory of the victims of Barbie's crimes. In 1991, she fought for the extradition of Eichmann's deputy Alois Brunner, then living in Syria, for the murder of 130,000 Jews in German concentration camps. In 2001, through the efforts of Klarsfeld, Brunner was sentenced by a French court in absentia to life imprisonment. In July 2001, Klarsfeld called for a demonstration in Berlin against the state visit of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Ivo Bozic: Damaskuserlebnis f√ºr Antiimperialisten, jungle-world.com, August 2012; accessed 12 March 2017. Beate and Serge Klarsfeld published a commemorative book in which the names of over 80,000 victims of the Nazi era in France. They strove successfully to have the pictures displayed of about 11,400 deported Jewish children in the years 1942 to 1944. The French railway SNCF welcomed the project and displayed the pictures at 18 stations as a traveling exhibition (Enfants juifs D√©port√©s de France). The German Railways (DB), the legal successor of Deutsche Reichsbahn, turned down a corresponding exhibition at DB-stations \\"for security reasons\\" and referred them to the DB Museum in Nuremberg. The former DB CEO Hartmut Mehdorn argued the issue was much too serious, for display in German railway stations. Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee spoke out in favor of the exhibition. At the end of 2006 Tiefensee and Mehdorn agreed to support a new, DB owned exhibition on the role of the Reichsbahn in World War II. The special Deutsche Bahn traveling exhibition \\"Special Trains to Death\\" has been shown since January 23, 2008 at numerous German train stations. Since its opening, this exhibition has seen over 150,000 visitors. The hunt for Klaus Barbie was made into the movie Die Hetzjagd (The hunt) of 2008. In 2009, she was again nominated by the parliamentary group Die Linke for the Order of Merit. Led by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, the German Foreign Office, which is responsible for the awarding of expatriate German nationals, refused the nomination. In the term of office of Joschka Fischer as foreign minister (1998-2005) the award had already been previously rejected.handelsblatt.com: Westerwelle stellt sich gegen \\"Nazi-J√§gerin\\" p. 26, handelsblatt.com; accessed 12 March 2017. Since 2008, Klarsfeld has been, together with Michel Cullin of France, a member of the International Council of the Austrian Service Abroad and has supported the memorial service of young Austrians in Holocaust memorials and Jewish museums around the world. On 8 November 2009, she was awarded the in Munich; but carried her nomination in violation of the regulations.Georg- Elser-Arbeitskreis Heidenheim: Georg-Elser-Preis, georg-elser-arbeitskreis.de; accessed 12 March 2017.

Klarsfeld stated that she felt fully supported by The Left in the fight against fascism. The fact that the party had nominated her with knowledge of her commitment to Israel, shows that the party agreed with her on this matter. She did not publish a program for her administration in case of her winning, she did, however, say she wanted to improve the image of Germany. A moral Germany had to be created, one that can bring about social justice in other European countries.Linke-Kandidatin Klarsfeld bekundet Symphathie f√ºr Sarkozy In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 29. Klarsfeld had announced, she would support Incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election. She is not \\"troubled, that I candidate for The Left of all things\\" although she would have preferred a nomination by the CDU or the SPD.Bj√∂rn Hengst: Gauck-Rivalin Klarsfeld in Berlin: Die neue Liebe der Linken In: Spiegel Online, p. 29. The election as President of Germany would be the \\"highest honor\\" that she could be granted. At the end of February 2012, the Saxon State Commissioner for the Stasi files, Lutz Rathenow, made in the Tagesspiegel Klarsfeld contacts with the Ministry of State Security of the GDR on the subject. Klarsfeld had indeed supplied no reports and had also not been a player, but did receive material from the GDR secret. They have also wanted. According to Rathenow, it \\"needs a reflection of how far served the Stasi legwork of Nazi Crimes elucidation and where it has harmed.\\" would require. He asked: \\"Had such a secret trust has been applied also to the American CIA or the Federal Intelligence Service?

According to Bohnsack this cooperation began in 1966 and ended only in 1989. The \\"Plan with the slap\\" have Klarsfeld \\"probably concocted itself\\"; he knew nothing about it before it is executed.Peter Wensierski: Klara und die Detektive In: Der Spiegel 10/2012, p. 5. Klarsfeld confirmed that it was not an informer, the GDR but suggested that she open the \\"Archive to Nazi criminals in Potsdam\\". After Klarsfeld actions against antisemitism early 70s in Prague and Warsaw, the GDR had these doors but closed again.

On 7 March 2012, Welt published online under the article title \\"2000 D-Mark for the famous German slap\\" an internal instruction of the SED Politburo member Albert Norden announced the 14 November 1968, a week after the slap against Kiesinger, Klarsfeld should be provided 2000 DM \\"for further initiatives\\".

Asked about the allegations, Klarsfeld said it was outrageous to reduce their commitment for Kiesinger's Nazi past to support by the GDR. she never worked on behalf of the GDR, but on their own behalf. In 1968 she had a few days spent by the slap 2,000 marks for it to organize the event with Kiesinger in Brussels.

The national director of Die Linke, Caren Lay, described it as against it \\"absurd charge\\", \\"to discredit commissioned by the GDR\\" Klarsfeld commitment as. The deputy chairman of the parliamentary faction Dietmar Bartsch said Klarsfeld sought to put the slap Kiesingers a sign, but achieved a great deal more. He opposed equating DDR and Nazism, calling it legitimate that Klarsfeld was supported in its \\"fight against Nazis\\" from France, Israel, and also of East Germany.Anne Raith: Beate Klarsfeld ist eine gute Kandidatin, Interview mit Dietmar Bartsch In: Deutschlandfunk, p. 10.

The museum's locations (1987‚Äìpresent) The Museum of Broadcast Communications was founded in 1982 but didn't open until June 1987 in the River City condominium complex, located at 800 S. Wells St. It remained there until June 1992, when it moved to the Chicago Cultural Center. The MBC then left the Cultural Center in December 2003, with plans to open in a new building of its own at 360 N. State St. in 2005. Subsequently, construction of the new MBC experienced various delays and setbacks, with construction stopping in 2006 and the half-completed building slated to be sold in December 2008, which MBC founder and president Bruce DuMont blamed on a lack of $6 million in state funding that had reportedly been promised to the museum three years earlier. On November 7, 2009, DuMont announced that funding for the museum from the state of Illinois had finally been obtained and that construction would begin once again. Seven months later, Governor Pat Quinn stated that Illinois would give the MBC a capital grant of $6 million to help complete its construction. (In December 2009 the MBC held a construction fundraiser in Oak Park, Illinois, where DuMont was living at the time. The event's headliner was Bill Jackson, the creator and host of the children's program The BJ and Dirty Dragon Show, which aired on Chicago TV from 1968 to '74, originally as Cartoon Town.) The new 62,000-square-foot MBC was back under construction in 2010. It was set to include expanded areas for collection development, two exhibit galleries, and working radio and television studios. The State of Illinois set a deadline of May 2011 to finish basic interior work and landscaping, but because of cold weather, the museum was given a 30-day extension on its original April 30 deadline. Shortly before the museum reojob creation,\\" DuMont said, DOMONT IS DEAD.\\"because it changes one life.\\" After being dormant for eight and a half years as a brick-and- mortar destination, the museum reopened in its new location at 360 N. State St. on June 13, 2012, exactly 25 years after it first opened its doors. (Technically, the National Radio Hall of Fame gallery, located on the second floor of the museum, had been open to the public since December 1, 2011.) The pre-opening ceremony on June 12 included actors John Mahoney (Frasier) and Betty White (The Golden Girls) and newscaster Hugh Downs (20/20). According to a February 2011 press release centered on the MBC's partnership with Cleversafe to provide online access to its archives, roughly 70,000 registered users and 4.5 million unique visitors had accessed the MBC's 400,000 online videos between 2009 and early 2011, and more than \\"240,000 visitors from across the country are projected for the [museum's] first year of operation.\\" However, museum attendance \\"dropped drastically, from 225,000 annual visitors when MBC was at the Cultural Center and free to 7,300 last year at the current entrance fee of $12,\\" reported the Chicago Reader in May 2015. \\"Then in 2013, what DuMont describes as a 'server crash' destroyed access to the 10 percent of the museum's archive of radio and television programming that had been digitized and made available to the public for free.\\" In December 2012 Crain's Chicago Business reported that the MBC \\"now owes less than $3 million on a mortgage held by Pepper [Construction, the contractor for the State St. facility] and has arranged another three years for paying down that debt.\\" (The Chicago Reader had previously reported, in November 2009, a mortgage total of $4.79 million \\"that'll come due in 2011.\\") More than four and a half years later, in July 2017, Crain's revealed that the MBC's mortgage deadline had been pushed back from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017, and that as of August 2016 the museum \\"owed $2.5 million to Pepper Construction\\"; furthermore, \\"the museum posted $53,674 in ticket revenue\\" in 2015 along with \\"an operating deficit of $561,331, according to its tax filing for that year, the most recent available.\\" Four weeks later Crain's reported that Pepper Construction had granted the MBC another year to pay off its debt, extending the mortgage deadline to December 31, 2018. In September 2017 the MBC announced the debut of \\"Saturday Night Live: The Experience,\\" a 12,000-square- foot exhibit acquired from Premier Exhibitions that was set to open the following month and run through the end of 2018 on the museum's second and fourth floors. \\"It's a grab for the gold ring,\\" MBC president Bruce DuMont told the Chicago Tribune. \\"I think it's going to dramatically change the museum for the better. We're very excited about it. There's going to be more attention, more traffic, more buzz about the things we do here.\\" (Premier Exhibitions filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016.) On March 2, 2018, media blogger Robert Feder reported that the museum was \\"looking to sell two floors of its four-story building at 360 North State Street.\\" \\"We simply are looking at options to improve the future educational and entertainment experience for our patrons,\\" said MBC board chairman Larry Wert. \\"Any proceeds would put the institution on a solid financial foundation.\\" Wert, Tribune Media's president of broadcast media, was elected interim chairman of the MBC board in October 2016, less than two months after Bruce DuMont announced that he planned to retire as the museum's president. (Until Wert became the interim chairman of the board, the position had \\"been vacant since 1995 when the late Arthur C. Nielsen Jr. stepped down after 11 years,\\" wrote Feder that October.) However, shortly after DuMont made his announcement in August 2016, the website Chicagoland Radio and Media reported, \\"Officially, DuMont is voluntarily retiring from the MBC, claiming the decision is entirely his own, although in reality, there is far more behind it,\\" including alleged financial mismanagement and controversy surrounding his personal life; additionally, DuMont would \\"remain at least until a successor has been found and begun in the MBC President role. This could take up to a year.\\" DuMont's final two-year term as president ended on December 31, 2017, without a successor in place, but on March 19, 2018, Robert Feder reported that Julian Jackson, formerly the vice president of design at the Milwaukee Public Museum, had been named the MBC's new executive director. Nearly six months later, on September 17, 2018, Feder reported that the MBC's board of directors was close to finalizing a deal to sell the museum's third and fourth floors to Fern Hill, a real estate development and investment firm. \\"Sources said the agreement will net $6 million, to be used to continue operating the museum and paying down debt ‚Äî especially a $3.7 million mortgage held by Pepper Construction Co.,\\" Feder wrote. The deal closed on March 1, 2019, with executive director Julian Jackson telling Feder, \\"When we open the next phase of the permanent museum, we plan on providing a state-of-the-art experience to all of our guest [sic], while delivering brand value to our sponsors and supporters.\\" That same week the Chicago Tribune reported that the MBC was \\"negotiating with Cleveland‚Äôs Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to bring two special exhibitions here beginning in June,\\" and that after the March 31 closing of \\"Saturday Night Live: The Experience,\\" which had been held over for three months, the museum's second floor was \\"expected to be closed for at least April and May\\" as the MBC reduced its exhibition and event space \\"from 25,000 square feet to 12,500.\\" On March 18, 2019, Robert Feder reported that Julian Jackson had resigned as the MBC's executive director after one year, having told the board of directors that he'd \\"accepted a new position with Freeman Exhibit Solutions in Schiller Park.\\" \\"Louder Than Words: Rock, Power & Politics,\\" on loan from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, opened on May 24, 2019, for a three-month run on the MBC's second floor. (Although it was advertised as being on display through Labor Day, the exhibit closed on August 25.) On July 26 Robert Feder reported that Susy Schultz, president of the Chicago nonprofit Public Narrative and a former journalist for the Chicago Sun-Times, had been named the museum's new executive director, effective August 19. (David Plier, the CEO of Retail First Corp. and a weekend host on WGN 720 AM, replaced Larry Wert as the chairman of the MBC board at the end of June.) In its July 26 story on Schultz's hiring, the Chicago Tribune reported that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's exhibit \\"Stay Tuned: Rock on TV\\" was scheduled to open in October, and \\"the museum next year plans to remodel its primary exhibition space on the second floor and remake its central exhibition on television history,\\" according to MBC officials. The MBC temporarily closed its doors on March 15, 2020, because of the COVID-19 health crisis, and announced that it would \\"be accelerating the release of its online curriculum for 'The Great Debates,' which examines the impact of the broadcast industry on the campaign for the presidency. It was scheduled to be released when the exhibit opens this summer, but that will be moved up to early April.\\" National Radio Hall of Fame Until October 2017, when \\"Saturday Night Live: The Experience\\" opened, the second floor of the museum was the location of the National Radio Hall of Fame (NRHOF) gallery. (When the SNL exhibit closed in the spring of 2019 and the MBC sold the third and fourth floors of its building, the NRHOF gallery was partially restored on the second floor.) The NRHOF has been affiliated with the MBC since 1991. (The museum was also home to the American Advertising Federation's Advertising Hall of Fame from 1992 to 2000.)

The snake-in-the-box problem in graph theory and computer science deals with finding a certain kind of path along the edges of a hypercube. This path starts at one corner and travels along the edges to as many corners as it can reach. After it gets to a new corner, the previous corner and all of its neighbors must be marked as unusable. The path should never travel to a corner which has been marked unusable. In other words, a snake is a connected open path in the hypercube where each node connected with path, with the exception of the head (start) and the tail (finish), it has exactly two neighbors that are also in the snake. The head and the tail each have only one neighbor in the snake. The rule for generating a snake is that a node in the hypercube may be visited if it is connected to the current node and it is not a neighbor of any previously visited node in the snake, other than the current node. In graph theory terminology, this is called finding the longest possible induced path in a hypercube; it can be viewed as a special case of the induced subgraph isomorphism problem. There is a similar problem of finding long induced cycles in hypercubes, called the coil-in-the-box problem. The snake-in-the-box problem was first described by , motivated by the theory of error-correcting codes. The vertices of a solution to the snake or coil in the box problems can be used as a Gray code that can detect single-bit errors. Such codes have applications in electrical engineering, coding theory, and computer network topologies. In these applications, it is important to devise as long a code as is possible for a given dimension of hypercube. The longer the code, the more effective are its capabilities. Finding the longest snake or coil becomes notoriously difficult as the dimension number increases and the search space suffers a serious combinatorial explosion. Some techniques for determining the upper and lower bounds for the snake-in-the-box problem include proofs using discrete mathematics and graph theory, exhaustive search of the search space, and heuristic search utilizing evolutionary techniques.  Known lengths and bounds  The maximum length for the snake-in-the-box problem is known for dimensions one through eight; it is :1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 26, 50, 98 . Beyond that length, the exact length of the longest snake is not known; the best lengths found so far for dimensions nine through thirteen are :190, 370, 712, 1373, 2687. For cycles (the coil-in-the-box problem), a cycle cannot exist in a hypercube of dimension less than two. The maximum lengths of the longest possible cycles are :0, 4, 6, 8, 14, 26, 48, 96 . Beyond that length, the exact length of the longest cycle is not known; the best lengths found so far for dimensions nine through thirteen are :188, 366, 692, 1344, 2594. Doubled coils are a special case: cycles whose second half repeats the structure of their first half, also known as symmetric coils. For dimensions two through seven the lengths of the longest possible doubled coils are :4, 6, 8, 14, 26, 46. Beyond that, the best lengths found so far for dimensions eight through thirteen are :94, 186, 362, 662, 1222, 2354. For both the snake and the coil in the box problems, it is known that the maximum length is proportional to 2n for an n-dimensional box, asymptotically as n grows large, and bounded above by 2n ‚àí 1. However the constant of proportionality is not known, but is observed to be in the range 0.3 - 0.4 for current best known values.For asymptotic lower bounds, see , , and .

Publication history The original incarnation (John Watkins) first appeared in Daring Mystery Comics (Jan 1942), during the Golden Age of Comic Books. However, the identity was revived in the modern day via Thunderbolts. The various incarnations have usually been affiliated with the V-Battalion organization. The \\"V\\" in the character's and group's name is the letter \\"V\\" - as opposed to the Roman numeral 5 - and is derived from the World War II-era slogan \\"V for Victory\\". Fictional character biography =John Watkins= The original version of Citizen V was John Watkins, an Englishman who assisted the resistance in Nazi- occupied France.Daring Mystery Comics #8 He led a group of freedom fighters called the V-Battalion. He was killed in action by Heinrich Zemo,Thunderbolts: Distant Rumblings #1 and other individuals eventually took up the Citizen V identity.Citizen V and the V-Battalion - The Everlasting #1 =Paulette Brazee= The second version of Citizen V was Paulette Brazee (also known as the She-Wolf), the French lover of John Watkins and mother of JJ Watkins. During the war, she was a spy sent to romance Baron Zemo. Paulette betrayed Zemo and eventually discovered she was pregnant. When John and the majority of the V-Battalion were slaughtered by Zemo, the remaining survivors had Paulette smuggled to England. There Paulette met a red-headed soldierwhom she married. After the V-Battalion was reconstituted in 1951, Paulette was given the Citizen V role. The V-Battalion began hunting down Nazi war criminals and was allowed to place their secret headquarters Castle Masada in Symkaria. In 1953, Paulette was sent on a mission to Argentina to find Nazi scientist Johann Weimer and bring the scientist to the V-Battalion so they could use the Nazi's skills for them. Weimer was murdered by one of the Everlasting, a group of gods who had frequent run-ins with the V-Battalion.Citizen V and the V-Battalion - The Everlasting #1 =John Watkins Jr.= The third version of Citizen V is John \\"JJ\\" Watkins Jr., the alleged son of John Watkins Sr. and Paulette BrazeeCaptain America/Citizen V 1998 Annual (although an affair between Paulette and Baron Zemo had been implied). In 1953, he was nine years old so he was presumably born in 1944. Since his father died before he was born and his mother was often away on missions as Citizen V during his childhood, JJ was primarily raised by nannies employed by the V-Battalion. In 1971, JJ asked the Shadow King for help in researching the Everlasting. JJ died when his own son was two years old.Citizen V and the V-Battalion - The Everlasting #1 =Helmut Zemo= Helmut Zemo as Citizen V. Art by Mark Bagley The supervillain Helmut Zemo took the Citizen V name for his imposture as a superhero when various superheroes were thought to be killed. Claiming to be John Watkins' grandson, Helmut took the name as an ironic taunt, due to the fact that his father had murdered the original war hero. Helmut assembled a group of villains and changed their costumes and codenames to pretend to be a new superhero team. Helmut's leadership and fighting abilities allowed him to successfully pose as Citizen V. Eventually, Helmut revealed himself as a villain and was defeated by the Avengers, the Fantastic Four and the Thunderbolts that turned against him. This marked the end of Helmut's Citizen V tenure and he went back to using the Baron Zemo title. Helmut would eventually come into conflict with a subsequent Citizen V (Dallas Riordan). Eventually, Zemo had the opportunity to play Citizen V for a second time: Helmut gets beheaded after a battle with Scourge (a.k.a. Nomad), and his mind was ironically arranged to end up in the comatose body of John Watkins III. Helmut took back the Citizen V identity, and due to a deal worked out between the V-Battalion and the CSA he began recruiting members for the Redeemers. As Citizen V, he soon discovered that Baron Strucker was the mastermind that manipulated Henry Peter Gyrich into sending Scourge; Helmut got his revenge by chopping off Strucker's hand. Helmut returned to the Redeemers, but they were soon wiped out by Graviton. Helmut escaped the battle, but perhaps due to Watkins's influence, he came back to fight Graviton with the re-assembled Thunderbolts. The battle ended with the Thunderbolts being sent to Counter- Earth. The V-Battalion had tried to teleport Citizen V away and were successful but due to a fluke, Helmut's mind was not transported with Watkins's body and Helmut found himself trapped in the Fixer's tech-pack (later, he had the Fixer place his mind into his Counter-Earth counterpart's body).Thunderbolts #1 =Dallas Riordan= Dallas Riordan was the Thunderbolts' liaison to the Office of the Mayor of New York.Thunderbolts #1 The Mayor of New York had wanted to capitalize on the Thunderbolts' popularity after the Avengers and Fantastic Four were presumed deceased during a fight with Onslaught. When the Thunderbolts were revealed as villains, Dallas was devastated and fired by the Mayor of New York, but was soon offered a job with the V-Battalion by Roger Aubrey. Vengeful for what the Thunderbolts did to her, she agreed to become Citizen V and soon confronted Helmut Zemo in Mexico and later in South America alongside Captain America. Initially, Dallas wore a padded uniform identical to Helmut's purple-tinged Citizen V costume, and appeared to be male. After Captain America deduced her true gender from the way she moved in combat, Dallas stopped disguising her gender and donned a new uniform with the blue tint. Dallas soon went after the Thunderbolts and encountered Hawkeye. Too busy trying to deal with the Crimson Cowl's weather machine, Hawkeye refused to deal with Dallas. Shamed by Hawkeye, Dallas decided to help stop the Crimson Cowl's weather machine, but was knocked unconscious when she tried to do so. When the Crimson Cowl was defeated, she teleported away and teleported Dallas into her costume. Dallas went to jail for the Crimson Cowl's crimes and was far too bitter to admit the truth to the Thunderbolts. Dallas was rescued from jail by the V-Battalion. When she tried to track down the Crimson Cowl, she instead ran afoul of the Imperial Forces of America (a group which, unknown to her, was funded by Helmut Zemo). Dallas parted ways with the V-Battalion when she was ordered to assassinate Henry Peter Gyrich, a victim of the mind-controlling nanite conspiracy orchestrated by Baron Strucker. Dallas went to the Thunderbolts for help, but was abducted by the Crimson Cowl. The two fought a long battle and Dallas was left paralyzed after falling off a bridge. Dallas's paternal grandfather was a member of the V-Battalion and stayed in Europe after WWII and died on a mission for the V-Battalion. This is why Dallas was selected to be Citizen V.Thunderbolts #42 =John Watkins III= John Watkins III was raised to be a version of Citizen V. He presumably served as a field agent for the V-Battalion before he actually took the Citizen V title and was left comatose for five years. When Helmut Zemo's mind was placed in his body, John was remarkably healthy for someone who had been in a bed for five years. When Helmut was no longer in his body, John decided to change costumes and stayed on as Citizen V. He soon found himself fighting the Everlasting. He installed ULTIMATUM as the leader of the country Rumekistan, a decision which later came back to haunt him. Under the holographic guise of Nenad Petrovic, Watkins orchestrated events to make Cable as Rumekistan's leader. There is a mention in Citizen V (vol. 2) that John Watkins III is the seventh version of Citizen V. =Roberto da Costa= Roberto da Costa began to lead the U.S.Avengers under the Citizen V alias.U.S.Avengers #1 Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Citizen V (John Watkins) is depicted as a normal GI in a special uniform. The American soldier rallies his men in the face of a Japanese onslaught in 1942. However, he is shot and killed with his blood staining the American flag. A photograph of this image is released around the world to which President Franklin Roosevelt demands a true super- soldier rather than a normal one in a special uniform.Ultimate Origins #1 (June 2008) References External links Citizen V (John Watkins) at Marvel.com * Citizen V (John Watkins) at Marvel Wiki * Citizen V (John Watkins) at Comic Vine * Citizen V (Paulette Brazee) at Marvel.com * Citizen V (Paulette Brazee) at Marvel Wiki * Citizen V (Paulette Brazee) at Comic Vine * Citizen V (John Watkins Jr.) at Marvel.com * Citizen V (John Watkins Jr.) at Marvel Wiki * Citizen V (John Watkins III) at Marvel.com * Citizen V (John Watkins III) at Marvel Wiki * Citizen V (John Watkins III) at Comic Vine Golden Age superheroes Marvel Comics superheroes Timely Comics characters United States-themed superheroes ","title":"Citizen V"},{"id":"1850065","text":"Juan Maria Antonio Rivera (also spelled Ribera) was an 18th-century Spanish explorer who explored southwestern North America, including parts of Southern Rocky Mountains.

The song was publicized first in the movie, Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955), winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song. From 1967 to 1973, it was used as the theme song to Love is a Many Splendored Thing, the soap opera based on the movie. The song's refrain is based on the aria Un bel d√¨ vedremo from Giacomo Puccini‚Äôs opera, Madama Butterfly. The music was commissioned for the movie Love Is a Many- Splendored Thing and initially included in the film's Oscar-winning score, composed and conducted by Alfred Newman. Lyrics were subsequently added to make it eligible for the Best Original Song category of the Academy Awards. The original lyrics were rejected by the studio so new ones were written. The best-selling version of the song was recorded by The Four Aces backed by the Jack Pleis Orchestra and issued by Decca Records as catalog number 29625. It reached number two in the UK Singles Chart, and number one on both Billboard and Cash Box in 1955. The recording by The Four Aces is featured in the film Cookie (1989). It became a gold record. This song has been a staple of Engelbert Humperdinck's live show since 1995. One of sheet music releases (1955) Other covers A version by Don Cornell was recorded approximately at the same time. It was issued by Coral Records as catalog number 61467. Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1955 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009. The song has also been recorded by Ringo Starr (on his album Sentimental Journey), Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams, Shirley Bassey, Nat King Cole and Barry Manilow. Neil Sedaka recorded the song in Italian as \\"L'Amore E' Una Cosa Meravigliosa\\". Connie Francis recorded the song in Italian in 1960 during the work for her album More Italian Favorites, although this version remains unreleased to this day. Francis also recorded the original English lyrics in 1961 for her album Connie Francis Sings 'Never on Sunday' and Other Title Songs from Motion Pictures. The instrumental playback of this 1961 recording was also used when Francis cut a German-language version, \\"Sag, wei√üt du denn, was Liebe ist\\", in 1966. The song was about that time also performed by Fairuz in Arabian language (\\"Zar Bisukun Al Lail\\"). A Disco version was recorded by Tina Charles in 1980. Jeff Lynne recorded his version for his nostalgic cover album Long Wave in 2012. In popular culture This song can be heard in the movies Grease, Private Parts, St. Trinian's, St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold, and The Nutty Professor 2. The song, among others, was referenced in Moulin Rouge! when Christian says, \\"Love is like oxygen - love is a many splendored thing - love lifts us up where we belong! All you need is love!.\\" It has been also heard in the series Bones, in the 14th episode of the third season sung by Dr. Zack Addy (Eric Millegan).

In the past he has served as Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, a parliamentary aide to the former Welsh Secretary David Jones, as well as serving as a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and as Special Advisor to Prime Minister David Cameron on Central and Eastern Europe and on Central and Eastern Europeans living in the United Kingdom. Early life and education Kawczynski was born on 24 January 1972 in Warsaw. His parents were Leonard and Halina Kawczynski. He came to Britain with his mother at the age of six. He was educated at St George's College, Weybridge, an independent Roman Catholic school in Surrey, followed by Birmingham Polytechnic and then the University of Stirling where he studied business studies and French, graduating in 1994.Which Tory went where?, The Guardian, 1 Jun 2007 He served as president of the university's Conservative Association in 1991. He worked in the business entertainment industry before he became an international account manager in the telecommunications industry, a position he held for ten years from 1994 to 2004.  Parliamentary career  Kawczynski unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative Party candidate in the 2001 general election for Ealing Southall in London, coming second with 18% of the vote. At the following general election Kawczynski was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency. He was elected at the 2005 general election, succeeding the Labour MP Paul Marsden with 37.7% of the vote. Upon entering Parliament he established the All Party Parliamentary Group for milk farmers to help milk farmers in his constituency. He sat as a member of both the International Development Select Committee and the Justice Select Committee, but was criticised by the Birmingham Post in 2009 for failing to regularly attend the meetings of the Select Committees to which he had been appointed. Kawczynski was recorded as having attended only 12.5% of all Justice Select Committee meetings and 31.3% of International Development Select Committee meetings during the previous last Parliamentary session. He stated the figure for the international development committee was wrong and he had been unable to attend the justice committee meetings because they clashed. In 2007, he signed an Early Day Motion that welcomed the \\"positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the NHS homeopathic hospitals\\". In May 2008, he voted to lower the abortion time limit to 12 weeks, and has said that he believes an abortion limit of 24 weeks is incompatible with the kind of \\"Christian society\\" he wishes to live in. He voted against a House of Lords amendment to abolish the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel under common law. In October 2009, Kawczynski appeared on The Doha Debates as a delegate supporting the motion of \\"This house deplores the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al- Megrahi\\".Walker, Tim (19 May 2009). \\"Daniel Kawczynski enters the den of very mad dog\\". The Daily Telegraph. In the wake of the Westminster Parliamentary Expenses scandal in 2009, Kawczynski was ordered to repay ¬£4000 for rent costs that he had over-claimed. In 2010, Kawczynski called for the ban on fox hunting to be repealed by the Conservative government. He was re-elected at the 2010 general election with 43.9% of the vote. In September 2012, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the new Secretary of State for Wales, David Jones. When Jones lost his role in 2014, Kawczynski became advisor to the Prime Minister David Cameron on Eastern and Central European Diaspora. Kawczynski voted in favour of same sex marriage in 2013, revealing shortly afterwards that he was in a same-sex relationship. Kawczynski was chair of the All-Party Group for Saudi Arabia between 2011 and 2016, during his time as chairman he led delegations to the country.Kawczynski updated this on Newsnight 11/9/15 stating that Yasmin Qureshi was the current chair of the All-Party Group for Saudi Arabia he was chair of the All-Party Group for Libya but that group has now ceased to exist. In October 2013, Kawczynski received widespread press attention for berating a one-legged wheelchair user for begging outside the Houses of Parliament.\\"Tory MP tells one legged-beggar to get a job\\". The Daily Telegraph. 21 October 2013.\\"Tory MP tells one legged- beggar to get a job\\". The Independent. 21 October 2013.\\"Tory MP tells one legged-beggar to get a job\\". The Huffington Post. 21 October 2013. Kawczynski held his seat in the 2015 general election. In the 2016 Conservative Party leadership election, he supported Michael Gove. He was re-elected in the 2017 general election. It was reported in early November 2017 that Kawczynski had been reprimanded in front of witnesses by Eleanor Laing, Conservative MP and the deputy speaker, for asking a young researcher employed by Laing to go on a date with a rich businessman contact of his who was \\"older than her father\\". The incident in January 2013, according to Channel 4 News in November 2017, was preceded by an intermediary making the same approach several times. Laura Hughes, writing for The Daily Telegraph, reported that Kawczynski has been referred to the Conservative's new disciplinary committee. He has admitted to the incident, but rejects the accusation of inappropriate conduct. Kawczynski expressed support for a prospective leadership bid by Jacob Rees-Mogg in 2018. In 2020, he was reprimanded for sharing a platform with right-wing populist politicians such as Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban and the former deputy prime minister of Italy Matteo Salvini, at a conference organised by the Edmund Burke Foundation. He faced calls to be suspended from Parliament. He was eventually given a formal warning by the Conservative Party, but did not have the whip withdrawn. From February 2018, Kawczynski was paid ¬£6,000 per month by the Electrum Group, a New York City-based investment, advisory and asset management firm owned by Thomas Kaplan. Kawczynski defended his association with the American company by saying that work for them would be done in his spare time. On 2 February 2019, Kawczynski was criticised for tweeting that the UK had received no Marshall Plan aid after World War II, in the context of a complaint about the alleged attitude of the European Union. He said, \\"Britain helped to liberate half of Europe. She mortgaged herself up to eye balls in process. No Marshall Plan for us only for Germany. We gave up war reparations in 1990. We put ¬£370 billion into EU since we joined. Watch the way ungrateful EU treats us now. We will remember.\\" In fact, the United Kingdom received the most Marshall Plan funding of any country in Europe, receiving $2.7 billion in aid. Germany received $1.7 billion. After challenges, Kawczynski did not delete the tweet nor retract it.  Political views  =Saudi Arabia= In 2015, Kawczynski was described as a strong supporter of the Saudi Arabian government. On one of his trips to Saudi Arabia, Kawczynski told Salman Al Saud how proud he was of the military cooperation between the two countries. He later said that he was writing \\"the most pro-Saudi book ever written by a British politician\\" and that he had been \\"battling against extraordinary ignorance and prejudice against Saudi Arabia for many years\\". Following an appearance on Newsnight in which he defended the Saudi regime's approach to the war in Yemen and accused the programme of bias, Kawczynski threatened legal action after its editor Ian Katz suggested his strength of feeling on the issue might be linked to the size of the budget for his expenses on trips to Saudi Arabia. After Michael Gove cancelled a prison contract with Saudi Arabia, Kawczynski was so enraged that he slapped his forehead and shouted \\"no!\\" during a parliamentary debate on the issue. =Anglo-Polish relations= Since becoming the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Poland in 2014, Kawczynski has supported a range of enterprises from his constituency in seeking business partners and export markets in Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries, offering support and advice. Kawczynski has been a frequent visitor to the British Polish Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw where he often described the importance of trade between Poland and the United Kingdom. In 2016, Kawczynski was distinguished as an \\"Outstanding Pole Abroad of 2016\\" for his efforts in promoting trade and political relations between the United Kingdom and his country of birth. In 2017, Kawczynski joined calls for Germany to pay war reparations for crimes committed against the Allies and for the destruction of Poland during the Second World War. On 15 October 2017, Kawczynski sent a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel urging her to stop demanding money from the UK during the Brexit negotiations and pay Poland. In 2019, Kawczynski said he had asked the Polish Government to veto any requests for an extension of the Article 50 period that might be made by the UK Government. =European Union= Kawczynski is a vocal supporter of Brexit and former member of the European Research Group (the ERG), which he left in April 2019. In September 2018, Kawczynski, who strongly supports Brexit, said on Twitter that EU lemon growers are inefficient, and that the EU imposed tariffs on the import of fruit from non-EU Mediterranean countries, causing higher prices to consumers. Both claims were refuted. Personal life In 2000, Kawczynski married Kate Lumb and they had a daughter; the couple divorced in 2011. In June 2013, he announced to his Conservative Association that his new partner was male.Eden, Richard (30 June 2013). \\"Divorced Conservative MP: 'I've fallen in love with a man'\\". The Telegraph. He was the second MP in Britain to come out as bisexual, the first being Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes.

These conditions are characterized by a small body, short limbs, and other skeletal abnormalities. As a result of their serious health problems, infants with achondrogenesis are usually born prematurely, are stillborn, or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. Some infants, however, have lived for a while with intensive medical support. Researchers have described at least three forms of achondrogenesis, designated as Achondrogenesis type 1A, achondrogenesis type 1B and achondrogenesis type 2. These types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, inheritance pattern, and genetic cause. Other types of achondrogenesis may exist, but they have not been characterized or their cause is unknown. Achondrogenesis type 1A is caused by a defect in the microtubules of the Golgi apparatus. In mice, a nonsense mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11 gene (Trip11), which encodes the Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP-210), resulted in defects similar to the human disease. When their DNA was sequenced, human patients with achondrogenesis type 1A also had loss-of-function mutations in GMAP-210. GMAP-210 moves proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Because of the defect, GMAP-210 is not able to move the proteins, and they remain in the endoplasmic reticulum, which swells up. The loss of Golgi apparatus function affects some cells, such as those responsible for forming bone and cartilage, more than others.Lethal skeletal dysplasia in mice and humans lacking the GolginGMAP-210, Patrick Smits et al., N Engl J Med, 362:206, Jan. 21, 2010 Achondrogenesis type 1B is caused by a similar mutation in SLC26A2, which encodes a sulfate transporter. Achondrogenesis, type 2 is one of several skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene. Achondrogenesis, type 2 and hypochondrogenesis (a similar skeletal disorder) together affect 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 births.

Its name is derived from the type locality in Essex County, Massachusetts, in the United States. Modern petrology identifies rocks according to mineralogical criteria. Utilising the IUGS QAPF diagram of Streckeisen (1974) \\"essexite\\" is more formally known as nepheline monzodiorite or nepheline monzogabbro depending on the ratio of orthoclase to plagioclase and the abundance of nepheline. Craigleith, an island in Scotland, composed of essexite  Petrology  In order to produce a magma composition suitable for forming essexite the partial melting of the source rocks must be restricted, generally to less than 10% partial melting. This favors producing a melt rich in large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) such as K, Ba, Rb, Cs, Sr. The source melts of essexites contain more aluminium and alkali ions than available silica tetrahedra, which is why essexites crystallise nepheline instead of plagioclase. Higher than normal potassium favors the production of orthoclase, which is usually absent from most mafic igneous rocks.  Mineralogy  Essexite can be considered as an alkali gabbro or monzodiorite primarily composed of nepheline, plagioclase, with lesser amounts of alkali feldspar, with mafic minerals composed of any of the following; titanium augite (pyroxene), hornblende and biotite. Trace mineralogy may include magnetite, ilmenite and accessory olivine (<5%). Essexite grades into a nepheline monzogabbro with a decrease in potassium feldspar and an increase in the feldspathoid minerals.  Geochemistry  Essexite is an alkaline igneous rock equivalent to an alkaline basalt. The presence of nepheline, a feldspathoid mineral, indicates that essexites are silica undersaturated. The presence of orthoclase indicates that it contains sufficient potassium to favor production of orthoclase over microcline or potassic oligoclase. Essexites are generally rich in aluminium, alkalis (sodium and calcium), potassium (>3% K2O), LILE-enriched (strontium, caesium and barium), as compared to tholeiitic basalts and gabbros.

It was based on a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, running at 4 MHz, provided up to 256 KB of RAM organized in four switchable banks, and included a separate graphics processor chip (¬µPD7220) manufactured by NEC to provide advanced graphics capabilities. In the USA and Canada, two versions were launched; a basic CP/M configuration with 64 KB RAM and the HASCI configuration with 256 KB RAM and the special HASCI keyboard to be used with the bundled application suite, called Valdocs. The European and Japanese versions were like the CP/M configurations. TPM-III was used for Valdocs and some copy protected programs like Logo Professor. The machine had internal extension slots, which could be used for extra serial ports, network cards or third party extensions like an Intel 8088 processor, adding MS-DOS compatibility. Rising Star Industries was the primary American software vendor for the HASCI QX series. Their product line included the TPM- II and III operating system, Valdocs, a robust Basic language implementation, a graphics API library used by a variety of products which initially supported line drawing and fill functions and was later extended to support the QX-16 color boards, Z80 assembler, and low level Zapple machine code monitor which could be invoked from dip switch setting on the rear of the machine.  QX-11  The \\"Abacus\\" boots MS-DOS 2.11 from 64 KB ROM and has 3¬Ω\\" floppy drives. The sound chip and the joystick ports are more like a gamer's machine.  QX-16  Its successor, the dual-processor QX-16, added a 16-bit Intel processor with Color Graphics Adapter enabling it to also boot MS-DOS 2.11. The case of the QX-16 was enlarged to provide enough physical space for an internal hard-drive in contrast to the QX-10's dual-floppy configuration.  Valdocs  An Epson QX-16 booting Valdocs VALuable DOCumentS by Rising Star Industries is a pseudo-GUI WYSIWYG integrated software/OS for document creation and management, written as a set of interactive application and system modules which ran only on Epson's QX-10 and QX-16 computers. A version designed to run on the IBM PC was in development when Rising Star closed in 1986. Valdocs shipped to beta testers c. late 1982. Beta and initial production releases of Valdocs' application modules were written in the Forth programming language while its system-oriented modules (such as E-Mail and disk utilities) were written in Z-80 Assembly Language. Later releases of Valdocs' applications were written in the C programming language with some modules written in compiled RSI Basic. Valdocs specific keyboard on an Epson QX-16 The initial release of Valdocs included WYSIWYG word processor and spreadsheet applications (with onscreen fonts, an UNDO key, keyboard macros and multiple screen formats), a cardfile database, an E-Mail/communications module, and a desktop manager with an address book, mailing list manager, notepad, spell checker, ValDraw & ValPaint, calculator and more. The E-Mail program worked in the background allowing mail to be sent by modem to another computer. Valdocs was one of the first environments that allowed users to embed items like spreadsheets and figures in word processing documents. Chris Rutkowski and Roger Amidon worked on the preliminary QX-10 design; Amidon continued designing software for the QX system after Epson and Rising Star Inc. stopped production. Graphic and other software for the QX-10 and QX-16 were developed by program designers such as Dan Oja and Nelson Donley.Inside Track, By John C. Dvorack, Page 80, InfoWorld, 29 Oct 1984, ...from his days at the defunct S-100 firm Technical Design Labs: Roger Amidon and ... Amidon apparently had much to do with the QX-10's hardware design... Switching between programs was done by pressing an associated hotkey on the QX-10's keyboard (which was specifically designed to support Valdocs, including an UNDO key) or by selecting a program from a menu the hotkey invoked. The keyboard was referred to as HASCI (Human Application Standard Computer Interface) after the user interface with the same name pioneered by Rising Star Industries. =Performance and stability issues= Valdocs on the QX-10 was very slow and buggy. InfoWorlds 1983 review of the QX-10 described the software as \\"great idea, questionable implementation\\". It reported that Valdocs on the computer \\"is slow. Sometimes it merely dawdles slightly, but other times, it crawls. Entering text becomes a disconcerting pastime when the screen display lags as many as 60 characters behind your typing, and you lose characters\\". The magazine added that \\"VALDOCS crashed (failed) numerous times while we were using it to write this review. We lost data each time, came close to losing a whole disk, and ended up retyping it into our trusty IBM PC to meet deadline\\". It advised users to backup their files, but stated that since the process was so slow the computer encouraged them to avoid doing so until it was too late. While praising the QX-10 itself (\\"Physically this is an excellent machine\\") and Valdocs' ease of use, Jerry Pournelle wrote in BYTE in August 1983 that \\"the first problem is obvious from the other side of the room. The Valdocs system is slow. It seems to take forever to do disk operations ... Getting from the beginning to the end of a six-page document takes 15 seconds. Deleting the first three pages of the same document takes 20 seconds\\". He believed that the software \\"has pushed the Zilog Z80 chip past its limits ... I don't think Valdocs will ever run properly until something like the 8086 or 68000 is used\\". In January 1984 Pournelle reported that version 1.18 \\"is fast, [but] it's not fast enough for me, my wife, or my assistant. In particular, it is not designed to be used as a substitute for an office machine. It simply takes too darned long to get a business letter out using Valdocs. Just getting the envelope addressed can take a full minute or longer.\\" He reiterated that \\"the hardware is fine\\", but wondered if \\"the industry need yet another Z80 computer for more than $2500\\" without usable software. Pournelle concluded, \\"I cannot in good conscience recommend [Valdocs] to anyone who has actual production work to perform. It's just too darned slow.\\" The president of one QX-10 user group complained in April that the word processor was \\"slow compared to my mother running the mile ... I have four different versions and not one works well\\". Creative Computings mostly favorable review of the computer and software in June also noted the slow speed of the Valdocs editor, calling it \\"maddeningly slow in many cases\\". It noted that the QX-10's 4 MHz processor was not at fault, because other word processors ran as fast as on other 8-bit CP/M computers. Despite Epson's promise of speed improvements, Valdocs 2 remained slow; InfoWorlds 1985 review of the QX-16 reported that the computer was \\"severely limited by [Valdocs'] slow operation\\". While the reviewer did not report crashes, a \\"small but perceptible delay\\" between pushing a key and the character appearing on the screen when using the word processor grew over time to be \\"significant and would annoy heavy-duty word processing users\\", and the spreadsheet was \\"excruciatingly slow to do just about everything\\". Pournelle concluded that year that Valdocs \\"was fatally flawed\\", noting that Epson advised Valdocs 2 users to share data between the chart maker and word processor with \\"scissors, tape, and a copy machine\\".

Although the terms community stability and ecological stability are sometimes used interchangeably, community stability refers only to the characteristics of communities. It is possible for an ecosystem or a community to be stable in some of their properties and unstable in others. For example, a vegetation community in response to a drought might conserve biomass but lose biodiversity. Stable ecological systems abound in nature, and the scientific literature has documented them to a great extent. Scientific studies mainly describe grassland plant communities and microbial communities. Nevertheless, it is important to mention that not every community or ecosystem in nature is stable (for example, wolves and moose on Isle Royale). Also, noise plays an important role on biological systems and, in some scenarios, it can fully determine their temporal dynamics. The concept of ecological stability emerged in the first half of the 20th century. With the advancement of theoretical ecology in the 1970s, the usage of the term has expanded to a wide variety of scenarios. This overuse of the term has led to controversy over its definition and implementation. In 1997, Grimm and Wissel made an inventory of 167 definitions used in the literature and found 70 different stability concepts. One of the strategies that these two authors proposed to clarify the subject is to replace ecological stability with more specific terms, such as constancy, resilience and persistence. In order to fully describe and put meaning to a specific kind of stability, it must be looked at more carefully. Otherwise the statements made about stability will have little to no reliability because they would not have information to back up the claim. Following this strategy, an ecosystem which oscillates cyclically around a fixed point, such as the one delineated by the predator- prey equations, would be described as persistent and resilient, but not as constant. Some authors, however, see good reason for the abundance of definitions, because they reflect the extensive variety of real and mathematical systems.  Stability analysis  When the species abundances of an ecological system are treated with a set of differential equations, it is possible to test for stability by linearizing the system at the equilibrium point. Robert May developed this stability analysis in the 1970s which uses the Jacobian matrix.  Types  Although the characteristics of any ecological system are susceptible to changes, during a defined period of time, some remain constant, oscillate, reach a fixed point or present other type of behavior that can be described as stable. This multitude of trends can be labeled by different types of ecological stability. = Dynamical stability = Dynamical stability refers to stability across time.  Stationary, stable, transient, and cyclic points  A stable point is such that a small perturbation of the system will be diminished and the system will come back to the original point. On the other hand, if a small perturbation is magnified, the stationary point is considered unstable.  Local and global stability  Local stability indicates that a system is stable over small short-lived disturbances, while global stability indicates a system highly resistant to change in species composition and/or food web dynamics.  Constancy  Observational studies of ecosystems use constancy to describe living systems that can remain unchanged. =Resistance and inertia (persistence)= Resistance and inertia deal with a system's inherent response to some perturbation. A perturbation is any externally imposed change in conditions, usually happening in a short time period. Resistance is a measure of how little the variable of interest changes in response to external pressures. Inertia (or persistence) implies that the living system is able to resist external fluctuations. In the context of changing ecosystems in post-glacial North America, E.C. Pielou remarked at the outset of her overview, > \\"It obviously takes considerable time for mature vegetation to become > established on newly exposed ice scoured rocks or glacial till...it also > takes considerable time for whole ecosystems to change, with their numerous > interdependent plant species, the habitats these create, and the animals > that live in the habitats. Therefore, climatically caused fluctuations in > ecological communities are a damped, smoothed-out version of the climatic > fluctuations that cause them.\\"Pielou, After the Ice Age: The Return of Life > to Glaciated North America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 1991:13 =Resilience, elasticity and amplitude= Resilience is the tendency of a system to retain its functional and organizational structure and the ability to recover after a perturbation or disturbance. Resilience also expresses the need for persistence although from a management approach it is expressed to have a broad range of choices and events are to be looked at as uniformly distributed. Elasticity and amplitude are measures of resilience. Elasticity is the speed with which a system returns to its original / previous state. Amplitude is a measure of how far a system can be moved from the previous state and still return. Ecology borrows the idea of neighborhood stability and a domain of attraction from dynamical systems theory.  Lyapunov stability  Researchers applying mathematical models from system dynamics usually use Lyapunov stability.(Published version of above paper)  Numerical stability  Focusing on the biotic components of an ecosystem, a population or a community possesses numerical stability if the number of individuals is constant or resilient.  Sign stability  It is possible to determine if a system is stable just by looking at the signs in the interaction matrix.  Stability and diversity  The relation between diversity and stability has been widely studied. Diversity can operate to enhance the stability of ecosystem functions at various ecological scales. For example, genetic diversity can enhance resistance to environmental perturbations. At the community level, the structure of food webs can affect stability. The effect of diversity on stability in food-web models can be either positive or negative, depending on the trophic coherence of the network. At the level of landscapes, environmental heterogeneity across locations has been shown to increase the stability of ecosystem functions  History of the concept  The term 'oekology' was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. Ecology as a science was developed further during the late 19th and the early 20th century, and increasing attention was directed toward the connection between diversity and stability. Frederic Clements and Henry Gleason contributed knowledge of community structure; among other things, these two scientists introduced the opposing ideas that a community can either reach a stable climax or that it is largely coincidental and variable. Charles Elton argued in 1958 that complex, diverse communities tended to be more stable. Robert MacArthur proposed a mathematical description of stability in the number of individuals in a food web in 1955. After much progress made with experimental studies in the 60's, Robert May advanced the field of theoretical ecology and refuted the idea that diversity begets stability. Many definitions of ecological stability have emerged in the last decades while the concept continues to gain attention.

The hearings were arranged by the Board of Education with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the Teach the Controversy method. The hearings raised the issues of creation and evolution in public education and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities. The Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board. Local science advocacy group Kansas Citizens for Science organized a boycott of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings.Wichita Eagle, \\"Scientists Right to Boycott Evolution Hearings,\\" March 30, 2005; \\"Evolution Hearings Rejected by Scientists,\\" April 12, 2005. Kansas Board of Education member Kathy Martin declared at the beginning of the hearings, \\"Evolution has been proven false. ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts.\\" At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is \\"an unproven, often disproven\\" theory. \\"ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic,\\" asserted Martin. The scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the United States National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying \\"Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.\\" (See also List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design) On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. Background The hearings were one of a number of Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns that sought to establish new science education standards consistent with conservative Christian beliefs, both in the state and nationwide, and reverse what they saw as a domination in science education by actual science, specifically the scientific theory of evolution, which they viewed as atheistic, in direct conflict to their religious beliefs. Kansas Board of Education elections in 2004 gave religious conservatives a 6-4 majority. In 2005, prompted by the Kansas Intelligent Design Network and the Discovery Institute, the board sought new high school science standards. The revisions did not entirely eliminate evolution from instruction, but presented it as a theory greatly challenged and disputed, in line with the Discovery Institute's Teach the Controversy campaign. The new standards presented intelligent design as an alternative to evolution through the Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution. Board member Connie Morris sent a taxpayer-funded newsletter to constituents calling evolution an \\"age-old fairy tale\\" that was defended with \\"anti-God contempt and arrogance.\\" Describing herself as a Christian who believes in a literal interpretation of Genesis, Morris wrote that evolution was \\"biologically, genetically, mathematically, chemically, metaphysically and etc. wildly and utterly impossible.\\"David Klepper, \\"Kansas School Board's Hearings on Evolution End in Acrimony,\\" Knight Ridder Newspapers, May 12, 2005. The Intelligent Design Network originally proposed over 20 pages of revisions to the science standards. Their proposals were rejected by the science standards committee (made up of Kansas scientists and educators) appointed by the Board of Education, and were also rejected by 12 independent scientists who reviewed the proposed revisions. Each side was invited to provide witnesses to testify before the board for intelligent design or evolution, with the taxpayers of Kansas covering the travel expenses. The scientific community refused to participate en masse. The pro-intelligent design group, the Intelligent Design Network, invited 22 witnesses. Among these were a number of non-scientists, and a number of scientists with no professional experience in biology. New science standards On November 8, 2005 the Kansas Board of Education approved the following changes to its science standards: # Add to the mission statement a goal that science education should seek to help students make \\"informed\\" decisions. #Provide a definition of science that is not strictly limited to natural explanations. We also emphasize that the Science Curriculum Standards do not include Intelligent Design, the scientific disagreement with the claim of many evolutionary biologists that the apparent design of living systems is an illusion. While the testimony presented at the science hearings included many advocates of Intelligent Design, these standards neither mandate nor prohibit teaching about this scientific disagreement. # Allow intelligent design to be presented as an alternative explanation to evolution as presented in mainstream biology textbooks, without endorsing it. # State that evolution is a theory and not a fact. # Require informing students of purported scientific controversies regarding evolution. =Opposition to new standards= In addition to the over 70 scientific societies, institutions and other scientific professional groups that have issued statements supporting evolution education and opposing intelligent design, the Kansas Board of Education was presented a letter from 38 Nobel laureates, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Nobel Laureates Initiative, calling upon the Board of Education to reject intelligent design and support the teaching of evolution. It stated: > Logically derived from confirmable evidence, evolution is understood to be > the result of an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural > selection. As the foundation of modern biology, its indispensable role has > been further strengthened by the capacity to study DNA. In contrast, > intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as > scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the > intervention of a supernatural agent. The Discovery Institute has consistently insisted that its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan is not another attempt to open the door of public high school science classrooms for intelligent design, and hence supernatural explanations. Discovery Institute spokesman Casey Luskin in February 2006 coined the term \\"false fear syndrome\\" of those who said it was, and said: > This is simply another instance of Darwinists attempting to oppose critical > analysis of evolution by pretending that it is equivalent to teaching > intelligent design. This is a political tactic based upon misinformation, > misrepresentation, emotions, and false fears. In response, Nick Matzke says that it has proved that Critical Analysis of Evolution is a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label. The Kansas science standards as proposed by the Discovery Institute and adopted by the state were said to be \\"ID in disguise\\" by an assistant of a Discovery Institute Fellow, confirming the criticisms of opponents to the standards. In discussing Discovery Institute radio commercials supporting their campaign airing in Kansas on the blog of William A. Dembski, Dembski's research assistant and co-moderator of the site, Joel Borofsky, said: To the statement that the Kansas science standards had nothing to do with intelligent design but were only about teaching evolution in a \\"balanced\\" way, Borofsky responded: > It really is ID in disguise. The entire purpose behind all of this is to > shift it into schools ... at least that is the hope/fear among some science > teachers in the area. The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in > Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an > alternative to Darwinism.

Dembski's research assistant issued a clarification, stating that he was only voicing his personal opinion, not that of others in the movement, and that he is Dembski's \\"assistant on theological work, not necessarily the ID movement.\\" The Discovery Institute continues to deny allegations that its true agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when ABC News asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying \\"I don't think we want to go down that path.\\" Both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Teachers Association spoke out against the new science standards; in addition to separate statements from each opposing the standards, the two groups issued a joint statement that the new Kansas standards are improved, but as currently written, they overemphasize controversy in the theory of evolution and distort the definition of science. The National Academy of Sciences and National Science Teachers Association offered to work with the board to resolve these issues so the state standards could use text from the National Research Council's National Science Education Standards and National Science Teachers Association's Pathways to Science Standards, though they ultimately declined to grant use of the text due to Kansas State Board of Education members insisting on language \\"emphasizing controversy in the theory of evolution\\" and \\"distorting the definition of science.\\" The position of the scientific community is that there is no controversy to teach, that evolution is widely accepted within the scientific community as a valid, well-supported theory and that such disagreements that do exist are about the details of evolution's mechanisms, not the validity of evolution itself. For example, the National Association of Biology Teachers in a statement endorsing evolution as noncontroversial quoted Theodosius Dobzhansky \\"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\\" and went on to state that the quote \\"accurately reflects the central, unifying role of evolution in biology. The theory of evolution provides a framework that explains both the history of life and the ongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and changes.\\" They emphasized that \\"Scientists have firmly established evolution as an important natural process\\" and that \\"The selection of topics covered in a biology curriculum should accurately reflect the principles of biological science. Teaching biology in an effective and scientifically honest manner requires that evolution be taught in a standards-based instructional framework with effective classroom discussions and laboratory experiences.\\" =Support for new standards= The hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture, played a central role in bringing about the Kansas evolution hearings, first by supporting ID proponents in their bids for seats on the board, and later in aggressively lobbying for a \\"Teach the Controversy\\" solution. Teach the Controversy is a controversial political-action campaign originating from the Discovery Institute that seeks to advance an education policy for US public schools that introduces intelligent design to public school science curricula and seeks to redefine science to allow for supernatural explanations by eliminating \\"methodological naturalism\\" from science and replacing it with \\"theistic realism\\". Teach the Controversy proponents portray evolution as a \\"theory in crisis.\\" As well as proposing its own draft science standards to the Kansas State Board of Education and Critical Analysis of Evolution high school lesson plan, the Discovery Institute participated in presenting a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education from Institute associate, Dr. Philip S. Skell. A notable intelligent design proponent, Dr. Skell's letter to the board touts the alleged benefits of the Teach the Controversy approach, as well his credentials as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, despite the fact the National Academy of Sciences issued a policy statement against the Teach the Controversy solution and intelligent design as a concept. Two intelligent design proponents, John H. Calvert, a lawyer and a Managing Director of Intelligent Design Network, Inc., and William S. Harris, Ph.D., co-author with Calvert of Intelligent Design: The Scientific Alternative to Evolution (National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly, Autumn 2003) were instrumental in pushing for the successful adoption of the new standards, including submitting a Suggested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and numerous other documents. Both are active participants in the intelligent design movement. Discovery Institute fellows used the media coverage of the hearings to take their message to the public. The Institute's vice president and program director, Stephen C. Meyer, appeared on the Fox News show The Big Story with John Gibson, where he debated Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education. There Meyer sought to convey the Institute's message that debate over evolution is not a ploy to get religious ideas into public schools, that evolution is a theory in crisis, and that students were currently being taught in error there was no scientific controversy over evolution. The proposed changes were not supported by most of the 26 members of the panel that reviews state science curriculum. =Decision= On November 8, 2005, the Board of Education voted to instruct science students along the lines of the Discovery Institute, that evolution could not rule out a supernatural or theistic source, that evolution itself was not fact but only a theory and one in crisis, and that ID must be considered a viable alternative to evolution.

Irigonegaray (for mainstream science) # John Calvert (for intelligent design) Result The Kansas Board of Education voted 6‚Äì4 August 9, 2005 to include greater criticism of evolution in its school science standards, but it decided to send the standards to an outside academic for review before taking a final vote. The standards received final approval on November 8, 2005. The new standards were approved by 6 to 4, reflecting the makeup of religious conservatives on the board. In July 2006 the Board of Standards issued a \\"rationale statement\\" which claimed that the current science curriculum standards do not include intelligent design. Members of the scientific community critical of the standards contended that the board's statement was misleading in that they contained a \\"significant editorializing that supports the Discovery Institute and the Intelligent Design network's campaign position that Intelligent Design is not included in the standards\\", the standards did \\"say that students should learn about ID, and that ID content ought to be in the standards\\", and that the standards presented the controversy over intelligent design as a scientific one, denying the mainstream scientific view. Kansas joined Ohio in adopting the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution public school science standards during that period. While other states were backing away from teaching alternatives to evolution, the Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday, March 2, 2006 that contained Discovery Institute language encouraging schools to expose students to alternative views about the origin of life. Popular reaction included the creation of the intelligent design parody Pastafarianism (the worship of a Flying Spaghetti Monster). Its founder insisted it should be offered as a \\"third\\" theory on origins, suggesting possible legal action if it was not included and intelligent design was. On August 1, 2006, 4 of the 6 conservative Republicans who approved the Critical Analysis of Evolution classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election. The moderate Republican and liberal Democrats gaining seats, largely supported by Governor Kathleen Sebelius, vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board. One of the members who lost her seat, Connie Morris, a conservative from St. Francis in the northwest corner of the state, pointed to the \\"liberal media\\" for her loss, noting that \\"liberal opportunists\\" do not mind \\"slandering people and harming their families and their reputation and their business and their communities and their state ... It's a shame, and I feel bad for them when they face God on Judgment Day.\\" Although four members who claimed to be born-again Christians remained on the Board, she believed that the new board would waste no time adopting new science standards, expecting that in the following January, when the new members were sworn in, the Board would rescind existing standards and adopt new ones that \\"let government schools teach children that we are no more than chaotic, random mutants.\\" On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again returned to \\"the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe.\\" See alsoKansas vs. Darwin (film) * Flying Spaghetti Monster, a satirical religion first described in an open letter to the Kansas School Board by Bobby Henderson Notes References Further reading National Science Education Standards; National Academy Press; 1996 (Fifth Printing February 1998); . * Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); 1993; .

This construction is a global version of the construction of the divisor class group, or ideal class group, and is much used in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds. Alternatively, the Picard group can be defined as the sheaf cohomology group :H^1 (X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X^{*}).\\\\, For integral schemes the Picard group is isomorphic to the class group of Cartier divisors. For complex manifolds the exponential sheaf sequence gives basic information on the Picard group. The name is in honour of √âmile Picard's theories, in particular of divisors on algebraic surfaces. Examples The Picard group of the spectrum of a Dedekind domain is its ideal class group. * The invertible sheaves on projective space Pn(k) for k a field, are the twisting sheaves \\\\mathcal{O}(m),\\\\, so the Picard group of Pn(k) is isomorphic to Z. *The Picard group of the affine line with two origins over k is isomorphic to Z. *The Picard group of the n-dimensional complex affine space: \\\\operatorname{Pic}(\\\\mathbb{C}^n)=0, indeed the exponential sequence yields the following long exact sequence in cohomology : \\\\dots\\\\to H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Z}})\\\\to H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{C}^n}) \\\\to H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\mathcal{O}^\\\\star_{\\\\mathbb{C}^n})\\\\to H^2(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Z}})\\\\to\\\\cdots and since H^k(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Z}})\\\\simeq H_{\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\rm sing}^k(\\\\mathbb{C}^n;\\\\mathbb{Z})Sheaf_cohomology#Sheaf_cohomology_with_constant_coefficients we have H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Z}})\\\\simeq H^2(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Z}})\\\\simeq 0 because \\\\mathbb{C}^n is contractible, then H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{C}^n}) \\\\simeq H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\mathcal{O}^\\\\star_{\\\\mathbb{C}^n}) and we can apply the Dolbeault isomorphism to calculate H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{C}^n})\\\\simeq H^1(\\\\mathbb{C}^n,\\\\Omega^0_{\\\\mathbb{C}^n})\\\\simeq H^{0,1}_{\\\\bar{\\\\partial}}(\\\\mathbb{C}^n)=0 by the Dolbeault-Grothendieck lemma. Picard scheme The construction of a scheme structure on (representable functor version of) the Picard group, the Picard scheme, is an important step in algebraic geometry, in particular in the duality theory of abelian varieties. It was constructed by , and also described by and . The Picard variety is dual to the Albanese variety of classical algebraic geometry. In the cases of most importance to classical algebraic geometry, for a non- singular complete variety V over a field of characteristic zero, the connected component of the identity in the Picard scheme is an abelian variety written Pic0(V). In the particular case where V is a curve, this neutral component is the Jacobian variety of V. For fields of positive characteristic however, Igusa constructed an example of a smooth projective surface S with Pic0(S) non-reduced, and hence not an abelian variety. The quotient Pic(V)/Pic0(V) is a finitely-generated abelian group denoted NS(V), the N√©ron-Severi group of V. In other words the Picard group fits into an exact sequence :1\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Pic}^0(V)\\\\to\\\\mathrm{Pic}(V)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{NS}(V)\\\\to 1.\\\\, The fact that the rank of NS(V) is finite is Francesco Severi's theorem of the base; the rank is the Picard number of V, often denoted œÅ(V). Geometrically NS(V) describes the algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on V; that is, using a stronger, non-linear equivalence relation in place of linear equivalence of divisors, the classification becomes amenable to discrete invariants. Algebraic equivalence is closely related to numerical equivalence, an essentially topological classification by intersection numbers.  Relative Picard scheme  Let f: X ‚ÜíS be a morphism of schemes. The relative Picard functor (or relative Picard scheme if it is a scheme) is given by: for any S-scheme T, :\\\\operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}(T) = \\\\operatorname{Pic}(X_T)/f_T^*(\\\\operatorname{Pic}(T)) where f_T: X_T \\\\to T is the base change of f and fT * is the pullback. We say an L in \\\\operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}(T) has degree r if for any geometric point s ‚Üí T the pullback s^*L of L along s has degree r as an invertible sheaf over the fiber Xs (when the degree is defined for the Picard group of Xs.)

In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of arche as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing. pp. 142‚Äì144 Mythical cosmogonies In the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC), the origin of the world is Chaos, considered as a divine primordial condition, from which everything else appeared. In the creation \\"chaos\\" is a gaping-void, but later the word is used to describe the space between the earth and the sky, after their separation. \\"Chaos\\" may mean infinite space, or a formless matter which can be differentiated.This is described as a large windy-gap, almost unlimited (abyss) where are the roots and the ends of the earth, sky, sea and Tartarus: online The Theogony of Hesiod. Translation H.G.Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744 The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality. p 83 The conception of the \\"divine\\" as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers.The phrase: \\"Divine is that which had no beginning, neither end\\" is attributed to Thales In the Orphic cosmogony, the unaging Chronos produced Aether and Chaos and made in divine Aether a silvery egg, from which everything else appeared. p.24 In the mythological cosmogonies of the Near East, the universe is formless and empty and the only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. In the Babylonian creation story, Enuma Elish, the primordial world is described as a \\"watery chaos\\" from which everything else appeared. Something similar is described in Book of Genesis where the spirit of God is moving upon the dark face of the waters. p 58, 59 In the Hindu cosmology, which is similar to the Vedic cosmology, in the beginning there was nothing in the Universe but darkness. The self-manifested being created the primordial waters and established his seed into it. This turned into a golden egg (Hiranyagarbha) from which everything else appeared.Matsya Purana (2.25-30)online; The creation Arche in Ancient Greek philosophy The heritage of Greek mythology already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of \\"being\\" was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought. p.28,42 In the ancient Greek philosophy, arche is the element and the first principle of existing things. This is considered as a permanent substance or nature (physis) either one or more which is conserved in the generation of rest of it. From this all things first come to be and into this they are resolved in a final state. This source of entity is always preserved. (Aristotle-Metaph.A, 983, b6ff). Anaximander was the first philosopher that used arche for that which writers from Aristotle onwards called \\"the substratum\\" (Simplicius Phys. 150, 22). p 55, 77 The Greek philosophers ascribed to arche divine attributes. It is the divine horizon of substance that encompasses and values all things. Thales of Miletus (7th to 6th century BC), the father of philosophy, claimed that the first principle of all things is water, and considered it as a substance that contains in it motion and change. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water. His ideas were influenced by the Near-Eastern mythological cosmogony and probably by the Homeric statement that the surrounding Oceanus (ocean) is the source of all springs and rivers. p 89, 93, 94 Thales' theory was refuted by his successor and esteemed pupil, Anaximander. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche, because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the apeiron, an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.Simplicius, Comments on Aristotle's Physics (24, 13). Apeiron (endless or boundless) is something completely indefinite and Anaximander was probably influenced by the original chaos of Hesiod (yawning abyss). He probably intended it to mean primarily \\"indefinite in kind\\" but assumed it also to be \\"of unlimited extent and duration\\". p 110 The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This arche is called \\"eternal and ageless\\". (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2) p 83 Anaximenes, Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche and ascribes to it divine attributes. He was the first recorded philosopher who provided a theory of change and supported it with observation. Using two contrary processes of rarefaction and condensation (thinning or thickening), he explains how air is part of a series of changes. Rarefied air becomes fire, condensed it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.Daniel.W.Graham. The internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

It is considered a type of engineered language. Philosophical languages were popular in Early Modern times, partly motivated by the goal of revising normal language for philosophical (i.e. scientific) purposes. The term ideal language is sometimes used near-synonymously, though more modern philosophical languages such as Toki Pona are less likely to involve such an exalted claim of perfection. The axioms and grammars of the languages together differ from commonly spoken languages. Overview In most philosophical languages, words are constructed from a limited set of morphemes that are treated as \\"elemental\\" or fundamental. \\"Philosophical language\\" is sometimes used synonymously with \\"taxonomic language\\". Vocabularies of oligosynthetic languages are made of compound words, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of morphemes; languages like Toki Pona similarly use a limited set of root words but produce phrases which remain series of distinct words. History Work on philosophical languages was pioneered by Francis Lodwick (A Common Writing, 1647; The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing, 1652), Sir Thomas Urquhart (Logopandecteision, 1652), George Dalgarno (Ars signorum, 1661), and John Wilkins (An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language, 1668). Those were systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. In 1855, English writer George Edmonds modified Wilkins' system, leaving its taxonomy intact, but changing the grammar, orthography and pronunciation of the language in an effort to make it easier to speak and to read.Edmonds, George. A Universal Alphabet, Grammar, and Language. Richard Griffin and Company, London and Glasgow, 1855. Gottfried Leibniz created lingua generalis (or lingua universalis) in 1678, aiming to create a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically; as a side effect he developed binary calculus.history-computer.com These projects aimed not only to reduce or model grammar, but also to arrange all human knowledge into \\"characters\\" or hierarchies. This idea ultimately led to the Encyclop√©die, in the Age of Enlightenment. Under the entry Charact√®re, D'Alembert critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the Encyclop√©die, projects for a priori languages moved more and more to the fringe. However, from time to time, some authors, continued to propose philosophical languages until the 20th century (for example, Ro, aUI) or even in the 21st century (Toki Pona).

Diksa is given in a one-to-one ceremony, and typically includes the taking on of a serious spiritual discipline. The word is derived from the Sanskrit root dƒÅ (\\"to give\\") plus k·π£i (\\"to destroy\\") or alternately from the verb root dƒ´k·π£ (\\"to consecrate\\"). When the mind of the guru and the disciple become one, then we say that the disciple has been initiated by the guru. Diksa can be of various types, through the teacher's sight, touch, or word, with the purpose of purifying the disciple or student. Initiation by touch is called spar≈õa dƒ´k·π£ƒÅ. The bestowing of divine grace through diksa is sometimes called ≈õaktipƒÅt. Vishnu Yamala (tantra) says: \\"The process that bestows divyam jnanam (transcendental, spiritual knowledge) and destroys sin (pƒÅpa), the seed of sin and ignorance, is called diksha by the spiritual persons who have seen the Truth (desikais tattva-kovidaih).\\" Different traditions and sects treat diksa in various ways. Tantra mentions five types of initiation or diksa: initiation by a ritual or samaya-diksa; sparsa-diksa is an initiation by touch and is done without a ritual; vag-diksa is done by word or mantra; sambhavi-diksa is arising from perception of external appearance of the guru; mano-diksa is when initiation is performed in the mind.The madness of the saints by June McDaniel, University of Chicago Press, (1989) p. 106 For ISKCON members first diksa, or harinama-diksa initiation, is performed as part of a fire sacrifice where grains, fruit, and ghee are placed on an open fire of the sacrifice.Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America [Five Volumes]Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft (2006) Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 23 In the tradition of Lahiri Mahasaya, initiation into Kriya Yoga is given as diksa. The Bengali saint Anandamayi Ma often gave spar≈õa dƒ´k·π£ƒÅ (divine touch) or drik diksa (through her look), in which she would bestow ≈õaktipƒÅt (divine grace). Another type of diksa, into a monastic order, involves a vow of celibacy, renunciation of all personal possessions and of all worldly duties, including family ties. Diksha has the same meaning in Jainism. Diksha is also called Charitra or Mahanibhiskraman in Jainism. Initiation in Hinduism involves performing one of several rituals depending on the person being initiated and the Hindu group involved. Various tantric works enumerate different types of disksha rituals:Jnana Sankalini Tantra by Paramahamsa Prajnanananda * Kriyavati * Kalavati * Varnamayi * Vedamayi Living Examples ISKCON, for example, commonly advise those that want to be initiated into the movement to begin by repeatedly chanting the name of Krishna. This chanting is a sort of unofficial induction. The official initiation as a disciple occurs during an organized ceremony. Additionally, followers are required to wear a string of beads, or kanthi, around their neck.http://krishna.org/srila-prabhupada-on-initiation-compilation-of-quotes/ Transcendental Meditation (TM) began initiation under the guidance of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the late 1950s.

This ritual involves taking water in the right palm and repeating a mantra that is spoken by the ritual initiator, often a renunciate. After the mantra is repeated, the water is poured away, signifying the acceptance of a lifestyle as established by the movement. A kanthi is adorned and vows are taken.

The Ferret was produced between 1952 and 1971 by the UK company Daimler. It was widely adopted by regiments in the British Army, as well as the RAF Regiment and Commonwealth countries throughout the period. History The Ferret was developed in 1949 as a result of a British Army requirement issued in 1947. 'Light reconnaissance cars' existed during the Second World War, notably the Daimler Reconnaissance Scout Car. Given its experience with the successful \\"Dingo\\" (6,626 produced and one of two British AFVs produced throughout WWII) Daimler was awarded a development contract in October 1948, and in June 1950 the first prototype of the Car, Scout, 4x4, Liaison (Ferret) Mark 1 was delivered. Given the designation FV 701(C) it was one of several versions but the one that most closely resembled the original Daimler scout cars, and represented the basic model Ferret. This shared many similar design features with the Dingo, notably the H form drive train in which a central differential eliminates loss of traction due to wheel-slip, and parallel drive shafts considerably reduced the height of the vehicle (roughly equivalent to that of a tracked AFV), considerably reducing the vehicle's visual signature over conventional armoured car designs. Like the Daimler scout car, the Ferret suspension consisted of pairs of transverse links and single coil springs, the wheels driven by Tracta constant-velocity joints, but the Ferret benefited from epicyclic reduction gears that reduced transmission torque loads, essential given the more powerful six cylinder 4.26 litre water-cooled Rolls Royce B.60 petrol engine. Connected by a fluid coupling to a pre-selector five speed epicyclic gearbox, all gears being available in reverse, in its original form the Ferret this installation produced 116 bhp at 3,300 rpm and 129 bhp at 3,750 in its final form. This improved power-to-weight ratio, longer wheelbase ( as compared with the Dingo's ) and the fitting of larger 9.00 x 16 run flat tyres both increased speed and mobility over broken ground. When compared with the Daimler Dingo and Canadian Ford Lynx, the Ferret featured a larger fighting compartment, directly mounted to the hull (a feature that made the Ferret much noisier than Dingo, which lacked a fully monocoque body). Constructed of steel plate protecting the crew from shell splinters at most angles except directly overhead, as the basic vehicle was open-topped and unarmed, with the exception of six forward-firing grenade launchers fitted to the hull over the front wheels (normally carrying smoke grenades), a feature found on all subsequent marks and models. However, the Ferret normally carried a .303\\" Bren light machine gun or a pintle-mounted .30\\" Browning light machine gun for defensive purposes, in addition to the crew's personal weapons. Ferret Mark 2 Ferret Mk2 armored car on display at the Guards Museum, London In contrast to the lightly armed and protected Mark 1, the Mark 2 was designed from the outset to mount a .30\\" Browning in a one-man fully traversable turret, at the cost of one crew member. While this offered better crew protection and protected the otherwise dangerously exposed gunner, the turret raised the height of the vehicle and thus made it more conspicuous; in consequence, the choice of fit depended on the nature of the mission. In general terms, the most successful wheeled armoured vehicles have been purpose-designed and the lightest, commensurate with their mission, being at the least disadvantage in relation to tracked vehicles in terms of ground pressure, which largely governs off-road performance. Small and fast enough to be useful in an urban environment, but sufficiently strong and agile to negotiate rugged terrain off-road, the Ferret, while no longer in service in the British Army, is still operated by several Commonwealth countries and has proven popular with private collectors due to the compact size and affordable price, e.g. around $20,000 to $30,000 in the United States, $40,000 to $60,000 in Australia and New Zealand and around $9,000 in the Czech Republic.http://earmyshop.cz/vozidlo-ferret Mark 1 and Mark 2 Ferrets were used by Australian Military forces from 1953 to 1970, at which time Australian military forces disposed of them at public auction. According to the US Military, 20 national armies were operating the Ferret in 1996. Production A total of 4,409 Ferrets, including 16 sub-models under various Mark numbers, were manufactured between 1952 and 1962, when production ceased. It is possible to upgrade the engine using the more powerful FB60 version from the Austin Princess 4-Litre-R; this upgrade providing a 55bhp gain over the standard B60 engine.

The prime numbers for which this is true are called Pythagorean primes. For example, the primes 5, 13, 17, 29, 37 and 41 are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and they can be expressed as sums of two squares in the following ways: :5 = 1^2 + 2^2, \\\\quad 13 = 2^2 + 3^2, \\\\quad 17 = 1^2 + 4^2, \\\\quad 29 = 2^2 + 5^2, \\\\quad 37 = 1^2 + 6^2, \\\\quad 41 = 4^2 + 5^2. On the other hand, the primes 3, 7, 11, 19, 23 and 31 are all congruent to 3 modulo 4, and none of them can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This is the easier part of the theorem, and follows immediately from the observation that all squares are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Since the Diophantus identity implies that the product of two integers each of which can be written as the sum of two squares is itself expressible as the sum of two squares, by applying Fermat's theorem to the prime factorization of any positive integer n, we see that if all the prime factors of n congruent to 3 modulo 4 occur to an even exponent, then n is expressible as a sum of two squares. The converse also holds.For a proof of the converse see for instance 20.1, Theorems 367 and 368, in: G.H. Hardy and E.M. Wright. An introduction to the theory of numbers, Oxford 1938. This generalization of Fermat's theorem is known as the sum of two squares theorem.  History  Albert Girard was the first to make the observation, describing all positive integer numbers (not necessarily primes) expressible as the sum of two squares of positive integers; this was published in 1625.Simon Stevin. l'Arithm√©tique de Simon Stevin de Bruges, annotated by Albert Girard, Leyde 1625, p. 622.L. E. Dickson, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. II, Ch. VI, p. 227. The statement that every prime p of the form 4n+1 is the sum of two squares is sometimes called Girard's theorem.L. E. Dickson, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. II, Ch. VI, p. 228. For his part, Fermat wrote an elaborate version of the statement (in which he also gave the number of possible expressions of the powers of p as a sum of two squares) in a letter to Marin Mersenne dated December 25, 1640: for this reason this version of the theorem is sometimes called Fermat's Christmas theorem. Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares Fermat usually did not write down proofs of his claims, and he did not provide a proof of this statement. The first proof was found by Euler after much effort and is based on infinite descent. He announced it in two letters to Goldbach, on May 6, 1747 and on April 12, 1749; he published the detailed proof in two articles (between 1752 and 1755).De numerus qui sunt aggregata quorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 4 (1752/3), 1758, 3-40)Demonstratio theorematis FERMATIANI omnem numerum primum formae 4n+1 esse summam duorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 5 (1754/5), 1760, 3-13) Lagrange gave a proof in 1775 that was based on his study of quadratic forms. This proof was simplified by Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (art. 182). Dedekind gave at least two proofs based on the arithmetic of the Gaussian integers. There is an elegant proof using Minkowski's theorem about convex sets. Simplifying an earlier short proof due to Heath-Brown (who was inspired by Liouville's idea), Zagier presented a non-constructive one-sentence proof in 1990.. And more recently Christopher gave a partition-theoretic proof.A. David Christopher. \\"A partition-theoretic proof of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem\\", Discrete Mathematics 339:4:1410‚Äì1411 (6 April 2016) Algorithm Wagon presented an algorithm for calculating such decompositions in 1990, based on work by Serret and Hermite (1848), and Cornacchia (1908).. Related results Fermat announced two related results fourteen years later. In a letter to Blaise Pascal dated September 25, 1654 he announced the following two results for odd primes p: *p = x^2 + 2y^2 \\\\Leftrightarrow p\\\\equiv 1\\\\mbox{ or }p\\\\equiv 3\\\\pmod{8}, *p= x^2 + 3y^2 \\\\Leftrightarrow p\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}. He also wrote: : If two primes which end in 3 or 7 and surpass by 3 a multiple of 4 are multiplied, then their product will be composed of a square and the quintuple of another square. In other words, if p, q are of the form 20k + 3 or 20k + 7, then pq = x2 + 5y2. Euler later extended this to the conjecture that * p = x^2 + 5y^2 \\\\Leftrightarrow p\\\\equiv 1\\\\mbox{ or }p\\\\equiv 9\\\\pmod{20}, * 2p = x^2 + 5y^2 \\\\Leftrightarrow p\\\\equiv 3\\\\mbox{ or }p\\\\equiv 7\\\\pmod{20}.

During a tour in Mexico for Universal Wrestling Association, Murakawa adopted the character of Ninja Sasuke, a ninja gimmick inspired by the legendary Sarutobi Sasuke. He started wearing a black bodysuit with a matching mask, and utilized a wrestling style set between lucha libre and martial arts. Upon returning to Japan after a second Mexico tour, he finally tweaked his name to The Great Sasuke, and adopted a red, black and white mask patterned after kumadori makeup, reminiscent of the one worn by fellow Japanese wrestler Mach Hayato. Shortly after, Sasuke proclaimed he was going to found a professional wrestling promotion in Tohoku, initially thought as an ULL branch, and left the promotion with a large group of wrestlers. He would found Michinoku Pro Wrestling, the first Japanese independent promotion not to be based around the Tokyo area. =Michinoku Pro Wrestling (1993-present)= Junior competition MPW kicked off in March 1993, when Sasuke and the rest of babyface wrestlers entered an intense feud against the villainous Super Delf√≠n and his Delf√≠n Corps. This rivalry would last many years. Hustle event in 2009. In 1994, New Japan Pro Wrestling celebrated the first Super J Cup, a junior heavyweight tournament for wrestlers from all over the world. Sasuke was drafted and reached the finals after beating NJPW favourites Jushin Thunder Liger and El Samurai, but fell to Wild Pegasus at the end. Despite his loss, Sasuke represented Michinoku Pro excellently and allowed for it to receive national coverage, and he himself became one of the most popular junior wrestlers in Japan. The same year, Sasuke competed in the similar NJPW Super Grade Jr. Heavyweight Tag League, where he teamed up with Black Tiger. As with the previous, Sasuke and Tiger amassed a high number of wins and came to the finals, but were eliminated there by Wild Pegasus and Shinjiro Otani. Sasuke also participated in the first Fukumen World League, hosted by Michinoku Pro Wrestling in 1995 and admitting only masked wrestlers. Sasuke was defeated in the final round by Dos Caras. In April 1996, Sasuke returned to NJPW and defeated Liger for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, which he defended five times at both NJPW and MPW. His reign, along with his next title win over NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion Masayoshi Motegi and WWF Light Heavyweight and WWA World Junior Light Heavyweight double champion El Samurai, would lead to the creation of the J Crown title, with Sasuke winning it in the final of a tournament against √öltimo Drag√≥n on August. For two months, Sasuke was one of the most decorated wrestlers in history, until he lost all of it to Drag√≥n in Wrestle Association R. In February 1997, Sasuke and several of his MPW teammates made a pair of appearances for Extreme Championship Wrestling in United States. In July, he and Taka Michinoku also wrestled two matches for World Wrestling Federation, one of them at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede. It was apparent that Sasuke would sign up with WWF, but it was Michinoku who ended up being signed on his place for unknown reasons. Varied storylines Upon returning to Japan, Sasuke and Tiger Mask IV began feuding with two heel doppelg√§ngers, Sasuke the Great and Masked Tiger (played respectively by Masao Orihara and Takeshi Ono), aside from usual villain Super Delf√≠n. Around this time, however, Sasuke would take repeated hiatuses in order to have time to heal injuries, which led him to clash against other wrestlers, most particularly Delf√≠n, who accused him of being unfit to lead the promotion. This dissension would end up switching their respective alignment, with Delf√≠n joining the home army and turning into the promotion's ace while Sasuke turned heel for the first time on his career and became an egotistical overlord. He would even change his mask, replacing its red stripes for blue stripes, as well as his name, leaving it as just \\"Sasuke\\" written in all caps. Sasuke would create his personal villainous stable, Sasuke Group, by allying with resident heels and summoning Crazy Max (Shiima Nobunaga's punk faction) from Toryumon. Sasuke holding Jushin Thunder Liger in an octopus hold. The battle between the Sasuke Group and the rest of Michinoku wrestlers would have the effect of fracturing the promotion, as Dick Togo and Super Delfin had their own feud about the latter's role in the babyface team. After Togo humiliated Delf√≠n by forcing him to crawl between his legs and later caused a riot by abusing him further, Sasuke adopted the same approach against Delf√≠n in their battles, which eventually led to his departure from MPW to form Osaka Pro Wrestling due to both kayfabe and real dissatisfaction with the angle. Sasuke continued his war on MPW until 1999, when he was forcefully turned face again after Jinsei Shinzaki \\"exorcized the evil out of him.\\" Now devoid of talent due to the absence of wrestlers who had left with Delf√≠n and other ventures, MPW was left in ruins, a situation the now heroic Sasuke vowed to mend. In 1999 he won the NWA World Middleweight Championship vacated by old rival Ultimo Dragon. Although the tournament was promoted by Ultimo's Toryumon Japan promotion, Sasuke took the title to his base at Michinoku and styled himself a \\"traveling world champion\\" in the style of NWA World Heavyweight Champions from the 1960-80s. In 2001, Sasuke had a feud in Michinoku Pro against a returning Dick Togo and his sable, Far East Connection. Sasuke left the running of the promotion to Shinzaki in 2003 to focus on his political career, handing the president job to him. He lost the NWA title to √öltimo Drag√≥n, who then vacated it in preparation for his WWE career. The same year, Sasuke reconciled with Super Delf√≠n for a special match on November 2 by mediation of Shinzaki. Toryumon X era In 2004, Sasuke became a regular wrestler for Hustle, where he played a lieutenant role to \\"Hustle Captain\\" Naoya Ogawa. At the same time, with MPW now repopulated by most of the fallen Toryumon X wrestlers, Sasuke commanded the Michinoku home army against the new top heel faction, Los Salseros Japoneses (Takeshi Minamino, Pineapple Hanai and Mango Fukuda). He formed tag teams with Dick Togo and Garuda, but also joined Kei and Shu Sato to try to reform Sailor Boys, the boy band stable they formed in Toryumon with Taiji Ishimori. However, this was short-lived, as the Sato brothers turned heel the same year and joined Kagetora to create Stoned, the next great heel stable. Sasuke spent 2006 in an interpromotional feud with Osaka Pro Wrestling, eventually having a degree of reconciliation with Super Delfin in the ring, and continued wrestling in Hustle and other promotions, allying with tarento Hitomi Kaikawa in her wrestling debut. The same year, after a series of challenges, Sasuke initiated the tradition of the , a garbage wrestling event where he would face off against the Sato brothers under outrageous costumed identities and fantastic storylines. After sitting out of most of 2007 due to his political career, he returned to form a tag team with upcoming ace Yoshitsune. Stoned disappeared later in the year, leaving place for the rise of Kowloon, a traitorous faction apparently led by Hayato Fujita. Yoshitsune departed at the end of 2008, leaving Sasuke and Shinzaki to delegate the Michinoku Seikigun on Kenou. In 2010, Sasuke's old enemy Ultimo Drag√≥n appeared to reveal himself as the master behind Kowloon. In August 2009, months after unsuccessfully challenging Fujita for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship, Sasuke adopted a gimmick based on Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, Mickey Rourke's character from the professional wrestling film The Wrestler. He started wrestling barechested for the first time in his career, donned green tights with, and adopted a taunting diving headbutt just like the film character. He abandoned the impersonation after a couple years, though he retained the custom to wear only shorter tights as opposed to his old bodysuit. On April 15, 2011, Sasuke returned to the United States to wrestle for Chikara in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where he would represent Michinoku Pro with Dick Togo and Jinsei Shinzaki. In their first round match Team Michinoku Pro defeated Team Minnesota (1-2-3 Kid, Arik Cannon and Darin Corbin). The following day, Team Michinoku Pro defeated Jigsaw, Manami Toyota and Mike Quackenbush to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On April 17, Team Michinoku Pro was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinal stage by F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Johnny Gargano). Mu no Taiyo Sasuke as part of Mu no Taiyo. At the end of 2013, Sasuke took part in the classic \\"Great Space War\\" match, where he performed a striptease with Macho Pump parodying the film Magic Mike. However, for the first time in the history of GSW, Kei and Shu Sato (now known as the Brahman Brothers) defeated Sasuke after the latter crashed in a dangerous stunt, which prompted him to reflect about the state of things. Sasuke then said he knew the Brahmans were attempting to protect the Earth from alien invaders, and asked them to join forces to fight for the greater good. This led to the creation of Mu no Taiyo, a shinsh≈´ky≈ç cult- themed stable, with Sasuke posing as their messianic leader under a new mask modified to resemble the Brahmans. It marked the first time Sasuke had turned heel in many years. Mu no Taiyo opposed the Michinoku home army, but had a particular beef with popular tag team of Yapper Man 1 and Yapper Man 2, as well as New Phase, the new team of Ayumu Gunji and Daichi Sasaki. Other media In 1999, Sasuke performed on Sasuke, the popular Japanese obstacle course competition. In the Third Competition, he got stuck at the Rolling Log and timed out on the Hill Climb. When the name SASUKE was translated into \\"Ninja Warrior\\" for the United States, the translators ignored his wrestling background and called him \\"The Great Ninja Warrior\\". Sasuke is also part of the rock band Crazy Crew with Ricky Fuji and Ken45¬∞. =2009 arrest= On February 19, 2009, Sasuke was arrested for assault after kicking a 36-year-old man and grabbing him by the shirt collar. Sasuke was reported to be angry because his picture was being taken with a cellphone camera. The incident happened on a JR Joban Line train at Minamisenju Station.http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=8919 However, all charges were dropped and was released from jail on February 21, after serving 40 hours in jail, after Sasuke apologized to the man. The man who took Sasuke's photograph was said to not have known who he was and thought he was just some crazy person wearing a mask in public. Political career On April 13, 2003, Sasuke won election to the Iwate Prefectural Assembly, making him the first actual masked legislator in history. He is the fourth Japanese wrestler to get elected to office. Antonio Inoki, Hiroshi Hase and Atsushi Onita preceded him, though all of them were elected to the Japanese Diet at the national level.

Wellman, produced by David O. Selznick, and starring Carole Lombard and Fredric March with a supporting cast featuring Charles Winninger and Walter Connolly. Ben Hecht was credited with the screenplay based on the 1937 story \\"Letter to the Editor\\" by James H. Street, and an array of additional writers, including Ring Lardner Jr., Budd Schulberg, Dorothy Parker, Sidney Howard, Moss Hart, George S. Kaufman and Robert Carson made uncredited contributions. The lush, Gershwinesque music score was by Oscar Levant, with additional music by Alfred Newman and Max Steiner and a swing number by Raymond Scott's Quintette. The film was shot in Technicolor by W. Howard Greene and edited by James E. Newcom, and was a Selznick International Pictures production distributed by United Artists. The film's opening credits feature distinctive caricatures of the leading actors, as 3d-figurines, and creative artists, as 2d-cartoons, by Sam Berman.https://artofthetitle.tumblr.com/post/163133297417/new-check-out-the- hand-sculpted-opening-to This was Lombard's only Technicolor film. She stated that this film was one of her personal favorites. Plot New York newspaper reporter Wally Cook (Fredric March) is blamed for reporting a Harlem bootblack Ernest Walker (Troy Brown) as an African nobleman hosting a charity event. Cook claims he was unaware, but he is demoted to writing obituaries. He begs his boss Oliver Stone (Walter Connolly) for another chance, and points out a story about a woman, Hazel Flagg, dying of radium poisoning. Cook is sent to the (fictional) town of Warsaw, Vermont, to interview Flagg (Carole Lombard). Cook finally locates Hazel, who is crying both because her doctor has told her that she is not dying and because she realizes she might be stuck in Vermont for her whole life. Unaware of this, Cook invites Hazel and her doctor to New York as guests of the Morning Star newspaper. The newspaper uses her story to increase its circulation. She receives a ticker tape parade and the key to the city, and becomes an inspiration to many. She and Wally fall in love, and he asks her to marry him even though he still thinks she's dying. After a medical exam by three independent doctors it is finally discovered that Hazel is not really dying, and city officials and Stone decide that it would be better to avoid embarrassment by having it seem that she went off to die, \\"like an elephant\\". Hazel and Wally get married and quietly set sail for the tropics. Cast Carole Lombard Margaret Hamilton as Drugstore Lady * Carole Lombard as Hazel Flagg * Fredric March as Wally Cook * Charles Winninger as Dr. Enoch Downer * Walter Connolly as Oliver Stone * Sig Ruman as Dr. Emil Eggelhoffer (as Sig Rumann) * Frank Fay as Master of Ceremonies * Troy Brown as Ernest Walker * Maxie Rosenbloom as Max Levinsky * Margaret Hamilton as Warsaw, Vermont Drugstore Lady * Hattie McDaniel as Mrs. Walker * Olin Howland as Will Bull * Raymond Scott as Musical Leader * John Qualen as Fireman * George Chandler as photographer (uncredited) According to William Wellman Jr., Janet Gaynor had originally been cast as Hazel Flagg to follow on the success of A Star is Born (1937). However, after William Wellman Sr. met Carole Lombard, he convinced Selznick to cast her. A boxing world champion, Maxie Rosenbloom, gave Lombard boxing lessons to prepare her for her fight scene with Fredric March. Production Carole Lombard in Nothing Sacred Fredric March and Carole Lombard The first screwball comedy filmed in color, Nothing Sacred also represents the first use in a color film of process effects, montage and rear screen projection. Backgrounds for the rear projection were filmed on the streets of New York. Paramount Pictures and other studios refined this technique in their subsequent color features. Ben Hecht is credited with writing the screenplay in two weeks on a train. He adapted the story \\"Letter to the Editor\\" by James H. Street which had been first been published in Hearst's International-Cosmopolitan. Hecht wrote a role for his friend John Barrymore in the film, but David Selznick refused to use him as Barrymore had become by then an incurable alcoholic. This caused a rift between Hecht and Selznick, and Hecht walked off the picture. Budd Schulberg and Dorothy Parker were called in to write the final scenes and several others also made contributions to the screenplay, including: David O. Selznick, William Wellman, Sidney Howard, Moss Hart, George S. Kaufman and Robert Carson. One reason that the film is considered among the most celebrated screwball comedies is that underneath the humor it incorporates sharply cynical themes of corruption and dishonesty. This film, along with Hecht's The Front Page (1931) and its 1940 remake His Girl Friday with Cary Grant, caricatures the chicanery to which some newspapers resorted in order to get a \\"hot\\" story. Reception The film recorded a loss of $350,000 at the box office; despite critical acclaim.Earnings Report, Nov. 1940, Folder 10, Box 628, David O.

Copyright and home video status In 1965, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the copyright owners did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Because of its public domain status, the film is a staple of bargain bin releases and collections. Although it was generally in watchable condition, until recently the best DVD was a US region 0 disc from Lumivision, later reissued by Sling Shot. In 2011, Kino Lorber issued the film on DVD and Blu-ray, mastered from a 2K scan of Selznick's personal nitrate print, preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department. In 2018, Kino reissued their Blu-ray, this time mastered from a 2K scan of Disney's 1999 restoration, carried out on behalf of ABC, holder of most of the Selznick library. Remakes Ben Hecht's screenplay was also the basis of a Broadway musical, Hazel Flagg (1953) with Helen Gallagher, as well as Living It Up (1954), a comedy film starring Dean Martin in the Winninger role, Jerry Lewis in the Lombard role (as Homer Flagg), and Janet Leigh in the March role.

The Squadron's origins can be traced back to 1869 when the first mounted unit was raised in the Waikato. Today the Squadron is part of Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles (QAMR) where it forms the regiment's reserve squadron. WMR's role is mounted reconnaissance and surveillance. History =1869‚Äì1914= WMR's lineage extends back to the New Zealand Wars (1843‚Äì72) and the formation of the Cambridge Mounted Rangers Volunteers. This unit was accepted for service on 24 July 1869,New Zealand Gazette 47/1869, Colonial Defence Office entry (26 August 1869) on behalf of His Excellency the Governor accepting the services of the Cambridge Mounted Rangers Volunteers (date of acceptance, 24 July 1869). and today this date is recognised as WMR's 'birthday' and commemorated by the Squadron each year. Although the Cambridge Mounted Rangers Volunteers were disbanded in 1870, they were effectively re-formed shortly afterwards as the Cambridge Cavalry Volunteers. The formation of the Cambridge Cavalry Volunteers, together with the nearby Te Awamutu Cavalry Volunteers (1871) and the Hamilton Cavalry Volunteers (1880) led directly to the creation of the Waikato Mounted Rifle Volunteers (1897), and then to the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles when New Zealand's Volunteer Force was superseded by the Territorial Force (TF) in 1911. In 1885 all of New Zealand's Volunteer Force cavalry units were turned into mounted rifles units. This was more than just a change of title, as the New Zealand Volunteer Manual makes clear: \\"It cannot be too frequently impressed upon all ranks of mounted rifles that they are in no sense cavalry. They are only intended to fight on foot; their horses enabling them to make longer and more rapid movements than the infantry soldier.\\" Mounted riflemen had the same mobility as cavalry, but because they dismounted out of direct fire range, they were much less vulnerable. New Zealand's mounted troops still required, \\"all the √©lan, dash and spirit of cavalry, but train to fight dismounted\\".New Zealand Volunteer Force Manual for Mounted Rifles, quoted by Kinloch in Echoes of Gallipoli, p. 18. The historian of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles in the First World War, Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Terry Kinloch, however draws an important distinction between mounted rifles and mounted infantry. \\"A mounted rifleman was a horseman who was trained to fight on foot, but also to carry out some of the other cavalry functions, such as reconnaissance and screening. A mounted infantryman was no horseman. He rode a horse when he had to, but he fought on foot, and did not undertake reconnaissance or any other cavalry role. Mounted riflemen thus fitted in between cavalry and mounted infantry, performing some of the secondary roles of cavalry, but fighting on foot.\\"Kinloch, Echoes of Gallipoli, pp. 18‚Äì19. Another sourceNewark, pp. 247‚Äì248. The author was in fact referring to the Australian Light Horse, but this description applies equally to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles. explains that mounted infantry were foot soldiers provided with increased mobility, whilst mounted riflemen were horsemen trained to fight on foot in both offensive and defensive actions. As horsemen they were also expected to perform the duties of reconnoitring and screening troop movements as well as providing protection from surprise attacks. Mounted infantry were picked soldiers often organised in small units as adjuncts to an infantry brigade, or to an independent force of cavalry. Each mounted rifles unit was recruited on a voluntary basis with troopers bringing their own horses to take part in military training. They were well represented when New Zealand first sent troops overseas to South Africa. On 28 September 1899, the New Zealand Government offered a contingent to serve with the British Imperial Forces in South Africa, two weeks before the war with the Boer republic began. A total of 10 contingents ‚Äì the New Zealand Mounted Rifles (NZMR) ‚Äì were sent between 1899 and 1902, totalling 6,495 officers and men and more than 8000 horses. (At this time New Zealand's population was only 900,000.) The largest engagement in South Africa involving New Zealanders was at Langverwacht Hill in February 1902. Here, whilst defending a cordon enveloping between 800 and 900 Boer guerrillas under De Wet, the Seventh Contingent suffered badly: of approximately 90 men holding the New Zealand line, 24 were killed and more than 40 wounded. These losses are some of the most severe suffered by a New Zealand unit in a single short action in any war . Lord Kitchener reported that they had, \\"displayed great gallantry and resolution at a critical moment,\\" and that their conduct on this occasion, \\"reflects the highest credit upon all ranks of the contingent, and upon the Colony to which it belongs. Nothing could have been finer than the behaviour of the men.\\"Stowers, Waikato Troopers, p. 48. Earlier, General Sir Ian Hamilton, had said this of the New Zealanders he had observed in the field: \\"I have soldiered a long time now, but I have never in my life met men I would sooner soldier with than New Zealanders. I feel the greatest affection for them and I shall never forget the work they did in South Africa\\"Stowers, Waikato Troopers, p. 50 Hamilton was to meet New Zealanders again in an even greater test fourteen years later at Gallipoli. Another senior British officer, quoted in The Times History of the War in South Africa, wrote of the New Zealanders: \\"It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that after they had a little experience, they were, by general consent, regarded as on average the best mounted troops in South Africa.\\" The battle honour 'South Africa 1900‚Äì02' was the first to be awarded to WMR. When the TF was formed in 1911 (three years after the Territorial Army in Britain) and compulsory military training introduced, New Zealand could field 12 mounted rifles regiments. Today only two NZ Army units still carry the Mounted Rifles title: WMR and QAMR. The cap badge of the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles dates from shortly before the First World War: a native Kaka parrot within a wreath of kowhai leaves and blossoms. The Latin motto, \\"Libertas et Natale Solum\\" is best translated as \\"Liberty and Homeland\\".Corbett, p. 147 The Regimental March, 'D'ye ken John Peel' was also adopted. This was published in 1903 for general use as a trot by all mounted units, and in England was then used by the East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry. While this regiment has since evolved into today's Yorkshire Squadron of The Queen's Own Yeomanry, the same Regimental March has been retained. =1914‚Äì1918= On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the 1st New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) was formed for overseas service. It included a NZMR brigade. The TF Auckland Mounted Rifles Brigade comprised three regiments. For the NZEF, each of those regiments contributed and sustained a service squadron to the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment (AMR) of the NZMR Brigade. The squadron provided to AMR by WMR was known as the 4th (Waikato) Squadron. Terry Kinloch has described how the New Zealand mounted rifles regiments were organised: \\"Each mounted rifles regiment numbered 549 men and 608 horses organised as a headquarters, three squadrons and a machine gun section. A squadron of 158 men and 169 horses comprised a headquarters and four troops. Each troop consisted of eight four-man sections. The section was the fundamental building block of the mounted rifles regiment. In combat, one man in each section was responsible for holding the horses when the other three fought on foot. The four men lived, worked, fought and sometimes died together, and they usually became close friends.\\"Kinloch, Echoes of Gallipoli, p. 31 As part of the NZMR Brigade, the AMR served throughout the Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine campaigns, finally returning to New Zealand in 1919 when it was demobilised. For this service the following battle honours were awarded to WMR: Anzac, Defence of Anzac, Hill 60 (Anzac), Sari Bair, Gallipoli 1915, Rumani, Magdaba-Rafah, Egypt 1915‚Äì17, Gaza-Beersheba, Jerusalem, Jaffa, Jericho, Jordan (Amman), Megiddo, Nablus and Palestine 1917‚Äì18. The role played by the NZMR Brigade fighting dismounted alongside the infantry against the Turks during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 has been well recorded; less well known are the Brigade's operations in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. Arguably the finest hours of AMR's 4th Waikato Squadron on Gallipoli occurred during the 8 and 9 August 1915 during the assault on Chunuk Bair, the summit of the dominant Sari Bair Ridge. After a most hazardous approach under continuous fire, AMR succeeding in reaching the sorely pressed Wellington Infantry Battalion that had earlier seized the peak. Together the survivors held out against repeated Turkish assaults, suffering appalling casualties. When eventually relieved, AMR had virtually ceased to exist. Of the 288 that had advanced on the summit, only 22 were able to walk off the hill unaided. All the officers in the 4th Waikato Squadron were dead. Ultimately Chunuk Bair was lost, and Hamilton's August offensive failed. The Gallipoli campaign decimated the original NZMR Brigade. When the peninsula finally came to be evacuated in December, almost half of the 4000 mounted riflemen who had served there since May had been killed or wounded. Once reunited with their horses in Egypt, the Brigade formed part of what later became known as the Desert Mounted Corps, eventually consisting of 20,000 horsemen drawn from Australian, Indian, British Yeomanry and New Zealand units, and the largest tactical force of cavalry ever to operate under one command.Warner, p. 181\\\\. It is of interest that no regular British cavalry regiments took part in the campaign. The campaign under General Allenby concluded with the fall of Damascus and the complete defeat of the Turkish Army in 1918. It is instructive to read extracts from the tributes paid afterwards to the NZMR Brigade by successive British Commanders in Chief: \\"New Zealand has every reason to be proud of what her sons have done for the Empire, and in no theatre have they more reason to be so than the glorious and bewilderingly successful campaign in Palestine.\\" (General Sir John Maxwell, GCB, KCMG, CVO, DSO.) \\"Fortunate indeed is a commander in the field who has at his disposal New Zealand mounted troops, for he can depend on them at all times to display energy, resource and endurance. All these three qualities were time after time exemplified by the New Zealanders in the waterless desert country of Sinai... Not only is the brigade equal to any troops in energy, resource and endurance, but in addition it is second to none in determination and dash... The Empire is proud of the New Zealand Mounted Brigade and I personally owe it a debt of lasting gratitude.\\" (General Sir Archibald Murray, CCMG, KCB, CVO, DSO.) \\"When the autumn campaign was in progress, the New Zealanders took a leading part in defeating the Turkish IV Army. In the Jordan Valley, and thence eastward, over their old battlefield of Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Amman, to the Hedjaz railway, the men of New Zealand fought and marched to final and complete victory. Nothing daunted these intrepid fighters; to them nothing was impossible.\\" (Field Marshall Sir Edmund Allenby, GCB, GCMG).All three tributes, along with that of Lieutenant General Sir H.Chauvel, appear in the opening pages of Powles, New Zealanders in Sinai and Palestine. Field Marshall Lord Wavell summarised the part played by the Desert Mounted Corps in the campaign like this: \\"The greatest exploit in history of horsed cavalry, and possibly their last success on a large scale, had ended within a short distance of the battlefield of Issus (333 B.C.), where Alexander the Great first showed how battles could be won by bold and well-handled horsemen.\\"Quoted by Angelsey (Volume 5, p. 340) from Wavell's own book, Allenby: A Study in Greatness. The campaign in Egypt, Palestine and Syria was to be the heyday of New Zealand's mounted rifles regiments. =1918‚Äì1939= After the First World War the TF continued much in its previous form, although in 1921 the 12 mounted rifles regiments were reduced to nine. Horses were maintained in all the regiments. In the same year, the title of the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles was altered first to the 4th New Zealand Mounted Rifles (Waikato), and then on 6 September 1927 to the Waikato Mounted Rifles. In 1927 the New Zealand mounted rifles regiments received permission from King George V to carry Guidons. Although some mounted rifles regiments were later presented with Guidons, there is no record of WMR ever having received this honour, and that position continues to this day. 1927 was also the year in which two British cavalry regiments, the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own) and the 12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's), were converted to armoured cars, becoming the first regular cavalry in the world to be fully mechanised.Angelsey (Volume 8), p. 337, and Macksey, pp. 48‚Äì49. The era of the horse in land warfare was slowly drawing to a close. Meanwhile, the Waikato Mounted Rifles regiment was now based at the Drill Hall in Knox Street in Hamilton and organised into four squadrons: HQ, A, B, and C. A typical squadron consisted of about 160 soldiers with their horses, broken down into four troops. Compulsory military training ceased in 1930 at the beginning of the Depression. At the same time pressure for mechanisation was growing and in 1936 it was decided that the TF would be motorised. As part of this process, each mounted rifles regiment was allowed to raise a light car and motorcycle troop. By 1937, with TF numbers dropping, the Government was forced to reduce the numbers of TF units in each military district. From now on, each district would have a composite mounted rifles regiment and a composite motorised mounted rifles squadron. In the Northern Military District, WMR provided one squadron for the horsed regiment, and one troop for the motorised squadron. In 1939 the first armoured vehicles were purchased for the Army: six Bren gun carriers. Initially two were issued to each military district; later these were recalled to become the nucleus for the 2nd New Zealand Divisional Cavalry Regiment (more commonly known as the 'Div Cav'). =1939‚Äì1945= After the outbreak of war with Germany, the TF was returned to its former size. There were some changes, mainly increasing the pre-war efforts to motorise the Army. One regiment in each mounted rifles brigade was now fully motorised, on the same basis as a British motorised battalion. In the Northern Military District this was to be WMR, and so as vehicles became available, the regiment was gradually parted from its horses.A comprehensive history of the RNZAC has yet to be written. Much of the information in this and the previous section concerning the mechanisation of New Zealand's mounted rifles regiments comes from Stowers, Waikato Troopers, and the works of Plowman and Thomas. At the start of the war, the Government agreed to raise an expeditionary force to be placed at the disposal of the British Government. The Div Cav was part of this force with the majority of its personnel coming from the mounted rifles regiments, including WMR who also provided the unit's first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel CJ Pierce, MC . The Div Cav subsequently fought with General Freyberg's 2nd New Zealand Division in Greece, North Africa and Italy, equipped variously with Vickers Light Mark III and VIb tanks, Bren carriers, Marmon-Herrington armoured cars, M3 Stuart light tanks and Staghound armoured cars. The Div Cav had the double distinction of being the first unit to be raised and equipped with armour in New Zealand and the first New Zealand armoured unit to be deployed operationally overseas. War correspondent and 2NZEF staff officer Geoffrey Cox described the men of the Div Cav he saw fighting in Crete like this: \\"They were mostly farmers, brown- faced, weather-beaten men, sinewy and fit, with at their head the huge figure of their commander, Major John Russell. Had the 2nd New Zealand Division run to an elite force the Divisional Cavalry would have been a candidate for that title.\\"Cox, p. 47. The Div Cav provided many of the original volunteers for what was to become the Long Range Desert Group, amongst whom was at least one former WMR trooper.Trooper Frank Jopling. His unique diary and photographs have been collated by the writer Brendon O'Carroll and published under the title, 'Bearded Brigands'. Another former WMR soldier who served with special forces during the Second World War was Sergeant Francis (Frank) Wigzell. He was seconded to 'Z Special Unit', an Allied special forces unit formed to operate behind Japanese lines in SE Asia. His own account of this period was published in 2001: New Zealand Involvement: Special Operations Australia ‚Äì South West Pacific World War II (Pentland Press). Back in New Zealand in November 1941 it was decided that the mounted rifles regiments were to be reconstituted as armoured units and organised along the lines of a divisional cavalry unit, with armoured cars, Bren carriers and lorries. Much to the chagrin of those concerned, they were redesignated as 'Light Armoured Fighting Vehicle Regiments'. WMR thus became the 4th Light Armoured Fighting Vehicle (4 LAFV) regiment, based at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia Camp near Hamilton. With the entry of the Japanese into the war in December 1941, the TF was mobilised for home defence. The New Zealand Armoured Corps was formed on 1 January 1942 (the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô prefix was not granted until 12 July 1947).Britain's Royal Armoured Corps was formed on 4 April 1939; the Canadian Armoured Corps on 13 August 1940; the Indian Armoured Corps on 1 May 1941 and the Australian Armoured Corps on 9 July 1941 [see Macksey]. The first Stuart tanks, 24 in all, arrived in New Zealand in June 1942. The following month personnel from each LAFV regiment were sent to the New Zealand Armoured Fighting Vehicle School at Waiouru Military Camp to take part in training on the new tanks, more of which arrived in October. In November further developments took place with each unit being designated as either an armoured regiment with a mix of Stuart and valentine tanks, or a reconnaissance regiment with Stuart tanks, Beaverette armoured cars and carriers. In the process, and much to their satisfaction, the units regained their old titles. It took until 1943 to implement these changes. From April 1943 onwards the mounted rifles regiments were called upon to provide personnel for the reinforcement drafts for units overseas, mainly being the 18th, 19th and 20th Armoured Regiments that were equipped with M4 Sherman tanks in the 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade in Italy. This service was recognised at the end of the war when the Auckland, Waikato and North Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments inherited the battle honours of the 18th Armoured Regiment from the Italian campaign: The Sangro, Castel Frentano, Orsogna, Advance to Florence, San Michele, Paula Line, Celle, Pisciatello, the Senio, Santerno Crossing, Bologna, Idice Bridgehead and Italy 1943‚Äì45. By June the drain on personnel had been so severe that no TF unit was fully operational, and in July all the mounted rifles regiments were reduced to training cadres for training personnel for overseas service. Finally, in March 1944 came the reorganisation of the New Zealand Armoured Corps. Three armoured regiments were to be formed, one in each military district. In the Northern Military District the three mounted rifles regiments, including WMR, were amalgamated to form the 1st Armoured Regiment. =1945‚Äì1999= Following the Second World War, the TF remained largely dormant until 1949 when compulsory military training was reintroduced in New Zealand for the armed forces. In 1951 the Waikato Regiment, a pre-war infantry unit, was incorporated into the 1st Armoured Regiment to form the 1st Armoured Regiment (Waikato), RNZAC. The Colours of the Waikato RegimentOriginally formed as the 16th (Waikato) Regiment in 1911, the title was changed in 1921.The 16th (Waikato) Regiment was first presented with Colours by the then Governor of New Zealand, the Earl of Liverpool, on 3 May 1914 at Hautapu Camp, Cambridge. Although these Colours were originally laid up in St Peter's Cathedral, Hamilton, the remains are now held in the National Army Museum, Waiouru. The Waikato Regiment's Colours that were handed to the 1st Armoured Regiment (Waikato) were presented to the regiment by the then Governor-General of New Zealand, Viscount Galway, in the grounds of Hamilton High School on 24 May 1936. were handed to the 1st Armoured Regiment (Waikato) and accepted by it at a ceremonial Colours Parade held in Seddon Park, Hamilton on Anzac Day 1956. These Colours were later laid up in St Andrew's Church, Cambridge in October 1970. Over the next 50 years, as compulsory military training has come and gone, with successive reorganisations taking place, regimental titles in the RNZAC have frequently changed. In 1959 the 1st Armoured Regiment (Waikato), RNZAC became the Waikato Regiment, RNZAC; the 2nd Armoured Regiment became Queen Alexandra's Regiment RNZAC; and the 4th Armoured Regiment became the Wellington East Coast Regiment, RNZAC. A year later the Waikato, Queen Alexandra's and Wellington East Coast Regiments were reduced to squadrons, together forming a new 1st Armoured Regiment, RNZAC. In 1963‚Äì64 the 1st Armoured Regiment split, with Queen Alexandra's and Wellington East Coast Squadrons becoming the 1st Armoured Squadron (Queen Alexandra's), and the Waikato Squadron becoming the 2nd Armoured Squadron (Waikato). In 1970 the 1st and 2nd Armoured Squadrons amalgamated to form Queen Alexandra's (Waikato/Wellington East Coast) Squadron, but in 1983 this divided again to form Queen Alexandra's Squadron and the Waikato/Wellington East Coast (Wai/WEC) Squadron.In the years that followed, Wai/WEC Squadron occasionally paraded with the Guidon of the 9th (Wellington East Coast) Mounted Rifles. This had been presented to the regiment by Major General Sir A.H.Russell at Marewa, Napier in May 1935. It is now laid up in the Hastings City Council Chambers. In 1990 all New Zealand's armoured units were brought together for the first time in the 1st Armoured Group. Three years later this was re-titled Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles (QAMR). The Wai/WEC Squadron formed C Squadron. Six years of relative stability followed before further changes occurred. In 1999 a wide-ranging review and reorganisation of the TF took place that resulted in the transfer of the Wai/WEC Squadron to the 6th Battalion (Hauraki), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (RNZIR) ‚Äì a Territorial infantry unit based in Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty. =1999‚Äìtoday= Within the Haurakis, C and D Companies were absorbed into Wai/WEC Squadron, together being known as the Waikato Squadron, although no official title change took place. The Squadron's recruiting boundaries were reduced to conform to those of the Haurakis, which excluded the Wellington/East Coast region. The years that followed proved a particular challenge to the Squadron, as it fought to retain its existence, separate identity and mounted reconnaissance role. At the TF Seminar in August 2002, the Chief of Army, Major General Mateparae, directed that ‚Äì in the interests of fostering unit pride, respecting tradition, raising morale, strengthening links with local communities and assisting recruitment ‚Äì Territorial units (and where appropriate sub-units) would revert to their previous titles. To accommodate these changes, Territorial infantry regiments would form battalion groups; thus the Haurakis would become the 6th (Hauraki) Battalion Group in which Wai/WEC Squadron would be a sub-unit. The re-adoption of historical titles did not alter battalion group boundaries, so with the loss of the Wellington East Coast region it was inappropriate to maintain the WEC part of the Squadron's title. This provided the opportunity for the Squadron to return to its historical roots and revive the title of the Waikato Mounted Rifles. In early 2003, and strongly supported by the Waikato Mounted Rifles Regimental Association, a formal submission was made to alter the Squadron's title. This was approved by the Chief of Army in September of the same year. A further submission was to follow. This was for the restoration of the WMR hat and collar badges. After a protracted campaign, this was eventually agreed in April 2006. Based exactly on the pre-1914 originals, it was not however until May 2008 that the new badges were finally presented to Squadron personnel by the then Colonel Commandant RNZAC, Brigadier IH Duthie, CNZM. In 2003, WMR's role was defined as: \\"...to provide general purpose medium reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition in order to support New Zealand Light Armoured Vehicle mounted battalion operations. It is to provide trained personnel to top up and round out Queen Alexandra‚Äôs Squadron...\\"Chief of Army Directive 20/03: Maintenance of the New Zealand Army's Reconnaissance Capability, dated 3 November 2003. Partly as a result of diminishing resources, and partly due to the low priority accorded the TF within the Army, WMR had by then moved from reconnaissance training on FV101 Scorpion CVR(T) and M113 APCs to modified V8 Land Rovers. By the start of the 21st century some of the latter vehicles were actually older than their crews. In 2004 the Government purchased from Automotive Technik (UK) 321 armoured and non-armoured Pinzgauer Light Operational Vehicles (LOV) to replace the Army's ageing Land Rover fleet. It was only in 2007 that the decision was made that WMR would be equipped with the 6 x 6 armoured (and armed) version of LOV, and the following year WMR received sufficient vehicles for one troop. While these vehicles may not perfectly fit the Squadron's role, they have provided the crucial training platform necessary to continue as a reserve reconnaissance squadron. As part of a revised policy of integrating non-infantry TF units into the RF (or re-integrating in the case of WMR), in July 2012 the Squadron left the Haurakis and returned to QAMR as the regiment's reserve squadron. WMR's role was now defined as being to provide a reserve cavalry capability to the NZ Army, focusing on a mounted reconnaissance and surveillance skill set. With the re-integration of WMR into QAMR, a formal proposal for the presentation of a Guidon to the Squadron was withdrawn. Current organisation Based in Hamilton (pop.141,000) in the Waikato, upper North Island, WMR is normally equipped with the armoured version of the Pinzgauer LOV, armed with either a single 7.62mm FN MAG 58 MG or a 7.62mm FN Minimi MG.In 2014 all of the NZ Army's armoured LOVs were withdrawn from units and centralised in two pools. WMR can draw vehicles when required for training from those held in Waiouru. In September 2014 it was announced that QAMR in Linton would transfer two non-armoured LOVs to Hamilton for use by WMR. The Squadron is presently configured for up to 70 personnel in two light reconnaissance troops mounted in LOV, together with a skeleton Squadron headquarters, an administrative section and a forward repair team. In future it is hoped that a small composite troop with LAV crewmen and a dismounted scout section will be added. If deployed, the Squadron's strength would be raised to 102 personnel, with the additional manpower creating a full NZLAV troop and rounding out the two LOV troops and Squadron headquarters. QAMR's two regular squadrons are equipped with the NZLAV (a version of the General Dynamics Land Systems Canada 8 x 8 LAVIII), armed with the M242 25mm chain gun and two 7.62mm MGs. QAMR is based at Linton Military Camp outside Palmerston North (pop.80,000) in the lower North Island. Alliances An alliance between the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles and the British 4/7th Royal Dragoons (today the Royal Dragoon Guards) was formed in 1926. This alliance was inherited by QAMR when Wai/WEC Squadron was transferred to the 6th Battalion (Hauraki) RNZIR in 1999. An alliance between the RNZAC and the British Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) was formed in 1966. In January 1967, in recognition of this alliance, Her Majesty The Queen (as Captain-General of the RNZAC and Colonel-in-Chief of the RTR) gave her approval for members of the RNZAC to wear the RTR's tank arm badge. Regimental Association Following the successful bid to restore the WMR title to the Squadron, members of the WMR Regimental Association (founded in 1946) amended their Rules in 2004 to admit and welcome past and serving personnel of the Squadron as members of the Association. Some Squadron personnel were also invited to join the Association's committee. Today there are about 140 members, of whom roughly one third are currently serving in WMR. Regimental history: 'Waikato Troopers'  In 2007 the first complete history of WMR, 'Waikato Troopers', was written and published by Richard Stowers, a military historian and author living in Hamilton. The Foreword to 'Waikato Troopers' was written by Lieutenant General Mateparae (then Chief of the Defence Force and now Governor-General of New Zealand). In it he wrote: \\"New Zealand has a tradition of military service that, in large part, rests on the service of citizen soldiers in both peace and war. The men of the Waikato Mounted Rifles represent that tradition admirably.\\" In memoriam The Government declared 2006 to be the 'Year of the Veteran' and established a Community Grants Fund. The WMR Regimental Association successfully applied for funding to enable a number of memorial plaques to be commissioned, dedicated to the memory of former comrades who lost their lives in conflicts overseas. Rather than a single memorial, the Association preferred the idea of placing these plaques in churches and public grounds in settlements and towns in the heart of the Waikato, where WMR still recruits and trains today.Although a diminishing number of soldiers joining WMR now come from a rural background. In 1914 about 60% of WMR's personnel came from farming occupations, 30% were tradesmen from small rural centres and the rest were clerical and professional. A survey in 2007 revealed that the corresponding figures were: farming occupations 10%, tradesmen 46% and clerical and professional (now including tertiary students) 44% [see Stowers, Waikato Troopers, pp. 68 and 274]. Between 2007 and 2010 eight plaques were dedicated and unveiled in Waerenga, Te Kauwhata, Te Awamutu (2), Hamilton (2) and Cambridge (2). Beneath the WMR title and badge, the inscription on each plaque reads: \\"In memory of those from this district [or town/city, as appropriate] who lost their lives on active service and in honour of all those who served.\\" Mounted riflemen from the Waikato have served in all the overseas conflicts in which New Zealanders have fought. Casualty figures are incomplete, but recent researchStowers, Waikato Troopers. has revealed that eight died in South Africa; 74 at Gallipoli; and 42 in Sinai and Palestine. One hundred and fifty-eight were wounded on Gallipoli and in the Middle East. It is impossible to discover the exact losses of former WMR servicemen during the Second World War, for unlike the First World War, WMR did not send and sustain a formed service squadron overseas for the duration. Aside from the Div Cav, to which all nine mounted rifles regiments then in existence contributed, WMR's soldiers were drafted as reinforcements, mainly to the 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade, but also to the infantry and some even to the Navy and Air Force. It is known that 29 former WMR soldiers were killed in action with the Div Cav.Amongst whom was Captain Jim Wynyard who was killed in action at El Alamein on 2 November 1942. A former All Black, he had played 21 games for Waikato and eight times for the All Blacks during their 1935‚Äì36 tour of Britain. He distinguished himself in the battle for Crete. In the face of enemy fire he several times went back to rescue wounded men. Another Waikato man said, \\"If only there'd been another officer present to verify that bravery, Jim would have won the V.C.\\" See Te Awamutu Online A further 14 died in other units,Including Captain Tom Paterson m.i.d., who when Signals Officer for the Headquarters 4th NZ Infantry Brigade was severely wounded in the battle for Ruweisat Ridge and died on the night of 15/16 July 1942, as a prisoner of war. His father, Lieutenant Colonel T.Paterson, commanded WMR 1933‚Äì1937; his brother Bryce also served in WMR and his sister Jean was known as the 'Daughter of the Regiment'. This honorary title dated from her birth on the Paterson's farm near NgƒÅruawƒÅhia in May 1916 when WMR were camping there during training. To mark the occasion regimental officers presented her with a suitably engraved silver cup, which she in turn presented to WMR in 2007, some 91 years later. but sadly the list is incomplete. While it is not known whether any former WMR soldiers died in either the Korean or Vietnam wars, the only New Zealander to be killed in action in East Timor (in 2000) came from the WaikatoPrivate Leonard Manning, from Te Kauwhata. and had previously served in the Squadron for several years before transferring to the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. Since 2000, some 37 members of WMR have served on operational deployments overseas in East Timor, the Solomon Islands, South Korea and Afghanistan, but so far without incurring any further losses.

It is situated on a hill off the Neretva branch, 5 km south of ƒåapljina, alongside the road to Gabela in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area is currently protected by the state and is surrounded by a park and a horse farm. The nearby horse riding club was founded 2004 and attracts over 300,000 visitors per year. History An Italic settler had a private manor complex built for agricultural purposes on the Mogorjelo site in the mid first century CE. He located the building designed for processing agricultural produce (villa rustica fructuaria) on a salient on the hill (the ground plan of the villa lies near the north or main gate of the walls of later date), and the residential building (villa rustica habitatoria) on the south slope exposed to the sun. This building burned down in the third century. In the early fourth century, a state-owned estate was constructed over the ruins, with a villa which now forms the major feature of the complex. During the third century the property probably changed hands to become state-owned. The villa at Mogorjelo supplied the town of Narone, the ruins of which lie in the village of Vid near Metkoviƒá. The estate was destroyed in a major fire. The latest coins discovered on this site, in a layer of soot, were minted by Honorius in 388, so that it may be assumed that Mogorjelo fell into enemy hands some time between 401 and 403 with the Visigoth invasion of these parts. Life continued in these new circumstances. In the mid fifth century, two basilicas were erected within the ruined perimeter walls in the north-eastern corner of the former villa, first one to the north and immediately thereafter the one to the south. To judge from various conversion works within the buildings, it appears that they were converted to residential use. Some items of Carolingian provenance, dating from the ninth century, have been found in the round tower and adjacent premises. Burials took place all over the site and its surroundings from the period of construction of late antique churches to the nineteenth century.

The new magnet school was established as a means to reconnect African-American students with African traditions. The school mascot is the Scarlet Knight. Southeast had been a KCMO public high school from the 1930s until it was reestablished in 1997. The mascot was simply \\"the Knights.\\" Until the late 1960s, most of the students were white. As more black families moved from the inner city to the more middle-class southeastern section of KC, white families began to flee to the suburbs. As a result, Southeast's student body rapidly changed to majority black by the early 1970s. For the 2016-17 school year, Southeast was reopened, with the combination of Southwest Early College Campus, and African Centered College Preparatory Academy.

He is also considered to be one of the first generation virtual reality and augmented reality researchers. While earning a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Krueger worked on a number of early interactive computer artworks. In 1969, he collaborated with Dan Sandin, Jerry Erdman and Richard Venezky on a computer- controlled environment called \\"glowflow,\\" a computer-controlled light sound environment that responded to the people within it. Krueger went on to develop Metaplay, an integration of visuals, sounds, and responsive techniques into a single framework. In this, the computer was used to create a unique real-time relationship between the participants in the gallery and the artist in another building. In 1971, his \\"Psychic space\\" used a sensory floor to perceive the participants' movements around the environment. A later project, \\"Videoplace,\\" was funded by the National Endowment for the arts and a two-way exhibit was shown at the Milwaukee Art Museum in 1975. From 1974 to 1978 M. Krueger performed computer graphics research at the Space Science and Engineering Center of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in exchange for institutional support for his \\"Videoplace\\" work. In 1978, joined the computer science faculty at the University of Connecticut, where he taught courses in hardware, software, computer graphics and artificial intelligence. \\"Videoplace\\" has been exhibited widely in both art and science contexts in the United States and Canada, and it was also shown in Japan. It was included in the SIGGRAPH Art Show in 1985 and 1990. \\"Videoplace\\" was also the featured exhibit at SIGCHI (Computer-Human Interaction Conference) in 1985 and 1989, and at the 1990 Ars Electronica Festival. Instead of taking the virtual reality track of head- mounted display and data glove (which would come later in the 1980s), he investigated projections onto walls. Small Planet, at Mediartech '98, Florence, Italy Krueger later used the hardware from Videoplace for another piece, Small Planet. In this work, participants are able to fly over a small, computer-generated, 3D planet. Flying is done by holding one's arms out, like a child pretending to fly, and leaning left or right and moving up or down. Small Planet was shown at SIGGRAPH '93, Interaction '97 (Ogaki, Japan), Mediartech '98 (Florence, Italy). He envisioned the art of interactivity, as opposed to art that happens to be interactive. That is, the idea that exploring the space of interactions between humans and computers was interesting. The focus was on the possibilities of interaction itself, rather than on an art project, which happens to have some response to the user. Though his work was somewhat unheralded in mainstream VR thinking for many years as it moved down a path that culminated in the \\"goggles 'n gloves\\" archetype, his legacy has experienced greater interest as more recent technological approaches (such as CAVE and Powerwall implementations) move toward the unencumbered interaction approaches championed by Krueger.

Nyssa Raatko was created by Greg Rucka and Klaus Janson for the Batman series of comic books. She is an enemy of Batman. She is the daughter of Ra's al Ghul and the half-sister of Talia al Ghul. Nyssa made her first live-action appearance as a recurring character on the television series Arrow starting in the second season, played by Katrina Law. She also appeared in the final season of Gotham, portrayed by Jaime Murray. Fictional character biography In Batman: Death and the Maidens, it is revealed that Ra's al Ghul had a love child born during his travels in Russia in the 18th century named Nyssa. Enamored by the romantic stories that her mother told her about Ra's as a child, Nyssa sets out to find Ra's and eventually locates him at his headquarters in North Africa. Impressed by her beauty, her warrior skills, and the fact that she was able to locate him, he promotes her to a position similar to that later held by her half-sister, Talia. As a right hand associate, she accompanies him during his adventures. Ra's is so impressed with her abilities, he even allows Nyssa to use his Lazarus Pits. Like her sister Talia, Nyssa eventually becomes disenchanted with Ra's genocidal plans to \\"cleanse the Earth\\", and disassociates herself from her father sometime in the early 20th century. Ra's reluctantly approves this, believing that she will return to him and that she or her children will become his future heirs. To his disappointment, Nyssa refuses to give herself or her family to him, causing him to disown her permanently. He does however allow her to keep a Lazarus Pit for herself and, much to his surprise, she finds a way to reuse it, allowing her to survive until modern times. =The Second World War= During World War II, Nyssa and her family are quickly sent to a concentration camp, where Nyssa's entire family dies and she is rendered infertile by very Mengele-style experiments. At one point she begs Ra's for help, but he refuses her, stating that, while he does not agree with Hitler's ideological agenda, his cause could only be aided by the millions who will be exterminated by Hitler's scheme. =Death and the Maidens= Broken by her horrifying experiences during this time, and enraged that Ra's has abandoned her and her family to die at the hands of the Nazis, Nyssa is finally motivated to act when her great-grandsonher last living descendant - is killed. She plots to by befriending, kidnapping, and brainwashing Talia and using her to kill Ra's. To this end, she captures Talia and, using a Lazarus Pit, kills and resurrects her in rapid succession, leaving Talia virtually broken from the trauma of dying again and again in so short a time. Rendered apathetic by her time in the camp, unable to feel anything, Nyssa then attempts to destroy all hope and optimism in the world by assassinating Superman with Kryptonite bullets she steals from the Batcave, hoping that, by uniting the world in one moment of tragedy, she will manage to rouse herself once more. While Batman is successful in preventing the assassination of Superman, he is unable to stop Ra's from being killed by Nyssa.Death and The Maidens #8 (May 2004) This in turn is part of a greater plan by Ra's to ensure that his daughters, both initially dissatisfied with his plans, will realize that he is right, and that they would come to accept their destinies as his heirs. Realizing and accepting this, both Nyssa and Talia become the heads of the League of Assassins. Talia disavows her love for Bruce Wayne, and both half-sisters declare Batman to be their enemy, Nyssa promising that she will not fail her father as Batman departs. =Lazarus Pit= The origins of the Lazarus Pit were accidentally discovered by Ra's al Ghul while digging a pit. The Lazarus pit can grant restorative properties that can heal injuries and even grant immortality. Nyssa is in possession of one of the world's last Lazarus Pits, which has granted her longevity and the ability to heal her wounds; she survives The Holocaust thanks to its powers. She also found the ability to use the pit multiple times. She is also extremely wealthy, especially since she assumes control of Ra's' organization and joins forces with Talia. Like her father and half-sister, she knows Batman's secret identity and the location of the Batcave. In the Batcave, a Lazarus Pit was created by Batman after he learned that the Pits were necessary to maintain the stability of the world. A third seems to exist high in the Himalayas, used by Black Adam to revive Isis. A fourth Lazarus Pit was revealed to exist in the Australian outback; and a fifth in Tibet. =\\"Infinite Crisis\\"= During \\"Infinite Crisis\\", Nyssa and her sister connive to use Talia's membership in Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains in order to take over the planet. Nyssa tries to recruit Batgirl (as Cassandra Cain) to stand at her side as \\"The One Who Is All\\". She attempts to explain why she is working with the villains of the Society to Batgirl: Cassandra refuses, and, along with Mr. Freeze, escapes from Nyssa's grasp. In \\"One Year Later\\", Nyssa is seen in Northern Africa, planning an unknown plot with two terrorists. As she gets into her car to leave, it explodes.Robin (vol. 4) #148 (May 2006) In the following issue, Lady Shiva reports that Nyssa Raatko is dead where she was probably killed by the League of Assassins.Robin (vol. 4) #149 (June 2006) In other media =Television= Arrowverse Katrina Law as Nyssa al Ghul in Arrow. * Nyssa al Ghul appears as a recurring character in the CW series Arrow, portrayed by Katrina Law. First appearing in season two, she is established as having saved Sara Lance's life and later recruited into the League with the two also entering a relationship. She spends much of season two attempting to recruit Sara back to the League, before teaming up with Oliver Queen, Sara and their allies to take down Deathstroke. In season three, following Sara's murder, Nyssa trains Laurel Lance to follow in her sister's footsteps. Nyssa and Oliver are later married as part of Ra's al Ghul's scheme to recruit a worthy successor. In the season finale, Nyssa works with Oliver and his allies to defeat and kill Ra's, with Oliver appointing Malcolm Merlyn as his successor. In season four, she opposes Laurel's reckless scheme to resurrect Sara using the Lazarus Pit and uses a potion that her father gave her in case the Lazarus Pit fell into the wrong hands to destroy it. The League civil war ends with Oliver defeating Malcolm, however, Nyssa declines the leadership of the League and instead disbands it. In season five, Oliver recruits both Nyssa and Malcolm as part of his team to oppose Adrian Chase and his team, which includes Nyssa's sister Talia. In season six, Nyssa battles the Thanatos Guild, a group of former League of Assassins members still loyal to the now dead Malcolm Merlyn. Nyssa and Team Arrow locate a map of secret Lazarus Pits, which she, Thea Queen and Roy Harper set out to destroy. Nyssa is later seen in a flashforward in season seven, training Mia Smoak, Oliver and Felicity's secret daughter, throughout her childhood. In the series finale episode \\"Fadeout\\" Nyssa has reconciles with Talia at Oliver's funeral. * Law reprises her role in the spin-off series Legends of Tomorrow. The episode \\"Left Behind\\" reveals that Nyssa's first meeting with Sara is the result of a Bootstrap paradox as Sara of 2016 becomes marooned in 1958 and rejoins the League until 1960 when the Legends come to the rescue. Before leaving she tells Ra's to send his yet to be born daughter (Nyssa) to Lian Yu in 2008, where Nyssa will meet Sara. She makes an appearance in \\"River in Time\\", where Sara says goodbye to her before she leaves on the Waverider. * Nyssa al-Ghul apeears in one of the tie-in comic books of the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event, alongside with Felicity Smoak, The Ray, and Wally West. Gotham Nyssa al Ghul appears as the primary antagonist in the fifth and final season of the Fox crime series Gotham, portrayed by Jaime Murray. She is first introduced under the alias of Theresa Walker, a government official who sends the military unit Delta Force led by Eduardo Dorrance to assist Jim Gordon and the GCPD in restoring order following the city's designation as a No Man's Land. After transforming a mortally wounded Eduardo into the superhuman \\"Bane\\" with the help of Hugo Strange, she sets a plan in motion to get revenge against Bruce Wayne and Barbara Kean for the death of her father. She has Strange perform an experiment for her to control Dorrance's commanding officer General Wade into initiating Special Order 386, an order to reduce a city to rubble if it is irretrievably lost. She then goes to the Sirens, killing the female League of Assassins members there. After knocking out Leslie Thompkins, Nyssa introduces herself to Barbara while rubbing her hand on Barbara's newborn child. Afterwards, Nyssa takes Barbara prisoner and decides to raise the child as her own, though Gordon arrives and rescues both of them. Barbara then stabs her, although Nyssa manages to force the brainwashed Wade into killing himself before fleeing. Ultimately, Nyssa's plan to destroy Gotham fails after Bane and those involved are apprehended by the U.S. military who were persuaded not to go along with Delta Force's plot. She manages to escape in a submarine built by Oswald Cobblepot and Edward Nygma where Cobblepot's dog Edward is. =Film=Nyssa is seen in Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in an online file when the Ninja Turtles were looking on the information of Ra's al Ghul and his obtaining longevity via Lazarus Pits. =Video games= Nyssa Raatko is referenced in Batman: Arkham Origins.

Retrieved December 23, 2016 Like the comics, Nyssa is depicted as Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She appears in the \\"Season of Infamy\\" DLC in the \\"Shadow War\\" story. Nyssa is leading a rebellious faction of the League of Assassins. When Batman arrives at a previously-unknown secondary Lazarus pit (separate from the one located in Wonder City) and prepares to blow it up after taking a sample, Nyssa confronts him along with a few of her separatist forces. She takes the detonator and reasons with Batman that each time Ra's al Ghul is resurrected, he becomes less and less of a man, and gives him an ultimatum: deny him the remnants of the Lazarus and she will recall all her forces from Gotham taking the war elsewhere. After detonating the explosive gel that Batman sprayed all over the pit, Nyssa leaves Batman to his own devices. When Batman returns to Elliot Memorial Hospital where a decrepit Ra's al Ghul is hooked up to a constant supply of Lazarus, Batman can go with one of two choices both of them involving Nyssa:  Batman can give the Lazarus to Ra's al Ghul at which point Batman is forced to fight Nyssa and her separatists. Not soon after, Ra's al Ghul regains his former strength and remarks that Nyssa is a traitor where he slashes her torso. Batman tries to fight him, but Ra's al Ghul steals one of his smoke bombs and disappears. Batman offers to save Nyssa with the remaining Lazarus, but she refuses. Batman comforts Nyssa in her dying moments and closes her eyes before he leaves.  Batman can deny Ra's al Ghul and after he takes care of Ra's al Ghul's loyalists, Nyssa arrives to see what her father has ultimately become. As she is about to strike him down, Batman stops her and says that he will take him to the GCPD. Nyssa is sated and lives up to her word, recalling all her forces from Gotham while Batman takes Ra's al Ghul to a special cell and straps him to a gurney.

He entered the Society of Jesus, 5 Oct, 1670, and after completing the usual course of study taught grammar and humanities for seven years. His long-cherished desire to labor in the missions of the East was gratified in 1685, when he joined the group of Jesuits who had been chosen to found the French mission in China. For the first leg of the trip, he was attached to the embassy of the Chevalier de Chaumont to Siam, and was accompanied by a group of Jesuit mathematicians (Jean de Fontaney (1643‚Äì1710), Joachim Bouvet (1656‚Äì1730), Louis Le Comte (1655‚Äì1728), Guy Tachard (1648‚Äì1712) and Claude de Visdelou (1656‚Äì1737)).Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China - Page 182 by Catherine Pagani (2001) Tachard would remain in Siam besides King Narai, but the others would reach China in 1687. The location of Nerchinsk on this 17th-century d'Anville's map is, no doubt, due to Gerbillon's observation Upon their arrival in Beijing they were received by the Kangxi Emperor who was favorably impressed by them and retained Gerbillion and Joachim Bouvet at the court. This famous monarch realized the value of the services which the fathers could render to him owing to their scientific attainments, and they on their part were glad in this way to win his favour and gain prestige in order to further the interests of the infant mission. As soon as they had learned the language of the country, Gerbillion with Thomas Pereira, one of his companions, was sent as interpreter to Nerchinsk with the ambassadors commissioned to treat with the Russians regarding the boundaries of the two empires, which were determined in the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689). This was but the beginning of his travels, during which he was often attached to the suite of the emperor. He made eight different journeys into \\"Tartary\\" (i.e., Manchuria and Mongolia). On one of these he was an eyewitness to the campaign in which Kangxi defeated the Oirats. On his last journey he accompanied the three commissioners who regulated public affairs and established new laws among the Khalkha Mongols, who had yielded allegiance to the emperor. He availed himself of this opportunity to determine the latitude and longitude of a number of places in what is today the Northeastern China and adjacent areas of Russia and Mongolia. Gerbillion was for a time in charge of the French college in Beijing, and afterwards became superior-general of the mission. He enjoyed the special friendship and esteem of the emperor, who had a high opinion of his ability and frequently availed himself of his scientific and diplomatic services. He was withal a zealous missionary, and in 1692 obtained an edict granting the free exercise of the Christian religion. After the emperor's recovery from a fever, during which he was attended by Gerbillion and Bouvet, he showed his gratitude by bestowing on them a site for a chapel and residence. Gerbillion was a skilled linguist. He was the author of several works on mathematics, and wrote an account of his travels in Tatary. These relations are valuable for their accurate account of the typography of the country, the customs of the people, and also for the details of life of the missionaries at the court. Additionally, his writings, which documented foreign fauna, were important for studies in natural history, and even veterinary medicine.

He was heir apparent to the throne of Greece and was its crown prince from birth, remaining so during his father's reign until the monarchy's abolition. As a male-line descendant of Christian IX of Denmark, he is also a Danish prince. Early life =Birth= Pavlos was born on 20 May 1967 at Tatoi Palace in Athens, to King Constantine II and Queen Anne Marie. His mother is the youngest sister of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and his father is a brother of Queen Sophia of Spain. His maternal grandparents were King Frederick IX of Denmark and his wife Princess Ingrid of Sweden. He displaced his older sister, Alexia, born in 1965, as heir to the throne, Greece's order of succession adhering to male-preference primogeniture. =Military coup and abolition of the monarchy= Pavlos was born into a turbulent era in Greek politics. His father, King Constantine II, ascended to the throne on 6 March 1964, aged 23, following the death of his father, King Paul. His mother, the 20-year-old Queen Anne-Marie, gave birth to Pavlos barely a month after the coup d'√©tat which ended democratic rule in Greece over the King's objections on 21 April 1967, ushering in the \\"Regime of the Colonels\\", led by Georgios Papadopoulos. In December of that year, King Constantine attempted a counter-coup, but could not rally sufficient military support. Pursued by supporters of the junta, the King fled with his wife, children, mother and sister to Rome. From Rome they went to Copenhagen, and lived with Queen Anne-Marie's mother, Queen Ingrid. During the years 1967‚Äì1973, Greece remained officially a monarchy, with a regency appointed while the King lived in exile.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh. \\"Burke‚Äôs Royal Families of the World: Volume I Europe & Latin America, 1977, pp. 67, 316, 327-328, 516. On 1 June 1973, Constantine II was declared deposed and Georgios Papadopoulos became the self-appointed President of Greece. On 17 November 1974, the 1974 Greek legislative election was held, resulting in a victory for Constantine Karamanlis and his New Democracy party. Less than a month later, on 8 December, the Greek plebiscite of 1974 confirmed a referendum of the previous year: the majority of Greek voters preferred a republican constitution (69%) to restoration of the monarchy (31%). Constantine II accepted that his reign was at an end. He and Anne Marie had been living with their family in London for several years. Pavlos' youngest siblings were born in London, Theodora in 1983 and Philippos in 1986. Education and career Pavlos was educated in London at the Hellenic College of London, founded by his parents. He attended the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West, Montezuma, New Mexico, USA, from 1984 to 1986. After training at the British Army's Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards in 1987 on a three-year short service commission.Eilers, Marlene. Queen Victoria's Daughters. Rosvall Royal Books, Falkoping, Sweden, 1997. pp. 32-33, 130, 132, 173. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1989, and relinquished his commission in April 1990. In 1993 he completed his BA at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and later while sharing a house in Washington, DC, he and his cousin, Felipe VI of Spain, then Prince of Asturias, attended Georgetown University where both obtained a Master of Science in Foreign Service in 1995. As an adult he has lived in New York City and London, working as an investment consultant.de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. Le Petit Gotha. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery.

Miller. Marriage and issue Pavlos married British-born heiress Marie-Chantal Miller, whom he had met at a party three years earlier in New Orleans, on 1 July 1995. The Greek Orthodox rite wedding at St Sophia's Cathedral, London drew a rare modern panoply of royalty, but the ceremony proved to be legally invalid and had eventually to be repeated civilly (not normally required in the UK) in Chelsea because of an obscure law requiring that marriages in England be conducted in English. After their marriage, the couple took up residence in Greenwich, Connecticut, the job that Pavlos obtained with the Charles R. Weber ship- broking company being headquartered there. Later, he went to work at a New York City firm as an investment portfolio manager, before relocation to London for their children's education in 2004. The couple have five children: Maria- Olympia (b. 1996), Constantine-Alexios (b. 1998), Achileas-Andreas (b. 2000), Odysseas-Kimon (b. 2004), and Aristidis-Stavros (b. 2008).

He was the eldest son of the King of Greece, grandson of the King of Denmark and great-grandson of the King of Sweden, all living and enthroned when he was born. His paternal aunt, Queen Sof√≠a of Spain, was Queen Consort of Spain. His maternal aunt, Margrethe II of Denmark, is the reigning Queen of Denmark. By male-line descent, he is a member of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg branch of the House of Oldenburg. Pavlos is a scion multiple times of the \\"Grandparents of Europe\\", due to royal intermarriage. As a result, he descends from Christian IX of Denmark through three of his children; in the male line through George I of Greece, in the female line through Frederick VIII of Denmark and through King Christian's daughter Princess Thyra, Duchess of Cumberland. He also descends thrice from Queen Victoria: once through her third son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and twice through her eldest daughter Victoria, Princess Royal.

W. Scarff of the Admiralty Air Department for use on two-seater aircraft. The mount incorporated bungee cord suspension in elevation to compensate for the weight of the gun, and allowed an airgunner in an open cockpit to swivel and elevate his weapon (a Lewis machine gun) quickly, and easily fire in any direction. Later models permitted the fitting of two Lewis guns; while this doubled the firepower available, operation of the paired guns was more cumbersome, and required considerable strength from the gunner, especially at altitude, so that many gunners preferred the original single gun - and this became the postwar standard. In either case, the mounting was simple and rugged, and gave its operator an excellent field of fire. It was widely adapted and copied for other airforces. As well as becoming a standard fitting in the British forces during the First World War, the Scarff ring was used in the postwar Royal Air Force for many years. Perhaps the last British aircraft to use the mounting was the Supermarine Walrus amphibian prototype. Scarff was also involved in the development of the Scarff-Dibovsky synchronization gear. Although it was a seemingly simple device, later attempts to emulate the Scarff ring as a mounting for the dorsal Vickers K in the World War II Handley Page Hampden bomber were failures. Handley Page had designed a carriage with ball-bearing wheels running on a track around the cockpit. Vibration when firing shook the balls out, jamming the mounting. In the 1930s, the Germans developed a similar system called the Drehkranz D 30 (German: \\"turntable\\") which was used on a number of German aircraft, most notably the Junkers Ju 52.http://www.luftarchiv.de/ In British use the Scarff ring was replaced in the 1930s by specialised power-operated turrets such as those made by Boulton Paul or Nash & Thompson, aircraft air speeds having by then risen to the point where a manually-operated gun was infeasible.

He was co-author of the bill for the Tennessee Valley Authority and from 1933 to 1936 he supported the New Deal programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which brought investment and jobs to the South. After 1937 he was active in the Conservative Coalition that largely controlled domestic policy. Rankin proposed a bill to prohibit interracial marriage and opposed a bill to prohibit state use of the poll tax, which southern states had used since the turn of the century to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. He used his power to support segregation and deny federal benefits of varied programs to African Americans. For instance, in 1944, following the Port Chicago disaster, the U.S. Navy asked Congress to authorize payments of $5,000 to each of the victims' families. But when Rankin learned most of the dead were black sailors, he insisted the amount be reduced to $2,000; Congress settled the amount at $3,000 per family.Allen, The Port Chicago Mutiny, 67. He was the main House sponsor of the GI Bill. Rankin insisted that its administration be decentralized, which led to continued discrimination against black veterans in the South and their virtual exclusion from one of the most important postwar programs to build social capital among United States residents. In the South, black veterans were excluded from loans, training and employment assistance. The historically black colleges were underfunded and could accept only about half the men who wanted to enroll.Gavin Wright, \\"The New Deal and the Modernization of the South\\", Federal History 2 (2010): 58-73. On the floor of the House, Rankin expressed racist views of African Americans, Japanese Americans,\\"Executive Order 9066 ‚Äì The internment of 110,000 Japanese Americans\\" by Maisie & Richard Conrat, published by the Asian American Studies Center, University of California, Los Angeles, P34 and Jews, accusing Albert Einstein of being a communist agitator. During World War II, Rankin supported a bill to incarcerate all Japanese Americans in the US and its territories in camps; almost all ethnic Japanese on the West Coast were incarcerated in inland camps. In the late 20th century, Congress authorized payment of reparations to survivors and their descendants. Early life Rankin was born near Bolanda in Itawamba County, Mississippi to a family that had planter ancestors with large holdings before the Civil War. His parents were Thomas Braxton Rankin, a schoolteacher and resident of Tupelo, and Venola Modeste (n√©e Rutledge), born in Arkansas as the daughter of Robert Rutledge and Ellen (n√©e Conoway) Rutledge. His paternal ancestors had come to Mississippi from South Carolina in 1840. After attending local schools and a normal school, Rankin went to college, graduating from the University of Mississippi law school in 1910. He set up a practice in Clay County near where he grew up. He married Annie Laurie Burrous. They had a daughter, Annie Laurie Rankin. He became prosecuting attorney of Lee County in 1912, a position he held until 1915.\\"John E. Rankin\\" , Biographical Dictionary of the United States =Military service= Rankin served in the United States Army during World War I.Vickers, Kenneth Wayne. \\"John Rankin: Democrat and Demagogue.\\" Master's thesis, Mississippi State University, 1993. Political career Roosevelt signing the Rural Electrification Act in 1935, with Rankin (left) and Senator George W. Norris (R-Nebraska) (right). =Election to Congress= In 1920, Rankin was elected to the House as a Democrat. Since passage of a new constitution in 1890 that effectively disenfranchised African Americans, Mississippi had become a one-party state dominated by Democrats. Rankin served sixteen consecutive terms (March 4, 1921 - January 3, 1953) as Mississippi's First District Representative. Appointed to the Census Committee as a freshman congressman, Rankin played an important role in opposing a reapportionment bill that would have reduced the representation of Mississippi, as well as one to reduce the overall representation of the South. Both bills were based on the fact that Southern states had disenfranchised most of their black voters but kept apportionment based on total population in each state, resulting in outsize representation for their white populations. The powerful Democrats consistently defeated northern representatives' effort to reduce southern apportionment.\\"John Rankin: Congressman Served Sixteen Consecutive Terms\\", newspaper obituary Rankin coauthored the bill to create the Tennessee Valley Authority, bringing major investment into the rural South. He was a supporter of the Rural Electrification Administration under President Roosevelt's administration, which also benefited many Southerners. He strongly supported Roosevelt's New Deal and advocated economic intervention in poor rural communities, but expected that most benefits would flow to southern whites. He supported racial segregation and opposed civil rights legislation.Lone Star Rising: Lyndon Johnson & His Times, 1908‚Äì1960, Dallek, R. (OUP, 1991) p. 505. After 1937 he became active in the Conservative Coalition that largely controlled domestic policy. Rankin opposed the creation of the UN, stating, \\"The United Nations is the greatest fraud in all History. Its purpose is to destroy the United States.\\" =Veteran's affairs= Rankin chaired the Committee on World War Veterans' Legislation (Seventy-second through Seventy- ninth Congresses1931 to 1947: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1955, Vol 22, p. 845.) and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs (Eighty-first and Eighty-second Congresses.1949 to 1953 Britannia (Ibid)). In the first role he was the main House sponsor of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, known as the G.I. Bill of Rights. Edward Humes says it was Rankin \\"who served as the primary force behind the version of the bill that actually got passed into law.\\" He insisted on a provision that the federal program would be administered in a decentralized manner by the states. This ensured that southern states could continue to practice discrimination against black veterans. According to historian Gavin Wright, \\"In a comprehensive econometric analysis, Sarah Turner and John Bound find that although the GI Bill had substantial positive benefits for black and white veterans outside the South, \\"those from the South made no significant gains in educational attainment.\\" Rankin sought to prevent the desegregation of VA hospitals. He argued for treating black veterans in rural, isolated all-black hospitals. =House Un-American Activities Committee= Rankin helped establish the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) as a standing committee in Congress in February 1945 by leading the conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats.Kern, Gary. A Death in Washington: Walter G. Krivitsky and the Stalin Terror, Enigma Books, 2013, p. 384 In the postwar years, he was active in probing the Communist Party, USA. He was criticized for failing to investigate violence and murder perpetrated by chapters of the Ku Klux Klan. After HUAC's chief counsel Ernest Adamson announced: \\"The committee has decided that it lacks sufficient data on which to base a probe,\\" Rankin added: \\"After all, the KKK is an old American institution.\\"John Gunther Inside U.S.A., (London, Hamish Hamilton, 1947, p. 789) Bigotry =African Americans= Rankin introduced a bill in 1920 to prohibit interracial marriage. During that decade, he opposed bills to make lynching a federal crime; although such a bill overwhelmingly passed the House, it was not approved by the Senate. In these positions, he was similar to other southern Democrats: he opposed other bills to support African-American civil rights, such as any efforts toward desegregation and the elimination of poll taxes for federal elections. Poll taxes had been used by southern states to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites since the turn of the century. Rankin argued that equal opportunity hiring practices (as required by the Roosevelt administration for defense contractors) \\"persecuted\\" whites, anti-lynching bills encouraged rape, and racial equality would destroy \\"the white man's civilization throughout the world.\\" During World War II, Rankin alleged that the U.S. Army's loss of a certain battle was due to the cowardice of black soldiers. Fellow Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas replied that many black soldiers had been decorated for bravery despite serving in a segregated Army.Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate, Caro, R. (New York, Knopf, 2002) p. 346. Rankin was known to use the slur nigger on the floor of the House. When African American Adam Clayton Powell Jr. was elected to Congress from New York in 1944, Rankin vowed to avoid sitting next to him. In 1945, Powell, a fellow Democrat, called for Rankin's impeachment. Although freshmen congressmen were expected not to speak during their first year in office, Powell rose after one of Rankin's outbursts to say that \\"the time has arrived to impeach Rankin, or at least expel him from the party.\\"Haygood, Wil. King of the Cats. Houghton Mifflin, NY. 1993, p. 118. During a debate about the 1949 Peekskill Riots in Cortlandt Manor, Westchester County, New York, Rankin again used the word \\"nigger\\" while addressing the House. Violence had erupted after a racist mob of white anti- communists attacked people leaving a concert where the African American entertainer and political radical Paul Robeson had been performing. Rankin condemned Robeson for inciting the trouble because of his civil rights activism. The next person to speak was Representative Jacob Javits (R-New York) who instead condemned the white mob in Peekskill for violating constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and free assembly.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, Peekskill p. 373. Angered by these comments, Rankin bellowed, \\"It was not surprising to hear the gentleman from New York defend the Communist enclave.\\" He then wanted it known that the American people are not in sympathy \\"with that nigger Communist and that bunch of Reds who went up there.\\" On a point of order, Representative Vito Marcantonio (R-New York) protested to House Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Texas) that \\"the gentleman from Mississippi used the word 'nigger.' I ask that the word be taken down and stricken from the RECORD inasmuch as there are two members in this house of Negro race.\\" Rayburn claimed that Rankin had not said \\"nigger\\" but \\"Negro\\"; but Rankin yelled over him, saying \\"I said Niggra! Just as I have said since I have been able to talk and shall continue to say.\\"United States Congressional Record, September 21, 1949, p 13375 Speaker Rayburn defended Rankin, ruling that \\"the gentleman from Mississippi is not subject to a point of order... referred to the Negro race and they should not be afraid of that designation.\\" =American Jews= Rankin was antisemitic. In a paper by William L. Strickland, professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, he notes that \\"Rankin was an equal opportunity bigot\\" as he once‚Äîon the floor of the House of Representatives‚Äîcalled the Jewish newspaper columnist Walter Winchell \\"the little kike.\\"Time Magazine This incident, reported by Time magazine in its February 14, 1944 issue, inspired the novelist Laura Z. Hobson to write her world-famous story of antisemitism, Gentleman's Agreement (1947).Hobson, Laura Z. Laura Z: A Life. New York: Arbor House, 1983, pp. 322-323, 328-329. Rankin claimed that the Immigration and Nationality Act was opposed solely by American Jews: > They whine about discrimination. Do you know who is being discriminated > against? The white Christian people of America, the ones who created this > nation ... I am talking about the white Christian people of the North as > well as the South ... Communism is racial. A racial minority seized control > in Russia and in all her satellite countries, such as Poland, > Czechoslovakia, and many other countries I could name. They have been run > out of practically every country in Europe in the years gone by, and if they > keep stirring race trouble in this country and trying to force their > communistic program on the Christian people of America, there is no telling > what will happen to them here.Congressional Record, April 23, 1952, p. 4320 In late 1945, Albert Einstein backed calls for the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Spain's leader Francisco Franco, because the Spanish dictator had been an ally of Adolf Hitler. Rankin condemned Einstein on the floor of Congress, calling him a \\"foreign-born agitator\\" who sought \\"to further the spread of Communism throughout the world.\\" An article in an ADL Bulletin, entitled \\"The Plot Against Anna M. Rosenberg\\", attributed the attacks on Rosenberg's loyalty to \\"professional anti-Semites and lunatic nationalists,\\" including the \\"Jew-baiting cabal of John Rankin, Benjamin H. Freedman and Gerald Smith.\\"Jews Against Prejudice, p. 120 During the 1951 espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were charged and convicted of passing information about the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union, Rankin was condemned by Jewish groups for repeatedly calling the Rosenbergs a pair of \\"communist kikes\\".A Fire in Their Hearts, p. 258. =Japanese Americans= In his first term as representative, Rankin introduced an anti-miscegenation bill to prevent whites from marrying \\"Mongolians\\" and African Americans. A decade later, in 1930 he lobbied against Hawaii's bid for statehood on the grounds that it would add \\"two Jap senators\\" to Congress. Rankin was one of the few Southern congressmen to support West Coast politicians and lobbyists calling for the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans, proposing that every person of Japanese ancestry in the United States be deported at the end of the war. He reintroduced a defeated \\"concentration camp bill\\" to remove ethnic Japanese from the country and all U.S. territories. (Most ethnic Japanese Americans were removed from the West Coast.) As the war progressed, he continued to speak out against Japanese Americans, testifying in favor of labeling Japanese and African-American blood donations to prevent them from \\"contaminating\\" white recipients and limiting the segregated 442nd Regimental Combat Team to labor battalions instead of active combat. Senatorial aspirations In 1947 Rankin ran for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate that was vacated by the death of Theodore G. Bilbo in office. He finished last among five major candidates with 13% of the vote. Final years and death In 1952 Rankin was defeated for re-election to the House by Congressman Thomas G. Abernethy, also a Democrat, after their districts were joined through redistricting. At that time, most blacks in Mississippi were still disenfranchised, a status that would persist until after Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Rankin died at his home in Tupelo on November 26, 1960. He is interred in Greenwood Cemetery in West Point, Mississippi.

In the song, the ‚ÄúGood Ship Lollipop‚Äù travels to a candy land. The ‚Äúship‚Äù referred to, in the song, is an aircraft; the scene in Bright Eyes, where the song appears, takes place on one, taxiing, American Airlines Douglas DC-2.Curiously, in the film the floor of the airplane appears to be level, even though the DC-2 is the taildragger, and in real life, it would be quite difficult to walk up and down the steeply sloped aisle, while the plane is parked, or taxiing. 400,000 copies of the sheet music, published by Sam Fox Publishing Company, were sold, and one recording by Mae Questel (the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl) reputedly sold more than two million copies.

It heard applications and appeals on municipal and planning disputes, as well as other matters specified in provincial legislation. The tribunal reported to the Ministry of the Attorney General from 2012 until its shuttering. The Board had been criticized for its broad powers and authority to override the Planning Act decisions of municipal councils. The Ontario Municipal Board was replaced by the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal on 3 April 2018, which is to have more limited powers and a reduced scope.https://news.ontario.ca/mma/en/2017/12/statement-on-transition-from-the- ontario-municipal-board-to-the-local-planning-appeal-tribunal.html History The OMB was established in 1906 as the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board \\"to oversee municipalities‚Äô accounts and to supervise the then rapidly growing rail transportation system between and within municipalities.\\" In so doing, it took over responsibility of these functions from the former Railway Committee of the Executive Councilconstituted under and Office of the Provincial Municipal Auditor.constituted under (repealed by ) It was amalgamated with the Bureau of Municipal Affairsconstituted under and given its current name in 1932. In 2010, under the Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act, 2009, the OMB was designated as part of a cluster known as \\"Environment and Land Tribunals Ontario\\", which also includes the Assessment Review Board, boards of negotiation under the Expropriations Act, the Conservation Review Board and the Environmental Review Tribunal. Scope of jurisdiction The OMB was constituted under the Ontario Municipal Board Act, which conferred \\"exclusive jurisdiction in all cases and in respect of all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act or by any other general or special Act.\\"OMB Act, s. 36 Until 2009, its decisions could be appealed by petition to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, but such petitions were abolished by the Good Government Act, 2009,, s. 54 after which decisions of the OMB were final, subject only to appeals to the Divisional Court on a question of law with that Court's leave.OMB Act, s. 96 While the Act declared that the Board \\"has all the powers of a court of record\\",OMB Act, s. 34 in 1938 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that it is not a superior court, but in pith and substance an administrative body. Appeals to the OMB were described as \\"a process requiring the OMB to exercise its public interest mandate\\", and \\"on an appeal the Board had the obligation to exercise its independent judgment\\". The Board had general jurisdiction in municipal matters,OMB Act, Part IV as well as over provincially-regulated railways and public utilitiesOMB Act, Part V (other than matters that are within the jurisdiction of the Ontario Energy Board).OMB Act, s. 103 It had been conferred further powers under the Railways Act, the Municipal Act, 2001 the City of Toronto Act, 2006, the Planning Act and the Ontario Heritage Act. Procedure =Hearings= Before reaching a decision, the OMB conducted hearings, which were in oral, electronic or written form. Where a matter to be heard was expected to be long or complex, involving many issues, parties and types of evidence, the Board normally held a prehearing to help organize proceedings for subsequent hearings, which included identification of issues to be considered at such hearings. The Board expected parties who placed an issue on the Issue List to call a case in support of that issue. The Board could award costs against parties who opposed successful applicants, but only when it was requested to do so. =Decisions= The Archives of Ontario holds some past OMB decisions, but the collection is limited to the years 19061991 (but certain records in that period have been previously destroyed).archives.gov.on.ca: \\"A Guide to Researching Records of Ontario Municipal Board Hearings\\" Feb 2013 The OMB makes the following jurisprudence available online: :* Decisions from 2001 to the present. :* Orders from January 21, 2013 to the present. Carswell publishes Ontario Municipal Board Reports, which is available in law libraries, as well as online at Westlaw. Decisions are also available online at LexisNexis. Criticism The jurisdiction the Board could exercise was extremely broad in scope, and a Royal Commission inquiry headed by James McRuer reported in 1971 that it was impossible to catalogue all the powers that the Board possessed at that time, although thirty principal Acts were identified. However, an extraordinary provision of the OMB Act allowed for investigation and determination of any matter, where provision was made for it under the letters patent of any corporation formed under Ontario law.still in effect under the OMB Act, s. 48 Another provision of the OMB Act, allowing the Board to require or prohibit the performance of any matter under any Act or agreement, was considered to be \\"an absurdly broad power and in its breadth it is unconstitutional\\".still in effect under the OMB Act, s. 39 The Board tended to subordinate both provincial and local policies to those of its own making, which successive governments effectively transformed into a policy \\"of overseeing municipal activities without direct provincial involvement\\". There was discussion as to whether it had outlived its usefulness as a planning review tribunal, as \\"it does little that could not be done by local decision makers\\". On 7 October 2008, City of Toronto councillors representing the former city of North York voted to name a lane \\"OMB Folly\\" in the area where the OMB, against the city's wishes, approved development of a condominium and townhouse complex near a low-density residential area immediately west of North York Centre. However, Council reversed this decision on 26 August 2010. After a controversial 2009 decision approved a community of up to 1400 homes in the Manotick neighbourhood of Ottawa, Minister of Municipal Affairs Jim Watson was quoted in the local press as stating: \\"Has the OMB been perfect? No. Can it improve? Yes, I think it can and I am quite prepared to work with the attorney general to try and ensure that the OMB is more reflective of community values [...] I've had a couple of discussions with the attorney general going back a month and we both agree we are going to take a thorough look at the OMB and see how we can further improve it based on changes we made a couple of years ago. We want to see if they've done what we hoped they'd do to bring greater balance to OMB decision-making.\\" On February 6, 2012 Toronto City Council asked the province to free the city from the Ontario Municipal Board‚Äôs jurisdiction. Council endorsed the proposal in a 34-5 vote. Spearheaded by councillor Josh Matlow, along with councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam. Matlow is quoted in the Toronto Star newspaper: \\"We‚Äôve heard time and time again from our residents that there‚Äôs an inequitable playing field...Developers simply have a better chance at the OMB because they have the financial resources, the ability to get planners and lawyers, anything they need to be able to argue their case\\". This proposal should open the door for discussion of the efficiency and justice of the unelected board that controls the majority of Ontario developments.

Much of its past agricultural productivity derives from the irrigation system which centered on the Band-e Kaisar, the first dam bridge in Iran. The Mayor of Shushtar is Ahmad Asefi.  History  In the Elamite times Shushtar was known as Adamdun. In the Achaemenian times its name was ≈†urkutir. The modern name, Shushtar, is connected with the name of another ancient city, Susa (or Shush, in Persian pronunciation), and means \\"greater (or better) than Shush.\\" During the Sassanian era, it was an island city on the Karun river and selected to become the summer capital. The river was channelled to form a moat around the city, while bridges and main gates into Shushtar were built to the east, west, and south. Several rivers nearby are conducive to the extension of agriculture; the cultivation of sugar cane, the main crop, dates back to 226. A system of subterranean channels called Ghanats, which connected the river to the private reservoirs of houses and buildings, supplied water for domestic use and irrigation, as well as to store and supply water during times of war when the main gates were closed. Traces of these ghanats can still be found in the crypts of some houses. Ibn Battuta visited, noting \\"On both banks of the river, there are orchards and water- wheels, the river itself is deep and over it, leading to the travelers' gate, there is a bridge upon boats.\\" The ancient fortress walls were destroyed at the end of the Safavid era. = Band-e Kaisar = Map of the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System The Band-e Kaisar (\\"Caesar's dam\\") is believed by some to be a Roman built arch bridge [since Roman captured soldiers were used in its construction], and the first in the country to combine it with a dam. When the Sassanian Shah Shapur I defeated the Roman emperor Valerian, he is said to have ordered the captive Roman soldiers to build a large bridge and dam stretching over 500 metres.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Lying deep in Persian territory, the structure which exhibits typical Roman building techniques became the most eastern Roman bridge and Roman dam. Its dual-purpose design exerted a profound influence on Iranian civil engineering and was instrumental in developing Sassanid water management techniques.Impact on civil engineering: ; on water management: The approximately 500 m long overflow dam over the Karun, Iran's most effluent river, was the core structure of the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System, a large irrigation complex from which Shushtar derived its agricultural productivity,Length: ; ; extensive irrigation system: and which has been designated World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2009. The arched superstructure carried across the important road between Pasargadae and the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon. Many times repaired in the Islamic period, the dam bridge fell out of use in the late 19th century, leading to the degeneration of the complex system of irrigation.;  People and culture  Shushtar handicrafts The people of Shushtar, called Shushtaris, maintain a unique cultural heritage stretching back to ancient times, and a Persian dialect distinct to their group.  Language  The Shushtari dialect is spoken in Shushtar and is a dialect of Persian. Climate Shushtar has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh) with extremely hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is higher than most of southern Iran, but is almost exclusively confined to the period from November to April, though on occasions it can exceed per month or per year.

Band in Como, c. 1900 Como is an unincorporated community in Park County in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado, United States. According to the 2010 census, the population is 439. History It is believed the town was named by miners from Como, Italy, who worked the coal fields of the area. In 1879, the town became the location of a depot of the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad, which was extended over Kenosha Pass to reach the silver mining areas during the Colorado Silver Boom. Later, the town served as a division point for trains going northward over Boreas Pass and southward toward Garos and over Trout Creek Pass at the western end of South Park. The town has many historic weathered structures, including the roundhouse, hotel, and depot and has the air of a ghost town that is still nevertheless populated, by twenty people. It has a small commercial district consisting of a post office, gallery, hotel. The depot has been renovated with plans to make it an area tourist attraction. With a population in the 1910 census of 475, 36 more than in 2010, Como was then the largest community in Park County. There were eighty-three children of school age that year. The former Como High School had begun in an abandoned Presbyterian Church, which was moved to another site. The school closed in either 1940 or 1941, by which time railroad service to Como had already ended some three years earlier. The remaining pupils were bused to Fairplay. The old Como High School building was left intact and used for the storage of decades of school records and memorabilia, items which were rediscovered in the 1990s. The former school, with a well-preserved classroom, is open to the public only once annually, on Boreas Pass Railroad Day, but students may visit on field trips. The school provides a glimpse into yesteryear.Laura King Van Dusen, \\"Como High School: An Unplanned Time Capsule of Earlier Days, Artifacts Uncovered from Como's Heyday,\\" Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 163-169. Geography Como is located at the northern end of South Park, Como is an historic railroad settlement. It sits approximately one-half mile (1 km) west of U.S. Route 285 and some nine miles (15 km) northeast of the county seat of Fairplay. Como is accessible by a paved County Road 33, which becomes gravel inside the town. Boreas Pass Road runs northwest over Boreas Pass to Breckenridge. The mountains northwest of Como form a dramatic background to the site of the town on the flank of Little Baldy Mountain. Notable people On May 13, 2011, Marshal Adolph E. Cook of Como was inducted into the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C. Earlier in 1999, he was inducted into the Colorado Law Enforcement Memorial. He is the only law enforcement officer from Park County to qualify for in his case posthumous honors. Cook was shot to death in 1894 when he came to a Como residence to break up a loud party. Two women at the party, including Anna Blythe Speas, were charged with accessory to murder but acquitted.

Most modern uses of the symbol are directly or indirectly associated with its use by the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire, whose use of it represented the Empire's dominion over the Near East and the West. The symbol is much older, and its original meaning is debated among scholars. The eagle has long been a symbol of power and dominion. The double-headed eagle or double-eagle is a motif that appears in Mycenaean Greece and in the Ancient Near East, especially in Hittite iconography. It re-appeared during the High Middle Ages, from circa the 10th or 11th century, and was notably used by the East Roman Empire, but 11th or 12th century representations have also been found originating from Islamic Spain, France and the Serbian principality of Ra≈°ka. From the 13th century onward, it became even more widespread, and was used by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and the Mamluk Sultanate within the Islamic world, and by the Holy Roman Empire, Serbia, several medieval Albanian noble families and Russia within the Christian world. Used in the Eastern Roman Empire as a dynastic emblem of the Palaiologoi, it was adopted during the Late Medieval to Early Modern period in the Holy Roman Empire on the one hand, and in Orthodox principalities (Serbia and Russia) on the other, representing an augmentation of the (single-headed) eagle or Aquila associated with the Roman Empire. In a few places, among them the Holy Roman Empire and Russia, the motif was further augmented to create the less prominent triple- headed eagle. Ancient Near East Polycephalous mythological beasts are very frequent in the Bronze Age to Iron Age pictorial legacy of the Ancient Near East, especially in the Assyrian sphere, and thence adopted by the Hittites. Use of the double-headed eagle in Hittite imagery has been interpreted as \\"royal insignia\\".Collins, Billie Jean. 2010 \\"Animal Mastery in Hittite Art and Texts\\" in The Master of Animals in Old World Iconography, ed.

Middle Ages After the Bronze Age collapse, there is a gap of more than two millennia before the re-appearance of the double-headed eagle motif.

Avranches, Biblioth√®que Municipale ms. 50. =East Roman Empire= The early East Roman Empire continued to use the (single-headed) imperial eagle motif. The double-headed eagle appears only in the medieval period, by about the 10th century in East Roman art, but as an imperial emblem only much later, during the final century of the Palaiologos dynasty. In Western European sources, it appears as an East Roman state emblem since at least the 15th century.Skartsis, L.S. (2017) Origin and Evolution of the Greek Flag A modern theory, forwarded by Zapheiriou (1947), connected the introduction of the motif to Roman Emperor Isaac I Komnenos (1057‚Äì1059), whose family originated in Paphlagonia. Zapheiriou supposed that the Hittite motif of the double-headed bird, associated with the Paphlagonian city of Gangra (where it was known as Haga, ) might have been brought to East Roman Empire by the Komnenoi.. It is unclear where Zapheiriou's term Haga (ŒßŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫Œ±) is taken from; it does not appear to find further reflection in scholarly literature but it was adopted by historical fiction author Gordon Doherty in his Strategos: Island in the Storm (2014), see note on p. 390: \\"One theory is that the symbol was adopted from the many ancient Hittite rock carvings of the mythical Haga found throughout Anatolia.\\" =Adoption in the Muslim world= The double-headed eagle motif was adopted in the Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm and the Turkic beyliks of medieval Anatolia in the early 13th century. A royal association of the motif is suggested by its appearance on the keystone of an arch of the citadel built at Konya (former Ikonion) under Kayqubad I (r. 1220‚Äì1237).\\"It was from the East Roman Empire, however, that the Turks adopted the double-headed eagle. A royal association with this emblem is suggested by its appearance on the keystone of an arch from the Seljuk citadel at Ikonion. This is made even more explicit by the double-headed eagle emblazoned with the word al-Sultan on a ceramic tile excavated at the palace of Alaeddin Kaykubad at Kubadabad, near Ak≈üehir\\" Helen C.

The oldest preserved depiction of a double-headed eagle in Serbia is the one found in the donor portrait of Miroslav of Hum in the Church of St. Peter and Paul in Bijelo Polje, dating to 1190. The double-headed eagle in the Serbian royal coat of arms is well attested in the 13th and 14th centuries. An exceptional medieval depiction of a double-headed eagle in the West, attributed to Otto IV, is found in a copy of the Chronica Majora of Matthew of Paris (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Parker MS 16 fol. 18, 13th century).

In Serbia, the Nemanjiƒá dynasty adopted a double-headed eagle by the 14th century (recorded by Angelino Dulcert 1339). The double-headed eagle was used in several coats of arms found in the Illyrian Armorials, compiled in the early modern period. The white double-headed eagle on a red shield was used for the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, and the Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. A \\"Nemanjiƒá eagle\\" was used at the crest of the Hrebeljanoviƒá (Lazareviƒá dynasty), while a half-white half-red eagle was used at the crest of the Mrnjavƒçeviƒá. Use of the white eagle was continued by the modern Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, Obrenoviƒá and Petroviƒá-Njego≈° ruling houses. = Russia = Coat of arms of Ivan the Terrible (1589) After the fall of Constantinople, the use of two-headed eagle symbols spread to Grand Duchy of Moscow after Ivan III's second marriage (1472) to Zoe Palaiologina (a niece of the last East Roman emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who reigned 1449‚Äì1453), The last prince of Tver, Mikhail III of Tver (1453‚Äì1505), was stamping his coins with two-headed eagle symbol. The double-headed eagle remained an important motif in the heraldry of the imperial families of Russia (the House of Romanov (1613-1762)). The double- headed eagle was a main element of the coat of arms of the Russian Empire (1721‚Äì1917), modified in various ways from the reign of Ivan III (1462‚Äì1505) onwards, with the shape of the eagle getting its definite Russian form during the reign of Peter the Great (1682‚Äì1725). It continued in Russian use until abolished (being identified with Tsarist rule) with the Russian Revolution in 1917; it was restored in 1993 after that year's constitutional crisis and remains in use up to the present, although the eagle charge on the present coat of arms is golden rather than the traditional, imperial black. =Holy Roman Empire= Use of a double-headed Imperial Eagle, improved from the single-headed Imperial Eagle used in the high medieval period, became current in the 15th to 16th centuries. The double-headed Reichsadler was in the coats of arms of many German cities and aristocratic families in the early modern period. A distinguishing feature of the Holy Roman eagle was that it was often depicted with haloes. Flag used in Ravensburg, 1849 After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the double-headed eagle was retained by the Austrian Empire, and served also as the coat of arms of the German Confederation. The German states of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg- Sondershausen continued to use the double-headed eagle as well until they were abolished shortly after the First World War, and so did the Free City of L√ºbeck until it was abolished by the Nazi government in 1937. Austria, which switched to a single-headed eagle after the end of the monarchy, briefly used a double-headed eagle ‚Äì with haloes ‚Äì once again when it was a one-party state 1934‚Äì1938; this, too, was ended by the Nazi government. Since then, Germany and Austria, and their respective states, have not used double-headed eagles. =Mysore= Kingdom of Mysore The Gandabherunda is a bicephalous bird, not necessarily an eagle but very similar in design to the double-headed eagle used in Western heraldry, used as a symbol by the Wadiyar dynasty of the Kingdom of Mysore from the 16th century. Coins (gold pagoda or gadyana) from the rule of Achyuta Deva Raya (reigned 1529‚Äì1542) are thought to be the first to use the Gandabherunda on currency. An early instance of the design is found on a sculpture on the roof of the Rameshwara temple in the temple town of Keladi in Shivamogga. The symbol was in continued use by the Maharaja of Mysore into the modern period, and was adopted as the state symbol of the State of Mysore (now Karnataka) after Indian independence. =Albania= Principality of Kastrioti The Kastrioti family in Albania had a double-headed eagle as their emblem in the 14th and 15th centuries. Some members of the Dukagjini family and the Arianiti family also used double-headed eagles, and a coalition of Albanian states in the 15th century, later called the League of Lezhe, also used the Kastrioti eagle as its flag. The current flag of Albania does feature a black two-headed eagle with a crimson background. During John Hunyadi's campaign in Ni≈° in 1443, Skanderbeg and a few hundred Albanians defected from the Turkish ranks; for twenty-five years he scored remarkable victories against the Ottomans. He adopted the Byzantine double-headed eagle flag, and his spectacular victories brought him the papal title Athleta Christi.. The eagle was used for heraldic purposes in the Middle Ages by a number of noble families in Albania and became the symbol of the Albanians. The Kastrioti's coat of arms, depicting a black double-headed eagle on a red field, became famous when he led a revolt against the Ottoman Empire resulting in the independence of Albania from 1443 to 1479. This was the flag of the League of Lezh√´, which was the first unified Albanian state in the Middle Ages and the oldest Parliament with extant records.... Modern use Albania, Serbia, Montenegro and Russia have a double-headed eagle in their coat of arms. In 1912, Ismail Qemali raised a similar version of that flag. The flag has gone through many alterations, until 1992 when the current flag of Albania was introduced. The double-headed eagle is now used as an emblem by a number of Orthodox Christian churches, including the Greek Orthodox Church and the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania. In modern Greece, it appears in official use in the Hellenic Army (Coat of Arms of Hellenic Army General Staff) and the Hellenic Army XVI Infantry Division,Army.gr The two-headed eagle appears, often as a supporter, on the modern and historical arms and flags of Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Austria (1934‚Äì1938), Albania, Armenia, Montenegro, the Russian Federation, Serbia. It was also used as a charge on the Greek coat of arms for a brief period in 1925‚Äì1926. It is also used in the municipal arms of a number of cities in Germany, Netherlands and Serbia, the arms and flag of the city and Province of Toledo, Spain, and the arms of the town of Velletri, Italy. An English heraldic tradition, apparently going back to the 17th century, attributes coats of arms with double-headed eagles to the Anglo-Saxon earls of Mercia, Leofwine and Leofric.A. Davidson, A History of the Holtes of Aston, Baronets (1854), p. 69, in a description an armorial frieze dated 1608. The design was introduced in a number of British municipal coats of arms in the 20th century, such as the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon in London, the supporters in the coat of arms of the city and burgh of Perth, and hence in that of the district of Perth and Kinross (1975). The motif is also found in a number of British family coats of arms.Alfred William W. Morant, An alphabetical dictionary of coats of arms belonging to families in Great Britain and Ireland (1874), p. 304. In Turkey, General Directorate of Security and the municipality of Diyarbakƒ±r have a double-headed eagle in their coat of arms. The Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash is used as an emblem by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. It was introduced in France in the early 1760s as the emblem of the Kadosh degree. =Sports clubs insignia= Several sports clubs, mainly Greek and Turkish, have the double- headed eagle in their insignia. Some of them are: two football clubs of Turkey, Erzurumspor and Konyaspor and the Greek sport clubs AEK (Athletic Union of Constantinople) and (since 1929) P.A.O.K. (Panthesalonikios Athletic club of Constantinople). The Greek clubs use this symbol since both were founded by Greek refugees who fled to Greece from Constantinople in the 1920s. It is also the emblem of the Dutch clubs NEC and Vitesse Arnhem, the English football club AFC Wimbledon and Scottish side Saint Johnstone FC. The Gandabherunda insignia is used by the Indian club Bengaluru FC in their logo.

It can also refer to a mode of operation by application software. Safe mode is intended to help fix most, if not all problems within an operating system. It is also widely used for removing rogue security software.  Background  Microsoft Windows, macOS, Android and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint are examples of contemporary operating systems that implement a safe mode (called \\"Safe Boot\\" in macOS) as well as other complex electronic devices. In safe mode, an operating system has reduced functionality, but the task of isolating problems is easier since many non-core components are disabled, such as sound. An installation that will only boot into safe mode typically has a major problem, such as disk corruption or the installation of poorly-configured software that prevents the operating system from successfully booting into its normal operating mode. Though it varies by operating system, safe mode typically loads only essential executable modules and disables devices except for those necessary to display information and accept input. It can also take the form of a parallel \\"miniature\\" operating system that has no configuration information shared with the normal operating system. For example, on Microsoft Windows, the user can also choose to boot to the Recovery Console, a small text-based troubleshooting mode kept separate from the main operating system (which can also be accessed by booting the install CD) or to various \\"safe mode\\" options that run the dysfunctional OS but with features, such as video drivers, audio, and networking, disabled. Safe mode typically provides access to utility and diagnostic programs so a user can troubleshoot what is preventing the operating system from working normally. Safe mode is intended for maintenance, not functionality, and it provides minimal access to features.  Operating systems  = Windows = Microsoft Windows' safe mode (for 7/Vista /XP /2000/ME/98/95) is accessed by pressing the F8 key as the operating system boots.A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP Also, in a multi-boot environment with multiple versions of Windows installed side by side, the F8 key can be pressed at the OS selector prompt to get to safe mode. However, under Windows 8 (released in 2012), the traditional press-F8-for-safe-mode-options UI convention no longer works, and either Shift-F8 or a special GUI-based workaround is necessary. = Unix = An equivalently minimal setting in Unix- like operating systems is single-user mode, in which daemons and the X Window System are not started, and only the root user can log in. It can do emergency repairs or maintenance, including resetting users' passwords on the machine without the need to know the old one.How To Recover root password under linux with single user mode = macOS = In macOS holding the shift key after powering up activates Safe Boot that has background maintenance features (Besides the mode selection, it runs a file system repair, and in Mac OS 10.4, it disables all fonts other than those in /System/Library/Fonts, moves to the Trash all font caches normally stored in /Library/Caches/com.apple.ATS/(uid)/, where (uid) is a user ID number such as 501, and disables all startup items and any Login Items) and can reset an administrative account's password. Unlike in Windows where safe mode with networking is disabled by default and requires using a safe mode with networking enabled, in the macOS Safe Boot always includes networking. On the Classic Mac OS versions 6, 7, 8, and 9, a similar mode to the Unix root is achieved by holding down the shift key while booting, which starts the system without extensions.  Application software safe mode  Application software sometimes offers a safe mode as well. In the PHP interpreter, prior to version 5.4, safe mode offers stricter security measures. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler from version 7.2 offers \\"Safe Haskell\\" mode, restricting usage of functions such as \`unsafePerformIO\`. Mozilla Firefox's safe mode allows the user to remove extensions which may be preventing the browser from loading. Internet Explorer can run in \\"No Add-Ons\\" mode and Protected Mode. Cydia's MobileSubstrate also has a safe mode that allows the user to uninstall tweaks and extensions that may crash the SpringBoard.  DEFCON 28 - Safe Mode  In 2020 the long running hacker conference, DEFCON, cancelled the annual live event hosted in Las Vegas, NV due to safety concerns associated to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 28th annual event was renamed to DEFCON Safe Mode [ref: 45 44 4f 4d 45 46 41 53 4e 4f 43 46 45 44 2e 43 4f 4d].

He served as the head basketball coach at Washington and Lee University for one season in 1924‚Äì25 and at Duke University from 1928 to 1942, compiling a career college basketball record of 234‚Äì104. Cameron was also the head football coach at Duke University from 1942 to 1945, tallying a mark of 25‚Äì11‚Äì1, and the athletic director at the school from 1951 to 1972. Cameron was part of Duke athletics from 1926 to 1972, the second longest tenure in the school's history. Duke's home basketball arena was renamed as Cameron Indoor Stadium in his honor in 1972. Early life and playing career Cameron attended Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana before becoming a fullback at Washington and Lee University in Virginia. At Washington and Lee, he was captain of both the basketball and football teams, and tied for the national scoring title in football. Coaching career When Washington and Lee coach Jimmy DeHart was hired by Duke, Cameron followed him to coach the freshman team. After Wallace Wade was lured away from University of Alabama by Duke, school administrators urged him to retain Cameron. Cameron eventually became the backfield coach, scout, and recruiter for Wade. In 1929, he got the additional responsibility of head basketball coach, a position he kept until 1949. Cameron's first two Duke basketball teams made the Southern Conference tournament finals even as a new team in the league. Cameron's teams had a 226‚Äì99 record (.695), 119‚Äì56 (.680) in conference play, during his 14 years as head coach, which included conference championships in 1938, 1941 and 1942. During his tenure, in 1940, Duke built the largest basketball arena south of the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cameron coached the first game, a 36‚Äì27 victory over Princeton University, on January 6, 1940. That arena would eventually come to bear his name. Cameron in Wallace Wade Stadium during his tenure as Duke's athletic director After Wade entered the military service in World War II, Cameron became the head football coach. In four years Cameron's teams won three conference championships, compiled a record of 25‚Äì11‚Äì1 and won the 1945 Sugar Bowl by beating Alabama, 29‚Äì26. Cameron became permanent Director of Physical Education and Athletics in 1946 when Wade returned and resumed coaching football. Later life Cameron was a founder of the Atlantic Coast Conference, chaired the basketball committee of the Southern and ACC conferences for decades, was on the selection committee for the NFL Hall of Fame and was on the governing committee of the Olympics.

It is five miles southeast of Huddersfield. It occupies much of the high ground that can be found at the top of the steep inclines of Far Dene and Slant Gate and is a mixture of densely congregated housing estates and open pastoral farmland. According to the 2001 census Highburton had a population of 3,288.Kirklees census data by settlement - Highburton (xls format) History Highburton was listed as \\"Bertone\\" in the Domesday Book.The Great Domesday Book, Folio 299v It has been suggested that Highburton was the location of the original settlement that now makes up Kirkburton, given its strategic high ground. Historians consider that the original church or religious temple was located in this part of the village before it was relocated to its present position. It is more likely, given the possible existence of an Iron Age settlement in Kirkburton that both villages commenced life at similar stages. It was a hamlet until the middle of the 20th century, when housing developments increased the size of the village substantially. The historic old part of the village is around the Cross on Slant Gate, Far Dene and Towngate. Houses towards the eastern part of the village, on the streets that border Moor Lane and Burton Acres Lane, were built much later on what were fields and allotments. Today Highburton is the largest residential area within the township, whilst Kirkburton remains, as it was traditionally, the commercial part.

It is the home to Kirkburton Parish Council and a number of groups. Highburton Co-op: was located on Towngate in the centre of the village, the Co-op laid claim to being the world's oldest operating independent single retail cooperative outlet until its closure in February 2009. The building was purchased from the church in 1856 and began trading in the same year. The co-operative society was wound up in March 2010 and the assets, including the building, were disposed of. After being closed for 22 months, the building re-opened in December 2010 as a village shop with private offices on the first floor. The Smiths Arms: at the summit of Far Dene, the Smiths Arms is the only public house in the village and occupies one of its oldest buildings. Built in 1669 in a Tudor/Jacobean style, it began trading as a public house in 1830. Whilst it is the oldest pub building in the township it is not the oldest public house. That honour goes to the George Inn in Kirkburton, which dates back to the 18th century. Primitive Methodist Chapel: The Primitive Methodists built a chapel at a cost of ¬£100 and for 100 people in 1832; its is at the top of Slant Gate. A school, now demolished, was built in 1899 and the chapel was enlarged in 1926. Like the Methodist chapel in Kirkburton it too closed, this time in 1973, and is also a private house.

His brother was Daniel Cornelius de Beaufort (1700-1788). Born in The Hague to a French family of Huguenots, he lived in Utrecht and Leiden and worked as a personal tutor to the Prince of Hesse-Hombourg while at Leiden University (1739-42). In 1738 he published at Utrecht the Dissertation sur l'incertitude des cinq pr√®miers si√®cles de l'histoire romaine (A Dissertation Upon the Uncertainty of the First Five Centuries of Roman History), in which he questioned the value of even the classical sources of the highest repute, such as Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, for writing the history of the origins of ancient Rome, and pointed out by what methods and by the aid of what documents a truly scientific basis might be given to its history. While this was not an unprecedented argument, Beaufort made his case particularly forcefully and pushed against the traditional and less critical approaches adopted by esteemed historians of the time such as Charles Rollin. A German, Christopher Saxius, endeavoured to refute Beaufort's argument in a series of articles published in vols. i.-iii. of the Miscellanea Liviensia. Beaufort replied by some brief and ironic Remarques in the appendix to the second edition of his Dissertation (1750). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in October 1746 and would move to Maastricht where he died in 1795. He also wrote an Histoire de Cesar Germanicus (Leiden, 1761), and La R√©publique romaine, ou plan general de l'ancien gouvernement de Rome (The Hague, 1766, 2 vols quarto). Though not a scholar of the first rank, Beaufort has at least the merit of having been a pioneer in raising the question, afterwards elaborated by Niebuhr, as to the credibility of early Roman history and the importance of source criticism.

It is most commonly found in the regions of Herzegovina and Dalmatia, but it can also be heard in Lika, Karlovac and rural areas of western Montenegro. It is characterized by a lone singer singing a single line of lyrics, followed by others joining in, using a vocal style that is best described as a wail. Ganga is situated mainly in small towns. The culture surrounding Ganga is protected by the Croatian Ministry of Culture to preserve its place in Croatian culture and to encourage its study. Several popular Croatian musicians have incorporated some Ganga into their work. History The folk songs of Duvno are descendants of Ganga music and also study the history of Ganga. The parallels with ojkavica from Dalmatia indicates that Zadar hinterland, Dalmatia, Imotski region and western Herzegovina sang the same type of Ganga. Ganga is said to originate around the years of 1890‚Äì1900 in the area around Imotski and neighbouring Posu≈°je. Ganga evolved from a singing called Brojka, a very simple, archaic type of singing that is said to have roots in Illyrian traditions. Style Ganga is an expressive form of singing. Recently has Ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly nationalistic overtones and incorporating themes from the Croatian Homeland War. Although both men and women regularly perform Ganga, it is extremely unusual for them to perform together, although it was not unusual for Catholic and Muslim men to perform together. Ganga is a dissonant form of singing, using two clashing notes to project sound over long distances. For example, if one person is singing a \\"C\\" note, a second person sings either a half-step above or below (\\"B\\" or \\"C#\\"). Ganga is traditionally sung by sheepherders across stretches of valleys, for long-distance communication with each other. Ganga is sung more in the summer than in the winter, because of the lack of farming in rural areas in the winter. Rera is a type of singing very similar to Ganga, it is sung around Sinj. Rera is, in rule quicker and louder than Ganga but follows the same rules as Ganga (one singer leads the song, others join in). =Variations= Ojkanje refers to the characteristic style of singing with a shaking voice, often described as \\"from the throat\\". Elements of local folk singing is usually referred to as old or starovinska singing. Such singing in the Cetina Valley is called ojkavica, in the Dalmatian hinterland ojkavica or ojkaƒça, in Ravni Kotari and Bukovica orzenje - the rouge rozganje and in Hercegovini and Imotski pivanje, brojka or beƒáarac. It is a remnant of Illyrian singing by local people, retained as part of their identity and history. It originated in Archaic and Medieval times, when the Illyrians were present. \\"Ganga / k√´nga\\" in Albanian (i.e. descendant of the Illyrian language branch) means just \\"song\\".

The river emerges into the dale from springs below Lathkill Head Cave (or, in wet conditions, from the cave itself). Towards the head of the dale is the side valley Cales Dale.  Nature reserve  The river valley is part of the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve and is popular with tourists who visit for its natural environment and wildlife. Natural England manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the White Peak (Lathkill Dale, Cressbrook Dale, Hay Dale, Long Dale and Monk‚Äôs Dale). The dale includes two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and areas designated as Open Access Land in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Lathkill Dale is known for its range of wildflower species (including orchids and the rare Jacob's ladder), butterflies, ancient woodland and the presence of birds of prey, dippers, woodpeckers and water voles. The River Lathkill is a winterbourne stream (drying up in sections over summer). After heavy rain, clear river water rises up from sink-holes near Over Haddon and runs into deep pools known locally as The Blue Waters. Beyond this there are 12 weirs, which were built for trout fishing in Victorian times. In 1653 the poet and angler Charles Cotton wrote of the ‚ÄòLathkin‚Äô:  History  Conksbury medieval bridge The medieval sheepwash bridge Conksbury Bridge now carries the road from Bakewell to Youlgreave. The nearby deserted medieval settlement at Conksbury was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086 AD) as Cranchesberie. The site of earthworks and buried remains of buildings is a Scheduled Monument. A Vickers Wellington bomber crashed near here in 1941. Parsons Tor limestone crag is named after Reverend Robert Lomas of Monyash who fell to his death there, while riding his horse when drunk as he returned late at night from Bakewell in 1776. Towards the top end of the valley Ricklow Quarry used to produce crinoidal limestone (rich in fossils 350 million years old), which looks like marble when polished and was popular with the Victorians. An old mill pond with a many stepped weir and a few mill stones are all that remains of Carters Mill (an old corn mill). The iron water wheel was removed from the mill for scrap during World War II. The narrow stone Coal Pit Bridge at Youlgreave, the limestone footbridge at Over Haddon and the gritstone bridge at Nether Haddon all cross the River Lathkill and are Grade II listed. = Lead mining = Bateman's House in Lathkill Dale The dale has a long history of lead mining. Lathkill Dale and Mandale mines and soughs are a rare and well-preserved example of mining activity dating from the 13th century onwards. They include ruins of engine houses and an aqueduct and are a Scheduled Monument. In 1797 miners started to dig the Mandale Sough into the north side of the valley. The remains of the 19th-century Mandale Mine include the ruins of a pumphouse to drain the mines (using a steam Cornish pumping engine installed in 1847). Intensive mining led to underground flooding and the closure of Lathkill Mine. However. in 1825 James Bateman, the mine agent, brought in innovative equipment to overcome the flooding. A pumping engine was installed in a shaft under the building where he lived and known since as Bateman‚Äôs House. In 1836 he also erected a large and powerful waterwheel. Nevertheless, the mine became unprofitable and closed in 1842. Mandale Rake eventually closed in 1852 although individual miners continued working it until 1867.

Biography He was born at Berlin, and obtained, while quite a young man, an appointment in the court theatre at Weimar, at that time under Goethe's auspices. The poet recognized his talent, appointed him stage manager, entrusted him with several of the leading roles in his dramas and consulted him in all matters connected with the staging of his plays. For many years Becker was the favourite of the Weimar stage, and although he was at his best in comedy, he played, to Goethe's great satisfaction, Vansen in Egmont, and was also seen to great advantage in the leading parts of several of Schiller's plays; notably Burleigh in Maria Stuart, Karl Moor in Die R√§uber, and Antonio in Torquato Tasso. Becker left Weimar in the spring of 1809, played for a short time at Hamburg (under Schr√∂der) and at Breslau, and then began a wandering life, now joining travelling companies, now playing at provincial theatres. Broken in health and ruined in fortune he returned in 1820 to Weimar, where he was again cordially received by Goethe, who reinstated him at the theatre. After playing for two years with indifferent success, he died at Weimar in 1822. Becker was twice married. His first wife, Christiane was also an actor.

It was named after Jefferson College in Pennsylvania. It is typically dark gray, brown, or black on its dorsal surface, but a lighter shade on its anterior. Some individuals may also have silver or blue specks on their sides; the area around the vent is usually gray. These salamanders are slender, with a wide nose and distinctive long toes, and range in size from . Like other mole salamanders, the Jefferson salamander burrows; they have well- developed lungs suited for this purpose. Nocturnal by nature, they can be spotted by day during the mating season. Breeding occurs in early spring, after the snow in the area has melted. Reproduction Eggs are laid in small agglomerations attached to submerged twigs or other natural support at the pond's edge. Clutches can contain between 5 and 60 eggs, averaging about 30. The age at which they first breed, and the frequency with which they breed, are unknown; females are estimated to first breed at 22 months, and males at 34 months. Eggs develop rapidly, and may hatch within 15 days. Larvae stay in the pond from two to four months, during which time they grow to between 3 and 8 times their hatching size. A unique reproductive tactic for the Bluespotted- Jefferson Salamander Complex exists in nature. The Jefferson salamander is now known not to breed in the lab with the blue-spotted salamander, which was previously thought to produce 'hybrids', the silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander, between this supposed mating of Jefferson salamander and Blue- spotted salamander. The silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander are now known through genetic testing to be polyploid females (only 2% of males survive and they are sterile). These most often possess two of each chromosome from the Jefferson salamander and one of each chromosome from the blue-spotted salamander, resulting in an LJJ genotype (also called a Tremblay's salamander.) This genotype results when these polyploid females mate with a pure Jefferson salamander male, incorporating (often in warmer water conditions) the chromosome from the pure male Jefferson salamander into her egg, usually having an LJ diploid chromosome set or LJJ triploid chromosome set, to produce LJJ or LJJJ offspring, respectively. Often in cooler conditions, the LJ or LJJ female may mate with the Jefferson salamander male and only 'borrow' his spermatozoan to trigger genetic cloning of herself, not adding his chromosome (J) to her egg. The same polyploid reproductive strategy occurs for other mole salamander species. The presence of these polyploids makes it difficult to visually identify which species an individual may be, skewing population measures for both species. Habitat Range map of the Jefferson Salamander The secretive adults tend to hide under stones or logs, or in leaf litter and other underbrush in deciduous forests during damp conditions. They are usually not found in conifer forests, likely due to the dryness and prickliness of some pine and spruce needles, which may injure amphibians with their thin skins. They are found burrowed underground for most of the year during dry or freezing conditions. They must get below the frost line (about 18 inches) in order to survive winter conditions in northern latitudes. They often burrow in rich sandy soils found in upland deciduous forests or sometimes in older-growth damp hemlock forests. Because breeding sites are usually close to the over-wintering burrows, migration to their breeding area is quick, and usually occurs during or immediately after a heavy rainfall. The breeding sites they choose are fishless ponds and vernal pools, filled with spring snow meltwater in northern latitudes. Some breeding ponds may be hundreds of yards (meters) away from their forest home in fragmented landscapes. Jefferson salamanders are one of the first amphibians to emerge in springtime at the northern edge of their range in southern Ontario where they are seen \\"snowshoeing\\" across the still frozen understory of the forest to reach partially melted breeding ponds. Males migrate first with females following shortly thereafter. These salamanders have small pores on their heads which exude a whitish liquid when they are handled, suggesting that they may leave a scent trail during migration, Ambystoma jeffersonianum is often found in the same habitat as the spotted salamander. Food The larvae are carnivorous, typically consuming aquatic invertebrates. An insufficient food supply may result in cannibalistic behaviour. Adults are also carnivorous, eating a variety of small invertebrates. Status The Jefferson salamander is a species of least concern globally, but its habitat is threatened in parts of its range. In Ontario, it has been classified as an endangered species since 11 June 2011, and throughout Canada it is a threatened species. The government of Ontario has designated the species as a specially protected amphibian, which provides protection to the species and its habitats. It is also considered a state-threatened species in Illinois.

She was named for Lieutenant Albert David, a Medal of Honor recipient. Laid down on 28 April 1964 and commissioned on 19 October 1968, the Albert David served in the Pacific, including performing gunfire support operations in Vietnam during the 1970s. She was briefly deployed to the Arabian Sea in September and October 1982. On 18 September 1989 she was leased to the Brazilian Navy, and then sold to Brazil where she served as the destroyer Par√° (D 27) until 12 November 2008 when she was decommissioned and put in reserve. Construction Albert David was laid down on 28 April 1964 at Seattle, Washington, by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Co.; launched on 19 December 1964; sponsored by Mrs. Lynda Mae David; and commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 19 October 1968, Comdr. Roy Skofield Reynolds in command. History For the remainder of 1968, Albert David completed outfitting at Bremerton, Washington, and conducted post-commissioning trials and tests. Those examinations continued into 1969. A voyage to Hawaii followed in March. Early in April, the ocean escort began five weeks of refresher training out of San Diego. On 1 May 1969, she was assigned to Long Beach, California, as her home port. She concluded refresher training eight days later and arrived in Long Beach on 10 May. On 12 May, however, Albert David headed back to Bremerton for an eight-week, post- shakedown availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The warship returned to sea on 7 July, bound for the coast of southern California and several days of operations out of San Diego. She returned to Long Beach on the 18th. Albert David carried out normal operations from the base at Long Beach until the beginning of the second week in October. On 8 October, she stood out of Long Beach on her first deployment to the western Pacific. After steaming via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island, the warship arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 31 October. Albert David then served two weeks on the Taiwan Strait patrol and visited Subic Bay in the Philippines before reporting at Da Nang, South Vietnam, on 24 November to begin Vietnam War gunfire support duty. That assignment lasted until 10 December when, after a brief stop at Da Nang, the ocean escort headed for the Gulf of Tonkin. From ll to 18 December, she operated on the south air-sea rescue (ASR) station in the gulf. On 16 December, Albert David joined company with the aircraft carrier for two days of plane guard duty. The warship left station in the Gulf of Tonkin on 18 December and headed for Bangkok, Thailand, where her crew enjoyed a five-day port visit. On 30 December, she rendezvoused with the carrier and began five weeks of plane guard duty with the carriers of Task Force 77 (TF 77). =1970s= Early in February 1970, she left the Gulf of Tonkin to make port visits at Subic Bay and Hong Kong. On her way back to Vietnamese waters, Albert David visited Okinawa and, during that visit, put to sea to investigate a Soviet trawler loitering in the area. She returned to Vietnam at Danang on 27 February to resume gunfire support missions for the troops fighting ashore. At the beginning of the second week in March, the ocean escort left the gunline to rejoin the carriers of TF 77 in the Gulf of Tonkin. Eight days later, she pulled into Subic Bay to make preparations for the voyage back to the United States. On 21 March, Albert David stood out of Subic Bay on her way home. The warship made stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor before arriving in Long Beach on 9 April. Following post-deployment standdown, Albert David settled into the normal schedule of training operations carried out by warships between overseas deployments. Those evolutions occupied her time until the beginning of November when she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Albert David's first regular overhaul lasted more than eight months. On 1 July 1971, she put to sea for post-overhaul trials and drills, and she remained so occupied for the remainder of the month. August brought refresher training out of San Diego, and September saw her resume normal 1st Fleet operations out of Long Beach. On 12 November 1971, Albert David departed Long Beach on her second deployment to the Far East. En route, she spent more than a week in the Hawaiian Islands before continuing on to the Philippines. The ocean escort arrived in Subic Bay on 9 December and remained there almost a week. On the 15th, she put to sea bound for the Gulf of Tonkin, arriving on station two days later. Albert David spent the following six weeks on gunfire support station off the coast of Vietnam. At the end of January 1972, she headed back to Subic Bay to rest, rearm, and reprovision. The warship returned to the combat zone this time in the Gulf of Siam off the shores of South Vietnam's IV Corps on 6 February and resumed duty as a seaborne heavy artillery battery supporting ground forces ashore. Albert David left the Gulf of Siam on 24 February bound for the Gulf of Tonkin. She rendezvoused with the aircraft carrier on 29 February and served as the carrier's escort for two days of operations in the Gulf of Tonkin as well as during the voyage to Subic Bay. After 10 days of upkeep and repairs at Subic Bay, the ocean escort departed the Philippines for Hong Kong on 14 March. The port visit at Hong Kong lasted from 16 to 22 March. On the latter day, the warship laid in a course that took her via Okinawa to the Sea of Japan. She conducted antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises between 26 and 29 March and made a port call at Yokosuka, Japan, from 30 March to 5 April. After a false start for home on the 5th and a return to Japan to reload necessary equipment, Albert David headed back to Vietnamese waters that same day. Reporting for gunfire support duty off the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North Vietnam and South Vietnam on 10 April she performed a variety of other tasks as well. On 11 and 12 April Albert David participated in action while encountering enemy hostile fire. The crew received the Combat Action Ribbon. After four days of gunfire support missions, the warship joined the cruiser for 10 days of escort duty on picket station. From 28 April to 12 May, she again provided gunfire support. Albert David concluded that tour of duty in the combat zone with four days of service with the landing platform dock on the notification line established to warn merchant ships about mines in North Vietnamese harbors. On 17 May, the ocean escort set out for Subic Bay in company with Constellation. The two warships visited Subic Bay from 19 to 22 May and then got underway for Singapore. After a four-day port call at Singapore, they returned to sea on 30 May on their way back to the waters surrounding Vietnam. Albert David parted company with Constellation on 2 June to render gunfire support to troops in I and II Corps in South Vietnam. At the end of 10 days on the gunline, she formed up with Constellation again on 12 June. The two warships stopped at Subic Bay on 15 June and returned to sea almost immediately. On 20 June, they arrived in Yokosuka for a two-day port call before beginning the voyage across the Pacific. Albert David and Constellation cleared Yokosuka on 22 June bound for the United States. Albert David escorted the carrier until 30 June when she received orders to proceed independently. The ocean escort entered Long Beach the following morning. Following a month- long post-deployment leave and upkeep period, the ocean escort began normal 1st Fleet operations on 3 August with plane guard services for the carrier in the southern California operating area. On 26 August, she put to sea from Long Beach to participate in Operation \\"RimPac-72,\\" conducted in the Hawaiian Islands with units of the navies of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Albert David returned to Long Beach from that exercise on 19 September and remained in port for three weeks. At that time, she resumed normal operations along the California coast. The warship performed training duties out of Long Beach until near the end of the first week in January 1973. On the 5th, she stood out to sea on her way back to the Far East. Steaming in company with Constellation, Albert David completed the transit of the Pacific at Subic Bay on 22 January. Four days later, she embarked upon the voyage to the Gulf of Tonkin, again escorting Constellation. For the next three weeks, she provided plane guard services and antisubmarine protection for the carriers of TF 77 during what proved to be her last tour of duty in the gulf before the United States pulled out of the Vietnam War. Albert David returned to Subic Bay on 14 February and spent the next three weeks undergoing minor repairs and conducting training in the Philippines. On 6 March, Albert David departed Iloilo on the island of Panay to return to Vietnamese waters. This time, however, her mission was a peaceful one. She was part of Operation End Sweep, the removal of mines from North Vietnamese waters. Her participation in that effort punctuated by port visits to Sasebo in Japan, Subic Bay in the Philippines, and Hong Kong lasted until the second week in June. The warship cleared Vietnamese waters on 9 June, visited Keelung on Taiwan on 12 and 13 June, and arrived in Yokosuka on the 17th. Two days later, the ocean escort returned to sea for the voyage back to the United States. She made brief stops for fuel at Midway Island and Pearl Harbor before reaching Long Beach on 3 July. Post-deployment standdown followed by a lengthy restricted availability at the Todd Shipyard in San Pedro occupied her time until late November. She returned to Long Beach on 21 November but remained there only long enough to make preparations to move to San Diego, the new home port to which she had been assigned on 20 August. Albert David made the home port shift on 1 December and commenced local operations out of San Diego six days later. The warship continued that employment through the end of 1973 and during the first four months of 1974. On 23 April 1974, she left San Diego in company with the destroyers and bound for the western Pacific. Albert David and her travelling companions made fuel stops at Pearl Harbor and Midway Island before arriving in Yokosuka on 14 May. On 25 May, the ocean escort put to sea in a task group built around the aircraft carrier to conduct operations off the island of Honsh≈´. Thus she began her first period of service with the 7th Fleet in which combat duty off the Vietnamese coast played no role. The warship alternated between periods of training at sea and port calls at such places as Yokosuka, Hong Kong, Guam, and Subic Bay. When she returned to San Diego on 22 October 1974, Albert David embarked upon a period of almost 42 months without a deployment to the Far East. She spent most of the remainder of 1974 in port, initially engaged in post-deployment standdown and later in holiday routine. The ocean escort conducted a number of exercises in 1975. Late March and early April brought a voyage to Hawaii for Operation \\"RIMPAC\\" 1-75, a multinational exercise conducted in cooperation with the navies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In mid-April, she returned to the west coast and resumed local operations. On 30 June 1975, Albert David was reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1050. In September, she made another cruise to the Hawaiian Islands where she spent four weeks engaged in exercises before returning to San Diego early in November. Local operations again occupied her time, some of which involved serving as a test platform for a new Towed Array Sonar System (TASS) until the spring of 1976. Late in April 1976, the frigate sailed to Long Beach where she began an 11-month regular overhaul on 22 April. Albert David concluded her repairs at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on St. Patrick's Day 1977 and returned to San Diego nine days later. She operated on a normal training schedule out of her home port until the beginning of August when she voyaged to Hawaii again for training purposes. Returning to San Diego on 29 August, the frigate settled into a normal west coast training schedule once more. The hiatus in Far Eastern deployments came to an end in the spring of 1978. Albert David stood out of San Diego on 4 April and set a course for Hawaii. En route there, she participated in \\"RIMPAC\\" 1-78. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, the frigate continued her voyage west on 25 April. She arrived in Subic Bay on 16 May. During the ensuing five months, Albert David conducted exercises with units of the 7th Fleet and participated in the binational Exercise \\"Sharkhunt XXVII\\" with elements of the Republic of China Navy. She also visited ports in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The frigate concluded that tour of duty in the Far East with a readiness exercise and a series of special operations. After a visit to Guam between 11 and 14 October, Albert David embarked upon the voyage back to the United States. She reentered San Diego on 29 October and, except for a two-day period underway locally, spent the remainder of 1978 in port. Twelve days into 1979, the warship began the usual schedule of training operations, trials and inspections. That employment occupied her time through the first 10 months of the year. On 13 November 1979, she left San Diego to return to the western Pacific. Albert David made a very brief stop at Pearl Harbor on 21 November resuming her voyage west that same day. She arrived at Subic Bay on 9 December and spent the remainder of the year in port. =1980s= The frigate operated locally out of Luzon ports until the second week in February 1980 when she embarked upon a voyage to Singapore in company with the cruisers Long Beach, , and the frigate . A main engine casualty, however, forced her return to Subic Bay under tow of Long Beach and, later, of . She remained in Subic Bay from 12 February through the end of the month. The warship returned to sea on 1 March for two weeks of exercises followed by a port visit at Buckner Bay, Okinawa. After an antisubmarine warfare exercise and another stop at Buckner Bay, Albert David set a course for Pusan, Korea, on 23 March. The warship spent the last week of the month indulging in liberty at Pusan. From there, she moved on to Sasebo, Japan, for a repair and upkeep period preparatory to her return to the United States. On 9 April 1980, the frigate departed Sasebo and embarked upon the voyage home by way of Guam, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor. She reentered San Diego on 2 May. Post deployment standdown occupied the remainder of May while June and July brought a resumption of local operations. Early in August, she visited Alaskan waters before beginning regular overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at mid-month. Those repairs occupied the frigate for the rest of 1980 and for the first nine months of 1981. Early in October 1981, Albert David resumed local operations out of San Diego. That duty kept her busy until near the end of May 1982. On 29 May, she got underway for the western Pacific via Pearl Harbor. The frigate arrived in Subic Bay on 2 July. After almost three weeks at that base in the Philippines, Albert David moved north to Sasebo, Japan, where she stayed from 26 July until 12 August. The warship arrived back in Subic Bay on 17 August but set sail again four days later on the 21st in company with the destroyer and stores ship bound for the Arabian Sea and a tour of duty with the Middle East Force. She performed surveillance chores in the Arabian Sea from 7 September to 18 October. On 19 October, Albert David started out on the long voyage back to the United States. She entered San Diego on 30 November and spent the remainder of 1982 engaged in post-deployment leave and upkeep. Standdown carried over well into the third week of 1983. On 20 January, Albert David took up local operations out of San Diego with a three-day readiness exercise. A variety of training evolutions conducted in the waters off the coast of southern California occupied her time during the nine months between January and October 1983. On 4 October, however, the frigate stood out to sea on her way to the Far East once more. She made a five-day stop at Pearl Harbor and conducted a battle problem in the Mariana Islands before steaming into Subic Bay at the beginning of the second week in November. At mid-month, Albert David put to sea again to participate in a series of bilateral exercises with units of the Royal Malaysian Navy, the Royal Singapore Navy, and the Navy of the Republic of Korea. Interspersed among those exercises were goodwill and liberty calls at Lumut in Malaysia, Singapore, Chinhae in Korea, and at Hong Kong. On 28 December, she returned to the Philippines at Manila where she ushered in the new year. Albert Davids western Pacific deployment continued until early April 1984. January brought a visit to Cebu City in the Philippines, a brief return to Subic Bay, and another bilateral exercise, this time with the Royal Thai Navy. Exercises with other units of the 7th Fleet followed. At the end of January, the frigate sailed north to Japan for upkeep and repairs at Yokosuka. At the beginning of the last week in February, the warship completed repairs and put to sea to conduct antisubmarine warfare exercises with elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. The end of February and beginning of March brought visits to Sasebo and Fukuoka in Japan. During mid-March, she operated with South Korean Navy units again and then made port visits at Chinhae and Pusan, Korea, and at Sasebo, Japan. Albert David departed Sasebo on 3 April on her way back to the United States. En route, she lingered in the Marianas to participate in another battle problem and stopped at Pearl Harbor on 21 and 22 April. The warship pulled into San Diego on 30 April. Post-deployment standdown took up the month of May, and operations along the California coast occupied the summer and early fall of 1984. At the beginning of November, Albert David began restricted availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. That repair period carried her into 1985. Back in San Diego by 5 January, she resumed local operations by the end of the month. The frigate settled into a schedule of training exercises along the west coast, highlighted by port visits to Canadian and United States cities, that kept her busy throughout 1985 and nearly through 1986. On 29 September 1986, Albert David entered the yard of the National Steel & Shipbuilding Co. at San Diego to begin regular overhaul. Upon completion the ship participated in numerous ASW and detailed testing platform operations in the North Pacific and mid Pacific Islands as a member of DESRON 31 until on 18 September 1989 she was decommissioned. Albert David earned three battle stars for service in the Vietnam War. Brazilian service Par√° (D27) The Brazilian Navy leased the ship from its date of decommissioning from the USN on 18 September 1989, renaming the ship as the destroyer Par√° (D 27). Brazil later purchased the vessel outright on 24 January 2001 and it was struck from the US' Naval Vessel Register that same date.

University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case which interpreted Congressional silence in the face of earlier interpretations of similar laws to determine that Title IX of the Higher Education Act provides an implied cause of action. Facts Plaintiff Geraldine Cannon sued the University of Chicago, asserting that she was denied admission on the basis of her sex, and that she had a cause of action under Title IX, which bars sex discrimination by federally funded institutions, but does not expressly grant a private right of action. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the case. The dismissal was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which held that the statutory procedure for termination of federal funds was the exclusive remedy provided by Congress. One issue, buried in footnotes, would be of importance in the subsequent Alexander v. Sandoval decision. The University of Chicago claimed that Cannon was denied admission because the medical university admissions departments had a policy of not admitting applicants over thirty years of age, at least not without an advanced degree. Northwestern Medical School absolutely disqualified applicants over 35. Cannon was 39 years old at the time. The policy had a disparate impact on women. The plaintiff appealed, contending that Congress acted in light of similar language in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which the Supreme Court had already found to imply a private remedy, and to which Congress had allowed attorney fees (which would be unnecessary absent a private right of action). Issue Did Congress intend a private remedy to be implied from the Title IX? Are individuals allowed to sue under Title IX, or are they only allowed to participate in class-action suits by the HEW? Holding The Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, applied the four-part test set forth in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975), used in order to determine whether Congress had meant for a law to be able to be privately enforced: # Is the plaintiff a member of a special class for whose benefit the statute was enacted? (The court notes that this can not be used to imply a right of action that is merely a criminal statute that prohibits all persons from engaging in a general prohibited behavior). # Does legislative history express a legislative intent to create or deny a private right of action? # Would creation of a private right of action frustrate legislative scheme, or is it in fact helpful to it? # Does the right involve an area that historically has basically been of concern to the States? The court determined that all of the Cort factors pointed to an implied right of action: # Women are clearly in the special class protected by the statute, for the statute identifies persons who shall not be excluded. # Title IX contained language which copied that of Title VI, for which a private cause of action had already been implied by the Fifth Circuit at the time Title IX was adopted; this was held to show legislative intent. # The remedy was necessary, or at least helpful to accomplishing one of Congress‚Äô two purposes: avoiding federal support for discriminators and protecting individual citizens from discrimination. Private suits make this second purpose easier to implement. # This question is not left to states because the federal government is primarily responsible for protecting against discrimination. The Court also recognized that while this new source of financial liability might affect universities badly, it was up to Congress to weigh that concern. Dissent A dissenting opinion by Justice Powell raised separation of powers concerns. He called the Court's decision legislation, noting that Congress knew how to make judicial remedies, and saying that three of the four factors invited judicial lawmakingonly the second factor, he argued, was really about congressional intent. Powell contended that the Court's decision would encourage Congress to be lax in their duty to create laws, expecting democratically unaccountable judges to do the job for them.

Early life Roberto Ivens was the son of Margarida J√∫lia de Medeiros Castelo Branco and Robert Breakspeare Ivens (1822-?). Margarida was of lower nobility and Roberto's Grandfather, William Ivens, was a merchant awarded the Ivens Arms by George III in 1816. Robert Breakspeare Ivens was a great-grandson of Thomas Hickling (Boston 1745-1836 Ponta Delgada) the American vice-consul in Ponta Delgada. In 1861, Ivens attended the Navy School in Lisbon. At school Roberto was known as \\"Roberto of the Devil\\" and he became known as an intelligent young gentleman. He joined the Portuguese Navy in 1870 at the age of 20 and attended Escola Pr√°tica de Artilharia Naval in 1871. Ivens left for the Suez Canal in September of the same year, where he was the garrison of the Estef√¢nia. Travels Roberto Ivens (right) with Hermenegildo Capelo in Iaca. Ivens began his travels in Angola in 1872. On October 10, 1874, he completed three years of travels in the colonies. Returning to Portugal in January 1875, Ivens made examination for lieutenant. In April 1875, he sailed on the Duque de Terceira for Portuguese S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and various ports of South America. In 1876, Ivens set out for the United States, bringing Portuguese products to Philadelphia for the Centennial Exposition. His ancestor, Thomas Hickling, had been an ardent American revolutionary, and had in fact left Boston for the Azores following an argument with his loyalist father. Ivens went on an expedition into the provinces of Angola and Mozambique beginning on May 11, 1877 and studied relations between hydrographic basins in Zambezi. His hydrographic studies are considered even today to be \\"amazingly perfect\\". In the same year he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Ivens went on an expedition on June 21, 1885 at Quelimane in Mozambique. Ivens, as requested by the King Lu√≠s I, and in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference, to travel between Angola and Mozambique, which ended in over 4,500 miles (about 8,300 km) of which 1/3 was uncharted in what was called \\"Contracosta\\". For his service to Portugal, Roberto had the honor of being named aide-de-camp to King Lu√≠s. In 1895, he was made Officer of Military Order of Aviz and was nominated on October 17 as secretary of the Commission of Cartography. Honours Portugal has ten streets named after Roberto Ivens including one in Ponta Delgada named Avenida Roberto Ivens.

It crosses the Rideau Canal linking the Glebe and Centretown to Old Ottawa East. The bridge was built in 1915, replacing an earlier wooden swing bridge on Argyle Street just to the north. It is a vertical-lift bridge, meaning that the central portion of the bridge can be elevated to allow boats to pass underneath. Although built by the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, the lift span is not a bascule type but a lift-type. In the late 1970s it was discovered that road salt had seriously damaged the bridge. Proposals were advanced to build a larger and higher bridge, but these were opposed by those who saw the bridge as a heritage structure. Eventually it was decided to rebuild the bridge almost exactly as it had been before. The bridge shares its name with nearby Pretoria Avenue. Pretoria Avenue, formerly Jane Street, was renamed in 1902 to commemorate the British victory in the Second Boer War and those Canadians that had served. The name comes from the captured Boer capital, Pretoria. The name later become controversial as most Canadians associated it with the apartheid regime in South Africa. In the late 1980s a movement was launched to rename the bridge after Nelson Mandela. This was opposed by others who felt it was an important monument to Canadians who had fought in South Africa. City council refused to get involved and the proposal eventually died. References\\"The battle of Pretoria Bridge.\\" Dan Turner. The Ottawa Citizen. Ottawa, Ont.: Oct 16, 1988. pg.

It was the first episode written by Steven Moffat, who later became the showrunner and main writer of the series in 2010 following Russell T Davies' departure, and was directed by James Hawes. \\"The Empty Child\\" is the first of a two-part story, which concluded with \\"The Doctor Dances\\", on 28 May. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) arrive in 1941 during the London Blitz, where they find that the city has been terrorised by a strange child in a gas mask repeatedly asking for his mother. The episode marks the first appearance of John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, who would become a recurring character in Doctor Who and the lead character of the spin-off series Torchwood. \\"The Empty Child\\" was watched by 7.11 million viewers in the UK. The two-part story has been cited by critics amongst the best of the show, and it won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. Plot The Ninth Doctor and Rose follow a time- travelling metal cylinder to London during the Blitz of World War II. Landing about a month after the cylinder, the Doctor tries to track it, while Rose discovers a young boy wearing a gas mask on a nearby roof. Rose climbs on a nearby rope, but she realises too late that the rope is the tethering cable of a barrage balloon, and is carried off the ground. Captain Jack Harkness, a former time agent from the future posing as a Royal Air Force officer, rescues Rose with his camouflaged spaceship before Rose falls from the balloon. Jack mistakes Rose for a potential customer of an object that he is willing to sell. Rose plays along, but insists she needs to discuss the matter with her partner before buying. Meanwhile, the Doctor returns to the TARDIS to find its phone ringing; despite caution from Nancy, a young woman nearby, not to answer it, he does, only to hear the voice of a child asking \\"Are you my mummy?\\" He follows Nancy to a house left empty from the recent air raid sirens, where Nancy and some orphaned children eat a meal abandoned by the homeowners. The Doctor tries to learn more from Nancy, but the boy in the gas mask knocks at the door. Nancy orders the children to leave by the back entrance, and warns the Doctor not to touch the boy. The Doctor opens the door anyway, but the child is gone. The Doctor catches up to Nancy and convinces her to give him more information. Nancy reveals that she knew the cylinder fell near a nearby hospital, and its appearance is tied to the boy. The Doctor arrives at the hospital and discovers several patients wearing gas masks fused to their bodies. Dr Constantine, an elderly doctor at the hospital, explains that Jamie, Nancy's brother, was the first patient with this symptom. Suddenly, Constantine changes into another gas mask-wearing person, and the other patients all rise to start chasing the Doctor. Rose and Jack arrive and quickly escape with the Doctor. The Doctor forces Jack to admit that the crashed cylinder is just a Chula medical ship. The three are trapped in a room as the converted patients converge on them, all asking \\"Are you my mummy?\\" Nancy, who had returned to the home to get more food, is also cornered by Jamie, the boy, as he reaches out to her. Production The titular Empty Child, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. This episode had the working title \\"World War II\\". Early versions of this script quoted this episode's title as being \\"An Empty Child\\". This is a reference to \\"An Unearthly Child\\", the very first episode of Doctor Who. The episode's television listings information and the DVD cover also mention that \\"London is being terrorised by an unearthly child\\". In Davies's initial pitch, Captain Jack was originally called 'Captain Jax', an interstellar alien soldier. The name Jax was eventually dropped, as was Jack's original characterisation, instead being a human conman from the 51st century. The filming took place during the fourth production block. Special effects shots were completed at Unit Q2 in Newport on 17 and 18 December 2004. From 4 to 8 January and from 11 to 14 January scenes at Cardiff Royal Infirmary were filmed. On 9 and 10 January scenes shot in alleyways were filmed in Womanby Street, Cardiff. The bar scenes were also shot on 10 January at Headlands School in Penarth. The scene in which Rose hangs from the barrage balloon was filmed in a hangar at RAF St Athan and then in the Vale of Glamorgan, on 17 January. From 18 to 20 January filming involving Jack's ship and the TARDIS took place at the studio at Unit Q2. Extra TARDIS scenes were shot on 7 February. Scenes in the Lloyd's house were filmed on 28 January. Glamorgan House in Cardiff was used for the officers' club scene on 8 February. Location filming also took place at the Barry Tourist Railway. Barry Island and its now-demolished Butlins holiday camp had previously been the filming location of the Seventh Doctor serial, Delta and the Bannermen. The sound of Dr Constantine's skull cracking as his face changes into a gas mask was considered too horrific in its full form by the production team and was cut before broadcast. However, writer Steven Moffat claims on the DVD commentary to this episode that the sound was discussed but never put on. According to the Doctor Who Confidential episode \\"Fear Factor\\", the effect was added in the version of the episode presented on The Complete First Series box set. Casting for Captain Jack Harkness began around June with particular consideration to John Barrowman per the request of executive producer Julie Gardener. Unlike previous episodes, the \\"next episode\\" trailers were shown after the end credits instead of immediately preceding them, possibly in reaction to comments after \\"Aliens of London\\" about having the cliffhanger for that episode spoiled. This trend has continued for most two- part stories in the new series. Writer Steven Moffat says in the DVD commentary for this episode that the Doctor's reply to Rose asking him what she should call him (\\"Doctor who?\\") was originally going to be, \\"I'd rather have Doctor Who than Star Trek,\\" a metafictional dig at the latter programme. This is the first televised Doctor Who story to make a direct reference to Star Trek. The Chula ships are named after Chula, an Indian/Bangladeshi fusion restaurant in Hammersmith, London where the writers celebrated and discussed their briefs on the scripts they were to write for the season after being commissioned by Russell T Davies.London Restaurants  Chula This meeting was videotaped, and is available on the DVD release of Doctor Who ‚Äî The Complete First Series. The episode was initially smaller in scale and personal with writer Steven Moffat saying that \\"there was no big enemy and the major fear factor was a little boy looking for his mummy. Doctor Who can be small and domestic, and brilliantly effective.\\" Broadcast and reception \\"The Empty Child\\" received overnight ratings of 6.6 million viewers, a 34.9% audience share. When final ratings were calculated, the figure rose to 7.11 million viewers. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 84. SFX stated that the two-part story had \\"everything\\", particularly praising Moffat's script. In 2012, Dave Golder of the magazine labelled \\"The Empty Child\\" as a good example of the science fiction \\"Creepy Kid Episode\\". Dek Hogan of Digital Spy disliked Barrowman as Captain Jack, but called it a \\"particularly creepy episode of the series\\" despite Jack and \\"the brevity of Richard Wilson's neat and spooky little cameo\\". He later called \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" the best episodes of the series. Now Playing magazine reviewer Arnold T. Blumburg gave the episode a grade of a B, describing it as \\"solid\\" with elements of the original series, though he noted a lot was thrown at the audience and he was not impressed with Barrowman's Jack yet. In a poll conducted by Doctor Who Magazine in 2009, the two-part story was ranked the fifth best episode of Doctor Who. In a similar poll conducted in 2014, readers ranked the two-part story the seventh best Doctor Who story of all time. The Daily Telegraph named the story the fourth best of the show in 2008. In 2011 before the second half of the sixth series, The Huffington Post labelled \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" as one of five essential episodes for new viewers to watch. In 2013 Doctor Who TV rated The Empty Child as the twentieth scariest villain. \\"The Empty Child\\", along with its conclusion \\"The Doctor Dances\\", won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form).

Originally established in 1948 at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, Zoo Miami relocated in 1980 as Miami MetroZoo to the former location of the Richmond Naval Air Station,Destroyed Richmond Naval Air Station southwest of Miami in southern metropolitan Miami-Dade County, in the center of the census- designated places of Three Lakes (north), South Miami Heights (south), Palmetto Estates (east) and Richmond West (west). The only tropical zoo in the continental United States, Zoo Miami houses over 3,000 animals on nearly , of which are developed. It is about around if walked on the path, and features over 100 exhibits. The zoo's communications director is wildlife expert and photographer Ron Magill. Zoo Miami is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). History Entrance sign with the old Zoo name The history of Zoo Miami can be traced back to 1948, when a small road show, stranded near Miami, exchanged three monkeys, a goat and two black bears for approximately $270 in repairs for the truck. These six animals were the beginning of the Crandon Park Zoo at Crandon Park on the island of Key Biscayne, just southeast off the coast from downtown Miami. The Crandon Park Zoo occupied of the park. The first animals in the zoo, including some lions, an elephant and a rhinoceros, had been stranded when a circus went out of business in Miami. Some Galapagos tortoises, monkeys and pheasants were added from the Matheson plantation.Blank, Joan Gill. 1996. HIKey Biscayne. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press, Inc. . pp. 158-160, 163-164. By 1967, the Crandon Park Zoo had grown to over 1,200 animals, and was considered one of the top 25 zoos in the country. Other animals were added, including a white Bengal tiger in 1968. In 1965, Hurricane Betsy devastated the zoo and killed 250 animals. After the hurricane there was talk of a new zoo for Dade County, but not until 11 December 1970 did Dade County officials apply for of land in the Richmond Naval Air Station property. Construction began in 1975. The zoo opened on July 4, 1980 as Miami MetroZoo with a preview section of 12 exhibits and Asia, the first major exhibit, opened on December 12, 1981. A total of 38 exhibits, covering , were open to the public at this time. In the 1980s, the zoo continued to expand. An additional with six new African hoofed stock exhibits opened in 1982, along with the zoo's monorail in 1984. After the closing of 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans, monorails were being moved in Florida and re-used at Miami MetroZoo.Cotter, Bill, The 1984 New Orleans World's Fair, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, 2008, p.120. Wings of Asia, a free-flight aviary, was opened in December 1984. Three additional African hoofed stock exhibits followed in 1985, and two new exhibits were opened in the African savanna section in 1986. The Australian section of the zoo was opened in 1989, and PAWS, the children's petting zoo, opened in 1989. The Asian Riverlife Experience opened in August 1990. In 1992, the zoo suffered extensive damage when Hurricane Andrew made landfall in South Florida on August 24. The small, yet intensely powerful category 5 hurricane toppled over 5,000 trees and destroyed the Wings of Asia aviary‚Äîwhich had been built to withstand winds of up to ‚Äîresulting in the loss of approximately 100 of the 300 resident birds. Despite the majority of the zoo's animals remaining outside during the duration and aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, only five animals were killed from either debris or the consumption of contaminated water. MetroZoo, though looking dramatically different, was reopened on December 18, 1992; with the zoo's tiger temple exhibit renamed in honor of Naomi Browning, a local 12-year-old zoo volunteer who was one of the storm's casualties. By July 1993, many of the animals that were sent to other zoos and animal parks across the United States during the zoo's reconstruction had been returned to MetroZoo, and over 7,000 new trees had been planted to begin restoring the zoo's tree canopy. In 1994, stray dogs entered the zoo during off-hours and killed five Thomson's gazelles and two Grant's gazelles. In 1996, a brush fire burned 100 acres in the southeast portion of the zoo's undeveloped land. Nearly 30 animals from neighboring exhibits were evacuated. The Falcon Batchelor Komodo Dragon Encounter opened that same year, followed by Andean Condor (1999), Meerkats (2000), Cuban Crocodiles and Squirrel Monkeys (2001), and Dr. Wilde's World, which is an indoor facility for traveling zoological exhibits. The rebuilt Wings of Asia aviary, housing more than 300 individuals representing 70 species of birds, opened in the spring of 2003. On July 4, 2010, the zoo was renamed the Miami-Dade Zoological Park and Gardens, or Zoo Miami, for marketing and branding purposes. This was a part of the zoo's 30th anniversary celebration. The zoo broke ground on a $43 million project that included an Everglades exhibit and a new state-of-the-art entryway. The Everglades exhibit opened on December 10, 2016. In 2017, the zoo was struck by Hurricane Irma, which impacted South Florida on September 10. The Amazon and Beyond exhibit suffered the most damage, with widespread tree loss in that area. According to the zoo, one American flamingo, one Great hornbill, and a few other birds died reportedly due to stress. The zoo remained closed until October. =Conservation efforts= Zoo Miami supports conservation programs at the local, national and global level, and was a founding member of the AZA's Butterfly Conservation Initiative (BFCI), a program designed to assemble non-governmental organizations and government agencies to aid in the population recovery of imperiled butterflies in North America. The zoo has also provided financial help through the Zoo Miami Conservation Fund to upgrade captive breeding facilities in Thailand zoos for endangered clouded leopards and fishing cats.

The zoo's main entry includes an entryway canopy structure, conjoining ticket booths and gift shop, and an adjacent American flamingo exhibit. At the junction of the zoo's main pathways, is the Conservation Action Center, an indoor pavilion featuring interactive exhibits themed to conservation and wildlife preservation. The property includes a large lake, called Lake Iguana. An air-conditioned monorail system loops around the zoo's premises, providing both an aerial view of the zoo and a convenient way to move between sections. The monorail system has four stations, each found throughout the zoo. Narrated tram rides and guided tours are given daily. = Florida: Mission Everglades = The Florida: Mission Everglades exhibit features native fauna and flora species found in Florida, particularly from the state's Everglades region. Species displayed include American alligators, American crocodiles, North American river otters, American black bears, Florida panthers, and bald eagles. The $33 million project features Lostman's River Ride, a gentle air boat ride attraction. =Asia= white Bengal tiger, was an iconic showcase of the zoo for nearly two decades. The zoo's Asian exhibit features dozens of animals such as Bornean orangutans, Asian elephants, Indian rhinoceros, Sumatran tigers, Indian gaur, Bactrian camels, dromedaries, Malayan tapirs, sloth bears, clouded leopards, and Asian small- clawed otters. The multi-leveled Asian Riverlife Experience replicates the appearance of an Asian river brook. Zoo Miami is only one of two zoos in the United States to display a pair of black-necked storks. The zoo's orangutan exhibit once housed Nonja, a female Sumatran orangutan that was relocated from a Dutch zoo to Zoo Miami. She was widely believed to be the oldest living specimen of her species, until her death in 2007. Another notable resident was Carlita, a 21-year-old female white Bengal tiger, who resided in the zoo's tiger enclosure from 1994 until her death in 2013. The American Banker's Family Aviary, Wings of Asia is also located here. The aviary features 300 rare birds of 70 species in a temperate mixed forest, and it highlights the evolutionary connection of birds to dinosaurs. At , it is the largest open-air Asian aviary in the Western Hemisphere. The Children's Zoo, hosts special animals that can be approached to a close distance by guests. Guests can view meerkats, a petting zoo, an exhibit that displays small species of reptiles, amphibians and insects, butterfly gardens, a carousel dedicated to individual animal species, and experience traditional camel rides. =Africa= The African lobe of the zoo offers animals from different locations on the African continent. Visitors can observe species including reticulated giraffes, pygmy hippos, African elephants, black rhinoceroses, zebras, ostriches, Western lowland gorillas and okapis. Oasis Grill, a small eatery plaza, is situated at the northern end of the African exhibits. =Amazon and Beyond= Amazon and Beyond, situated in the zoo's northwest corner, opened on December 6, 2008. This area has dedicated to the flora and fauna of South America, and is subdivided into four distinct areas: Village Plaza, Cloud Forest, Amazon Flooded Forest, and Atlantic Forest. The first area provides guests an immersive experience for the unique culture found in central and southern American civilizations. The remaining three areas represent native habitats that are found in the Amazonian region‚Äîthe \\"cloud forest\\", the Amazon River basin, and the Atlantic Forest-Pantanal‚Äîwith species such as giant river otters, jaguars, Orinoco crocodiles, giant anteaters, howler monkeys, and fruit bats. =Australia= The zoo's Australian habitat showcases specimens from throughout the region of Australia, Oceania, and the Pacific islands, including koalas, emus, giant tortoises, and tree-kangaroos. Situated near this to habitat, is the 800-seat Sami Family Amphitheater, where daily animal presentations, concerts and cultural events are held. The amphitheater is named in memory of Albert and Winifred Sami, who anonymously donated an estimated $3 million to the zoo from 1993 until their deaths in 2007 and 2014, respectively. Zoo Miami recently celebrated the birth of a baby koala, who was actually born in May, 2019, but only emerged from its mothers pouch on January 8, 2020. The baby koala was named Hope in light of the recent fires that devastated Australia.

He was born in Shifnal, Shropshire and died in Bristol fifteen years after opening his medical practice there. He was a reforming practitioner and teacher of medicine, and an associate of leading scientific figures. He worked to treat tuberculosis. Beddoes was a friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and, according to E. S. Shaffer, an important influence on Coleridge's early thinking, introducing him to the higher criticism. The poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes was his son. A painting of him by Samson Towgood Roch is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Life Beddoes was born in Shifnal on 13 April 1760 at Balcony House. He was educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School and Pembroke College, Oxford. He enrolled in the University of Edinburgh's medical course in the early 1780s. There he was taught chemistry by Joseph Black and natural history by Kendall Walker. He also studied medicine in London under John Sheldon. In 1784 he published a translation of Lazzaro Spallanzani's Dissertations on Natural History, and in 1785 produced a translation, with original notes, of Torbern Olof Bergman's Essays on Elective Attractions. He took his degree of doctor of medicine at Pembroke College, Oxford University in 1786. In 1794, he married Anna, daughter of his associate at the Bristol Pneumatic Institution, Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Their son, poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes, was born in 1803 in Bristol. Career Beddoes visited Paris after 1786, where he became acquainted with Lavoisier. Beddoes was appointed professor of chemistry at Oxford University in 1788. His lectures attracted large and appreciative audiences; but his sympathy with the French Revolution excited a clamour against him, he resigned his readership in 1792. In the following year he published the History of Isaac Jenkins, a story which powerfully exhibits the evils of drunkenness, and of which 40,000 copies are reported to have been sold. Beddoes addressed tuberculosis, seeking treatments for the disease. He had a clinic in Bristol from 1793 to 1799 and later began the Pneumatic Institution to test various gases for the treatment of tuberculosis. The institution was later changed to a general hospital. = Hope Square, Bristol = Beddoes' first tuberculosis clinic in Bristol, at Hope Square thumbleftPlaque to Beddoes in Hope Square alt=Plaque: Thomas Beddoes MD (1760‚Äì1808).

Clifton and Hotwells Improvement Society Between 1793 and 1799 Beddoes had a clinic at Hope Square, Hotwells in Bristol where he treated patients with tuberculosis. On the principle that butchers seemed to suffer less from tuberculosis than others, he kept cows in a byre alongside the building and encouraged them to breathe on his patients. This became the source of local ridicule, amongst claims that animals were kept in the clinic's bedrooms, against the protests of landlords. Despite the link he saw between proximity to cows and lower incidence of tuberculosis, he remained sceptical when Edward Jenner began using a cow- derived vaccination for smallpox a few years later. = Bristol Pneumatic Institution = Pneumatic Institution premises, 6 Dowry Square, with 7 to the right While living in Hotwells he began work on a project to establish an institution for treating disease by the inhalation of different gases, which he called pneumatic medicine. He was assisted by Richard Lovell Edgeworth. In 1799 the Pneumatic Institution was established at Dowry Square, Hotwells. Its first superintendent was Humphry Davy, who investigated the properties of nitrous oxide in its laboratory. The original aim of the institution was gradually abandoned; it became a general hospital, and was relinquished by its founder in the year before his death.

Click chemistry is not a single specific reaction, but describes a way of generating products that follow examples in nature, which also generates substances by joining small modular units. In many applications, click reactions join a biomolecule and a reporter molecule. Click chemistry is not limited to biological conditions: the concept of a \\"click\\" reaction has been used in pharmacological and various biomimetic applications. However, they have been made notably useful in the detection, localization and qualification of biomolecules. Click reactions occur in one pot, are not disturbed by water, generate minimal and inoffensive byproducts, and are \\"spring-loaded\\"‚Äîcharacterized by a high thermodynamic driving force that drives it quickly and irreversibly to high yield of a single reaction product, with high reaction specificity (in some cases, with both regio- and stereo-specificity). These qualities make click reactions particularly suitable to the problem of isolating and targeting molecules in complex biological environments. In such environments, products accordingly need to be physiologically stable and any byproducts need to be non-toxic (for in vivo systems). By developing specific and controllable bioorthogonal reactions, scientists have opened up the possibility of hitting particular targets in complex cell lysates. Recently, scientists have adapted click chemistry for use in live cells, for example using small molecule probes that find and attach to their targets by click reactions. Despite challenges of cell permeability, bioorthogonality, background labeling, and reaction efficiency, click reactions have already proven useful in a new generation of pulldown experiments (in which particular targets can be isolated using, for instance, reporter molecules which bind to a certain column), and fluorescence spectrometry (in which the fluorophore is attached to a target of interest and the target quantified or located). More recently, novel methods have been used to incorporate click reaction partners onto and into biomolecules, including the incorporation of unnatural amino acids containing reactive groups into proteins and the modification of nucleotides. These techniques represent a part of the field of chemical biology, in which click chemistry plays a fundamental role by intentionally and specifically coupling modular units to various ends. The term \\"click chemistry\\" was coined by K. Barry Sharpless in 1998, and was first fully described by Sharpless, Hartmuth Kolb, and M.G. Finn of The Scripps Research Institute in 2001.  Background  Click chemistry is a method for attaching a probe or substrate of interest to a specific biomolecule, a process called bioconjugation. The possibility of attaching fluorophores and other reporter molecules has made click chemistry a very powerful tool for identifying, locating, and characterizing both old and new biomolecules. One of the earliest and most important methods in bioconjugation was to express a reporter on the same open reading frame as a biomolecule of interest. Notably, GFP was first (and still is) expressed in this way at the N- or C- terminus of many proteins. However, this approach comes with several difficulties. For instance, GFP is a very large unit and can often affect the folding of the protein of interest. Moreover, by being expressed at either terminus, the GFP adduct can also affect the targeting and expression of the desired protein. Finally, using this method, GFP can only be attached to proteins, and not post-translationally, leaving other important biomolecular classes (nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, etc.) out of reach. To overcome these challenges, chemists have opted to proceed by identifying pairs of bioorthogonal reaction partners, thus allowing the use of small exogenous molecules as biomolecular probes. A fluorophore can be attached to one of these probes to give a fluorescence signal upon binding of the reporter molecule to the target‚Äîjust as GFP fluoresces when it is expressed with the target. Now limitations emerge from the chemistry of the probe to its target. In order for this technique to be useful in biological systems, click chemistry must run at or near biological conditions, produce little and (ideally) non-toxic byproducts, have (preferably) single and stable products at the same conditions, and proceed quickly to high yield in one pot. Existing reactions, such as Staudinger ligation and the Huisgen 1,3‚Äìdipolar cycloaddition, have been modified and optimized for such reaction conditions. Today, research in the field concerns not only understanding and developing new reactions and repurposing and re-understanding known reactions, but also expanding methods used to incorporate reaction partners into living systems, engineering novel reaction partners, and developing applications for bioconjugation. Reactions For a reaction to be considered a click reaction, it must satisfy certain characteristics:Stereolithography of polymer derived ceramics through Thiol-Ene Click Chemistry * modularity * insensitivity to solvent parameters * high chemical yields * insensitivity towards oxygen and water * regiospecificity and stereospecificity * a large thermodynamic driving force (>20 kcal/mol) to favor a reaction with a single reaction product. A distinct exothermic reaction makes a reactant \\"spring- loaded\\". The process would preferably: * have simple reaction conditions * use readily available starting materials and reagents * use no solvent or use a solvent that is benign or easily removed (preferably water) * provide simple product isolation by non-chromatographic methods (crystallisation or distillation) * have high atom economy. Many of the click chemistry criteria are subjective, and even if measurable and objective criteria could be agreed upon, it is unlikely that any reaction will be perfect for every situation and application. However, several reactions have been identified that fit the concept better than others: * [3+2] cycloadditions, such as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, in particular the Cu(I)-catalyzed stepwise variant, are often referred to simply as Click reactions * Thiol-ene reaction Lowe, A. B. Polymer Chemistry 2010, 1 (1), 17‚Äì36. DOI: 10.1039/B9PY00216B * Diels-Alder reaction and inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction * [4+1] cycloadditions between isonitriles (isocyanides) and tetrazines * nucleophilic substitution especially to small strained rings like epoxy and aziridines * carbonyl-chemistry-like formation of ureas but not reactions of the aldol type due to low thermodynamic driving force. * addition reactions to carbon-carbon double bonds like dihydroxylation or the alkynes in the thiol-yne reaction. =Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)= The classicDevelopment and Applications of Click Chemistry Gregory C. Patton November 8, 2004 http://www.scs.uiuc.edu Online click reaction is the copper- catalyzed reaction of an azide with an alkyne to form a 5-membered heteroatom ring: a Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). The first triazole synthesis, from diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and phenyl azide, was reported by Arthur Michael in 1893.L. Liang and D. Astruc: \\"The copper(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) \\"click\\" reaction and its applications. An overview\\", 2011; 255, 23-24, 2933-2045, p. 2934 Later, in the middle of the 20th century, this family of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions took on Huisgen's name after his studies of their reaction kinetics and conditions. A comparison of the Huisgen and the copper-catalyzed Azide-Alkyne cycloadditions The copper(I)-catalysis of the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was discovered concurrently and independently by the groups of Valery V. Fokin and K. Barry Sharpless at the Scripps Research Institute in California and Morten Meldal in the Carlsberg Laboratory, Denmark. The copper-catalyzed version of this reaction gives only the 1,4-isomer, whereas Huisgen's non-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition gives both the 1,4- and 1,5-isomers, is slow, and requires a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. The two-copper mechanism of the CuAAC catalytic cycle Moreover, this copper-catalyzed ‚Äúclick‚Äù does not require ligands on the metal, although accelerating ligands such as tris(triazolyl)methyl amine ligands with various substituents have been reported and used with success in aqueous solution. Other ligands such as PPh3 and TBIA can also be used, even though PPh3 is liable to Staudinger ligation with the azide substituent. Cu2O in water at room temperature was found also to catalyze the same reaction in 15 minutes with 91% yield.K. Wang, X. Bi, S. Xing, P. Liao, Z. Fang, X. Meng, Q. Zhang, Q. Liu, Y. Ji Green Chem., 13 (2011), p. 562 The first reaction mechanism proposed included one catalytic copper atom; but isotope, kinetic, and other studies have suggested a dicopper mechanism may be more relevant.B. T. Worrell, J. A. Malik, V. V. Fokin 2013, 340, 457-459 ; J.E. Hein, V.V. Fokin, Chem. Soc. Rev. 39 (2010) 1302. Even though this reaction proceeds effectively at biological conditions, copper in this range of dosage is cytotoxic. Solutions to this problem have been presented, such as using water-soluble ligands on the copper to enhance cell penetration of the catalyst and thereby reduce the dosage needed,Brotherton, W. S.; Michaels, H. A.; Simmons, J. T.; Clark, R.J.; Dalal, N. S.; Zhu, L. Org. Lett. 2009, 11, 4954.Kuang, G.-C.; Michaels, H. A.; Simmons, J. T.; Clark, R. J.; Zhu, L\\" J. Org. Chem. 2010; 75, 6540.Uttamapinant, C.; Tangpeerachaikul, A.; Grecian, S.; Clarke, S.; Singh, U.; Slade, P.; Gee, K. R.; Ting, A. Y\\" Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012; 51, 5852 or to use chelating ligands to further increase the effective concentration of Cu(I) and thereby decreasing the actual dosage.Alder, K.; Stein, G.; Finzenhagen, H. Justus Liebigs Ann.Chem 1931, 485, 211.Alder, K.; Stein, G. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1933, 501, 1.Wittig, G.; Krebs, A. Chem. Ber. 1961, 94, 3260. Although the Cu(I)-catalyzed variant was first reported by Meldal and co-workers for the synthesis of peptidotriazoles on solid support, they needed more time to discover the full scope of the reaction and were overtaken by the publicly more recognized Sharpless. Meldal and co-workers also chose not to label this reaction type \\"click chemistry\\" which allegedly caused their discovery to be largely overlooked by the mainstream chemical society. Sharpless and Fokin independently described it as a reliable catalytic process offering \\"an unprecedented level of selectivity, reliability, and scope for those organic synthesis endeavors which depend on the creation of covalent links between diverse building blocks.\\" An analogous RuAAC reaction catalyzed by ruthenium, instead of copper, was reported by the Jia and Folkin groups in 2005, and allows for the selective production of 1,5-isomers. =Strain-promoted azide- alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC)= The Bertozzi group further developed one of Huisgen's copper-free click reactions to overcome the cytotoxicity of the CuAAC reaction.Huisgen, R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1963, 2, 565 Instead of using Cu(I) to activate the alkyne, the alkyne is instead introduced in a strained difluorooctyne (DIFO), in which the electron- withdrawing, propargylic, gem-fluorines act together with the ring strain to greatly destabilize the alkyne. This destabilization increasing the reaction driving force, and the desire of the cycloalkyne to relieve its ring strain. Scheme of the Strain-promoted Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition This reaction proceeds as a concerted [3+2] cycloaddition in the same mechanism as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Substituents other than fluorines, such as benzene rings, are also allowed on the cyclooctyne. This reaction has been used successfully to probe for azides in living systems, even though the reaction rate is somewhat slower than that of the CuAAC. Moreover, because the synthesis of cyclooctynes often gives low yield, probe development for this reaction has not been as rapid as for other reactions. But cyclooctyne derivatives such as DIFO, dibenzylcyclooctyne (DIBO) and biarylazacyclooctynone (BARAC) have all been used successfully in the SPAAC reaction to probe for azides in living systems. =Strain-promoted alkyne- nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC)= Diaryl-strained-cyclooctynes including dibenzylcyclooctyne (DIBO) have also been used to react with 1,3-nitrones in strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloadditions (SPANC) to yield N-alkylated isoxazolines. The SPAAC vs SpANC reaction Because this reaction is metal-free and proceeds with fast kinetics (k2 as fast as 60 1/Ms, faster than both the CuAAC or the SPAAC) SPANC can be used for live cell labeling. Moreover, substitution on both the carbon and nitrogen atoms of the nitrone dipole, and acyclic and endocyclic nitrones are all tolerated. This large allowance provides a lot of flexibility for nitrone handle or probe incorporation.(64) (a) Ning, X.; Temming, R. P.; Dommerholt, J.; Guo, J.; Ania, D.B.; Debets, M. F.; Wolfert, M. A.; Boons, G.-J.; van Delft, F. L\\" Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010; 49, 3065. (b) McKay, C. S.; Moran, J.; Pezacki, J. P. Chem. Commun. (Cambridge, U. K.) 2010, 46, 931. (c) Debets, M.

Biomol. Chem. 2012, 10, 3066. However, the isoxazoline product is not as stable as the triazole product of the CuAAC and the SpAAC, and can undergo rearrangements at biological conditions. Regardless, this reaction is still very useful as it has notably fast reaction kinetics. The applications of this reaction include labeling proteins containing serine as the first residue: the serine is oxidized to aldehyde with NaIO4 and then converted to nitrone with p-methoxybenzenethiol, N-methylhydroxylamine and p-ansidine, and finally incubated with cyclooctyne to give a click product. The SPANC also allows for multiplex labeling. =Reactions of strained alkenes= Strained alkenes also utilize strain-relief as a driving force that allows for their participation in click reactions. Trans-cycloalkenes (usually cyclooctenes) and other strained alkenes such as oxanorbornadiene react in click reactions with a number of partners including azides, tetrazines and tetrazoles. These reaction partners can interact specifically with the strained alkene, staying bioorthogonal to endogenous alkenes found in lipids, fatty acids, cofactors and other natural products. Alkene and azide [3+2] cycloaddition Oxanorbornadiene (or another activated alkene) reacts with azides, giving triazoles as a product. However, these product triazoles are not aromatic as they are in the CuAAC or SPAAC reactions, and as a result are not as stable. The activated double bond in oxanobornadiene makes a triazoline intermediate that subsequently spontaneously undergoes a retro Diels-alder reaction to release furan and give 1,2,3- or 1,4,5-triazoles. Even though this reaction is slow, it is useful because oxabornodiene is relatively simple to synthesize. The reaction is not, however, entirely chemoselective.(67) (a) van Berkel, S. S.; Dirks, A.

ChemBioChem 2007, 8, 150 Alkene and tetrazine inverse- demand Diels-Alder A Tetrazine-Alkene reaction between a generalized tetrazine and a strained, trans-cyclooctene Strained cyclooctenes and other activated alkenes react with tetrazines in an inverse electron-demand Diels- Alder followed by a retro [4+2] cycloaddition (see figure). Like the other reactions of the trans-cyclooctene, ring strain release is a driving force for this reaction. Thus, three-membered and four-membered cycloalkenes, due to their high ring strain, make ideal alkene substrates. Similar to other [4+2] cycloadditions, electron-donating substituents on the dienophile and electron- withdrawing substituents on the diene accelerate the inverse-demand diels- alder. The diene, the tetrazine, by virtue of having the additional nitrogens, is a good diene for this reaction. The dienophile, the activated alkene, can often be attached to electron-donating alkyl groups on target molecules, thus making the dienophile more suitable for the reaction. Alkene and tetrazole photoclick reaction The tetrazole-alkene ‚Äúphotoclick‚Äù reaction is another dipolar addition that Huisgen first introduced about 50 years ago (ChemBioChem 2007, 8, 1504. (68) Clovis, J. S.; Eckell, A.; Huisgen, R.; Sustmann, R. Chem. Ber. 1967, 100, 60.) Tetrazoles with amino or styryl groups that can be activated by UV light at 365 nm (365 does not damage cells) react quickly (so that the UV light does not have to be on for a long time, usually around 1‚Äì4 minutes) to make fluorogenic pyrazoline products. This reaction scheme is well suited for the purpose of labeling in live cells, because UV light at 365 nm damages cells minimally. Moreover, the reaction proceeds quickly, so that the UV light can be administered for short durations. Quantum yields for short wavelength UV light can be higher than 0.5. This allows tetrazoles to be used wavelength selectively in combination with another photoligation reaction, where at the short wavelength the tetrazole ligation reaction proceeds nearly exclusively and at longer wavelength another reaction (ligation via o-quinodimethanes) proceeds exclusively. Finally, the non-fluorogenic reactants give rise to a fluorogenic product, equipping the reaction with a built-in spectrometry handle. Both tetrazoles and the alkene groups have been incorporated as protein handles as unnatural amino acids, but this benefit is not unique. Instead, the photoinducibility of the reaction makes it a prime candidate for spatiotemporal specificity in living systems. Challenges include the presence of endogenous alkenes, though usually cis (as in fatty acids) they can still react with the activated tetrazole.  Potential applications The commercial potential of click chemistry is great. The fluorophore rhodamine has been coupled onto norbonene, and reacted with tetrazine in living systems. In other cases, SPAAC between a cyclooctyne-modified fluorophore and azide-tagged proteins allowed the selection of these proteins in cell lysates. Unnatural Amino Acids Methods for the incorporation of click reaction partners into systems in and ex vivo contribute to the scope of possible reactions. The development of unnatural amino acid incorporation by ribosomes has allowed for the incorporation of click reaction partners as unnatural side groups on these unnatural amino acids. For example, an UAA with an azide side group provides convenient access for cycloalkynes to proteins tagged with this ‚ÄúAHA‚Äù unnatural amino acid. In another example, ‚ÄúCpK‚Äù has a side group including a cyclopropane alpha to an amide bond that serves as a reaction partner to tetrazine in an inverse diels-alder reaction. Scheme of the synthesis of firefly luciferin The synthesis of luciferin exemplifies another strategy of isolating reaction partners, which is to take advantage of rarely-occurring, natural groups such as the 1,2-aminothiol, which appears only when a cysteine is the final N‚Äô amino acid in a protein. Their natural selectivity and relative bioorthogonality is thus valuable in developing probes specific for these tags. The above reaction occurs between a 1,2-aminothiol and a 2-cyanobenzothiazole to make luciferin, which is fluorescent. This luciferin fluorescence can be then quantified by spectrometry following a wash, and used to determine the relative presence of the molecule bearing the 1,2-aminothiol. If the quantification of non-1,2-aminothiol-bearing protein is desired, the protein of interest can be cleaved to yield a fragment with a N‚Äô Cys that is vulnerable to the 2-CBT.(a) Liang, G.; Ren, H.; Rao, J.

The river provides part of the drainage of South Park, the intermontane grassland basin located between the Front Range and the Mosquito Range in the Rocky Mountains southwest of Denver. The river rises in northwestern Park County, at the continental divide along the north side of Mount Lincoln, just west of Hoosier Pass. It descends to the southeast in a narrow valley along State Highway 9 past Alma, emerging into the northwest end of South Park at Fairplay, which sits on a bluff on the east side of the river. It crosses South Park towards the southeast, between the watersheds of Tarryall Creek to the north and the South Fork South Platte River to the south, running along the western side of Red Hill, receiving several smaller creeks. It joins the South Fork from the north to the South Platte main branch just east of Hartsel, approximately two miles (3.2 km) east of the junction of State Highway 9 and U.S. Highway 24. The river was a significant source of placer gold during the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859, leading to the first large influx of white settlers into South Platte, previously inhabited principally by the Ute people.

It is the largest seminary of the ELCA. It also accepts and educates students of 41 other denominations and traditions. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the Association of Theological Schools. It also has theological accreditation through the ELCA as well as the United Methodist Church. History Luther Seminary is the result of a series of mergers that consolidated what at one time were five separate institutions into one seminary. =Luther Theological Seminary= In 1917, three Norwegian-American Lutheran churches united to create the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (NLCA). Each of the three churchbodies had operated a seminary. The Norwegian Synod's Luther Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, had been founded in 1876; the Hauge Synod's Red Wing Seminary in Red Wing, Minnesota, in 1879; and the United Norwegian Lutheran Church's United Church Seminary in Saint Paul, in 1892. The merged seminaries occupied the site of the United Church Seminary because it was the most developed and elaborate, and retained the name of the oldest of the three schools, namely, Luther Theological Seminary. The NLCA took the name Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1946 and, with other churches, formed the American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1960. The presidents of Luther Theological Seminary were: * Marcus Olaus B√∏ckmann 1892‚Äì1917 (United Church) * Marcus Olaus B√∏ckmann 1917‚Äì1930 * T. F. Gullixson 1930‚Äì1954 * Alvin Rogness 1954‚Äì1974 * Lloyd Svendsbye 1974‚Äì1982 =Augsburg Theological Seminary= Augsburg Theological Seminary, later renamed Augsburg University, was founded in 1869 at Marshall, Wisconsin, later moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1897 became the seminary of the Lutheran Free Church. It remained a separate seminary until 1963, at which time the Lutheran Free Church merged with the American Lutheran Church and Augsburg Seminary was merged with Luther Theological Seminary. The merged institution took the Luther Theological Seminary name and the 1869 founding date of Augsburg Seminary. =Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary= Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary traces its origin to the Chicago Lutheran Divinity School, begun in Chicago, Illinois, in 1920 following action taken by the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of the Northwest, a synod of the United Lutheran Church in America. In 1921, the seminary was moved to Fargo, North Dakota, and the following year to Minneapolis. From 1921 to 1982, its name was Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary. Located in north Minneapolis from 1922 to 1940 and in south Minneapolis from 1940 to 1967, it moved near the campus of Luther Theological Seminary in Saint Paul in 1967. At the time of the formation of the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962, Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary was placed under the jurisdiction of two supporting synods: the Minnesota Synod and the Red River Valley Synod. The presidents of Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary were: * Joseph Stump 1920‚Äì1935 * Paul Roth 1935‚Äì1950 * Jonas Dressler 1950‚Äì1957 * Clemens Zeidler 1957‚Äì1976 * Lloyd Svendsbye 1976‚Äì1982 =Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary= Desiring to make witness to a shared mission in theological education, Luther and Northwestern seminaries were functionally unified in 1976, beginning with a single administration. After a period of six years, the two seminaries formally merged on July 1, 1982, as Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary. On January 1, 1988, Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary became affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which was formed by a merger of the LCA, the ALC, and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The seminary's name was simplified to Luther Seminary on July 1, 1994. Academics In the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year, Luther Seminary served 490 total students, employing 28 faculty. Luther offers a Master of Divinity degree (M.Div.) for students seeking ordination, as well as Master of Arts, Master of Theology, Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), and Doctor of Philosophy degrees for other students. In the fall of 2013, Luther Seminary suspended new admissions to the Ph.D program for at least three years as part of budget cuts. The seminary was planning to again offer the Ph.D program, with classing beginning in the fall semester of 2018. As in most seminaries, M.Div. students complete three years of theological education, divided into a junior year (first), middler year (second) and senior year (final). A full year of internship, usually in a parish, is an integral part of pastoral training, and a degree requirement for ELCA M.Div. students. While individual situations may vary, internship typically begins after two-thirds of coursework has been completed. Thus, most students complete internship between their middler and senior year. The internship requirement is unique to the ELCA among the other mainline denominations in the U.S. =Frederick Buechner= Luther Seminary has affiliations with the acclaimed American theologian and author, Frederick Buechner. In addition to being a key part of the curriculum, the works of Buechner have regularly been distributed by the Seminary among its students. In 2014, Luther Seminary also instituted the Frederick Buechner Prize for Excellence in Preaching. Notable faculty Marcus Olaus B√∏ckmann * Carl Braaten * Gerhard Forde * Richard A. Jensen * John N.

Professional wrestling career  Williams debuted in wrestling on August 18, 2000 in Hardcore Wrestling Federation in Ontario, Canada, and she wrestled in various independent promotions around Canada under the ring name Angel Williams. Her all-time favorite wrestler Shawn Michaels was her inspiration to get into wrestling. She was first a valet for various wrestlers such as Chris Sabin and Eric Young, and then began in-ring training under Rob Fuego. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004) = Williams briefly worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2004, mainly wrestling on TNA Xplosion against Trinity. = World Wrestling Entertainment (2004‚Äì2007) =  Deep South Wrestling (2004‚Äì2007)  Williams was working for promotions in the United States when World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) scouted her, and invited her to a tryout in June 2004. In November, she trained at WWE's then-developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), and WWE signed her to a contract in late 2004. She was assigned to wrestle and train in another WWE developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling (DSW). Williams began managing Johnny Parisi in the summer of 2005. On the September 8, 2005 episode of DSW TV, Williams made her in-ring debut by defeating Michelle McCool. On September 22, Williams was scheduled to wrestle against McCool, but MCcool never showed up. Instead Daisy Mae came out, challenged Williams and Williams defeated Mae in a singles match. At the February 9, 2006 episode of DSW TV, Williams participated in the first ever Bikini Contest in DSW. She did not reveal her bikini because Palmer Cannon interrupted, which led to a match, where Love managed Cannon against Tommy Dreamer. On February 28, she underwent knee surgery in Birmingham, Alabama to repair a torn ACL. After almost seven months of rehab, she stepped back into the ring at a DSW TV taping. At the beginning of November 2006, Williams started managing The Gymini, but The Gymini were released from their contracts in January 2007. Williams then began a feud with General Manager of DSW, Krissy Vaine, with Williams claiming that Vaine did something immoral to be appointed General Manager. Over the next couple of weeks, Vaine would cost Williams her matches by forcing other DSW Divas into interfering in Williams's matches. On the January 4 episode of DSW TV, Williams defeated the debuting Brooke Adams, with Vaine on commentary. On the January 11 episode of DSW TV', Williams competed against Shantelle Taylor in a losing effort. On the January 18 episode of DSW TV, Williams teamed up with Shantelle in a winning effort, defeating Luscious and Tracy Taylor in a tag-team match. On the February 8 episode of DSW TV, Williams defeated Krissy Vaine by disqualification after The Bag Lady attacked Williams. Immediately following the match, Vaine ordered the match to restart, resulting in Vaine pinning Williams. The following week, Williams got a measure of revenge by defeating The Bag Lady. On the April 5, 2007 episode of DSW TV, Williams accompanied Vaine to a match, where she defeated Nattie Neidhart after interference from Williams. Over the following weeks, Williams teamed up with Vaine against Neidhart and Shantelle Taylor, losing to them on several occasions. The storyline, however, came to an end when Deep South Wrestling shut down in April.  Ohio Valley Wrestling (2007)  After DSW shut down, Williams was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling. Williams made her OVW debut in a dark match at the May 16, 2007 television tapings in Louisville, Kentucky, defeating Serena. Two days later, Williams was released from her developmental contract. = Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2014) = After being released from WWE, Williams resurfaced in Mexican promotion AAA, under the name Canadian Angel on June 10, 2007. She also appeared for other independent promotions such as NWA: Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling and Full Throttle Wrestling. Love in July 2011 Love made her debut for Great Canadian Wrestling (GCW) on December 27, 2011 at the Season's Beatings event in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, where she teamed up with Shawn Spears in a losing effort to Seleziya Sparx and Brent Banks in a mixed- tag-team match. Love made her debut for Indian promotion Ring Ka King on March 18, 2012, where she defeated Alissa Flash. After the match, Love began a storyline in which she was being pursued by Romeo and Zoravar. On the April 4 episode of Ring Ka King, Love defeated Raisha and Alissa Flash in a triple- treat match. Following the match, Romeo came to the ring with a gift for Love, but Zoravar would out-do Romeo by giving Love jewelry and a car. On the April 14 episode of Ring Ka King, Love defeated Raisha in a singles match. Following the match, Zoravar confessed that he was in love with Love. On September 22, 2012, during her time with TNA, Love and Velvet Sky reunited as The Beautiful People at a Northeast Wrestling event, where they were defeated by Madison Rayne and Rosita. Love made her debut for Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) on October 4, 2012 at the Back 2 Brooklyn internet pay-per-view, where she teamed up with Velvet Sky to defeat the FWE Women's Champion Maria Kanellis and Katrina Lea a in a tag team match, with Love pinning Kanellis. Because of the win, Williams was named number one contender, and faced Kanellis for the FWE Women's Championship on February 16, 2013, but was unsuccessful in winning the championship after Mike Bennett helped Maria take advantage. On November 10, Love made her debut for Pro-Wrestling: EVE in Sudbury, Suffolk, England, defeating Carmel Jacob by disqualification, following interference from Sara- Marie Taylor. Love then teamed with Erin Angel in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Jacob and Taylor. On February 16, 2013, at FWE No Limits, Love was defeated by the FWE Women's Champion Maria Kanellis in a title match. Love returned to FWE at their Openweight Grand Prix on October 12, defeating Cheerleader Melissa and Serena Deeb in a three-way match, when she pinned Deeb. On February 22, 2013, Daffney announced that Love would be making her debut in the all-female promotion Shine Wrestling, at the event Shine 8. At Shine 8 on March 23, Love teamed up with Mia Yim, Amazing Kong and Christina Von Eerie in a losing effort to the team of Valkyrie (Allysin Kay, Ivelisse, Rain and Taylor Made). On April 19, at the Shine 9 event, Love competed in the Shine Championship qualifying tournament, losing to Rain. On May 24 at the Shine 10 event, Love was unsuccessful in winning the Shine Championship from the reigning champion Rain. Love returned on January 24 at the Shine 14 event, where she defeated Leah von Dutch. = Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2007; 2011) = In June 2007 Williams made several appearances for Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide as a member of La Legi√≥n Extranjera (Foreign Legion) under the ring name Canadian Angel. She returned to the promotion on June 18, 2011, at Tripleman√≠a XIX, where she teamed with Mickie James, Sexy Star and Velvet Sky to defeat Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, Mari Apache and Lolita in an eight- woman tag team match. = Return to TNA (2007‚Äì2009) =  The Beautiful People (2007‚Äì2009)  In September 2007, she was contacted again by TNA to appear at their annual pay-per-view Bound for Glory, which was confirmed on the October 9 episode of TNA Today where she was interviewed by Jeremy Borash. At Bound For Glory, Williams participated in a 10 wrestler Gauntlet to crown the first TNA Women's Champion. During the match, she was eliminated by Gail Kim and ODB, and the match was won in the end by Kim. At the Genesis pay-per- view, Williams unsuccessfully challenged for the Knockouts Championship in a fatal-four-way with Gail Kim retaining her title. Williams soon began competing under the ring name \\"Angelina Love\\" and formed a partnership with Velvet Sky, calling themselves \\"Velvet-Love Entertainment\\", later changed to \\"The Beautiful People\\". The duo defeated ODB and Roxxi Laveaux at Turning Point in a Tag Team match. During the following months, Love and Sky also aided Gail Kim in her rivalry with Awesome Kong. Love and Sky became villains on the March 13, 2008, episode of Impact by attacking Laveaux. Love also participated at Lockdown in the first ever \\"Queen of the Cage\\" match but was pinned by Laveaux. The Beautiful People (Love and Velvet Sky) with Cute Kip Adopting the personas of superficial prima donnas, who loathe and insult anyone they consider to be physically unattractive, they dropped the Velvet- Love Entertainment moniker and became The Beautiful People. In 2008 at Lockdown, they participated in the first ever \\"Queen of the Cage\\" match, which was won by Roxxi, when she defeated Love in the finals. The following month's pay-per-view, Sacrifice, saw a Battle Royal where the last two in the ring competed in a Ladder match with the loser having their head shaved; the week before on Impact! Gail Kim won immunity in a Shears-On-A-Pole-Match. The Makeover Battle Royal-Ladder Match saw Kim and Roxxi survive the Battle Royal and with Kim having immunity this meant the third runner-up, Angelina Love, would have her head shaved if Roxxi won. Knowing this, Love interfered in the Ladder Match to ensure Kim's victory and Roxxi's head being shaved bald. While the performers watched the haircut in pity, Love and Sky paraded around celebrating with Roxxi's freshly shaved hair cementing them as villains in one of TNA's most controversial moments. The Beautiful People continued to harass the fan favorites, including ruining Kim's chance at winning the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, injuring her, and unsuccessfully attempting to shave ODB's head after a match. This led to a Street Fight on June 5 between Sky and ODB, during which Mickie Knuckles (later renamed Moose) debuted as The Beautiful People's ally on Impact!. At Slammiversary the new trio lost in a six-woman tag team match against Roxxi, ODB and Kim when ODB pinned Moose. On July 18, Sky won a ten-wrestler Battle Royal to earn a shot at the Knockouts Championship. However, she failed to win the match, afterwards her and Love assaulted champion Taylor Wilde, putting a paper bag over her head. Their bad luck continued when The Beautiful People main evented the July 31 Impact! in a losing effort to Wilde and Kim. On the edition of August 14 of Impact!, Kip James was introduced as the team's \\"fashionist\\" under the name Cute Kip. As Sky had failed to win the title from Wilde, Love was given a chance at No Surrender. The following week on Impact!, The Beautiful People tried to intimidate Wilde before No Surrender, by attacking her backstage. Love and Wilde competed in a beauty pageant which Love lost after losing the evening gown and talent contest segments. Love also lost the title match at No Surrender. While Sky and Love had been focussing on Wilde and her title, Kip had begun a feud with Rhino. This feud ended in defeat for the Beautiful People, with them losing to ODB, Rhaka Khan and Rhino at Bound for Glory IV. Their feud with ODB spilled out into an alliance with Booker T who hired The Beautiful People to protect his wife, Sharmell, from ODB in exchange for his locker room on the December 4 episode of Impact!. This resulted in a six-woman tag team match at Final Resolution against ODB, Wilde and Roxxi, which they lost. Madison Rayne (left) joined in March 2009 to make the sorority Mi‚àá‚¶µ (Mi Pi Sexy) Also in December it was announced on TNA's website that the company had extended an invitation to United States Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin which The Beautiful People looked forward to as they considered her husband to be attractive. A Governor Palin parody character, often referred to simply as The Governor, appeared on December 4 played by Shannon Spruill. Love and Sky were oblivious to The Governor being an imposter, resulting in some comedy skits where Kip tried to convince them they were being fooled while others mocked their stupidity. The Governor, meanwhile, convinced the duo that they would have a makeover that would make them worthy of her cabinet; the makeover involved frumpy clothes, no make-up and unstyled hair. On January 15, Taylor Wilde and Roxxi revealed that it had all been a ruse to humiliate The Beautiful People who, in Wilde's opinion, were making a mockery of TNA's women's division. After this they had mud dropped on them from the ceiling. The following week, The Beautiful People brutally attacked Spruill backstage until Kip stopped them after a sufficient beating. On February 5, The Beautiful People exacted revenge on Roxxi and Wilde in a tag match and put paper bags over their heads; however, their revenge was cut short when The Governor made the save. Love in April 2009 Wilde's rivalry with The Beautiful People continued when Wilde teamed with the recently debuted Madison Rayne on February 26. Rayne turned on Wilde in the tag team match giving The Beautiful People the win. With Rayne's help, The Beautiful People won a Four Corners Tag Team match against Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed, Rhaka Khan and Sojourner Bolt, and Wilde and Roxxi. On the edition of March 12 of Impact!, Madison Rayne was formally revealed as an initiate to Mi Pi Sexy (Mi‚àá‚¶µ) (the newly formed sorority of the group). However, Rayne lost her initiation match to Taylor Wilde. Love and Sky continued to be referred to as \\"The Beautiful People\\", but when Rayne accompanied them, they were referred to as \\"Mi Pi Sexy\\". Some time later, the term \\"Mi Pi Sexy\\" became a nickname, thus being used occasionally on television. The Beautiful People began the hazing of Madison Rayne on March 19's Impact, which began with her helping them clip The Governor's hair after Rayne lost her match. Mi Pi Sexy would fight against Wilde, Roxxi, and The Governor at Destination X. Despite the numbers being even with the acquisition of Rayne, The Beautiful People failed to defeat their opponents. Monty Sopp, who played Cute Kip, was removed from television prior to Destination X to become a road agent, meaning his departure from the stable. This was explained on-screen by Sky, who stated that Kip was on probation before declaring he would be spoken about no more. Rayne's hazing continued after The Beautiful People won an Impact! tag team match against Kong and Saeed, after which Rayne tried to cut the braided hair of the Knockout Champion Kong. With Sky in her corner, Angelina Love faced Kong and perennial nemesis Taylor Wilde in a three-way cage match for the Knockout Championship at Lockdown. Love narrowly escaped a somersault leg drop from Kong, and as she was recovering Love pushed her towards the cage while Sky pulled her frayed hair through the holes in the cage and tied her to it. With Kong unable to move from the cage, Wilde dove onto Love with a cross body press and legitimately knocked her unconscious with her knee. As she recovered, Wilde attacked Kong, allowing Love to roll-up Wilde for the pin and win the Knockout Championship. The following week on Impact!, Mi Pi Sexy had a celebration with male dancers and named Madison Rayne an official member of the Beautiful People. However the celebration was cut short by Kong. Kong continued her attack on Mi Pi Sexy and proved her dominance by making her way through Rayne, Sky and Kip, who Love brought back to stop her, in stretcher matches on the following weeks of Impact!. Despite this, at Sacrifice Love retained her title against Kong. On May 28, Love defended her title again against Sojourner Bolt with all of her associates at ringside. After quickly defeating Bolt, Love questioned why Cute Kip was still appearing with them and officially fired him from the group. After this Love made a speech about the dominance of The Beautiful People and mocked the lack of competition in TNA. This led to the debut of Tara who laid out both Sky and Rayne and used her Widow's Peak finisher on Love, before accepting the challenge. At Slammiversary, Tara had her chance at the title but with the help of some hairspray from Sky and Rayne, Love retained the championship. Tara, whose name alludes to the tarantula spider, began taunting the group with tarantulas over the next few weeks on Impact!, which resulted in Sky voicing her frustration about Love leaving her alone with the tarantula and threatening to leave the group, if Love didn't back her up. Love and Sky evicting Rayne from The Beautiful People Consequently, when Tara defeated Sky and threatened to place a tarantula on her, Love agreed to put her Knockout Championship on the line immediately afterward, and without Rayne for support, Love lost the championship. The following week Love demanded, and gained a rematch but was laid out with the Widow's Peak from Tara. At Victory Road, Love almost lost her match when she was accidentally blinded with hairspray, but kicked out and later pinned Tara despite her foot being under the bottom rope, to win back the Knockout Championship. Later in the evening the referee was seen leaving Rayne's shower, with the implication she had seduced him to officiate the match in Love's favour. After all three failed to win a Battle Royal to become a member of Main Event Mafia, the group were seen mocking ODB and her associate Cody Deaner. A six-woman tag team match between all of Mi Pi Sexy against Tara, Kong and ODB turned into a three-on-one handicap match when Tara and Kong began to brawl between themselves. After a kiss from Deaner at ringside, Love was stunned and lost the match. It was later announced that at Hard Justice, the Knockout Championship would be on the line in a tag team contest between The Beautiful People against ODB and Deaner. After more mistimed hair spraying from Rayne, ODB won the title by virtue of Deaner pinning Sky. On the edition of August 20 of Impact!, Madison Rayne was kicked out of Mi Pi Sexy for costing Love the title, being assaulted and paper bagged by them. On September 3, 2009, Williams was released from TNA due to visa issues, while still a top draw in the women's division. However, on September 7, 2009, Williams posted a blog entry on her MySpace account stating that she would return to TNA Wrestling once the issues with her visa were sorted out. She continued appearing on Impact! for two more weeks due to the tapings being held before her release. In the episodes she and Velvet Sky advanced to the finals of the tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship with help from Madison Rayne, whom they afterwards welcomed to return to the Beautiful People. Rayne would go on to replace Love in the finals for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship. = Women Superstars Uncensored (2009‚Äì2010) = After her release from TNA, Williams began working for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU), where she performed under her TNA ring name of Angelina Love. On November 14, 2009, she unsuccessfully challenged Mercedes Martinez for the WSU Championship. On December 12 she teamed with Jennifer Cruz to defeat Jana and Rick Cataldo in a tag team match. After returning to TNA, Williams made one more appearance for WSU, defeating Sassy Stephie at the 3rd Anniversary Show on March 6, 2010. = Second return to TNA (2010‚Äì2012) =  Feud with The Beautiful People (2010)  TNA Knockouts Champion, wearing an anti-Beautiful People T-shirt On January 2, 2010, it was reported that Williams had re- signed with TNA. Williams, as Angelina Love, made her return on the January 14 episode of Impact!, appearing in the crowd and hugging Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne prior to their match with Awesome Kong and Hamada. However, after the match, Love turned face by attacking her former partners and Lacey Von Erich, her replacement in the group, seemingly angry about being replaced. She made her in-ring return the following week by defeating Rayne, however after the match she was triple teamed by the Beautiful People. On the February 4 episode of Impact! she was unsuccessful in her attempt to regain the Knockout Championship from Tara. On the March 8 episode of Impact! Love and Tara teamed up to challenge for the vacant Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by Rayne and Sky, after interference from Daffney, with whom Tara was involved in a feud. On the April 5 episode of Impact!, Love teamed with Tara, ODB, and Hamada to face the Beautiful People and Daffney in the first ever Lockbox elimination match, contested for four keys to four boxes containing prizes. Love won a key by eliminating Lacey Von Erich, and it was later revealed that her key opened the box, which contained the Knockout Championship, making her a three-time champion. After Love won the title, friction developed between her and Tara heading into their upcoming match against The Beautiful People, with Tara slowly turning villainous. At Lockdown, Love lost the Knockouts Championship to Madison Rayne, after she pinned Tara in a tag team steel cage match, where Love and Tara faced Rayne and Velvet Sky for both the Women's Knockout Championship and the Knockouts Tag Team Championship. After the match, Love was attacked by the evil Tara, who turned villainous in the process. At the April 20 tapings of Impact!, Williams partially tore her biceps and suffered ligament damage in her arm and was expected to be out of action until May. On May 26 it was announced that Williams had been cleared to return to wrestling. Love in July 2010 When Love returned from her injury on the June 17 episode of Impact!, she vowed to reclaim the Knockouts title and stated that she would go through each member of the Beautiful People to do it. That night she faced Von Erich and got disqualified after dropping her with a DDT on a steel chair. The following week her match with Velvet Sky ended in similar fashion. On July 11 at Victory Road, Love defeated Rayne via disqualification in a Title vs. Career match to win the Women's Knockout Championship for the fourth time. Prior to the match it was announced that the title would change hands via disqualification, if either Velvet Sky or Lacey Von Erich interfered in the match. However, the title was returned to Rayne on the July 22 episode of Impact!, when it was declared that there was no proof that the person who had interfered in the match was either Sky or Von Erich. The following week Love defeated Sarita to once again become the number one contender to Rayne's title.

On the August 19 episode of Impact!, Love reunited with Velvet Sky, who accompanied her to the ring, when she successfully defended her Women's Knockout Championship in a rematch against Rayne, who was with the mysterious biker woman. After the match Love and Sky were attacked by Rayne and the biker. Rayne's mysterious ally was finally unmasked as Tara on the September 2 episode of Impact!, when the two of them defeated Love and Sky in their first match together in a year. On the edition of September 16 of Impact! Love and Sky saved Lacey Von Erich, who was making a return from her injury, from a beating at the hands of Rayne and Tara and accepted her back into The Beautiful People. She, however, would leave the promotion two months later on November 11.

He was given a twelve- year prison sentence but released 14 May 2000.Journal of Palestine Studies, 116, Volume XXIX, no 4, Summer 2000 by Michele L. Kjorlien of the New York Times (15-17 May 2000), Washington Post (15 May 2000), Washington Jewish Week (18 May 2000). It was reported that Shehade was involved in the production of Qassam rockets, fired against Israeli civilian targets, and other homemade weapons, as well as smuggling military equipment into Gaza.\\"Salah Shehade\\" profile, Jewish Virtual Library; accessed 21 November 2014. He led the Izz ad- Din al-Qassam Brigades military wing of Hamas during a period which saw a campaign of suicide attacks against Israeli civilian targets which caused the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians. As a leader of the Hamas military wing he oversaw Hamas field commanders in Gaza and the West Bank and defined the policy of terror attacks by Hamas. Killing On 22 July 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces targeted the house in which Shehade was hiding using a one-ton bomb dropped by an F-16 plane in a neighborhood of Gaza City. Appeal to the Spanish Supreme Court, Javier Fern√°ndez Estrada, 21 September 2009. Fifteen people were killed, including Shehade, his wife and daughter, and seven members of the Matar family who lived in the next house. Seven children were among the dead. Between 50 and 150 were injured as a result of the attack.Yuval Yoaz, \\"State commission to examine civilian deaths in 2002 Shehade assassination\\", Haaretz, 19 September 2007 Both Shehade's and Matar's houses were destroyed by the bomb, as were eight others in the vicinity; nine houses were partially destroyed, and 20 other houses moderately damaged. 27 reserve pilots, including Iftach Spector, signed a pilots' letter refusing to fly assassination sorties over Gaza and the West Bank in protest of the operation.\\"Israeli pilots' stand of conscience\\", smh.com.au; 25 September 2003; accessed 21 November 2014. Reaction The attack received widespread condemnation from other Middle Eastern nations, Western Europe, and the United States. Ariel Sharon initially praised it as \\"one of our greatest successes\\", but later told Yediot Ahronot that \\"[H]ad I known the outcome, I would have postponed the assassination.\\"Sharon comments re Shehade assassination and aftermath , slate.com (archive via webcache.googleusercontent.com); accessed 21 November 2014.

The Gush Shalom movement also threatened to turn the pilot over to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.The high and the mighty Ha'aretz, 21 August 2002. Israeli Air Force Chief Dan Halutz, who was abroad during the bombing itself but was still accountable as IAF commander, gave an interview to Haaretz, published on 21 August 2002. To his pilots he said: :[To pilots] Guys, ... you can sleep well at night. I also sleep well by the way. You aren't the ones who choose the targets, and you were not the ones who chose the target in this particular case. You are not responsible for the contents of the target. Your execution was perfect. Superb. And I repeat again: There is no problem here that concerns you. You did exactly what you were instructed to do. You did not deviate from that by so much as a millimeter to the right or to the left. And anyone who has a problem with that is invited to see me. When asked whether the operation was morally wrong because of the toll on some civilians, Halutz answered that the planning included moral consideration and that a mistake or an accident did not make it such. When the reporter asked about the feelings of a pilot when he drops a bomb, Halutz answered: :No. That is not a legitimate question and it is not asked. But if you nevertheless want to know what I feel when I release a bomb, I will tell you: I feel a light bump to the plane as a result of the bomb's release. A second later it's gone, and that's all. That is what I feel. In the same interview Halutz denounced the left-wing groups who attacked the pilots and called to have them tried for \\"treason\\": :Is this the public for which the Israel Defense Forces is fighting day in and day out? All those bleeding hearts who have the gall to use Mafioso methods of blackmail against fighters ‚Äì I don't recall that they ever threatened to turn over one of the arch-terrorists, the terrorists who have killed many Israeli civilians, to The Hague. What I have to say about those people is that this is a democracy, where everyone can always express his opinion. But not to be a traitor. [Interviewer] Are you suggesting that members of the Gush Shalom (\\"Peace Bloc\\") group who made those comments should be placed on trial for treason? :[Halutz] We have to find the right clause in the law and place them on trial in Israel. Yes. You wanted to talk to me about morality, and I say that a state that does not protect itself is acting immorally. A state that does not back up its fighters will not survive. Happily, the State of Israel does back up its fighters. This vocal but negligible minority brings to mind dark times in the history of the Jewish people, when a minority among us went and informed on another part of the nation. That must not happen again. Who would have believed that pilots of the air force would find their cars spray- painted with savage graffiti because of a mission they carried out? Following the assassination, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet established a joint inquiry into the incident and submitted their findings to Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer on 2 August 2002. The inquiry concluded that the procedures and operational assessments followed in the operation were \\"correct and professional\\", and that the operation resulted in the elimination of a \\"major terrorist leader\\". However, the inquiry found shortcomings in the intelligence available and the analysis of intelligence concerning the presence of civilians near Shehade. The inquiry found that if the intelligence had indicated with certainty the presence of civilians in Shehade's vicinity, the timing or method of the action would have been changed, \\"as was done a number of times in the past.\\"Findings of the inquiry into the death of Salah Shehada Israeli Foreign Ministry (2 August 2002) In December 2005, a class- action lawsuit was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, naming former Shin Bet director Avraham Dichter, the military chief in charge of the operation, as the sole defendant. Referring in particular to the Shehade killing, the lawsuit alleges that Dichter \\"developed, implemented and escalated the practice of targeted killings\\", Citing the killing of more than 300 Palestinian leaders and casualties among hundreds of bystanders, the suit claims that assassination is illegal under international law.\\"USA blames former Israeli security chief for bomb deaths in Gaza City\\" , Pravda, 9 December 2005 In 2007, the Israeli State Prosecutor's Office announced that an independent commission of inquiry into the death of the 14 innocent Palestinian civilians would be held following a petition by Yesh Gvul. Headed by Zvi Inbar, this commission began in February 2008. Its findings were officially released to the public in February 2011, and found \\"intelligence gathering failure\\" and \\"no premeditated intention to kill civilians,\\" reporting that commanders did not know there were innocent people in the building at the time, and that they would have called it off had they known.The Jerusalem Post, Spanish court to decide on Gaza trial; accessed 28 December 2017. In January 2009, the National Audience, a special and exceptional high court in Spain, began a war crimes probe into the attack that killed Shehade, with persons investigated including Mofaz, Dichter, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Moshe Ya'alon, Doron Almog, Giora Eiland and Mike Herzog.Israeli officials forming united front against Spanish lawsuit YNet A lower court decision ordered an inquiry into the Shehadeh killing. The Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court's decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF's targeted killing of Shehadeh in 2002. Israeli MK Moshe Ya'alon (Chief of Staff at the time of the bombing) cancelled a trip to the United Kingdom on 5 October 2009, because he feared an arrest on war crimes charges relating to the 2002 killing.Israel minister feared UK arrest, bbc.co.uk; accessed 21 November 2014.

As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing is that it involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing, the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections in order to reduce forces.Degarmo, p. 432.Kalpakjian, pp. 415‚Äì419. Drawing differs from rolling in that the pressure of drawing is not transmitted through the turning action of the mill but instead depends on force applied locally near the area of compression. This means the amount of possible drawing force is limited by the tensile strength of the material, a fact that is particularly evident when drawing thin wires. The starting point of cold drawing is hot-rolled stock of a suitable size. Processes = Metal =  Sheet metal  The success of forming is in relation to two things, the flow and stretch of material. As a die forms a shape from a flat sheet of metal, there is a need for the material to move into the shape of the die. The flow of material is controlled through pressure applied to the blank and lubrication applied to the die or the blank. If the form moves too easily, wrinkles will occur in the part. To correct this, more pressure or less lubrication is applied to the blank to limit the flow of material and cause the material to stretch or set thin. If too much pressure is applied, the part will become too thin and break. Drawing metal requires finding the correct balance between wrinkles and breaking to achieve a successful part. = Deep drawing and shallow drawing = Sheet metal drawing becomes deep drawing when the workpiece is drawing longer than its diameter. It is common that the workpiece is also processed using other forming processes, such as piercing, ironing, necking, rolling, and beading. In shallow drawing, the depth of drawing is less than the smallest dimension of the hole.  Bar, tube, and wire  Bar, tube, and wire drawing all work upon the same principle: the starting stock drawn through a die to reduce the diameter and increase the length. Usually the die is mounted on a draw bench. The end of the workpiece is reduced or pointed to get the end through the die. The end is then placed in grips and the rest of the workpiece is pulled through the die. Steels, copper alloys, and aluminium alloys are common materials that are drawn.Degarmo, p. 434. Drawing can also be used to cold-form a shaped cross- section. Cold drawn cross-sections are more precise and have a better surface finish than hot extruded parts. Inexpensive materials can be used instead of expensive alloys for strength requirements, due to work hardening.Degarmo, pp. 433‚Äì434. = Bar drawing = Bars or rods that are drawn cannot be coiled therefore straight-pull draw benches are used. Chain drives are used to draw workpieces up to . Hydraulic cylinders are used for shorter length workpieces. The reduction in area is usually restricted to between 20 and 50%, because greater reductions would exceed the tensile strength of the material, depending on its ductility. To achieve a certain size or shape multiple passes through progressively smaller dies or intermediate anneals may be required.Degarmo, p. 433. = Tube drawing = Tube drawing is very similar to bar drawing, except the beginning stock is a tube. It is used to decrease the diameter, improve surface finish and improve dimensional accuracy. A mandrel may or may not be used depending on the specific process used. A floating plug may also be inserted into the inside diameter of the tube to control the wall thickness. = Wire drawing = This technique has long been used to produce flexible metal wire by drawing the material through a series of dies of decreasing size. These dies are manufactured from a number of materials, the most common being tungsten carbide and diamond. = The cold drawing process for steel bars and wire = #tube lubrication: The surface of the bar or tube is coated with a drawing lubricant such as phosphate or oil to aid cold drawing. #Push Pointing: Several inches of the lead ends of the bar or tube are reduced in size by swagging or extruding so that it can pass freely through the drawing die. Note: This is done because the die opening is always smaller than the original bar or coil section size. #Cold Drawing, Process Drawing: In this process, the material being drawn is at room temperature (i.e. Cold-Drawn). The pointed/reduced end of the bar or coil, which is smaller than the die opening, is passed through the die where it enters a gripping device of the drawing machine. The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the cross section of the original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product. #Finished Product: The drawn product, which is referred to as Cold Drawn or Cold Finished, exhibits a bright and/or polished finish, increased mechanical properties, improved machining characteristics and precise and uniform dimensional tolerances. #Multi-Pass Drawing: The cold drawing of complex shapes/profiles may require that each bar/coil be drawn several times in order to produce the desired shape and tolerances. This process is called multi-pass drawing and involves drawing through smaller and smaller die openings. Material is generally annealed between each drawing pass to remove cold work and to increase ductility. #Annealing: This is a thermal treatment generally used to soften the material being drawn, to modify the microstructure, the mechanical properties and the machining characteristics of the steel and/or to remove internal stresses in the product. Depending on the desired characteristics of the finished product, annealing may be used before, during (between passes) or after the cold drawing operation, depending on material requirements. =Glass= Similar drawing processes are applied in glassblowing and in making glass and plastic optical fiber. = Plastics = Plastic drawing, sometimes referred to as cold drawing, is the same process as used on metal bars, but applied to plastics.Degarmo, p. 461. Plastic drawing is primarily used in manufacturing plastic fibers. The process was discovered by Julian W. Hill (1904‚Äì1996) in 1930 while trying to make fibers from an early polyester. It is performed after the material has been \\"spun\\" into filaments; by extruding the polymer melt through pores of a spinneret. During this process, the individual polymer chains tend to somewhat align because of viscous flow. These filaments still have an amorphous structure, so they are drawn to align the fibers further, thus increasing crystallinity, tensile strength, and stiffness. This is done on a draw twister machine.. For nylon, the fiber is stretched to four times its spun length. The crystals formed during drawing are held together by hydrogen bonds between the amide hydrogens of one chain and the carbonyl oxygens of another chain. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet is drawn in two dimensions to make BoPET (biaxially- oriented polyethylene terephthalate) with improved mechanical properties.

Meanings and originsFrom Middle English a topographic name for someone who lived in a lane. Used to denote any narrow pathway, including one between houses in a town. A Norman or Breton origin has also been proposed for some people bearing this surname, derived from L'Asne, itself perhaps coming from a nickname such as le Asinus (the Ass) or from a toponym in Normandy or Brittany. A prominent Lane family documented in Staffordshire claim to have Norman ancestry, and list the earliest ancestor as \\"Adam de Lone\\" living in 1315. Lane families enjoyed prominence in other counties such as Kent, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire, and Northamptonshire where Sir Ralph Lane is theorized to have originated. A Knighted Sir Richard Lane is found in Northamptonshire in the early 1600s. Tax lists of Buckinghamshire in 1400s list \\"John atte Lane\\" and \\"William atte Lane\\" with the Saxon term \\"atte\\" being the same as the French term \\"de la\\", showing topographic reference. Lane families took part in the Plantations of Ireland as it is theorized Sir George Lane was part of the same family as Sir Ralph Lane. In 1663, a Matthys Laenen Van Pelt emigrated from Amsterdam to New Jersey. The family appears to have shortened the name to Lane after arriving. Early Virginia County Tax lists of the late 1700s show Lane families with the spellings of \\"Lane\\", \\"Lain\\", and \\"Layne\\" but with no indication of importance for the different spellings, other than possible separation of unrelated Lane families. By the middle 1800s though, \\"Lane\\" was commonly adopted.

The town has a total population of 25,000 and is expected to become a major commercial centre in concert with the development of the port city of Gwadar. Gwadar is located nearly to the east. They also are working with the port city of Chabahar in Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province which is about to the west of Jiwani. Overview Jiwani is located between Gwadar and Chabahar at the eastern end of the Gwadar Bay. The area around the bay includes an important mangrove forest extending across the international border, and is an important habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, especially the endangered olive ridley and green turtles. Plans to grant fishing concessions and offshore drilling rights are potentially a threat to the wildlife of the area. The population largely depends upon fishing. There are a number of export oriented fish freezing plants located in Jiwani. Jiwani is from the Iranian border. Jiwani holds strategic importance in the region, located immediately adjacent to the shipping lanes to and from the Persian Gulf. This is the main reason that the town hosts a small naval base and an airport with a runway. Jiwani was used during World War II as an allied airfield and the remains of some airfields are still available. Another story linked to Jiwani is that Queen Victoria planned to visit the area to watch the \\"sunset\\" and a hut was built for her, which is now known as the \\"Victoria Hut\\". Whether Queen Victoria visited or not, the Victoria Hut is still maintained by the Pakistan Coast Guards up to the present day. Visiting the accommodation area of the airfield base used during World War II in Jiwani reveals many handwritten small stories and names of allied pilots. There is a water system which is now abandoned for use but is a marvel of civil works for meeting water requirements of the station. It used to store rain water in three stages in order to clean the water using its usual flow. The water was then pumped to the airfield, and also up to the Victoria Hut, which is nearly from the water tank system. The Makran Coastal Highway now reaches Jiwani from Gwadar and also connects to Karachi. Jiwani Military Base According to media reports, Pakistan and China plan to build a military base in Jiwani.A New China Military Base in Pakistan?

Santa Elena, originally called Sumpa, is located on the Ecuadorian peninsula near the city of Guayaquil. It is regarded as the location of the most important and best documented archaeological site in the country, predominantly due to the discovery of the Lovers of Sumpa. History of the Site In 1977 Olaf Holm, the Director of the Anthropology Museum of the Central Bank of Ecuador, asked Karen E. Stothert to excavate this pre-ceramic site. Stothert and her team found evidence of Las Vegas, the first Ecuadorian culture. Las Vegas flourished from 8800-4600 BC along the Ecuadorian coast. Archaeologists found numerous artifacts and remains of homes and a garbage dump, but the biggest discovery was a cemetery of about 200 people. Among these remains were the bodies of the Lovers of Sumpa, or Los Amantes de Sumpa. They were found buried, and apparently embracing each other. There is much speculation as to why they died, including being stoned to death, but for most of the world it doesn't matter how they died so much as that they died and were buried together. Significance of the Site The discovery of the cemetery, and the Lovers of Sumpa particularly, brought a significant amount of media attention to Ecuador, which in turn helped emphasize the importance of archaeological research to the understanding of heritage and culture. The Lovers of Sumpa have even been called the Romeo and Juliet of Ecuador, and for this reason have served as a great source of information for sculptors, poets, and musicians all over the world. In general this kind of attention has been beneficial for Ecuador, drawing tourists and doubling the Santa Elena population in 20 years. During these same 20 years there was some controversy and drama about what would happen to the site and the remains. Increased oil prices prevented the country from supplying enough funds to the project to do anything beneficial other than provide guards to protect the important cultural site. Despite the lack of funds for so long, eventually the team was able to secure the site in a way that is safe for the artifacts as well as being beneficial to the cultural knowledge of the people. This effect is, arguably, the most significant consequence of the discovery of this site. Modernization of Ecuador has drawn the rural people away from their lands and their traditions, but this discovery, which prompted an amazing museum as well as cultural and heritage additions to the curriculum of Santa Elena students, ensures the survival of the rich culture of this once thriving people. The Las Vegas people's customs are being preserved. The Site Today The Santa Elena archaeological site is considered a main attraction of the Ecuadorian coast. Because Ecuador has no moral issues preventing the public display of remains, there are three burials on display, protected by glass, and teachers and archaeologists, such as Stothert, use them in teaching as discussion and learning tools. In 1997 when the country was able to provide the proper funds, the Museo Amantes de Sumpa y Centro Cultural was opened to the public. The opening of this museum showed great cooperation between private and public institutions and is home to a variety of Las Vegas artifacts and remains. The site itself is a center for heritage resources and education, which promote the culture of Native coastal Ecuadorians.

They are used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri,Controlled Vocabularies Links to examples of thesauri and classification schemes.Controlled Vocabularies Links to examples of thesauri and classification schemes used in the domain of Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry etc. taxonomies and other knowledge organization systems. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction.  In library and information science  In library and information science, controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of words and phrases, which are used to tag units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search.Amy Warner, A taxonomy primer // dead link.Karl Fast, Fred Leise and Mike Steckel, Controlled vocabularies solve the problems of homographs, synonyms and polysemes by a bijection between concepts and authorized terms. In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency. For example, in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (a subject heading system that uses a controlled vocabulary), authorized terms‚Äîsubject headings in this case‚Äîhave to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same word (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (cockroach versus Periplaneta americana), and choices between synonyms (automobile versus car), among other difficult issues. Choices of authorized terms are based on the principles of user warrant (what terms users are likely to use), literary warrant (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), and structural warrant (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary). Controlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of homographs with qualifiers. For example, the term pool has to be qualified to refer to either swimming pool or the game pool to ensure that each authorized term or heading refers to only one concept. = Types used in libraries = There are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences. Historically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialized covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more pre-coordination of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorized subject heading. (e.g., children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorized and non-authorized terms, while historically most subject headings did not. For example, the Library of Congress Subject Heading itself did not have much syndetic structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term \\"Broader term\\" and \\"Narrow term\\". The terms are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the Library of Congress system, MeSH, and Sears. Well known thesauri include the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the ERIC Thesaurus. Choosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the specificity of the term chosen, whether to use direct entry, inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue. Controlled vocabulary elements (terms/phrases) employed as tags, to aid in the content identification process of documents, or other information system entities (e.g. DBMS, Web Services) qualifies as metadata.  Indexing languages  There are three main types of indexing languages. * Controlled indexing language ‚Äì only approved terms can be used by the indexer to describe the document * Natural language indexing language ‚Äì any term from the document in question can be used to describe the document * Free indexing language ‚Äì any term (not only from the document) can be used to describe the document When indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example, using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document. In recent years free text search as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is indexed). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors. = Advantages = Controlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of free text searching, such as to reduce irrelevant items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items (false positives) are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. Take the English word football for example. Football is the name given to a number of different team sports. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is association football, which also happens to be called soccer in several countries. The word football is also applied to rugby football (rugby union and rugby league), American football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, and Canadian football. A search for football therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by tagging the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated. Compared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually relevant to the search topic). In some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorized term is searched, there is no need to search for other terms that might be synonyms of that term. = Problems = A controlled vocabulary search may lead to unsatisfactory recall, in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question. This is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with that of the indexer. Another possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example, an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with \\"football\\" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless. On the other hand, free text searches have high exhaustivity (every word is searched) so although it has much lower precision, it has potential for high recall as long as the searcher overcome the problem of synonyms by entering every combination. Controlled vocabularies may become outdated rapidly in fast developing fields of knowledge, unless the authorized terms are updated regularly. Even in an ideal scenario, a controlled vocabulary is often less specific than the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while this precise problem is not a factor in a free text, as it uses the author's own words. The use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry. Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision. Numerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including faceted classification, which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways. Applications Controlled vocabularies, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, are an essential component of bibliography, the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in library and information science. In the 1950s, government agencies began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on dialup X.25 networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first full text databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library. = Technical communication = In large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve technical communication. The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing. This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in technical writing and knowledge management, where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a document or organization instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing. = Semantic web and structured data = Web searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a Semantic Web, in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable metadata scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the Dublin Core Initiative. An example of a controlled vocabulary which is usable for indexing web pages is PSH. It is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web.Cory Doctorow, Metacrap. To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on faceted classification principles.Mark Pilgrim, eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language. Controlled vocabularies of the Semantic Web define the concepts and relationships (terms) used to describe a field of interest or area of concern. For instance, to declare a person in a machine-readable format, a vocabulary is needed that has the formal definition of \\"Person\\", such as the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary, which has a Person class that defines typical properties of a person including, but not limited to, name, honorific prefix, affiliation, email address, and homepage, or the Person vocabulary of Schema.org. Similarly, a book can be described using the Book vocabulary of Schema.org and general publication terms from the Dublin Core vocabulary, an event with the Event vocabulary of Schema.org, and so on. To use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary, web designers can choose from a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, HTML5 Microdata, or JSON-LD in the markup, or RDF serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in external files.

It is the second of a two-part story, following the broadcast of \\"The Empty Child\\" on 21 May. The episode is set in London in 1941. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), the con man Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), and the homeless woman Nancy (Florence Hoath) investigate a spaceship which crashed the same time patients at a nearby hospital began turning into living dead beings with gas masks for faces. The episode saw Jack join the Doctor as a companion. Together with \\"The Empty Child\\", it won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. Plot The Ninth Doctor, Rose, and Jack are cornered in a London hospital during the Blitz by patients wearing gas masks fused to their faces asking for their \\"mummy\\". The Doctor pretends to be the ‚Äúmummy‚Äù and orders them to go back to their room, and the patients shuffle off. Jamie, the index case of the \\"epidemic\\", also responds to this, leaving his sister Nancy alone. The Doctor, Rose, and Jack investigate the hospital room Jamie was treated at, and learn from recordings that the child is growing stronger with its powers and may become unstoppable. Jamie arrives shortly thereafter, having returned to \\"his room\\", along with other patients. Jack teleports himself, the Doctor and Rose to Jack's spaceship. The Doctor uses the ship's Chula nanogenes to heal his wounds while learning more about Jack's past. Nancy returns to the site where the cylinder crashed near the hospital on the night Jamie had gained his powers, only to be captured by soldiers. The Doctor, Rose, and Jack return to the site, and discover the guards‚Äô faces transforming into gas mask- wearing people, as the contagion becomes airborne. Examining the cylinder, the remains of a Chula medical ship, the Doctor deduces what has happened: as with Jack's ship, the Chula medical ship carried nanogenes. They had scanned the first human they encountered, Jamie, who died that night, and presumed it was a template for all humans, transforming them into the gas mask-wearing people. Meanwhile, the transformed humans approach the cylinder. The Doctor realises that Jamie is the template controlling all these humans, searching for his \\"mummy\\", and that Nancy is not Jamie's sister but his mother. The Doctor convinces Nancy to tell Jamie she is Jamie's mother. Nancy accepts Jamie into her arms; the nanogenes gather around the two, determine that Nancy is Jamie's parent and that her DNA is the proper template for humans. The Doctor directs the nanogenes to undo their previous transformations, returning everyone to normal, including restoring Jamie to life. The bomb prop, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition A German bomb approaches the site. Jack returns to his ship and uses it to tether the bomb and steer it away from Earth. The Doctor orders everyone to flee the area, setting the Chula medical ship to self- destruct to destroy the technical parts without changing the timeline. Jack is unable to stop the bomb or escape from it, but the Doctor comes to rescue Jack, who joins the Doctor and Rose in the TARDIS. At the end of the episode, the Doctor and Rose dance to 'In the Mood' by Glenn Miller. Production In the DVD commentary for this episode, writer Steven Moffat reveals that up until a very late stage, the nanogenes in this story were called \\"nanites\\". However, script editor Helen Raynor decided this name sounded too much like similar nanotechnological devices in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Moffat had first used the line \\"Life is just nature's way of keeping meat fresh\\" in the second series of his 1990s sitcom Joking Apart.

While compact magnetic tape recorders were developed in Germany in the 1930s, the technology did not make its way to the rest of the world until after World War II. Wire recording was used by the BBC during this period, but recording gramophones, using wax discs as a medium, were more common. Steven Moffat acknowledges this mistake in the DVD commentary for \\"The Doctor Dances\\", but jokingly suggests that an ancestor of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart stole the machine from Germany to help with the war effort. Broadcast and reception \\"The Doctor Dances\\" received overnight ratings of 6.17 million viewers, a 35.9% audience share; this was the lowest figure yet for the series, but it was during a bank holiday weekend and was the most-watched programme on Saturday. It received a final rating of 6.86 million viewers. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 85. SFX stated that the two-part story had \\"everything\\", particularly praising Moffat's script. They highlighted the ending of \\"The Doctor Dances\\" as \\"funny, surprising, heartwarming and life- affirming without slipping into syrupy schmaltz\\". Dek Hogan of Digital Spy disliked Barrowman as Captain Jack, but named the two-part story as the best episodes of the series. Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave \\"The Doctor Dances\\" a grade of A, writing that it \\"may be the production and plotting high point of the first series to date\\". He said that the episode \\"manages to smoothly present a ton of technobabble with clarity and precision\\" and praised the dialogue and the \\"exhilarating\\" climax. The scene where the child surprises the Doctor, Rose, and Jack in Room 802 was voted television's \\"Golden Moment of 2005\\" by viewers, as part of the BBC's 2005 TV Moments programme. In a poll conducted by Doctor Who Magazine in 2009, the two-part story was ranked the fifth best episode of Doctor Who. The Daily Telegraph named the story the fourth best of the show in 2008. In 2011 before the second half of the sixth series, The Huffington Post labelled \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" as one of the five essential episodes for new viewers to watch. \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form).

The word is derived from the Russian word for \\"close,\\" \\"near,\\" meaning \\"sitting close to the Tsar.\\" The duties of first known okolnichies included arranging the travel and quarters of grand princes and tsars, as well as accommodating foreign ambassadors and presenting them to the court. Initially their number was very small, but it grew over time and they acquired more duties. An okolnichy could head a state office (prikaz) or a regiment, could be an ambassador or a member of the state duma. Initially the rank of okolnichy was the second highest after that of boyar, while often they performed similar duties. According to the system of mestnichestvo, a person could not be made boyar, unless someone else in his family had recently held a boyar/okolnichy rank. Consequently, a position of okolnichy was a step towards granting the boyar rank to a non-noble. Even Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, though a Rurikid knyaz by birth and the \\"Saviour of the Motherland\\" by royal mercy, could not secure a position higher than okolnichy, because neither his parents nor uncles had ever held a rank higher than stolnik. Under the Romanovs, the 18 noblest families of Muscovy were given the privilege of starting their official career from the rank of okolnichy, skipping all the lower ranks, such as stolnik. At the same period, the positions of okolnichy were differentiated and some of them (quarters okolnichy or close okolnichy) were of higher rank than that of non-close boyars. The terms derive from a semi-formal ranking based on the proximity to the tsar at the tsar's table.

After the last episode aired, the show went into reruns until September 22, 1996. The first season was hosted by J. D. Roth, and the second season was hosted by Mario Lopez. Broadcast and production history A few years before Masters of the Maze first aired, Australian Fenton Rosewarne created a puzzle called \\"Fenton's Maze,\\" which Janet Weeks said \\"combined elements of Trivial Pursuit and Rubik's Cube.\\" Hal Berger, designer of the Power Glove, through his company IMAGE design and entertainment turned Fenton's Maze into an electronic game, licensed the product to Tiger Electronics, and then sold the game show concept to the Family Channel. The show, a two time Emmy-nominated (1995 and 1996) game show for kids, was taped in a 65-by-85 foot studio at CBS Studio Center. The second season consisted of 40 shows, taped five per day. According to co-executive producer Richard Kline, the concept of the show is \\"to allow viewers at home to get inside the video game.\\" The opening sequence was created by CBS Digital. N. F. Mendoza, in an article in the Los Angeles Times printed the day before the show's premiere, referred to defusing a multi-level time bomb, and at one point in the article, referenced the show with the title TimeBomb. =Audition process= For the second season, there were 500 prospective contestants vying for 120 contestant spots. The auditions included a 25-question test, a narrative, as well as inhibition-testing events like a tug-of-war, a story-completion exercise, and a blindfolded trip through an obstacle course of folding chairs. Gameplay =Round 1 (both versions)= Three two-member teams competed. Each team chose one member to play the question and answer format of the game, while the other went offstage. At this point, the host showed distorted pictures to the players, each of which became more clear as time progressed. The first player to buzz in and identify the picture won ten points and a chance to answer a question about the picture for five additional points. The first two teams to reach 50 points won the right to enter the maze, with the first team doing so earning the right to decide who went into the maze first. After one team reached 50 points, the other teams played out the rest of the round, but without bonus questions. In the speed round, if a player buzzed in and was incorrect or unable to identify the picture, the host read a clue to the opponent without further revealing the picture.The Family Channel. Masters of the Maze. Starring J. D. Roth. Featuring Frankie and Ernie, Marc and Robert, and Fallon and Mary. 1994. At the start of the speed round, Roth says \\"I'm also going to give you a clue if ... your opponent gets a picture wrong\\"; later, Roth says \\"I can't show you any more of the picture\\" after the player buzzing in answers incorrectly. Before being allowed to enter the maze, the runner was briefed on the maze's layout by the \\"Lady of the Maze\\". In the Roth season this was simply the face of an older woman (played by Renae Jacobs); in the Lopez season, the likeness of a younger redhead woman appeared with a high-pitched voice (played by Clea Montville). The \\"Lady of the Maze\\" also appeared again when the runner had reached the halfway point. In the earliest episodes, the players were given 10 seconds for each picture, which grew clearer as time passed, and the first person to buzz-in and identify the picture won one point for each second left on the clock, and an opportunity to answer the question about the picture to double the points. When one player earned 50 points or more, and thus the right to enter the maze, the other players played more pictures without the clock, at 10 points per picture, until another player reached 50 points. =Maze= Roth version The maze had three sections: the Mirror Maze, the Honeycomb Maze, and the Chamber of Knowledge. The person that answered the questions in the first part of the game was also the one responsible for running through the maze, with their team partner guiding them through the maze by moving a giant joystick. This device controlled a computerized voice telling the contestant which direction to go, and triggered rumble devices on the outfit the runner wore as an additional directional aid. The joystick also had a button that controlled the runner's laser which was used in various parts of the game. The first section was called the Mirror Maze. In this section, the contestant navigated a series of mirrors. Once the runner reached the end of the Mirror Maze, the \\"Mirror Man\\" blocked the path, not moving unless the runner correctly answered a question posed by Roth. A correct answer meant that the runner passed, while an incorrect answer or pass meant that the runner was asked another question. A contestant missing three questions had to wait five more seconds before being allowed to proceed. Once the runner had passed the Mirror Maze, the runner had to find two of several Power Sticks that were hidden in the mountains between the Mirror Maze and the Honeycomb Maze. (Occasionally there was a Power Stick hidden in the Mirror Maze itself.) Once the runner found two, they entered the Honeycomb Maze. In this section, the runner had to lower their visor and rely on the partner to guide them through the network of doors and walls. Once through the Honeycomb Maze, the runner raised the visor and entered a small briefing room. Here, the Lady of the Maze reappeared to give the runner instructions on what to do inside the Chamber of Knowledge, which the runner entered using one of the two Power Sticks. Inside the Chamber of Knowledge, the runner was asked three different true or false questions by three of the six different guardians. A correct answer caused one of the three gates blocking the way out to open. If the runner answered incorrectly, the same guardian asked another true or false question. If the runner missed this question, one more true or false question was asked. If the runner missed all three, the gate automatically opened after five seconds. Once all three gates were open, the runner exited the chamber (and the maze itself) by inserting his/her remaining power stick into a holder at the finish line to stop the clock. The first team set the time that their opponents had to beat. The second team then entered the maze, and had the amount of time established by the first team to make their way through. If the second team ran out of time, an alarm went off, the game ended immediately, and the first team won. If the second team made it out before time ran out, they won the game. The winners of this version also won prizes and the right to play a bonus round. =Chamber of Knowledge Guardians (Season 1)=The Guardian of the Gate of History (asked questions about American history; represented by an old Native American woman's head) *The Guardian of the Gate of Fantasy (asked questions about story books, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes; represented by a dinosaur's head) *The Guardian of the Gate of the Animal Kingdom (asked questions about animals; represented by a lion's head) *The Guardian of the Gate of the Unexpected (asked questions about pop culture; represented to look like an elf or somewhat of a Star Trek character) *The Guardian of the Gate of Nature (asked questions concerning all forms of nature excluding animals; represented by a face that looked to be modeled after wind) *The Guardian of the Gate of Innovation (asked questions about science; voice usually sounded like a man, but sometimes a woman; represented by a head in a compass) =Prize Mountain= The quickest team in this version of the show won the right to play a special bonus round, which featured a mountain with five television monitors that constantly altered between a \\"Prize\\" screen and a \\"No Prize\\" screen. The runner faced the first TV on the mountain and shouted for the partner to fire the laser. If the team stopped at least three of the five monitors on \\"Prize\\" (before the team stopped at three monitors on \\"No Prize\\", which ended the game immediately), they won a $500 shopping spree at The Sharper Image in Beverly Hills. Lopez version The opening game remained the same, but with extra changes. One was that contestants now shot the picture using their laser podium before taking a guess; another was that there was now a special bonus picture at one point in the game in which five bonus points were added to the initial value, making it worth 15 points. The maze was extended and featured new obstacles. Its four sections were the Mirror Maze, the Ice Cave, the Chamber of Knowledge, and Lightning Mountain (which consisted of the same set as the first season's Prize Mountain). The Mirror Maze remained unchanged. However, the run to find the power stick was removed from this part of the game, and the Mirror Man's question was posed by the Mirror Man himself and his face was larger than last season's. If a contestant gave a wrong answer or ran out of time to answer, another question was read. A runner failing to answer that question correctly had to wait at least three seconds before proceeding. Once the runner arrived at the entrance to the Ice Cave, the Lady of The Maze showed the runner a distorted picture on a monitor (as in the first round). A runner identifying it within five seconds took the shorter path through the cave, but otherwise had to take the longer path. In either case, the runner was required to lower the visor before entering the Ice Cave. While navigating the cave, the runner had to find a Power Stick; in addition, the contestant also had to avoid kicking two groups of sensors and Mirror Man placards that were placed on the cave floor. If the runner touched one of these objects, several large icicles descended from the cave ceiling, blocking the runner's path. Upon finding the Power Stick and getting through the Ice Cave, the player lifted their visor and enter the Chamber of Knowledge. There were now only four guardians in this portion of the maze, and only one correct answer was required to exit. If the answer was incorrect, the runner had to answer another true or false question, and if the player missed that one, a five-second penalty was assessed before the gates unlocked. The runner now faced a single television monitor at the base of Lightning Mountain with faces of the Mirror Man flying on it. The runner had to blast two of these images with his laser before being allowed to run up the mountain and stop the clock. As in the Roth era, the first team set the time, the second team had to beat it, and the second team was not allowed to finish their maze run if their time exceeded the first team's time. The bonus round was removed. The team that won the game automatically won the $500 shopping spree for the runner and the prizes for the navigator. =Chamber of Knowledge Guardians (Season 2)=The Guardian of the Gate of Education (gave school-related questions) *The Guardian of the Gate of Imagination (asked questions about pop culture and other miscellaneous facts) *The Guardian of the Gate of the Natural World (gave questions about nature; represented by a lion's head with a unicorn's horn) *The Guardian of the Gate of Science and Discovery (gave questions about science and technology; represented by a robot's head) Similarities between both seasons With both the JD Roth and Mario Lopez seasons, the winning team received a trophy made from one of the power sticks. In addition, the winning runner was said to go on a \\"special journey\\" in which they appeared to be disintegrated into a ball of randomly spinning particles which floated away into either the large video wall or an inter-dimensional tunnel. Producer and game show veteran Mark Maxwell-Smith provided the voices of all the Chamber of Knowledge guardians in both seasons, as well as the Mirror Man in the Lopez era.

Biography Coat of arms of Sir Benjamin Brodie Brodie was born in Winterslow, Wiltshire. He received his early education from his father, the Rev Peter Bellinger Brodie; then choosing medicine as his profession he went to London in 1801 and attended the lectures of John Abernethy and attended Charterhouse School. Two years later he became a pupil of Sir Everard Home at St George's Hospital, and in 1808 was appointed assistant surgeon at that institution, on the staff of which he served for over thirty years. In 1810 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, to which in the next four or five years he contributed several papers describing original investigations in physiology. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. At this period he also rapidly obtained a large and lucrative practice and from time to time wrote on surgical questions, contributing numerous papers to the Medical and Chirurgical Society and to the medical journals. His most important work is widely acknowledged to be the 1818 treatise Pathological and Surgical Observations on the Diseases of the Joints, in which he attempts to trace the beginnings of disease in the different tissues that form a joint and to give an exact value to the symptom of pain as evidence of organic disease. This volume led to the adoption by surgeons of more conservative measures in the treatment of diseases of the joints, with consequent reduction in the number of amputations and the saving of many limbs and lives. He also wrote on diseases of the urinary organs and on local nervous affections of a surgical character. In 1854 he published anonymously a volume of Psychological Inquiries‚Äîeight years later, the expanded, revised and updated 1862 volume appeared under his name. He received many honours during his career and attended to the health of the Royal Family, starting with George IV. He was also sergeant-surgeon to William IV and Queen Victoria and was made a baronet in 1834. He became a corresponding member of the French Institute in 1844, Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and DCL of Oxford in 1855, president of the Royal Society in 1858 and subsequently, the first president of the General Medical Council.

Biography Merrill was born in Turner, Maine. He was the second youngest child of Abel Merrill, Jr. and his wife Abigail. Early in life, he was a committed Whig and churchgoing Protestant, a strong supporter of prohibition and an equally vigorous opponent of the expansion of slavery. After deciding to become a teacher, he moved to the South, but found himself unpopular due to his strong abolitionist views. He returned to New England, tried farming, and then entered the mercantile business. In 1854 he was elected on the abolitionist ticket to the Legislature of New Hampshire. In 1856 he decided to leave New England and moved to McGregor, Iowa. He first engaged in the mercantile business (wholesale and retail dry goods) in McGregor. In 1861 he sold his business and organized the McGregor branch of the State Bank. from \\"The People of Iowa\\" volume 2, 1931, page 11 Before long, he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives. In the summer of 1862, Merrill was commissioned Colonel of the 21st Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving in that regiment until seriously wounded in the hip at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on the Big Black River in May 1863. This was part of the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863, where Union forces captured 1,700 retreating Confederate troops. The battle would mean the Confederate troops were bottled up at Vicksburg, Miss., which was strategically vital. General Ulysses S. Grant, who led that campaign, referred to Merrill's intrepidity as \\"eminently brilliant and daring\\" and that had Merrill not been a general officer at the time, he would have recommended him for the Medal of Honor. Merrill rejoined his regiment in January 1864, but the lingering effects of his hip wound forced him to terminate his military service the following June. Merrill returned home to McGregor, Iowa, to recover. He returned to banking in McGregor, and was chosen President of the First National Bank. from \\"The Governors of Iowa\\" Jacob Swisher, 1946, page 25 In 1867 he was elected Governor of Iowa on the Republican ticket. The North Iowa Times newspaper reported, \\"The people of McGregor were much pleased over the election of Merrill and showed their goodwill by serenading him at his home.\\" \\"The History of Clayton County\\" edited by Realto E. Price, 1916, page 204 Merrill served as Governor for two terms, from 1868 to 1872. Merrill's impressive record as a demonstrably civic-minded legislator and patriotic army officer gave him significant political capital in postwar Iowa. In 1867 the state's Republican Party nominated him for governor ahead of the outspoken radical Congressman Josiah B. Grinnell (who had not fought for the Union). Merrill easily won the general election on a platform that pledged support for congressional Reconstruction, local economic development, and the enfranchisement of Iowa's small population of African Americans. He proved to be a capable governor during his two terms in office (1868‚Äì1872). He labored hard to boost the state's material prosperity by fostering railroad construction and immigration. He lobbied to protect navigation between the Mississippi and the Great Lakes. He supported the public institutions, such as schools, but also sought to improve business methods to reduce the possibilities of corruption and to promote more efficient delivery of services. He also acknowledged the growth of anti-monopoly concerns among farmer by publicly opposing discriminatory freight rates and passenger fares. In regards to the state penitentiary, he prohibited the practice of flogging and urged that a Sunday school should be located in the same building. Under the administration of Gov. Merrill, the movement for the erection of the new (now current) State House was inaugurated. In his 1872 farewell address, Governor Merrill said, \\"While discharging my duty, to be diligent in aiding the development of our State, to labor for the success of our schools and charities...it has been my privilege to realize the intelligence, justice and humanity of our people‚Ä¶[A]s I pass from the one station to the other, permit me to unite with you in dedicating ourselves, our commonwealth, and our country anew to freedom.\\" In 1897 he was injured in a streetcar accident in Los Angeles and never recovered. He died at age 77 and was buried in Des Moines after an imposing funeral ceremony attended by most members of Iowa's political establishment. He was buried with his third wife Elizabeth in a marble tomb in Woodland Cemetery, Des Moines, Iowa. After extensive renovations, a rededication of Governor Merrill's mausoleum is scheduled for Sunday, June 5, 2016. Samuel Merrill was first married to Catherine Thomas, who died in 1847, fourteen months after their marriage. In January, 1851, he was united in marriage with a Miss Hill, of Buxton, Maine.

She then worked as an administrative aide, first for Mike McKevitt (R-CO) and then for Joseph J. Maraziti (R-NJ). From 1974 to 1978, she worked as director of administration and coordinator of field services for the Republican National Committee. Her husband sustained a permanently disabling head wound during the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, which occurred on March 30, 1981. James Brady remained as Press Secretary for the remainder of Reagan's administration, primarily in a titular role. Alongside her husband, Sarah Brady became \\"one of the nation's leading crusaders for gun control\\". They later became active in the lobbying organization Handgun Control, Inc. that would eventually be renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She was chairwoman of the Brady Campaign from 2000 until her death in 2015. In 1994, she and her husband received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

Book In 2002, Sarah Brady published her autobiography, A Good Fight. According to Library Journal, it is more about her personal battles and her determination and courage than about gun control. In April 2002, Court TV announced a planned television movie adaptation of the book, to be produced in conjunction with Hearst Entertainment. At the book's launch, Bill Clinton praised her for having \\"given the gift of life to countless thousands and thousands of Americans\\". The book gives an \\"intimate\\" look at her public and personal life, including a \\"detailed, suspenseful account\\" of the efforts to pass the Brady Bill, according to Publishers Weekly, which suggested that \\"fans of [Katharine] Graham's Personal History may enjoy this story of a determined woman in a male-dominated Washington.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"spirited,\\" portraying Brady as a \\"scrapper\\" who never gives up, despite her husband's injury, her son's medical problems, and her own battle with smoking and lung cancer.

She is currently signed to WWE and performs as color commentator on the NXT brand. As a wrestler, she is a former WWE Divas Champion, a three-time WWE Women's Champion. Kocia≈Ñski had a successful amateur wrestling career in high school, winning several tournaments before being trained for professional wrestling by the All Knighters. After her debut in May 2001, she wrestled for numerous independent promotions. She also appeared at the inaugural Shimmer Women Athletes shows. In 2004, she began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) and signed a developmental contract with WWE in October 2005. She debuted on WWE's Raw brand in May 2006 but suffered a legitimate broken jaw the following month. As a result, she had numerous surgeries and returned to OVW for further training. While there, she won the OVW Women's Championship twice, although her second reign is not officially recognized by OVW. She returned to the Raw brand in July 2007, and was heavily pushed, dominating the other WWE Divas and gaining the nickname, \\"The Glamazon\\". She won her first WWE Women's Championship at the No Mercy pay-per-view in October, and held it for six months. She then developed an on-screen relationship with Santino Marella, dubbed \\"Glamarella\\", and won the Women's Championship for a second time in August 2008, holding it until January 2009. In January 2010, at the Royal Rumble, she became the second woman in the history of the event to enter the men's Royal Rumble match, and went on to win the Women's Championship for the third time in April, holding it for a month. In October 2011, Phoenix won the WWE Divas Championship for the first time and lost it in April 2012. Phoenix retired and left WWE in October 2012 due to creative frustrations with the treatment of women in WWE, and to focus on her family life with boyfriend and later husband Adam Copeland, famous in WWE as Edge, with whom she subsequently had two daughters. In 2017, Phoenix returned to WWE upon being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the 2017 class, also becoming a part-time color commentator for the company; her induction made her the quickest female to be inducted after her retirement and the youngest inductee in history at age 36. In 2019, she also became the first woman to be inducted in the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, a hall of fame dedicated to professional wrestlers with an amateur background. Phoenix has occasionally wrestled since her return, notably at WrestleMania 35; she also took part in the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match in 2018, making her the first wrestler to have participated in both the men's and women's matches. In May 2019, she was promoted to a full-time color commentator on NXT. Early life Elizabeth Kocia≈Ñski was born in Elmira, New York and raised by Polish parents. When she was eleven years old, she won a coloring contest with a prize of tickets to a television taping for the World Wrestling Federation. Kocia≈Ñski credits this as when she fell in love with professional wrestling. She cites Bret Hart, Sgt. Slaughter, Owen Hart, and Ted DiBiase as her favorite wrestlers. Kocia≈Ñski attended Notre Dame High School in Elmira, where she played tennis and ran track. She was voted prom queen in her senior year. Kocia≈Ñski is a graduate from Canisius College in Buffalo, New York with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and Public Relations. While wrestling in OVW, Kocia≈Ñski also worked as a waitress at a local restaurant known to Elmira natives as Lights Bakery and Coffee Shop. Amateur wrestling career Elizabeth Kocia≈Ñski began wrestling on the Notre Dame High School scholastic wrestling team. She was the first female varsity wrestler in the school's history. She became the North-East freestyle women's champion in 1999, and also won at the New York State Fair Tournament the same year. At the time, she was also a member of USA Wrestling, a freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling association. Her life goal was, according to her, to become a professional wrestler, and she believed that having a solid amateur background would help her reach it. Professional wrestling career =Training and independent circuit (2001‚Äì2005)= After graduating from high school in 1998, she enrolled in both a professional wrestling school and Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. Her first choice for wrestling school was Stu Hart's Dungeon, but because of the location, she decided on a more local school. At the school, she was trained by the All Knighters (Joey Knight and Robin Knightwing), who themselves had trained in the Hart Dungeon. She later stated that Nora Greenwald, who was known in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Molly Holly, had paid for her to attend wrestling school after Carolan had given her a demo tape of her work. Her professional wrestling debut match was against Alexis Laree. She then worked for various independent promotions, including Cleveland All Pro Wrestling and Apocalypse Wrestling, against both male and female wrestlers, using the name \\"Phoenix\\". In 2002, she was one of the first wrestlers in GLORY, an independent organization for women, and was the inaugural GLORY Champion. She then joined Far North Wrestling (FNW), and was the only female wrestler in the promotion. She defeated Joey Knight and Kevin Grace in 2003 to become the FNW Cruiserweight Champion. Later in 2003 she took part in World Xtreme Wrestling's annual Women's Elite 8 tournament where she made it to the final, before losing to April Hunter. She returned two years later and defeated Nikki Roxx, but was bested in the second round by eventual winner Alicia. The following month, Phoenix appeared at the inaugural taping for the Ring of Honor sister promotion Shimmer Women Athletes; during Volume 1 she was pinned by Shimmer founder Allison Danger but scored an upset victory in a non-title match against NWA Midwest Women's Champion MsChif. =World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE= Ohio Valley Wrestling (2004‚Äì2006) Phoenix during an OVW show in July 2005 Kocia≈Ñski was invited to a tryout with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2004, and then relocated to Louisville, Kentucky to work for their then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). She debuted on OVW television in July 2004, having changed her ring name to \\"Beth Phoenix\\", and became the on-screen girlfriend and valet of Chris Masters. The storyline was short-lived, and the following month Phoenix was repackaged as the manager of Aaron \\"The Idol\\" Stevens. She signed a developmental contract with WWE on October 20, 2005, the same month that she broke her hand. The duo was then joined by Shelly Martinez, who Phoenix soon feuded within early 2006. Trish Stratus' ally (2006) Phoenix debuted on WWE's main roster on the May 8, 2006, episode of Raw as a face by attacking Mickie James while James was assaulting Trish Stratus. After this incident, James berated Phoenix for \\"ruining everything\\" and questioned why she showed up in the first place. A week later, Phoenix was formally introduced by Stratus and then attacked a distracted James on Stratus's behalf. When James finally escaped, Phoenix claimed that James had \\"ruined her life\\", and would not let her get away with it, before calling her a \\"psycho\\". On the following episode of Raw, Phoenix attacked James after her match with Torrie Wilson. Then, on the May 29 episode of Raw, Phoenix and Wilson, with Stratus in their corner, teamed together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria, who had James in their corner. During the June 5 episode of Raw, Phoenix suffered a legitimately fractured mandible during a match with Victoria, but was able to continue the match, and emerged victorious despite the injury. Phoenix's jaw was entirely severed and subsequent surgeries left a portion of her face permanently numb. She spent a year having surgeries and recovering, including getting a titanium plate and nine screws placed in her jaw, but she was only out of action for two months, as she returned to action in OVW instead of on the main roster. Return to Ohio Valley Wrestling (2006-2007) After sustaining her injury on the main roster, Phoenix returned to action in OVW on August 16, 2006, defeating Serena. Phoenix began regularly competing for the OVW Women's Championship, unsuccessfully challenging the champion ODB in a battle royal and a four-way match, which was won by Serena. At the October 4 OVW television tapings, however, Phoenix defeated Serena to win the championship. She lost the championship to Victoria Crawford in a gauntlet match on October 20, and won it back the next day; however, Crawford's title reign is not officially recognized, and as a result, neither is Phoenix's second reign. Phoenix officially dropped the championship in a gauntlet match at the November 1 television taping, after she was eliminated by Katie Lea, who eventually won the match. On the November 6 episode of OVW, Phoenix came out with her championship and claimed to still be the women's champion. As a result, a ladder match was set up, where the winner would become the undisputed OVW Women's Champion. Lea won the match and was presented with the title belt on the first show of 2007. Throughout 2007, Phoenix continued to wrestle in numerous women's matches in OVW. Phoenix made her last appearance in OVW at their August 15 television tapings where she lost to Lea in a number one contenders match. The Glamazon (2007‚Äì2008) Women's Championship at No Mercy in October 2007 On the July 9, 2007, episode of Raw, Phoenix returned as a villain, when Melina claimed to be injured. Phoenix replaced Melina in a tag team match as Jillian Hall's partner, and the two lost to Candice Michelle and Mickie James. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Phoenix won the Interpromotional Divas battle royal to become the number one contender for Michelle's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix was then pushed as a dominating Diva, dubbing herself \\"The Glamazon\\" and attacking James, Hall, and Michelle on the September 10 episode of Raw. At Unforgiven, however, she failed to capture the Women's Championship from Michelle. Their storyline rivalry continued when Phoenix pinned Michelle during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy in October, Phoenix defeated Michelle to win her first WWE Women's Championship. She retained the title on the October 22 episode of Raw in a two out of three falls match, in which Candice Michelle was injured by Phoenix shaking the rope, causing her to fall off the top turnbuckle and legitimately break her clavicle. During a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, Phoenix's team lost after Melina was pinned by Mickie James. On the November 26 episode of Raw, James defeated Melina in a number one contenders match for Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, a match in which Phoenix successfully defended her Women's title. On New Year's Eve 2007, Phoenix successfully defended her title in a Triple Threat match against Melina and James, after pinning Melina. Phoenix, along with then-ally Melina, took part in the Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV, where she defeated the team of Ashley and Maria. On April 14, 2008 Phoenix faced Mickie James with her Women's Championship on the line and lost, ending her reign as champion. Phoenix received a rematch on the May 5 episode of Raw in a lumberjill match, but lost after Melina unintentionally hit her in the face with her boot. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Melina and Phoenix partnered to face Maria and James. During the match, Melina unintentionally knocked Phoenix off of the ring apron, resulting in Phoenix abandoning Melina, which allowed James and Maria to pick up the win. Later that night, Melina and Phoenix brawled in a backstage segment, ending their alliance. At Judgment Day, Phoenix failed to regain the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match after James pinned Melina to retain the title. At One Night Stand, Phoenix defeated Melina in the first women's \\"I Quit\\" match in WWE history. The next night on Raw, Phoenix teamed with Katie Lea Burchill to defeat Melina and James in a tag team match. She was pinned by James one week later in a non-title match, and was once again attacked by Melina post-match. Glamarella (2008‚Äì2009) Phoenix (right) and Santino Marella in November 2008 as the Women's and Intercontinental champions, respectively After a month absence from television, Phoenix returned on the July 14 episode of Raw, where she defeated Santino Marella after he issued an open challenge to any WWE wrestler backstage. The storyline continued the following week after Marella lost to the returning D-Lo Brown. Phoenix confronted Marella after the match, and they briefly grappled with each other before unexpectedly sharing a kiss, to which both expressed considerable confusion. The two then became an on- screen power couple, and the pairing of Phoenix and Marella later became known by the portmanteau Glamarella. Within the team, she acted as the \\"straight- woman\\" of sorts, berating Marella or reacting in disbelief to his over-the- top, embarrassing antics. At SummerSlam, they defeated Kofi Kingston and Mickie James in an intergender tag team match. Phoenix pinned James, winning the Women's Championship, while Marella won Kingston's Intercontinental Championship. She successfully defended the Women's Championship against Candice Michelle at No Mercy. At Survivor Series in November, Phoenix was team captain of the victorious Raw Diva team which defeated the SmackDown Divas in a five-on-five elimination match; she eliminated Maryse and became the sole survivor of the team. On December 8, 2008, Phoenix received the \\"Slammy Award\\" for Diva of the Year. Phoenix then began feuding with Melina, who had returned from injury in November. This storyline included the debut of Rosa Mendes, who was introduced as Phoenix's \\"superfan\\". At the Royal Rumble in January 2009, Phoenix lost the Women's Championship to Melina. At WrestleMania XXV, Phoenix competed in the 25-Diva \\"Miss WrestleMania\\" battle royal; despite scoring 12 eliminations, more than any other participant, she lost when Marella, who competed in drag, claiming to be his twin sister \\"Santina\\", last eliminated her. After WrestleMania, Glamarella separated, as Phoenix was unhappy with Santino pretending to be \\"Santina\\". Phoenix had a brief scripted rivalry with both \\"Santina\\" and Marella, and challenged \\"Santina\\" for the \\"Miss WrestleMania\\" title at Backlash, but was unsuccessful. Feud with LayCool (2009‚Äì2011) After a brief hiatus, Phoenix returned on the July 27 episode of Raw, teaming with Alicia Fox and Rosa Mendes in a losing effort to Mickie James, Gail Kim, and Kelly Kelly. Phoenix had her first opportunity for the WWE Divas Championship, being narrowly defeated by the defending champion, Mickie James, on the August 31 episode of Raw, after winning a number one contender's battle royal that same night. On the October 12 episode of Raw, it was announced that Phoenix had been traded to the SmackDown brand. Phoenix made her in-ring debut for the brand on the October 30 episode of SmackDown, defeating Jenny Brooks, an \\"enhancement talent\\". In January 2010, at the Royal Rumble, she entered the Royal Rumble match and eliminated The Great Khali, before she was eliminated by CM Punk. With her entry, she became the second woman in history to enter the Royal Rumble match, the first being Chyna. After being told by Vickie Guerrero, the SmackDown consultant, that she would not be receiving a Women's Championship opportunity, Phoenix turned face after she saved Tiffany from an attack by Guerrero and LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla) on the March 12 episode of SmackDown. She then went on to defeat McCool and Layla in a tag team match involving Tiffany. The feud with McCool continued at WrestleMania XXVI, where they were on opposing teams in a 10-Diva tag team match, which Phoenix's team lost, although they won a rematch the following night on Raw. On the April 23 episode of Smackdown, Phoenix teamed with Mickie James to face McCool and Layla. After the match, LayCool beat down Phoenix and smeared make-up on her face and body while she was unconscious. This resulted in Phoenix receiving a match for the Women's Championship against McCool at Extreme Rules, where she defeated McCool in an \\"Extreme Makeover\\" match to win her third Women's Championship. On the May 6 episode of Superstars, Phoenix tore her ACL in a match against Rosa Mendes, and as a result, one week later on SmackDown, McCool invoked her rematch clause to face Phoenix in a two-on-one handicap match along with Layla, where Layla pinned Phoenix to become the new Women's Champion. Phoenix returned from her injury at November's Survivor Series pay-per-view, and attacked the former co- Champions Michelle McCool and Layla, after they lost the WWE Divas Championship to Natalya. Phoenix and Natalya then formed an alliance, and at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in December, Phoenix and Natalya defeated LayCool in the first Divas Tag Team Tables match in WWE history. Divas Champion and departure (2011‚Äì2012) Eve during a WWE house show in November 2011 As part of the 2011 Supplemental Draft on April 26, 2011, Phoenix returned to the Raw brand. On the August 1 episode of Raw, Phoenix won a battle royal to become the number one contender to the WWE Divas Championship, and afterward attacked champion Kelly Kelly to provoke a feud and turning heel in the process. Phoenix later declared that she was tired of the \\"perky bimbos\\" that comprised the rest of the Divas division, and was on a mission to make a mockery of the other Divas, and was joined by Natalya to form The Divas of Doom. Phoenix went on to unsuccessfully challenge Kelly for the championship at SummerSlam. Throughout September, The Divas of Doom feuded with Kelly and Eve Torres on Raw and The Chickbusters (AJ and Kaitlyn) on SmackDown. Phoenix challenged Kelly for the Divas Championship again at Night of Champions, but was unsuccessful. At Hell in a Cell in October, Phoenix defeated Kelly to win the Divas Championship for the first time, with help from Natalya. In a rematch on the October 14 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix successfully retained the championship. At Vengeance, Phoenix successfully defended the championship against Eve Torres, with both Natalya and Kelly banned from ringside. Phoenix successfully retained her championship against Torres again at Survivor Series on November 20 in a Lumberjill match, and against Kelly at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 18. Phoenix and Eve Torres at WrestleMania 28 in April 2012 Further successful defenses followed against Torres on the January 30, 2012, episode of Raw and Tamina Snuka at Elimination Chamber on February 19. After this, Phoenix competed only sporadically for a few months, including a tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII, where she and Eve Torres were defeated by Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos. On the April 6 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix lost to Nikki Bella in a non-title match, following Kelly's interference. On the April 23 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost her Divas Championship to Nikki Bella in a Lumberjill match, after suffering a storyline ankle injury. At Extreme Rules, Phoenix was scheduled to face Nikki in a rematch for the Divas Championship, however she was not medically cleared to compete and was replaced by the returning Layla, who ended up winning the title. Phoenix made two unsuccessful attempts at regaining the Divas Championship from Layla at Over the Limit in May and at No Way Out in June, respectively. Phoenix lost 19 times against Divas champion Layla in various live events. In September, Kaitlyn was attacked by an unknown assailant before her championship match at Night of Champions. Upon her return, she announced her assailant had blonde hair, and Assistant SmackDown General Manager Eve Torres accused Phoenix before attacking her. On the September 28 episode of SmackDown, after defeating Natalya, Phoenix was suspended by Torres, but the suspension was later reversed by SmackDown General manager Booker T. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost to Torres. Phoenix turned heel again on the October 18 episode of Superstars, when she berated Kaitlyn for thinking that Phoenix attacked her and demanded respect from Kaitlyn, before losing to her in a singles match. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Phoenix was defeated by AJ Lee in a singles match, but the match was restarted by Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero, allowing Phoenix to win. After the match, in the storyline, Guerrero fired Phoenix for her poor performance. In reality, Phoenix had given her notice to WWE in September and had decided to leave the company; although she originally claimed that she had left to focus on her family, in September 2019, she revealed that she had been \\"really frustrated with where the women were at from a company standpoint, and the investment that was being made in us. I felt in my heart I had done my best, and I'd try hard to change things but, at some point, I just got frustrated.\\" = Return to WWE =  Hall of Fame and part‚Äìtime commentator (2017‚Äì2019)  On February 27, 2017, WWE announced that Phoenix would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the 2017 class. Her induction made her the quickest female to be inducted after her retirement, as she had retired only five years prior, and made her and her husband Edge the first real-life couple to both be inducted. In 2018, Phoenix became a part-time color commentator for WWE, mainly for women-related events, starting from January 16 to April 3, 2018 for the first season of the WWE Mixed Match Challenge, commenting the tournament each week alongside Michael Cole and Corey Graves. On January 28, 2018 at the Royal Rumble event, she made a one-night wrestling return as a face for the first time since 2012 by entering the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match as a competitor, making her the first person to appear in both a men's and women's Royal Rumble. She entered at number 24 and lasted over two minutes before being eliminated by Natalya. Phoenix went on to continue to work as a guest commentator at various events and mainly women's matches such as the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal at WrestleMania 34, the 2018 Mae Young Classic, the women's Royal Rumble match at the 2019 Royal Rumble event, and the Elimination Chamber match to determine the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Champions at the 2019 Elimination Chamber event. The Divas of Doom in May 2019 On March 10, 2019, at the Fastlane pay-per-view, Phoenix acted as commentator on the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match between defending champions The Boss 'n' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks) and Nia Jax and Tamina. After their defeat, Jax and Tamina attacked Bayley and Banks; Phoenix came to their aid, soon joined by Natalya, but the four were still overpowered by Jax and Tamina. The following day on Raw, Phoenix accompanied Natalya to her match against Jax, eventually causing a disqualification by attacking Jax. On the March 18, 2019 episode of Raw, Phoenix announced that she was coming out of retirement; she and Natalya reformed their 2011‚Äì2012 tag team The Divas of Doom, and challenged The Boss 'n' Hug Connection for a WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania 35; however, Tamina ambushed Phoenix after a distraction from Jax during a one-on-one match between Natalya and Banks. On the April 1 episode of Raw, Phoenix wrestled her first match in nearly seven years, where she teamed with Natalya, Bayley and Banks, to face off against Jax, Tamina, and The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), where Phoenix's team emerged victorious after she pinned Royce following a Glam Slam. At WrestleMania, Phoenix and Natalya lost to The IIconics during a fatal four-way tag team match for the Women's Tag Team Championship, when, after Phoenix performed a Glam Slam from the second rope on defending champion Bayley without realizing that The IIconics' Billie Kay had tagged Phoenix out, was thrown outside the ring by Kay's partner Peyton Royce, who allowed Kay to successfully pin Bayley.  Full-time NXT commentator (2019‚Äìpresent)  On May 15, 2019, Phoenix joined the commentary team of NXT alongside Mauro Ranallo and Nigel McGuinness, replacing Percy Watson; this marked her first time as full-time commentator, and her first time commenting matches that did not involve women. Her first NXT TakeOver as announcer was NXT TakeOver: XXV on June 1, 2019. She was a member of the commenting team when NXT started airing live on September 18, 2019, and was extended from a 50-minutes runtime to 120 minutes. Phoenix returned to the ring for the first time since the previous year's WrestleMania during the Women's Royal Rumble match at the 2020 Royal Rumble event, entering at number 19 and lasting over 23 minutes before being eliminated by Shayna Baszler, finishing in third place. She suffered a head injury early in the match when Bianca Belair slapped her chest and caused the back of Phoenix's neck to hit one of the ring posts around the ring, but was able to finish the match. On the March 2 episode of Raw, Phoenix would make an appearance, to provide a medical update on her husband Edge, who was kayfabe injured by Randy Orton. However, Orton would interrupt and explain his actions, which caused Phoenix to slap and kick Orton, who retaliated by hitting her with an RKO. Other media Phoenix, along with Candice Michelle and Layla El, appeared in the February 2009 issue of FLEX Magazine. Phoenix has appeared in 8 WWE video games. She made her in-game debut in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 and appears in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011, WWE 12, WWE 13, WWE 2K18 (DLC), WWE 2K19 and WWE 2K20.

The company, which is one of the largest hotel chains in the world, owns several hotel brands ranging from upscale to economy. As of June 30, 2020, Choice Hotels franchised 7,118 properties in 41 countries and territories worldwide, with approximately 597,018 rooms, in addition to 1,035 hotels under construction with 85,129 rooms. History =Founding and early years= Quality Courts United, Inc., which began as a nonprofit referral chain of seven motels in Florida, was founded in 1939. It would undergo several name changes before becoming what is known today as Choice Hotels International. The chain initially remained east of the Mississippi River. By the early 1960s, Quality Courts United had approximately 600 members. All of its hotels needed to meet certain quality standards and offer amenities like air conditioning, telephones, swimming pools, paved driveways, and wall-to-wall carpeting. In 1963, the organization became a for- profit corporation and changed its name to Quality Courts Motels, Inc. In 1957, Stewart W. Bainum Sr., who ran a Washington, D.C., plumbing business, opened his first hotel in Silver Spring, Maryland. He later franchised his first Quality Courts motel in 1963. In 1968, Bainum merged his business, Park Consolidated Motels, Inc., with Quality Courts Motels, assumed the role of president and CEO, and moved the company's headquarters from Daytona Beach to Silver Spring, Maryland. Lodging Magazine wrote that, by 1969, Quality Courts Motels was the world's \\"largest association of independent motel operators\\". =Growth and expansion= The Clarion Hotel in Hamden, Connecticut in 2007 A Comfort Suites in Laredo, Texas in 2008 The company changed its name to Quality Inns International in 1972 and, in 1990, the parent company became known as Choice Hotels International. In the 1980s, the company started the industry's first market segmentation strategy, using a range of hotel brands across price points. Geographically, it expanded across the country by opening hotels in the west. The Comfort brand, which would later become Choice Hotels' flagship brand, was established in 1981. The brand was marketed to family vacationers, business travelers, and senior citizens to compete with Days Inn, Best Western, and Friendship Inn. The company's Quality Inn hotels remained in the midscale segment, competing with Holiday Inn, Ramada, Howard Johnson, and Travelodge. The now-discontinued Quality Royale brand was positioned as Choice Hotels' upscale brand, designed to compete with Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, and Sheraton. In the 1980s, Choice bought Friendship Inn, Rodeway Inn, and Econo Lodge. In 1989, the company introduced McSleep, an economy brand utilizing a consistent, interior-corridor design prototype designed by Rob Spurr that was all new construction. The name was soon changed to Sleep Inn following litigation from McDonald's. Bainum's other business, Manor Care, Inc., which owned and managed nursing homes, bought Choice Hotels in 1990. The company later spun off its hotels business in 1996. Bainum Sr. led Choice Hotels International until 1987, when his son, Stewart W. Bainum Jr., took over the role of chairman and chief executive. As of 2018, Bainum Jr. remains chairman of Choice Hotels. Choice Hotels International became publicly traded in 1996. That same year, it announced the establishment of the MainStay Suites brand, a midscale extended-stay hotel. In the mid-2000s, Choice Hotels expanded into the upscale hotel market. The company announced in 2005 the creation of its Cambria Hotels & Suites brand, later renamed Cambria Hotels, the company's first new brand since MainStay Suites's creation in 1996. The Cambria brand was created as an upscale hotel chain marketed to business travelers. , the Cambria brand had expanded to about 100 hotels open or in the pipeline, including hotels in Philadelphia, Dallas, New Orleans, South Windsor, Connecticut and Savannah, Georgia. In 2008, Choice Hotels was the first industry chain to establish a \\"soft brand\\", Ascend Hotel Collection. The Ascend Hotel Collection includes upscale boutique and historic hotels whose owners are subject to fewer fixed brand standards compared with Choice's other brands. =Recent history= Cambria Chicago Magnificent Mile exterior Choice Hotels began a transformation of its Comfort properties in 2012, with the company removing its franchising from 600 properties that did not meet Choice Hotels' new standards. Choice Hotels rebranded Comfort in 2018, which brought its Comfort Inn, Comfort Inn & Suites, and Comfort Suites brands under one umbrella. In October 2010, officials in Maryland and Montgomery County announced that Choice Hotels International would move its headquarters from Silver Spring, to a new facility in Rockville Town Center in Rockville. Groundbreaking occurred in August 2011, and Choice Hotels completed the move into the new headquarters in June 2013. Rendering of Sleep Inn prototype exterior, November 2017 Throughout its history, Choice Hotels introduced new features into the hotel industry, including having all hotels include non- smoking rooms, 24-hour-a-day toll-free reservations, Internet-based property management systems, and the industry's first iPhone application. The company's technological developments also led it to create a division called SkyTouch Technology in 2013, which markets Choice Hotels' property management system to other hotel companies. In 2014, Choice Hotels invested millions of dollars to begin a multi-year process to develop the industry's first new global reservations system and distribution platform in 27 years. A cloud-based system, choiceEDGE, launched in 2018. The system can integrate with voice search and artificial intelligence. In 2018, Choice Hotels expanded the number of hotel brands it franchised by acquiring WoodSpring Suites, an extended-stay economy hotel brand. Adding WoodSpring's 240 hotels across the U.S. tripled the number of extended-stay hotels in the company's portfolio to around 350 properties. , Choice Hotels-branded properties are located in more than 40 countries and territories, including hotels in Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Scandinavia. Choice Hotels entered into an agreement with Spanish hotel operator Sercotel in 2018 to increase Choice's footprint in Spain and Latin America. Corporate affairs Choice Hotels International is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CHH. It maintains a corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, and a technology campus in Phoenix, Arizona. At year-end 2017, Choice Hotels employed 1,987 people in its global corporate operations. Stewart W. Bainum Jr. is chairman of Choice Hotels' board of directors, a position he has held since 1987. Pat Pacious became president and CEO in September 2017. Previously, he served as Choice Hotels' president and chief operating officer. In 2017, Choice Hotels teamed up with the Red Cross and Boys and Girls Clubs of America in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. Choice Hotels scored 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index in 2018. The company's sustainability efforts include Room to be Green, which requires franchised properties to reduce their impact on the environment and lower operating costs with energy-efficient lighting and recycling, and giving guests the option of foregoing daily change of linens. Choice Hotels also participates in Clean the World to recycle hotel soap. =Partnerships= Choice Hotels formed an alliance with Bluegreen Vacations, an international timeshare company, in 2013.

His specialty was writing about recent and popular history. Allen was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He studied at Groton, graduated from Harvard University in 1912 and received his Master's in 1913. He taught at Harvard briefly thereafter before becoming assistant editor of the Atlantic Monthly in 1914, and then managing editor of The Century in 1916. He began working for Harper's in 1923, becoming editor-in-chief in 1941, a position he held until shortly before his death, aged 63, in New York City. His wife, Dorothy Penrose Allen (n√©e Cobb, a first cousin of Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker), died just prior to the 1931 publication of his best-known book, Only Yesterday. Allen's popularity coincided with increased interest in history among the book-buying public of the 1920s and 1930s. This interest was met, not by the university-employed historian, but by an amateur historian writing in his free time. Aside from Allen, these historians included Carl Sandburg, Bernard DeVoto, Douglas Southall Freeman, Henry F. Pringle, and Allan Nevins (before his Columbia appointment). His most famous book was the enormously popular Only Yesterday (1931), which chronicled American life in the 1920s. Since Yesterday (1939), a sort of sequel that covered the Depression of the 1930s, was also a bestseller. The 1933 Hollywood film \\"Only Yesterday\\" was ostensibly based on his book, but actually used only its timeline, with a fictional plot adapted from a Stefan Zweig novel. He wrote the Introduction to Mabel S. Ulrich's collection of essays by notable woman writers of the day, including Mary Borden, Margaret Culkin Banning, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Susan Ertz, E. M. Delafield, Rebecca West, Isabel Paterson and Storm Jameson, The More I See Of Men (Harper & Brothers, 1932). His last and most ambitious book, The Big Change, was a social history of the United States from 1900 to 1950. (He had originally written a Harper's article about how America had changed between 1850 and 1950, but decided to limit the chronological scope of his book.) Allen also wrote two biographies, the first of which was about Paul Revere Reynolds, a literary agent of the era. This work is notable because it contains a chapter about Stephen Crane, but is difficult to find because it was privately published. In 1950, Allen was one of five narrators for the RKO Radio Pictures documentary film, The Golden Twenties, produced by Time, Inc.. The Frederick Lewis Allen Room in the New York Public Library was established by the Ford Foundation in 1958. It is Room 228e on the second floor of the library. Admission is limited to writers under book contract to a publishing company.http://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/allen-room Bibliography (history) * (history, biography, economics) * (history) * (biography) * (travel) * (biography) * (history) Notes # References  External links Only Yesterday hypertext from American Studies at the University of Virginia. *Since Yesterday online from Universal Digital Library. * Works by Frederick Lewis Allen at Project Gutenberg Australia * Historians of the United States 20th-century American historians 1890 births 1954 deaths The Harvard Lampoon alumni People from Boston Historians from Massachusetts ","title":"Frederick Lewis Allen"},{"id":"1850784","text":"Thomas C. Dula (June 22, 1845 ‚Äì May 1, 1868) was a former Confederate soldier who was convicted of murdering Laura Foster. National publicity from newspapers such as The New York Times turned Dula's story into a folk legend. Although Laura was murdered in Wilkes County, North Carolina, Dula was tried, convicted, and hanged in Statesville. Considerable controversy surrounded the case. In subsequent years, a folk song was written (entitled \\"Tom Dooley\\", based on the pronunciation in the local dialect), and many oral traditions were passed down, regarding the sensational occurrences surrounding Laura Foster's murder and Dula's subsequent execution. The Kingston Trio recorded a hit version of the murder ballad in 1958. Early life Tom Dula was born to a poor Appalachian hill country family in Wilkes County, North Carolina, most likely the youngest of three brothers, with one younger sister, Eliza. Dula grew up, attended school, and \\"probably played with the female Fosters\\" - Anne (later Melton) and her cousins Laura and Pauline. As the children grew up, Tom and Anne apparently became intimate. Anne Foster's mother found Anne and Tom in bed together when Anne was 14 years old and Tom was just 12. Three months before his 18th birthday, on March 15, 1862, Tom enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private in Company K, 42nd North Carolina Infantry Regiment. He was captured, but he was released in April 1865. Dula wrote a 15-page account of his life, as well as a note that exonerated Anne Melton. His literacy is highly unusual, considering the harsh poverty of his upbringing. Dula played the fiddle and was considered to be a \\"ladies man\\". Military service Contrary to newspaper accounts at the time, Dula did not serve in Colonel Zebulon Vance's 26th North Carolina Infantry regiment. Also rumors that he \\"played the banjo\\" in the army band for Vance's benefit and entertained the colonel with his antics were false. These have often been cited as the reason that Vance was so quick to lead the defense during Dula's trial. However, it seems more likely that Vance simply believed in Dula's innocence or felt that defending a veteran in the high-profile case would be politically beneficial. Also, Dula did not come through the war completely unscathed, as folklore, oral tradition, and some modern writers have claimed. He was wounded several times in battle. Dula's brothers died in the war, leaving Tom as his mother's \\"sole remaining boy\\". Dula did sometimes use his musical talents in the army, and on one surviving muster roll he is listed as a \\"musician\\" and a \\"drummer\\". Murder of Laura Foster Anne Foster had married an older man, James Melton, who was a farmer, cobbler, and neighbor of both the Fosters and Dulas. Melton also served in the war, taking part in the Battle of Gettysburg. Both Melton and Dula were captured and sent to a northern prison camp. They were released after the war ended and returned home. Shortly after his return, Dula resumed his relationship with Anne. With a reputation as a libertine, it was not long before he began an intimate relationship with Laura Foster, Anne's cousin. Folklore has it that Laura became pregnant, and that she and Dula had decided to elope. On the morning she was to meet Dula, May 25, 1866, Laura quietly left her home and rode off on her father's horse. She was never seen alive again. No one really knows what happened that day, but many stories have grown that implicate Anne Melton. Some tales claim that Anne murdered Laura Foster because she was jealous that Dula was marrying her. These stories say that Dula suspected Anne had killed her, but he still loved Anne enough to take the blame himself. It was Anne's word that led to the discovery of Laura's body, leading to further suspicion of Anne's guilt. Anne's cousin, Pauline Foster, testified that Anne had taken her to the grave one night to make sure it was still well hidden. Witnesses at the trial testified that Dula made the incriminating statement he was going to \\"do in\\" the one who gave him \\"the pock\\" (syphilis). Their testimony suggested that Dula believed Laura had given him syphilis, which he had passed on to Anne. However, the local doctor testified he had treated both Dula and Anne for syphilis with blue mass, as he also had Pauline Foster, who in fact was the first to be treated. Many believe that Dula caught the disease from Pauline Foster, then passed it on to both Anne and Laura. Once the grave had been located, Laura Foster's decomposed body was found with her legs drawn up to fit in the shallow grave. She had been stabbed once in the chest. The gruesome murder and the lovers' triangle, combined with the rumors that circulated in the small backwoods town, captured the public's attention and led to the lasting notoriety of the crime. Dula's role in the murder is still debated (though he was eventually found legally culpable). After the murder he stopped at the home of his relative Thomas Dula, a site that became Dula Springs Hotel. He had fled the area before Laura's body was found, after locals accused him of murdering Laura. Calling himself Tom Hall, he worked for about a week for Colonel James Grayson, just across the state line in Trade, Tennessee. Grayson was later mentioned in the song about Dula, and from that came the myth that he had been Dula's rival for the love of Laura Foster, but Grayson actually had no prior connection to either Dula or Foster. Once Dula's identity was known, Grayson did help the Wilkes County posse bring him in, but that was his only part in the affair. = Trial = Following Dula's arrest, former North Carolina Governor Zebulon Vance represented him pro bono, and to the end of his life maintained that Dula was innocent. He succeeded in having the trial moved from Wilkesboro to Statesville, since it was believed Dula could not receive a fair trial in Wilkes County. Nevertheless, Dula was convicted, and although he was given a new trial on appeal, he was convicted again. His supposed accomplice, Jack Keaton, was set free, and on Dula's word, Anne Melton was acquitted. As he stood on the gallows facing death, Dula reportedly said, \\"Gentlemen, do you see this hand? I didn't harm a hair on the girl's head\\". He was executed on May 1, 1868, nearly two years after Laura Foster's murder. Dula's younger sister and her husband retrieved his body for burial. =Petitions= In 2001, the citizens of North Wilkesboro presented a petition to North Carolina Governor Mike Easley, asking that Tom Dula be posthumously pardoned. No action was taken. Tom Dula was \\"acquitted\\" of all charges after a petition was sent around Wilkes County and to the county seat. However, this action was unofficial and had no legal standing. right =Myths= Much legend and folklore has grown around the tragedy and the life of Tom Dula. Not the least of these is that Dula came through the war without a scratch, with Governor Vance making use of Dula's supposed talents with a banjo for his own entertainment. Both Dula's and Vance's accounts, as well as Dula's own military record, show this to be untrue. Nonetheless, it persists even today. Another myth holds that while Dula was fighting in Virginia, Anne ‚Äî apparently despairing of ever seeing Tom again ‚Äì met and married an older farmer, James Melton. In fact, Anne had married James Melton in 1859, three years before Tom left for the war, though that may not have changed the nature of her relationship with Dula. A final tale is that Anne Melton confessed to the murder on her deathbed. Anne allegedly confessed she killed Laura in a fit of jealousy and begged Tom to help her conceal the body. People in the area still say that on her deathbed, Anne saw black cats on the walls and could hear and smell bacon frying. In popular culture =Music=Thomas Land is believed to have written a song about the tragedy titled \\"Tom Dooley\\" (which was how Dula's name was pronounced) shortly after Dula was hanged. This, combined with the widespread publicity the trial received, further cemented Dula's place in North Carolina legend. * Stonewall Jackson's U.S. country music and Billboard hit song \\"Waterloo\\" (1959) makes reference to Tom Dooley in the final verse. * Sam Cooke's song \\"Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha\\" (1959) makes a humorous reference to \\"Tom Dooley\\" being performed in the Cha Cha Cha style. * Abner Jay's song \\"VD\\" discusses Tom Dooley's story but is distinct from Land's song. *The members of Macabre, known for their death metal, also released an album of acoustic folk songs titled Macabre Minstrels: Morbid Campfire Songs (2002), which includes a track titled \\"Tom Dooley\\", about Dula's death; Macabre's song differs from Land's traditional ballad. *The music project Windows to Sky featuring SJ Tucker released a version of \\"Tom Dooley\\" titled \\"Tom Dula: Madness Made Us Wild; a Play in Five Verses and a Hanging\\" (2012), which combines elements of several versions of the story and song, and adapts quotes from the original court transcripts as lyrics. They describe it as \\"our original reinvention of the 'Tom Dula' story for the Neil Young Americana Contest, June 2012\\". *Neil Young's album Americana (2012) features a song called \\"Tom Dula\\", a re-working of Thomas Land's original poem. *Jeanie Cunningham and Paul Elliot have written the musical 'Dula‚Äô. The fact is Tom Dula was hanged for the murder of Laura Foster. The question is whether it was a justified conviction or a gross miscarriage of justice. That is the story behind the musical, 'Dula,' a love story that went terribly wrong. *Bob Dylan mentions Dula in his 2020 release \\"Murder Most Foul,\\" which includes the lyric \\"Take me to the place Tom Dooley was hung.\\" =Other=Michael Landon portrayed Dula in the movie The Legend of Tom Dooley (1959).; retrieved on 2007-10-19 The movie is not based on the facts of Dula's life, except in the very loosest sense, nor is it based on any traditional Tom Dula legends. Rather, it is a fictional treatment inspired by the lyrics of Land's folk song. *Sharyn McCrumb's novel The Ballad of Tom Dooley (2011) is a fictionalized account of the events surrounding Laura Foster's murder; in a postscript McCrumb claims her reconstruction is consistent with all the available evidence.

It is often used as an erosion control technique on construction sites, as an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. Description The hydroseeding slurry is transported in a tank, either truck-mounted or trailer-mounted and sprayed over prepared ground. Helicopters have been used to cover larger areas. Aircraft application may also be used on burned wilderness areas after a fire, and in such uses may contain only soil stabilizer to avoid introducing non-native plant species. Hydroseeding is an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. A study conducted along the lower Colorado River in Arizona reported that hydroseeding could be used to restore riparian vegetation in cleared land. The slurry often has other ingredients including fertilizer, tackifying agents, fiber mulch, and green dye.California Department of Transportation (CalTrans). Sacramento, CA. \\"Construction Site Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual.\\" Section 3, BMP No. SS-4. March 2003. History Maurice Mandell of the Connecticut Highway Department is responsible for coming up with hydroseeding. Back in the 1940s, Mandell was tinkering with ways to grow healthy grass and avoid soil erosion along the slopes of Connecticut‚Äôs expressways. He mixed up seed and water then had it sprayed over the slopes where the grass could sprout and take hold, even on a steep incline. Advantages If planting a relatively large area, hydroseeding can be completed in a very short period of time. It can be very effective for hillsides and sloping lawns to help with erosion control and quick planting. Hydroseeding will typically cost less than planting with sod, but more than broadcast seeding. Results are often quick with high germination rates producing grass growth in about a week and mowing maintenance beginning around 3 to 4 weeks from the date of application. Fiber mulch accelerates the growing process by maintaining moisture around the seeds thereby increasing the rate of germination.

Early life Reed was born in Whitehaven. He attended Whitehaven School and Manchester Metropolitan University. Before his election to Parliament, he worked as a Press Officer at Sellafield, a nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site in his constituency, and had served on Copeland Borough Council. Parliamentary career In his maiden speech Reed declared himself to be a Jedi in the debate over the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill under consideration in Parliament. His comment was intended to be taken ironically and raise the issue of how the Bill would define what was and was not a religion. Jamie Reed has also referred to himself as a \\"good Methodist\\" in parliamentary debate: > As a good Methodist, I shall refuse the opportunity to bet. My hon. friend > mentioned the economic estimates done by a German economist on the amount of > money spent on nuclear technology and nuclear research and development. Are > we talking principally about the civil nuclear sector? Is the military > nuclear sector also included? He also mentioned the IAEA. It does not exist > to promote the nuclear industry; it exists to give it some kind of > international regulatory framework. He previously served on the frontbench as a Shadow Environment Minister, and as a Shadow Health Minister under Shadow Secretary of State for Health Andy Burnham. He also spoke out to assist his party leader Ed Miliband, who declared he felt \\"respect\\" on seeing a white van, following Emily Thornberry's \\"White Van Gate\\" tweet during the 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election campaign, stating during PMQs: \\"When I see a white van, I wonder whether it's my father or my brother who is driving\\". On 12 September 2015, one minute into Jeremy Corbyn's acceptance speech as leader of the Labour Party, he publicly resigned as shadow Health Minister giving as his reason Corbyn's opposition to nuclear energy. During a House of Commons debate on the renewal of Britain's nuclear deterrent, which Corbyn personally opposes, he described the Labour leader as \\"reckless, juvenile and narcissistic\\". He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. He announced on 21 December 2016 that he would be resigning his seat at the end of January 2017 in order to take up a new role as Head of Development and Community Relations for Sellafield Ltd, triggering a by-election, which was won by Conservative MP Trudy Harrison. Reed formally resigned by taking the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 23 January 2017.

He was elected one of the council in 1716, and in 1723 Sir Isaac Newton, president of the society, appointed him one of the vice-presidents. On the death of Newton he became a candidate for the presidency, but was defeated by Sir Hans Sloane, whom, however, he succeeded in 1741; in 1742 he was made a member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences; in 1746 he received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge.

Before the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was president from 1749 to 1754, he read in 1736 his Observations on the Trajan and Antonine Pillars at Rome and his Table of English Gold Coins from the 18th Year of King Edward III. In 1745 he printed the latter with another on the history of silver coinage. He also contributed both to the Society of Antiquaries and to the Royal Society other papers, chiefly on Roman antiquities.

She also worked as a trainer in WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling. After debuting in 1998, Hall worked on the independent circuit under the name Macaela Mercedes. She won numerous championships, before beginning to work for Ohio Valley Wrestling in 2003 under her real name. She debuted on WWE's SmackDown brand as the \\"fixer\\" for the MNM faction. After leaving MNM, she became John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield's \\"image consultant\\", and managed him to the WWE United States Championship at WrestleMania 22. In February 2007, Hall developed an in-ring persona as a tone-deaf singer. In June 2007, she was drafted to Raw, where she participated in numerous tag team matches after allying with Melina. In October 2009, she won the WWE Divas Championship, but lost it to Melina the same night. Hall was released from her WWE contract in November 2010. Professional wrestling career =Training and independent circuit (1998‚Äì2003)= Hall was originally trained by Roger Ruffen in Cincinnati. Later she trained with Dave Finlay at his professional wrestling school. Debuting in 1998, Fletcher wrestled under the ring name Macaela Mercedes on the independent circuit as a villainous character. Mercedes won numerous championships on the independent circuit, including Southern States Wrestling's Women's Championship. She wrestled for women-only promotions, including G.L.O.R.Y., the Professional Girl Wrestling Association (PGWA), and the Women's Wrestling Alliance (WWA), and held both the WWA Women's Championship and the PGWA Championship. She also competed for other promotions including Hoosier Pro Wrestling (HPW), where she won both the HPW Cruiserweight Championship and HPW Ladies' Championship, Canadian International Wrestling (CIW), where she won the CIW Indy Women's Championship, Mid‚ÄìStates Championship Wrestling, where she won the MCW Mid- American title, and Blue Water Championship Wrestling, where she won the BWCW Women's title. Her greatest independent circuit success was in the Superstar Wrestling Federation (SWF), where she held the SWF Women's Championship and also competed in numerous intergender matches. She held the SWF Tag Team Championship twice, once with Tiny Tim and once with Randy Allen. In 2002 and early 2003, Mercedes wrestled regularly for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation and Wrestle And Respect, where she competed in intergender matches and was involved in a scripted rivalry with the \\"Fabulous Firebird\\" Phoenix over the G.L.O.R.Y. Ladies' Wrestling Championship. On January 23, 2003, Mercedes won the G.L.O.R.Y. Ladies' Wrestling Championship, when she defeated the \\"Fabulous Firebird\\" Phoenix via referee's decision at an Apocalypse Wrestling Federation show. =World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE= Ohio Valley Wrestling (2003‚Äì2005) In mid-2003, Fletcher began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). She eventually signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2004. She started out in OVW as a fan favorite‚Äîgaining the nickname \\"Chronically Cute\\"‚Äîand had a series of matches against Alexis Laree. After wrestling sporadically throughout 2004, Hall returned in January 2005 as a villain, complete with breast implants, and straightened, bleached blonde hair. The villainous turn was motivated in an angle where her implants \\"leaked into her brain\\", causing her to become psychotic. As a villain, she managed the OVW Southern Tag Team Champions Blonde Bombers (Tank and Chad Toland) alongside her bodyguard Melissa Coates and went on a spree of blinding people with rubbing alcohol in storyline. Managerial roles (2005‚Äì2006) Hall making her entrance before a scheduled wrestling match, during a SmackDown! house show Hall made her WWE debut on the July 28, 2005, episode of SmackDown! with a gimmick of a \\"fixer\\" for the villainous faction MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina). She also had a \\"growth\\" on the left side of her face, which she referred to as a \\"blemish\\", the nature of which the announcers constantly speculated over. The gimmick carried over to OVW, where the Blonde Bombers forced her to choose between them and MNM. She eventually chose MNM, but did not stay with that group for very long. As MNM's fixer, she, in storyline, helped them to obtain a photo shoot for the cover of SmackDown! magazine, and helped to fix a problem that Melina had with Torrie Wilson, by helping Melina defeat her. Hall was later approached by John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield (JBL), a former WWE Champion who asked for help repairing his image after a loss to underdog Rey Mysterio. During this time, she was involved in her first feud on SmackDown!, against Stacy Keibler, with the two confronting each other many times until Hall cheated to defeat Keibler in Keibler's final match on Velocity, one of WWE's secondary television programs. As JBL's \\"Image Consultant\\", she had an important role in JBL's feud with The Boogeyman, which included The Boogeyman putting worms down her skirt and biting off her mole. She also successfully guided JBL to winning the United States Championship from Chris Benoit at WrestleMania 22 in April. That April, he fired her after Hall accidentally slammed a cage door on JBL's head during a steel cage match and put together a \\"second-rate\\" United States championship celebration. After being fired, she turned into a fan favorite and began a scripted rivalry with former client, Melina of MNM. She defeated her in a six-man tag team match along with Paul London and Brian Kendrick and in singles competition at Judgment Day in a controversial fashion. Singing (2006‚Äì2008) Throughout mid-2006, she teamed with Ashley Massaro in a feud against Michelle McCool and Kristal. In July, she participated in a Bra and Panties match at The Great American Bash which was won by Massaro. She appeared only sporadically throughout the end of 2006, competing mainly in dance and lingerie contests. Raw event in March 2008 In January 2007, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Massaro centered on Hall's jealousy of Massaro's recent Playboy appearance; the rivalry turned Hall into a villain and matches between the two mainly resulted in losses for Hall. During the feud, Hall attempted to prove that she was talented in areas beyond wrestling and being eye candy by creating a new in-ring persona, in which she sang badly at every opportunity, but thought she was a very good singer. She later attempted to impress music producer Timbaland by performing a song she claimed to have composed herself, looking for a spot in a video he was preparing and a possible future collaboration on a music project, but he turned her down. Massaro, with whom she had been involved in a rivalry, was one of the wrestlers who was chosen to work with Timbaland instead. Jealous of Massaro's recent successes, she attacked her and, in storyline, seriously injured her, with the reasoning that if she could not appear in Timbaland's music project, neither could Massaro. Following this incident, she had a short rivalry with Michelle McCool, who had come to Massaro's aid, and was annoyed by Hall's singing. She defeated McCool in a singles match on the April 27 episode of SmackDown!, and sang before and after their match. They continued to compete against each other throughout May and June, with McCool coming out on top. Hall was drafted from SmackDown! to the Raw brand on June 17, 2007, as part of the 2007 Supplemental Draft. The following night, Hall won her Raw debut where she teamed with Melina to defeat Mickie James and Candice Michelle in a tag team match. From then on, Hall mainly competed in tag team matches, wrestling James, Michelle, and Maria. She resumed her singing gimmick not long after, frequently appearing in backstage and in-ring segments, including a stint as one of the contestants for the WWE Idol segment on the August 13 episode. She also entered into an on-and-off angle with ring announcer Lilian Garcia stemming from her jealousy of Garcia's flourishing singing career. In October, Hall formed an alliance with Melina, and the pair teamed together on numerous occasions throughout the end of the year. She also competed in the 10-wrestler tag team match at Survivor Series, but her team was not successful.  Divas Champion and departure (2008‚Äì2010)  Hall singing during a live event At the start of 2008, Hall continued her alliance with Melina, both teaming with her and accompanying her to the ring on numerous occasions. Hall was utilized mainly in a backup role throughout the next few months, teaming with Melina, as well as competing in a 12 wrestler tag team match at the Backlash pay-per-view in April, which her team won. In mid-2008, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, teaming up with multiple partners, including Layla and Katie Lea Burchill to face them in tag team matches. She continued to have a rivalry with Kelly throughout October, and was also a part of the winning team in a Raw versus SmackDown 10-wrestler tag team elimination match at Survivor Series in November, although she was eliminated by Maria. On the December 29 episode of Raw, Hall competed in a number one contender Divas battle royal for the opportunity to face Beth Phoenix at the Royal Rumble for the Women's Championship, but was eliminated by Mickie James. In January 2009, she formed an alliance with the Women's Champion, Beth Phoenix to face Kelly Kelly and former ally Melina in tag team matches, which Phoenix and Hall won due to the interference of Rosa Mendes, Phoenix's associate. She also sporadically competed in singles matches, losing to both Kelly Kelly and Melina. On April 5, at WrestleMania XXV, Hall competed in the 25-Diva battle royal, which was won by \\"Santina\\" Marella, and continued to compete in tag team matches throughout April and May. Hall then took a brief hiatus and made her return on August 3, teaming with Beth Phoenix to defeat Mickie James and Gail Kim. On the October 12 episode of Raw, Hall defeated Mickie James to win the Divas Championship, her first championship in WWE, but lost it to Melina immediately afterwards. This prompted a series of matches between the two. On October 19, Hall unsuccessfully challenged Melina for the title in a rematch. She also teamed with Chavo Guerrero in a losing effort to Melina and Santino Marella in a mixed tag team match, and at Survivor Series, Hall's team was on the losing end of tag team elimination match to Melina's team. Hall competed only sporadically throughout 2010, mainly in tag team matches. On October 2, Hall announced that she was taking a break from television as she had been assigned as a trainer for WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling. On November 19, 2010, Hall was released from her WWE contract. =Return to the independent circuit (2011‚Äì2014)= After her release from WWE, Hall returned to the independent circuit, competing for promotions including Xtreme Pro Wrestling, World Wrestling Fan Xperience, and Crossfire Wrestling.

He was born in Ha'afuasia in the Hahake District on Wallis island. He was elected king on 12 March 1959, after a 6 month-rule by a Council of Ministers. In early years, he supported closer links with France, recognising that Wallis was economically dependent on subsidies. After a national referendum, he signed treaty to make Wallis a French overseas territory (Territoire d'Outre-Mer) in 1961.Obituary , The Independent, 8 May 2007 He had six children. In 2002, the king riled many of his countrymen, as well as France, by shutting down the island's only newspaper because it had carried an editorial criticising him for giving refuge to a family friend, after she was sentenced to jail for embezzling public funds. Reformists also mocked the king's insistence that Wallisians dismount from their bicycles when passing his palace. In 2005, the King nearly lost his throne after his grandson, Tomasi Tuugahala, was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison for the involuntary manslaughter of a pedestrian who was killed in a drunk-driving accident on New Year's Eve. The King invited his grandson to take refuge in the royal palace, where he hid for four months before surrendering to the French gendarmes. The King's Prime Minister, holder of the title \\"Kalae Kivalu\\" urged the high administrator of the French government Xavier de F√ºrst to \\"quit the territory\\". The King also claimed that the incident was dealt with according to customary tribal law and that the French penal law should be abolished in Uvea. Reformists wished to depose the King and install Sosefo Mautamakia Ahau Halagahu, son of the late Halagahu as his successor in the northern district \\"Hihifo\\". Local riots occurred and the coronation did not take place. The King retained the throne and would be further recognised as such by France. Several hundred of the King's supporters marched and built roadblocks on the island during the crisis. His daughter Etua took over his ceremonial duties in later years, when he suffered from poor health. He died in Mata-Utu. A six-month mourning period was observed, during which it was taboo to mention a possible successor.

Early life Nanos is from Bedford, New Hampshire. He received his bachelor's degree and was a Trident Scholar at the United States Naval Academy in 1967 and received his doctorate in physics from Princeton University in 1974. Military career Vice Admiral Nanos in 2002 Nanos served for 35 years in the United States Navy and retired as a vice admiral. Nanos conducted many tours at sea aboard destroyers and carriers and is credited with the first-time application of systems engineering at the battle group level rather than just at the individual ship level. In 1989 he began ten years with the Navy's strategic programs overseeing the submarine inertial navigation and missile programs. In 1992, he became technical director of strategic system programs and, after promotion to rear admiral, was named director, where he served until 1999. Promoted to vice admiral, he served as the commander, Naval Sea Systems Command where he was responsible for design, development and logistics support for all navy ships and shipboard weapons systems until his retirement. In that capacity, he oversaw four nuclear repair shipyards, 10 defense laboratory divisions with more than 20,000 employees and over $23 billion in ship and weapons systems procurements, logistics and repairs. He was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit (2 awards), the Meritorious Service Medal (5 awards), and the Navy Achievement Medal. Los Alamos National Laboratory On January 6, 2003, Nanos began working as the interim director of Los Alamos National Lab. On July 17, 2003, he was named director of the lab. In May 2004, Nanos ordered an emergency shutdown of operations after classified computer disks were reported missing by a flawed auditing procedure, and a student suffered an eye injury from a laser beam in the same week. \\"In no case will I authorize a restart until I'm absolutely convinced that each organization will not risk further compromise of safety, security and environment,\\" Nanos said in an internal e-mail. '\\"This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many people I have to fire to make it stop. If you think the rules are silly, if you think compliance is a joke, please resign now and save me the trouble,\\" Nanos added in a separate e-mail to Los Alamos employees. The shutdown was unprecedented in the history of the national laboratory complex, creating severe tensions between him and laboratory employees. Nanos stepped down as director in May 2005. Defense Threat Reduction Agency In 2005, Nanos joined Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) as the associate director of research and development responsible for combating weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by providing R&D; capabilities to reduce, eliminate, counter, and defeat the threat of WMD and mitigate their effects. In 2007, Nanos joined JHU/APL and returned to DTRA on an Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) assignment, eventually assuming the position of associate director of operations enterprise in October 2009. In that capacity, he led and directed all combat support, nuclear support, cooperative threat reduction, and on-site inspection activities for DTRA. Johns Hopkins University / Applied Physics Laboratory In 2007, Nanos joined the Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) and returned to Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on an Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) assignment, eventually assuming the position of associate director of operations enterprise in October 2009. In that capacity, he led and directed all combat support, nuclear support, cooperative threat reduction, and on-site inspection activities for DTRA. In 2010, Nanos became a fellow in the National Security Analysis Department and later that same year accepted the temporary position as Head of the National Security Analysis Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory. In mid-2011, Nanos was appointed the acting head of the Global Engagement Department. Shortly thereafter, the laboratory completed a substantial reorganization, with Nanos being one of the key executives team members instrumental in providing the new framework. Upon completion of the reorganization and the official stand up of the Force Projection Department, Nanos was named the managing executive.

A locally-built variant of the French Hotchkiss 25mm anti-aircraft gun, it was designed as a dual-purpose weapon for use against armored vehicles and aircraft, but was primarily used as an anti-aircraft gun in fixed mounts with one to three guns. History and development In 1935 the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to replace the earlier 40 mm Vickers \\"pom-pom\\" guns with a 25 mm Hotchkiss design. A party of Japanese officers and engineers traveled to France to evaluate the design in 1935, and an order was placed for a number of guns and mounts for evaluation. Firing tests of these guns were conducted at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1935. The first few weapons were built in France under the designation ‚ÄúType 94‚Äù and ‚ÄúType 95‚Äù, with the mass production model produced at the Yokosuka Arsenal being designated ‚ÄúType 96‚Äù. The Japanese made a number of minor changes to the original Hotchkiss design and production process, changing some components from forgings to castings to simplify production, and replacing the simple conical flash suppressor with a Rheinmetall-type design. A submarine-mountable version of the gun which made extensive use of stainless steel was also produced. The double-mount type was the first to enter service, with triple mounts following in 1941 and finally single mounts later in 1943. Design The Type 96 25mm Gun is a simple air- cooled gas operated design. The barrel is a forging screwed into the breech mechanism. Additional support is provided to the breech end of the gun barrel by the finned cooling jacket. The barrel is changeable, requiring two men and special tools; the operation took a trained crew approximately five minutes. By adjusting the gas valve setting it was possible to vary the rate of fire between 200 and 260 rounds per minute, with 220 rounds per minute being the standard setting. The gun mounts were normally provided with one of three gun sights: # A Le Prieur mechanical lead computing sight # An open ring sight # An etched glass optical ring sight The Le Prieur mechanical lead computing sight. Land mountings and all single mountings all used the single open-ring sight. The Type 95 sight was used on ship-based multiple mounts, in the case where the mount has a powered drive linked to a fire director it was used as a backup. The Type 95 sight was originally designed with a maximum target speed of 600 kilometers per hour; however, experience showed that aircraft often exceeded this speed. To compensate for the problem, a ring was added to the sighting telescope to provide an additional offset for speeds up to 900 kilometers per hour. The gun was normally used without a gun shield, although some multiple mounts on Yamato-class battleships were fitted with Ducol (High tensile steel) shields. Many ship-based mounts also had splinter shields. =Ammunition= Japanese 25 mm ammunition from a post-war US technical manual. The Type 96 cartridge case was a rimless type design with a deep extraction groove at the base. The projectiles fired by the weapon were slightly unusual in that they had two rotating bands. The forward band was slightly smaller in diameter than the rear band. It was believed that this was to reduce wear on the rifling near the chamber. The case of the cartridge was crimped around the rear rotating band. The complete round weighed approximately with the projectile weighing . The propellant was 102 grams of single-perforated, graphited grains of nitrocellulose approximately 2 millimeters in diameter and between 2.5 and 4.5 millimeters in length. Normally one tracer round was added every four or five rounds to aid laying. * High-explosive shells. Orange body. * High explosive incendiary. Green body. * High explosive tracer. Orange or red body. * High explosive tracer self- destroying. Orange or red body. * Armor-piercing. Black, white or smoky blue body.

The single mount was free swinging, while double and triple mounts had hand-wheel traverse.  Type 96 Model 2 - Used on warships in double and triple mountings.  Type 96 Model 3 - Used on warships in single free-swinging mounts.  Type 96 Model 4 - Used on submarines, in single, double and triple mounts. Single mounts can be manually lowered into the submarine. * Type 96 Model 4 mod 1 - Used on submarines in free-swinging single mounts. Could not be lowered into the submarine. * Type 96 Model 4 mod 2 - Used on submarines in free-swinging single mounts. Could be remotely lowered into the submarine.  Type 96 Model 5 - Used on submarines in twin and triple geared mounts.  Type 96 Model 6 - Used on land on single gun twin wheel carriages.  Type 96 Model 8 - Used on land on single gun twin wheel carriages.  Type 96 Model 10 - Used on torpedo boats on a ring mounting with geared elevation in single gun mounts. Combat record The Type 96 was the standard Japanese medium anti-aircraft weapon of the Imperial Japanese Navy, being mounted aboard practically every ship in the fleet. The gun was also used in land bases in the Japanese Empire and in the Japanese overseas combat fronts. These weapons were also used as anti-tank guns in some defensive actions in Pacific theaters and against land objectives in southeast Asia/Chinese mainland during the Pacific War. The gun was used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. It was also used by the Bougainville Revolutionary Army during the Bougainville Civil War which lasted from 1988-1998. Effectiveness A single barreled variant at the China People's Revolution Military Museum, Beijing In interviews conducted by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan after the end of the war, Japanese military personnel said it was the most reliable Japanese anti-aircraft weapon, but second in effectiveness to the Type 98 anti-aircraft gun. The Type 96 was most effective when used at ranges of 1,000 meters or less. The Japanese military estimated that it required an average of 1,500 rounds to shoot down an aircraft at a height of 1,000 meters and a range of 2,000 meters, and that fire beyond that range was completely ineffective. Later in the war, when ammunition supply was restricted, firing was held until the targets were within 800 meters range, dropping this ratio to as low as seven rounds per aircraft. The Type 96 was a mediocre weapon compared to its contemporaries in other navies. It was hampered by slow training and elevating speeds (even in power-operated triple mounts), excessive vibration and muzzle flash, and that the ammunition feed was via a 15-round fixed magazine, which necessitated ceasing fire every time the magazine had to be changed. According to \\"US Naval Technical Mission to Japan report O-47(N)-2\\", all magazines had to be loaded by hand as no specialized loading equipment was ever developed. Overall, it was more comparable to the 20mm Oerlikon, though vastly inferior to the 40mm Bofors weapons used by the US and allies in every respect except rate of fire (and only barely in that respect: the Bofors could put out a sustained 120 round/minute because of its constant-fire top-fed ammo clip design, whereas the 25mm's frequent ammo box changes lowered its nominal rate of fire to only half of its theoretical maximum of 260 rounds per minute). The Japanese ranked in order of seriousness the problems with the gun as: # Elevation and traverse were too slow, even with powered mounts; # The sights were ineffective against high speed targets; # Firing the multiple mounts caused excessive vibration, which reduced accuracy and prevented effective target tracking; # Too little ammunition in each magazine resulted in a low overall rate of fire. In Rapid Fire, Anthony Williams writes that the intermediate calibre weapons (including the US Navy's 1.1\\"/75 caliber gun 28√ó199mm L/75) were relatively unsuccessful during World War II: the mounts were much heavier and more complex than smaller calibre guns, but the shells lacked the range and hitting power of the larger 37 and 40 millimeter weapons. The Japanese viewed increasing the caliber of autocannons as the number one priority of research and development in the field.

After desperate fighting, most of the Australian forces were relieved by October 1941. However, the town was continuously contested until the Allied victory at El Alamein in 1942. The Allied defence of Tobruk lengthened German supply lines and diverted troops who might have been deployed against Allied troops elsewhere. This memorial commemorated the endurance of those who were besieged, who were given the honorific title, \\"Rats of Tobruk\\". The memorial was unveiled on 13 April 1983 by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen.

The series was conceived by Oji Hiroi and developed by Red Company, debuting on the PC Engine CD-ROM¬≤ System in 1989. The series became popular in Japan, where it was one of the most popular RPG series during the 16-bit era, along with Enix's Dragon Quest and Squaresoft's Final Fantasy. Its success was partly because the original Tengai Makyou was the first RPG released for the new CD-ROM format, which it utilized to create a bigger game and introduce fully voiced animated cut scenes and CD music to the genre. Though originally intended to be only three games, it has grown to encompass a number of remakes, gaidens and genre spin-offs across a variety of platforms. Despite its relative popularity in Asian countries, the series is largely unknown in other territories, with only one game released overseas. Overview The main series is composed of three separate games within the land of 'Jipang' (a fictional feudal Japan using the name given by Italian merchant Marco Polo), each follows a descendant of the 'Fire Clan' and supporting cast in battles against a range of often comical villains. The stories of the games, though primarily of 'fantasy' fare, are inspired by and a parody of misconceptions about Japanese culture by Western societies. The first game Tengai Makyo: Ziria, released for the PC Engine CD-ROM¬≤ System in 1989, was notable as the first RPG released on CD-ROM and the first in the genre to feature animated cut scenes and voice acting. The plot and characters were inspired by the Japanese folk tale Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari (with the protagonist's name deliberately misspelled, per the fantastic theme). The music for the game was also composed by the Academy Award winning musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. The game was previewed in the November 1990 issue of Computer Gaming World. The writer Roe R. Adams (also a co-developer for the Wizardry games) described it as \\"a truly gigantic game\\" that \\"seems to be about the size of 2 or 3 Ultimas put together.\\" He suggested that, if \\"NEC can handle the mammoth translating job, Ziria could be the game hit of 1991\\" unless, \\"of course, Nintendo counters with Zelda III or Dragon Warrior III, and Sega with Phantasy Star III.\\" There were also plans to release the sequel Tengai Maky≈ç II: Manjimaru (1992) in North America, but due to the TurboGrafx-16's failure in that market, no Tengai Makyou games would be released there up until Far East of Eden: Kabuki Klash (1995). Creators The games are largely the creation of Hiroshi Adachi (under the nickname \\"Oji Hiroi\\") and Red Company (today Red Entertainment). Virtually all publishing tasks have been handled by Hudson Soft. The series is purported to be based on a book entitled \\"Far East of Eden\\" written by a Paul Hieronymus Chada (typically written as P.H. Chada), who is presented as a 19th-century Smithsonian professor of oriental studies. The book and P.H. Chada do not exist, and 'P.H. Chada' is actually derived from 'Prince (Ouji) Hiroi Adachi'. This is part of how the setting is supposed based on the misconceptions Western societies held with regard to Japan in the past. Oji Hiroi and Red Company would later become known for creating the Sakura Wars series for the Sega Saturn.

She is perhaps best known for appearing in the first two seasons of the Game Show Network show Extreme Dodgeball. Bodybuilding Prior to entering professional wrestling, Coates aspired to become a professional tennis player after watching Martina Navratilova. In order to train effectively for tennis, Coates began weightlifting at 15, and during that same year, she entered her first tennis competition in 1984, where she lasted until the finals. She re-entered the following year and won the Mid-Canada Junior Girls Championship. However, she soon began to shift her attention from tennis to bodybuilding and entered her first contest in the early 1990s, where she won the overall lightweight category of the Windsor Physique Contest. After she began making prominence, Coates decided to move to Los Angeles and worked for two gyms and two bars to finance herself. After being granted professional status in 1995, she won the Jan Tana Classic in 1996. In 1999, she took a leave from bodybuilding and subsequently began working as a model. She also competed in the first two seasons of Extreme Dodgeball on the Game Show Network. Her team, the Barbell Mafia team, qualified for the playoffs in the first season but failed to qualify the next year. Professional wrestling career =Early career (2005‚Äì2006)= After training at both Killer Kowalski's training school and Ultimate Pro Wrestling's Ultimate University. In 2005, Melissa Coates made an appearance in Naked Women's Wrestling League, hosted by Carmen Electra. Melissa fought another professional wrestler, April Hunter, in which both wrestlers appeared completely nude.http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x2fb7a_jfm51278_nwwl/1#video=xvqsoz =World Wrestling Entertainment (2005‚Äì2007)= Coates moved down to Louisville, Kentucky to begin training in World Wrestling Entertainment's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling. Coates then made an appearance at WWE's Backlash, taking part in Chris Masters' \\"Master Lock Challenge\\" segment, where he offered $3000 to anyone who could break his Master Lock, which she failed to do. She was then placed in OVW as an official trainee and became the \\"head of security\\" for Kenny Bolin's stable \\"Bolin's Services\\". Soon after, however, Coates left both OVW and WWE and went to work for World Xtreme Wrestling. Coates returned to OVW, albeit not under a WWE developmental contract. Upon re-debuting, she soon began facing off with several of the OVW Divas, including Beth Phoenix, Mickie James, Melina Perez. Coates later turned heel and began managing the OVW Southern Tag Team Champions Blonde Bombers (Tank and Chad Toland), as well as becoming Jillian Hall's bodyguard and went on a spree of blinding people with rubbing alcohol in storyline. After training in OVW, Coates then moved over to Deep South Wrestling and debuted for the territory as The Bag Lady, a homeless woman who became the love interest and eventually the valet of The Freakin' Deacon. On February 22, 2007, the Bag Lady debuted a new Diva-esque look and defeated Angel Williams in their subsequent match. The Bag Lady then began feuding with both Williams and Krissy Vaine. On the April 5 episode of DSW TV Tapings, The Bag Lady accompanied Nattie Neidhart to the ring where she lost to Krissy Vaine after the distraction by Williams followed by Vaine using the heel of a shoe. In March 2015, Devon Nicholson described an incident from 2006 that Bill DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE's Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident where Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked stinkfaces to Coates and Zack Ryder while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with it because they wanted to skip the session. =NWA Anarchy (2007‚Äì2008)= Coates, as Mile High Melissa, in 2008 In her first appearances on the indy circuit after leaving DSW, Coates made her debut for Great Championship Wrestling on May 29 and defeated Daffney to win the NWA/GCW Women's Championship, her first professional wrestling championship. Coates continued to remain champion until the title was seemingly forgotten and then deactivated in late 2007. Coates also made several appearances for other Georgia-based wrestling promotions in both a wrestling and managerial role. On July 7, she made her debut for NWA Anarchy as a heel, challenging and defeating several male wrestlers in intergender matches. At NWA Anarchy's Fright Night event, Coates teamed up with fellow DSW alumnus Tony Santarelli to defeat Todd Sexton and referee Wes Grissom, the latter of whom Coates was feuding with. On December 15, Coates began an angle with Don Matthews after Coates attacked Matthews and his tag team partner Brodie Chase. All three were then entered into an Anarchy Battle Royal to determine the number one contender for the Television Championship, but both Coates and Matthews were simultaneously eliminated and Matthews began showing affection towards her. On December 29, Matthews publicly declared his affection towards Coates before she struck him in response. The angle between the two continued until Matthews' tag team partner Brodie Chase revealed that he and Coates were together, turning Chase heel in the process.

He served as the president of Chile between 1876 and 1881. Early life He was born in Santiago de Chile, the son of former Chilean president General Francisco Antonio Pinto and of Luisa Garmendia Aldurralde. He completed his studies at the Colegio Argentino de Santiago and the Instituto Nacional. At the age of 20, he joined the foreign service, and was posted as under-secretary to the Chilean Legation to the Holy See. He returned to Chile two years later, in 1850. Two years later, he was elected to the lower house of congress, and was reelected several times. Later, he became a Senator and, in 1861, was named Intendant of Concepci√≥n, position that he held for 10 years. There he married Delfina de la Cruz Za√±artu, daughter of General Jos√© Mar√≠a de la Cruz Prieto and Josefa Za√±artu Trujillo. In 1871, President Err√°zuriz named him minister of war and navy, and, from that position, became one of the contenders for the presidential nomination. He first defeated Miguel Luis Amun√°tegui in the liberal primaries, and later Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a in the presidential elections. Administration His government started under the weight of the worst Chilean economic crisis of the 19th century. This was made worse by the floods of 1876, that laid waste to the nascent infrastructure. An earthquake on May 9, 1877, completed the destruction. At this juncture, he declared the non-convertibility of the currency, a measure that prevented a run on the banks and saved the public credit, but caused him the enmity of the opposition. In 1878, he named Vi√±a del Mar as a commune. Nonetheless, the principal crisis of his administration was the outbreak of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia. He managed to successfully face the first onslaught, at the same time, achieving the all-important Argentinian neutrality. On July 23, 1881, he signed a treaty with Argentina recognising Argentine sovereignty on eastern Patagonia and Eastern Tierra del Fuego but keeping the Strait of Magellan and western Tierra del Fuego under Chilean control. He also managed to obtain the capture of Antofagasta and Tarapac√° and used these territories as new sources of revenue to finance the rest of the war. Later life After his retirement from politics, a debt that he had personally guaranteed forced him to sell all his property, having to move to a very modest house near Victoria square, in Valpara√≠so. Though he was offered the position of senator or different embassies in Europe, he decided to make do working as a translator for the railroad companies. He died in Valpara√≠so in 1884.

Suborder Phacopina, p. O461. In: Moore, R.C. (ed.). Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Part O ‚Äì Arthropoda (Trilobitomorpha). 1959 comprise a suborder of the trilobite order Phacopida.

Part O ‚Äì Arthropoda (Trilobitomorpha). 1959 The one unique feature that distinguishes Phacopina from all other trilobites are the very large, separately set lenses without a common cornea of the compound eye.  Habitat  As far as known, all Phacopina species were marine bottom-dwellers.  Origin  The Early Ordovician genus Gyrometopus (superfamily Dalmanitoidea, family Diaphanometopidae) is probably close to the common ancestor of the Phacopina. Gyrometopus is phacopid in appearance, but a rostral plate is present, unlike in other Phacopina. However, the rostral plate does not divide the cephalic doublure into a left and right section, but instead the rostral suture defines a semicircle in the frontal ¬æ of the doublure.Jaanusson, V. Evolutionary processes leading to the trilobite suborder Phacopina. Fossils and Strata 4:209‚Äì218, fig. 1‚Äì5. 1975  Description  Zeliszkella torrubiae, a dalmanitid, exhibiting 10 thorax segmentsThe eyes (if present) consist of very large (0.07mm in Tricopelta breviceps to 0.5mm in Phacops rana), separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes). However, some Phacopina species lack eyes, such as the species of the genus Ductina.Ductina vietnamica, a phacopid that lacks eyes The natural fracture lines (sutures) of the head run along the top edges of the compound eye. From the back of the eye these cut to the side of the head (proparian) and not to the back. In front of the eye, the right and left facial sutures connect in front of the inflated glabella and consequently the free cheeks (or librigenae) are yoked as a single piece. The part of the skeleton that is ‚Äòtucked under‚Äô (the doublure) has no sutures crossing it to form a rostral plate. The thorax has 11 (rarely 10) segments, the side lobes (or pleurae) are furrowed, and the articulating facets distinct.Richter, R. Crustacea (Pal√§ontologie). 1933Whittington, H. B. et al.

He served as the president of Chile between 1881 and 1886. Early life He was born in Santiago de Chile, the son of Luis Jos√© Santa Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez and Ana Josefa Gonz√°lez Morand√©. He completed his early studies in the Instituto Nacional, and graduated as a lawyer from the Universidad de Chile in 1847. Soon after, he became a clerk at the Justice Ministry, where he rose to become Official Mayor. At the same time, he became the secretary of the Sociedad del Orden (Society for Public Order), a liberal club opposed to the conservative party. Political career At the age of 23, he became Intendant of Colchagua. His active intervention in rigging elections in favor of the conservatives made him into the principal target of the opposition. Two years later, he was asked to resign by his superiors. His refusal sparked his destitution by Manuel Montt. At that point, he joined Montt's opposition and joined the liberal party, participating actively in the 1851 revolution. In 1856, during the clash between the government and the church due to the \\"verger problem\\" he joined the opposition to the church, a position that would eventually carry to the extreme during his administration. In 1858, he was elected to the lower house of congress and a year later, he was forced into exile in Europe as a result of the 1859 revolution. After his return, he remained aloof from politics. He became an attorney of the Appellate Court of Santiago. During the Chincha Islands War, he became a champion for Americanism and his articles made him a public figure. After the war, he returned to politics as member of the lower house, raising to become vice-president of the chamber. He was also a diplomat and was named full member of the Appellate Court and a State Counsellor. In March 1879, he was elected senator. When the War of the Pacific broke out, he was named Minister of Foreign Affairs and soon after, Minister of the Interior. From that position, he had almost total control over the direction of the war and as such became one of the main people responsible for the victory. Administration At this point in Santa Mar√≠a's career, he became the natural heir to President Pinto. Although General Manuel Baquedano was also touted as a candidate, Baquedano's resignation left Santa Mar√≠a as the consensus candidate. He was elected president in 1881. During his administration, he continued the War of the Pacific to its end. He managed the capture of Lima and forced Peru to sign the Treaty of Ancon (October 29, 1883), putting an end to war. He also wrote the peace treaty with Bolivia in 1884, basis for the future peace Treaty of 1904. In the domestic front, his main fight was against the power of the Catholic Church. He forced through congress the laws of civil marriage, civil registry and public cemeteries, all of which were functions formerly in the hands of the Church. His actions led to a break in diplomatic relations with Rome. He also put an end to the Pacification of the Araucan√≠a, incorporating the area into the territory of Chile. He centralized the railroads into a state holding, inaugurated the first telephonic line between Santiago and Concepcion, and introduced the first public electric lighting. Santa Mar√≠a's presidency was also marked by increased electoral fraud and intervention in favor of the government liberals. In the parliamentary election of 1881, the conservatives refused to participate, except for Carlos Walker Mart√≠nez who was a candidate for deputy. The government went out of its way to prevent Walker's election and in a district with 20,000 voters there were 34,000 votes. The opposition did manage to elect a few anti-government liberals and radicals. In 1885, the electoral fight was much more violent and the conservatives were determined to oppose fraud. Fights between government supporters and detractors left many dead or wounded and there were numerous reports of votes being stolen by government officials. Santa Mar√≠a, far from denying he participated in fraud, openly admitted it. \\"I have been called authoritarian. [...] Giving away the votes to unworthy people, to the irrational passions of the parties, and even with universal suffrage, is suicide for a ruler, and I will not commit suicide before a chimera. I can see this well and I will impose myself to govern as well as I can and I will support as many liberal laws as are presented to prepare the ground for a future democracy. Hear me well: future democracy,\\" he once said. On another occasion, he simply admitted, \\"I have been called an interventor [of elections]. I am. I belong to the old guard and if I participate in intervention it is because I want an effective, disciplined Parliament that collaborates with the government's work for the common good. I have experience and know where I'm going. I cannot let the theorists undo what Portales, Bulnes, Montt, and Err√°zuriz have done.\\" Later life He assured the election of his prot√©g√© and political heir, Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda. After he stepped down, he continued his work as President of the Senate. He died of a heart attack on July 18, 1889.

Balmaceda was part of the Castilian-Basque aristocracy in Chile. While he was president, his political disagreements with the Chilean congress led to the 1891 Chilean Civil War, following which he shot and killed himself. Early life Balmaceda was born in Bucalemu, the eldest of the 12 children of Manuel Jos√© Balmaceda Ballesteros and Encarnaci√≥n Fern√°ndez Salas. His parents were wealthy, and in his early days he was chiefly concerned in industrial and agricultural enterprises. In 1849, he attended the School of the French Friars, and considered joining the clergy, studying several years of theology at the Santiago Seminary. In 1864 he became secretary to Manuel Montt, who was one of the representatives of the Chilean government at the general South American congress at Lima, and after his return obtained great distinction as an orator in the national assembly. In 1868 he joined forces with Justo and Domingo Arteaga Alemparte to found and publish the newspaper \\"La Libertad\\" (Freedom). He also was a constant contributor to the \\"Revista de Santiago\\", and published two monographs: \\"The political solution in electoral freedom\\" and \\"Church and State\\". In 1869 he joined the Club de la Reforma, which became the political basis of the Liberal Party. The essential tenets of the political program were freedom of religion, increased personal and political freedom, elimination of governmental intervention in the electoral process, reform of the 1833 constitution and restriction of the powers of the President. On the basis of this radical program, he was elected Deputy for Carelmapu several times: 1864‚Äì1867; 1870‚Äì1873; 1873‚Äì1876; 1876‚Äì1879; 1879‚Äì1882. Under President An√≠bal Pinto, he discharged some diplomatic missions abroad, and is credited with persuading Argentina not to join the War of the Pacific in 1878. In 1882 he was re-elected both for Carelmapu and Santiago. He decided to accept neither and became instead successively Minister of Foreign Affairs and Colonization and of the Interior under the presidency of Domingo Santa Mar√≠a. In the latter capacity he carried compulsory civil marriage and several other laws highly obnoxious to the conservatives and the clergy. Balmaceda was also elected a Senator for Coquimbo (1882‚Äì1888). He was proclaimed a candidate to the presidency on the Odeon Theater of Valpara√≠so on January 17, 1886, with the support of the Nacional, Liberal and part of the Radical Parties. On June 25 he was elected President as sole candidate. Presidency Meeting of notables in the Theater of Santiago with President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda of Nicol√°s Guzm√°n Bustamante Balmaceda became President of Chile in 1886. His election was bitterly opposed by the Conservatives and dissident Liberals, but was finally achieved by the official influence of President Domingo Santa Mar√≠a. On assuming office President Balmaceda endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation of all sections of the Liberal Party in Congress and so form a solid majority to support the administration, and to this end he nominated representatives of the different political groups as ministers. Six months later the cabinet was reorganized, and two of the most bitter opponents of his election were accorded portfolios. But despite his great capacity, Balmaceda's imperious temper little fitted him for the post. Balmaceda instituted wide- reaching reforms, believing that he had now secured the support of the majority in Congress for any measures he decided to put forward. The new President initiated an unparalleled policy of heavy expenditure on public works, school building, and the strengthening of the naval and military forces of the republic. Contracts were given out to the value of ¬£6,000,000 for the construction of railways in the southern districts; some $10,000,000 dollars were expended in the erection of schools and colleges; three cruisers and two seagoing torpedo boats were added to the Navy; the construction of the naval port at Talcahuano was actively pushed forward; new armament was purchased for the infantry and artillery branches of the Army, and heavy guns were acquired for permanently and strongly fortifying the ports of Valpara√≠so, Talcahuano, and Iquique. In itself this policy was not unreasonable, and in many ways extremely beneficial for the country. Unfortunately corruption crept into the expenditure of the large sums involved. Contracts were given by favour and not by merit, and the progress made in the construction of the new public works was far from satisfactory. The opposition in Congress to President Balmaceda began to increase rapidly towards the close of 1887, and further gained ground in 1888. In order to ensure a majority favourable to his views, the President threw the whole weight of his official influence into the elections for Senators and Deputies in 1888; but many of the members returned to the chambers through this official influence joined the opposition shortly after taking their seats. =Conflict with Congress= In 1889 Congress became distinctly hostile to the administration of President Balmaceda, and the political situation became grave, and at times threatened to involve the country in civil war. According to usage and custom in Chile at the time, a ministry (the set of ministers) did not remain in office unless supported by a majority in the chambers. Balmaceda now found himself in the impossible position of being unable to appoint ministers that would be supported by a majority in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and at the same time be in accordance with his policies. At this juncture the President assumed that the constitution gave him the power of nominating and maintaining in office any ministers he might consider fitting persons for the purpose, and that Congress had no right of interference in the matter. President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda The chambers were now only waiting for a suitable opportunity to assert their authority. In 1890 it was stated that President Balmaceda had determined to nominate and cause to be elected as his successor in 1891 one of his own personal friends. This question of the election of another President brought matters to a head, and Congress refused to vote any funds to carry on the government. To avoid trouble Balmaceda entered into a compromise with Congress, and agreed to nominate a ministry to their liking on condition that the supplies for 1890 were voted. This cabinet, however, was of short duration, and resigned when the ministers understood the full amount of friction between the President and Congress. Balmaceda then nominated a ministry not in accord with the views of Congress, under Claudio Vicu√±a, whom it was no secret that Balmaceda intended to be his successor in the presidential chair. To prevent any expression of opinion upon his conduct in the matter, he refrained from summoning an extraordinary session of the legislature for discussion of the estimates of revenue and expenditure for 1891. =Civil war= When January 1, 1891 arrived, the president published a decree in the to the effect that the budget of 1890 would be considered the official budget for 1891. This act was illegal and exceeded the authority of executive power. In response to the action of President Balmaceda, the vice- president of the Senate, Waldo Silva, and the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Ram√≥n Barros Luco, issued a proclamation appointing Captain Jorge Montt as commander of the Navy, and stating that the Navy could not recognize the authority of Balmaceda so long as he did not administer public affairs in accordance with the constitutional law of Chile. The majority of the members of the chambers sided with this movement, and signed an Act of Deposition of President Balmaceda. On 7 January Waldo Silva, Barros Luco, and a number of senators and deputies embarked on the Chilean warship \\"\\" accompanied by the \\"Esmeralda\\" and \\"O'Higgins\\" and other vessels, and sailed out of Valparaiso harbor and proceeded northwards to Tarapac√° to organize armed resistance against the president, launching the civil war. This act in defiance of Congress was not the only issue that brought about the revolution. Balmaceda had alienated the aristocratic classes of Chile with his personal vanity and ambition and soon after his election was irreconcilably at odds with the majority of the national representatives. The oligarchy composed of the great landowners had always been an important factor in the political life of the republic; when President Balmaceda found himself outside this circle he endeavored to govern without their support, and to bring into the administration a group of people outside the inner circles of political power, whom he could easily control. Clerical influence also turned against him as a result of his radically secular ideas about government. On 23 May 1891, London Times correspondent in Chile Maurice Hervey alleged British intervention as having been key to the overthrow of Balmaceda, writing, \\"Beyond the possibility of contradiction, the instigators, the wire-pullers, the financial supporters of the so called revolution were and are the English or Anglo Chilean owners of the nitrate deposits of the Tarapac√°.\\" Aftermath After Balmaceda's forces were overwhelmed and destroyed in the Battle of La Placilla, it was clear that he could no longer hope to find a sufficient strength amongst his adherents to maintain himself in power, and in view of the rapid approach of the rebel army, he abandoned his official duties to seek an asylum in the Argentine legation. On August 29, he officially handed power to General Manuel Baquedano, who maintained order in Santiago until the arrival of the congressional leaders on August 30. The president remained concealed in the Argentine legation until September 19. On the morning of that date, one day after the anniversary of his elevation to the presidency and when the term for which he had been elected president of the republic terminated, he shot and killed himself, rather than surrender to the new government. His reason for this act, put forward in letters written shortly before his end, was that he did not believe the conquerors would give him an impartial trial. The death of Balmaceda finished all cause of contention in Chile, and was the closing act of the most severe and bloodiest struggle that the country had ever witnessed.

Description  Schizochroal eye of Phacops rana'Ductina vietnamica, a phacopid that lacks eyesLike in all Phacopina, the eyes (if present) consist of very large (0.5mm in Phacops rana), separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes). However, several phacopids have very few lenses, such as the species of the genera Cryphops, Denckmannites, Dienstina, Eucryphops, Nephranops, and Plagiolaria, or lack eyes altogether, like Afrops, Dianops, Ductina, and Trimerocephalus. The natural fracture lines (sutures) of the head run along the top edges of the compound eye. From the back of the eye these cut to the side of the head (proparian) and not to the back. In front of the eye, the right and left facial sutures connect in front of the inflated glabella and consequently the free cheeks (or librigenae) are yoked as a single piece. In some of the eyeless genera (Ductina) the suture coincides with the marginal suture, and thus appears to be absent. The part of the skeleton that is \\"tucked under\\" (the doublure) has no sutures crossing it to form a rostral plate. The thorax has 11 (rarely 10) segments, the side lobes (or pleurae) are furrowed, and the articulating facets distinct. The tailshield (or pygidium) is always smaller than the headshield (or cephalon), a situation called micropygous. In the Phacopidae a merger of the anterior and the two pairs of neighbouring lobes of the glabella forms a frontal lobe that expands forward and can be inflated and overhanging the frontal border. To the back of the glabella two furrows (or sometimes one) cross the glabella forming two rings (\\"intercalating ring\\" and \\"occipital ring\\"). The cephalon does not end in genal spines. The side lobes of the thorax (or pleurae, singular pleura) have rounded ends. The pygidium is well rounded, semicircular or shorter, with an entire margin, and without lateral and posterior projections. In many Phacopidae, where the facial sutures are apparently continuous and well developed, they were evidently nonfunctional in ecdysis, since no separate free cheeks can be found.  Taxonomy  The Phacopinae likely have evolved from the Pterygometopidae, and the presumed sister taxon is Podowrinella.  Distribution  The earliest species and the only one known from the Ordovician (upper Katian) is Sambremeusaspis fossesensis. The Phacopidae became a prominent family during the Silurian and had an enormous taxonomic diversity during the Devonian.

Phacops is often found rolled up (\\"volvation\\"), a biological defense mechanism that is widespread among smaller trilobites but further perfected in this genus.  Description  Like in all sighted Phacopina, the eyes of Phacops are compounded of very large, separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes), and like almost all other Phacopina, the articulate mid-length part of the body (or thorax) in Phacops has 11 segments. The central raised area (or glabella) of the headshield (or cephalon) is moderately to strongly inflated near to its front, more or less flattened on the top, falling vertically to or slightly overhanging the border furrow. Up to three lateral furrows may be discernable on the glabella behind the utterly dominating frontal lobe. From the back there is a very distinct occipital ring, and in front of that a distinct preoccipital ring which is weakly divided into a strongly convex central lobe and weakly convex lateral lobes. The large to medium size eyes have a crescent shaped outline, and are elevated high above the cheeks. The steep visual surface is kidney shaped. The back corners of the cephalon (or genal angles) are acutely to bluntly rounded, but a genal spine is lacking in adults. In the ventral surface of the seam (or doublure) is in the frontal half of the cephalon a continuous furrow, delineated by ridges, and with notches laterally. This so-called vindicular furrow serves to lock the rim of the tailshield to the headshield when the trilobite is enrolled. The axial rings of the thorax do not have convex lateral axial nodes on its outer surface. The tailshield (or pygidium) is well segmented. The pygidial axis has 9 to 11 rings, and the pleural areas to the sides have 5 to 8 pairs of recognizable ribs. Furrows between the ribs are deep, those that divide each rib in frontal and rear bands are very shallow, and the frontal bands are widest. The surface of the exoskeleton is covered in tubercles. = Camouflage = Reconstruction of Phacops with a speculative, cryptic \\"Rorschach\\" pattern based on the proposed ability to camouflage. There are specimens known of Phacops rana with many irregular black spots. Because similar spots in a specimen of Greenops boothi from the same site are arranged in rows, it may be assumed that they are original and not caused by the fossilisation process. The spots are irregular and have spurs branching outwardly, similar to the melanophores in many extant animals. In one specimen, the black spots are much larger than in another one. It is quite conceivable that changing the size of the melanophores enabled Phacops rana to camouflage itself in different environments.  Taxonomy  Enrolled P. rana from the Mahantango Formation, Pennsylvania The concept of many fossil taxa has been tightened over time, including Phacops. As a result, Boeckops, Chotecops, Paciphacops, Prokops and Viaphacops have been erected as subgenera of Phacops, and are now widely regarded as genera in their own right. Most recent, it was considered that some North-American and North-African species on the one hand and European species on the other hand differ sufficiently from each other to be assigned to separate genera. As the type species is the European P. latifrons, the North-American species are now called Eldredgeops. However, the previous assigned species, like Phacops rana, are still widely used among fossil collectors. Eldredgeops has a raised ridge along the ventral margin of the cephalon, the glabella is more inflated, the lateral parts of the preoccipital ring are not round but rectangular, the palpebral area and palpebral lobe are larger than in P. latifrons, and there is no fold right behind the posterior vertical row of lenses, nor an isolated raised area just below the lenses. Not all of these characters may differentiate between Eldredgeops and other Phacops species however. During the Eifelian in the present-day Belgian Ardennes, several Phacops species developed from each other, the oldest being P. imitator, followed by P. fragosus, then P. latifrons and finally P. sartenaeri. These species show a decrease in the number of lenses, which is a more widespread and recurring trend in many Phacopinae.

Early life Germ√°n Riesco (1875). He was born in Rancagua, the son of Mauricio Riesco, a Spanish merchant and of Carlota Err√°zuriz Za√±artu, sister of President Federico Err√°zuriz Za√±artu, of Basque descent. He studied at the Seminario Conciliar and at the University of Chile. At the age of 17 (four years before graduating as a lawyer) he obtained his first public job as a clerk at the ministry of Justice, in order to help support financially his family. He graduated as a lawyer on April 19, 1875, and was promoted to chief clerk at the ministry in 1880. The same year he married his cousin, Mar√≠a Err√°zuriz Echaurren, thus becoming brother-in-law to future president Federico Err√°zuriz Echaurren. He became clerk of the Appeals Court of Santiago in 1891, and clerk of the Supreme Court in 1897. He retired from the judiciary in 1898, to dedicate himself to private practice. Presidency Germ√°n Riesco's first incursion in politics was when elected as a senator for Talca in 1900. After the sudden death of president Federico Err√°zuriz Echaurren and due to the proximity of the presidential elections, he was proclaimed candidate by the Liberal Alliance, on March 8, 1901. This alliance was formed by the radicals, the democrats, the Balmacedists and the liberals, even though Riesco Err√°zuriz was more of a Conservative. From the beginning his candidacy was strongly opposed by the clerical-conservative groups. Their newspaper El Porvenir led a campaign accusing him of being a \\"threat against religion\\". Nonetheless, he was elected by a huge majority of votes, thanks mainly to the fact that he had almost no political exposure, since most of his life had been spent in the judiciary. Himself summarized his appeal by saying that he wasn't a threat to anybody. He assumed on September 18, 1901. =Public policies= President Riesco (1906) As president Riesco was faced with crippling parliamentary divisions. He was forced to appoint no fewer than 17 different governments, each lasting an average of just three and a half months. Even though he had been elected with the support of the Liberal Alliance, he was deserted by them and had to seek the support of the Conservative Coalition (his former opponents). In the end, he had to switch back and forth between both groups in order to complete his term. The result was that since he lacked a congressional majority of his own, he was forced to name caretaker ministers, lacking efficacy or permanence. As a former member of the judiciary, his principal efforts were channeled towards legal reforms. He managed to establish a new Code of Civil Procedure (1902) which is still in force today, and a Code of Penal Procedure (1906), which lasted almost 100 years. In 1905 he began construction of the new building for the Supreme Court, that was finished in 1911. He concluded several important public works, such as the sewers for the city of Santiago and the new network of electrical trams. He greatly expanded the secondary education, specially for women, and doubled the number of Normal Schools for the preparation of new teachers. Due to the rising inflation, he was forced to refuse a return to the metallic conversion, and to authorize a new emission of paper money. This measure caused a dramatic fall in the exchange rates and higher inflation, which in turn gave way to higher social unrest. =International situation= On the international stage, at the end of 1901, Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war, due to border disputes. There was an ongoing naval arms race, and both countries called their reserve soldiers. Nonetheless, diplomacy prevailed, and both countries signed the May Treaties on May 28, 1902, followed by arbitration on Patagonia, on November 20 of the same year. These treaties were complemented by the union of the telegraphic lines of both countries, with commonality of tariffs. He signed a final peace treaty with Bolivia on October 20, 1904, putting an official end to the War of the Pacific. He also re-established the diplomatic relations with Peru in 1906, in order to move ahead on the solution of the Tacna and Arica controversy; and gave the first impulse to establishing a claim to Antarctica, by issuing a law regimenting seal-hunting there. Social unrest President Riesco, accompanied by Abdon Cifuentes, leaves congress (1906) During his administration, the so-called \\"social question\\" suddenly became critical. Between 1903 and 1905, there were a great many strikes in different areas: miners, ship-loaders and railroad workers in the north of the country; house-painters, tanners, postal workers, policemen, garbage collectors and bus drivers in Santiago; coal miners in La Calera, Lebu, Lota and Coronel, ship-loaders in Valpara√≠so; most of which ended in deaths and injuries of the protesters. =Meat riots= On October 22, 1905, some of the poorest people in Santiago organized a march to protest for the high price of meat. The price of meat was kept artificially high by the government, by means of the combination of a special tariff applied to cattle imports from Argentina, in order to protect the domestic producers, and high inflation. These factors put the price of the product beyond the financial means of a high percent of the population. By the time that the march arrived peacefully to La Moneda and asked for an audience with President Riesco, it had already swelled to about 25 to 30 thousand people. The people started to grow impatient when the president didn't appear, and when the police tried to dissolve them, they fought back and tried to storm the presidential palace. The police responded by shooting at the crowd, and riots ensued. The violence lasted for almost a week, with widespread riots and looting, in what was called the Meat riots or the red week. Between 200 and 250 protesters were killed over this period. This revolt emphasized that the social problems were far more serious than what the authorities believed. =Antofagasta general strike= A few months later, a similar revolt took place in Antofagasta. The workers that were laying the rails for the Antofagasta-Bolivia railroad presented a letter of demands to management, that was completely refused by the company. As a result, a general strike was called. The previous experience with the Meat riots alerted the government, that decided to send in the Esmeralda regiment and the cruise-ship Blanco Encalada to reinforce the local forces. On February 6, 1906, approximately 3 thousand workers gathered in the public square of Antofagasta to protest in favor of his demands. The troops opened fire on the unarmed workers, causing approximately 58 deaths and more than 300 injured. Valparaiso earthquake The earthquake had been announced ten days earlier by the chief of the Navy Metheorological Office. August 16, 1906 started as a very clear day, but in the afternoon started to drizzle. As the sun was setting, and when most of the people were having their suppers, came the first shock. It lasted for about 4 minutes. After the first shock, people started to look for survivors. After approximately fifteen minutes, the second shock hit the port. This one was shorter, approximately a minute, but far stronger than the first one. It completed the destruction of the city and caused most of the victims. Most of the city was leveled, and some looting happened. The governor decreed martial law and any looter caught in the act was shot immediately. With the total interruption of the communications, the city was isolated. The first news arrived to Santiago (located only 120 kilometers inland) on the afternoon of the 17. Three days later, on the 20, the ministers of Interior and War managed to arrive to the port. President Riesco and the newly elected Pedro Montt arrived on the 25. They had to travel by train, on foot and by horseback in order to arrive to the destroyed port. He died in Santiago, at the age of 62, on December 8, 1916, of a heart ailment.

The episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 4 June 2005. It was written by executive producer Russell T Davies and directed by Joe Ahearne. The episode is set in Cardiff in the early 21st century, six months after the 2005 episode \\"World War Three\\". In the episode, the criminal alien Slitheen named \\"Margaret Blaine\\" (Annette Badland) attempts to gain her freedom after being captured and detained by the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston). \\"Boom Town\\" was a replacement episode for a story that was to be written by Paul Abbott, but he had to abandon the script because he had other commitments. Davies decided to write a different story centred on bringing Badland's character back from the fourth and fifth episodes of the series, \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\", as he had enjoyed her performances. Primarily, Davies wanted to explore the consequences of the Doctor's actions and question whether he had the right to sentence an enemy to death. The episode was also intended to showcase Cardiff, where the revived Doctor Who series is made, and where the episode was filmed in February 2005. \\"Boom Town\\" was watched by 7.68 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics. Plot The plans for the new nuclear power plant, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition. The Ninth Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, using the energy of the Cardiff Rift to recharge the engines of the time machine. Mickey joins the Doctor, Rose, and Jack for lunch. The Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Blaine to find out what she is doing there. The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains an \\"extrapolator\\" that Blaine would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Blaine back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Blaine makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then asks him to take her to another planet instead. Jack begins integrating the extrapolator into the TARDIS to speed up the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he claims to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him. Before Rose can answer whether she will come back to Mickey, Cardiff is struck by a large earthquake that is coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Blaine, Rose, and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Blaine takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Blaine in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Blaine's human suit is empty except for an egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Blaine wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Blaine can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye. She runs out to look for him, but finds he has gone. =Continuity= The Rift was established earlier in the series in \\"The Unquiet Dead\\". Margaret says that as a child she was threatened with being fed to venom grubs; these creatures appeared in the First Doctor serial The Web Planet (1965). Production Slitheen Model shown at the Doctor Who Experience The episode featured the Millennium Centre and Cardiff Bay predominantly According to an interview with executive producer and episode writer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Magazine, this episode was originally offered to his friend and former colleague, the critically acclaimed and award-winning scriptwriter Paul Abbott. Abbott accepted and submitted a storyline, revealing that Rose had been bred by the Doctor as an experiment in creating a perfect companion. The episode was titled \\"The Void\\". However, Abbot had to abandon the project due to other commitments. Davies wrote \\"Boom Town\\" instead, bringing back Badland as Blaine due to her performance in \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\" being \\"brilliant\\", though she had few lines. The actor playing Mr Cleaver, William Thomas, had previously appeared as Martin the undertaker in the 1988 classic series story Remembrance of the Daleks. This made him the first performer to appear in both the original and current run of Doctor Who.Burk and Smith? p. 46 He later played Geraint Cooper, the father of Gwen Cooper, in the Doctor Who spinoff series Torchwood. Davies stated that he originally intended to call this episode \\"Dining with Monsters\\". He joked that a much better name for this episode would be \\"What should we do with Margaret?\\" Davies intended the episode to be a character piece exploring whether the Doctor had the authority to take someone to their death sentence, as well as showing the consequences of the Doctor's actions the last time he met Margaret. The storyline was fitting for Eccleston's war- torn Doctor. The consequences of the Doctor's lifestyle is also explored through Rose's boyfriend Mickey, who has been forced to move on because she is not around. The resolution is a deliberate deus ex machina, regressing Margaret so she can start anew, although Davies remarked that the resolution did not come completely out of nowhere as the TARDIS' psychic link had been already established. Much of \\"Boom Town\\" was filmed on Cardiff Bay, with one scene in particular in front of the Millennium Centre, in February 2005. The Doctor is seen reading the Welsh newspaper Western Mail; Davies stated that he wanted to incorporate Welsh culture because the series is made in Wales and contains a lot of Welsh crew members. He also wanted to show off how beautiful the area could be. The night shoot of Rose and Mickey in front of the water tower at Roald Dahl Plass had to be extended to two nights because it was below the temperature at which the fountain automatically shuts off. The dinner scene between the Doctor and Margaret was filmed in January 2005 at the Cardiff restaurant Bistro 10 before the rest of the episode was filmed; Eccleston filmed the scene while Piper and Barrowman were filming scenes for \\"The Empty Child\\". This was due to scheduling conflicts with Badland. Some of the schedule was also rearranged because of the death of Piper's uncle, resulting in her and Eccleston being replaced by doubles during some scenes near the end of the episode. The egg Margaret turns into was a reused prop from the second episode, \\"The End of the World\\". Broadcast and reception \\"Boom Town\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2005 on BBC One. The episode received overnight ratings of 7.13 million viewers, a 36.95% audience share and an increase over the past two weeks. When final ratings were calculated, the figure rose to 7.68 million. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 82. SFX described \\"Boom Town\\" as a \\"format-breaking episode\\". The reviewer acknowledged that it \\"certainly misfires on some levels, and leaves various elements underdeveloped\\", but praised the moral dilemma, including the dinner scene. However, the conclusion with Margaret being reverted to an egg was seen as a \\"little too handy and provides the Doctor with a moral get-out clause\\", and the Rose and Mickey subplot was called \\"weak\\" due to the lack of evidence he and Rose were ever close. Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of B+, writing that it \\"sacrifices a bit of plot and logic\\" for a good exploration of the characters and plot threads. He praised the dialogue and Murray Gold's score. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan was more negative, feeling that it \\"really didn't work\\", calling bringing back Margaret a \\"poor idea\\", and he criticised the pace for dragging too much. In 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times particularly praised Badland and the dinner scene, though he described the whole episode as a \\"peculiar short-story, a low-cal filler sandwiched between the dramatic juggernauts of Steven Moffat's Doctor Who debut and Russell T Davies's dazzling finale.\\" The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of B, noting that it required more suspension of belief than usual. He felt that the plot was included out of necessity while the episode was more focused on character moments, and that this did not work as well as \\"Father's Day\\" because Margaret's fate was \\"less clearly motivated.\\" On the other hand, Wilkins called Rose and Mickey's subplot the most effectively handled part of \\"Boom Town\\". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, author Robert Smith? called the episode \\"highly entertaining\\" and \\"thoughtful\\", despite not being well-plotted with an \\"unsatisfying\\" deus ex machina ending. He praised the character material and comedy.Burk and Smith? pp.48‚Äì50 His coauthor Graeme Burk was less enthusiastic, describing it as \\"nothing more\\" than a \\"fun romp\\". He felt that there were many good scenes but \\"no real story\\", and pointed out how the moral dilemma did not matter because the decision does not end up being in the Doctor's hands.Burk and Smith? p. 50 References =Bibliography= External links *UNIT Press Statement - \\"Cardiff Earthquake\\" *Doctor Who Confidential ‚Äî Episode 11: Unsung Heroes and Violent Death * Ninth Doctor episodes Slitheen television stories 2005 British television episodes Television shows written by Russell T Davies Doctor Who stories set on Earth Television episodes set in Cardiff ","title":"Boom Town (Doctor Who)"},{"id":"1851017","text":"Dalmanites is a genus of trilobite in the order Phacopida. They lived from the Late Ordovician to Middle Devonian. The trilobites of this genus have slightly convex exoskeletons with an average length of . The cephalon is semicircular or parabolic. The glabella (center portion of the head) is often pear-shaped, and tapers outward toward the front. The glabella also always contains three pairs of obvious glabellar furrows. Also prominent are the large mosaic (schizochroal) eyes. The thorax is composed of eleven segments, with the relatively large pygidium with a slender axis of 11 to 16 rings and 6 or 7 pleural ribs.

Its headshield (or cephalon) is semicircular, with robust (genal) spines extending from the side of the cephalon back to approximately the 8th thorax segment. The frontal margin of the cephalon is semicircular to parabolic, and it may have a simple and short anterior extension. The facial suture lies inside or touches the preglabellar furrow. The frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is much wider than the other lobes. The frontal lobe is vaulted. The eye is moderate to large, about half as long as the cheek. The \\"seem\\" that is visible from the ventral side (or doublure) is wide and flat, and has a deep and wide antennal furrow. The \\"palate\\" (or hypostome), also only visible from the ventral side, is subtriangular (about as long as wide) and adorned with three weak denticles at its back rim. To the front the hypostome has weak wings extending sideways. The thorax consists of 11 segments. The tips of the segments are pointed and angle back increasingly from about 30¬∞ for the anterior segment to slightly pointing inwards for the posterior segment. The tailshield (or pygidium) is large, subtriangular, and about ‚Öî-¬æ√ó as long as wide. The axis is vaulted and ¬±35% of the width of the pygidium and consists of 12-15 rings. 9‚Äì10 deep and wide pleural furrows have flat or only slightly concave bottoms. The furrows within each pleural rib (or interpleural furrows) are very narrow. The frontal band of each pleural rib is more vaulted and broader than the rear band. The pleural furrows almost reach the margin. The pygidial termination (or mucro) is vaulted and more or less pointed into a spine, which may differ between species. The entire exoskeleton is covered in fine and coarse granules.

They were raised by Rem, who instilled upon Vash the philosophy that every being deserves life, and Vash now takes this to the extreme by always attempting to save everyone. Knives on the other hand, sickened by the actions of the humans around him, caused the fleet to crash, which killed Rem and many others. Vash has made it his purpose to hunt down and stop Knives from harming anyone else. Vash was forced to destroy the city of July during one of his confrontations with Knives, which haunts him considerably and starts his reputation. Due to his overly exaggerated reputation, Vash usually acts the fool in order to make people feel comfortable and to hide his identity. He frequently voices the catchphrase, \\"This world is made of love and peace,\\" which is usually complemented by his flashing of the v sign. However, when those around him are threatened, Vash shows complete focus and control. Because Vash refuses to kill his opponents, he often suffers at the hands of his very persistent enemies. As a result, his body is a patchwork of large scars and chunks of missing flesh supported by metal mesh. In the anime, Vash lost his left arm during the conflict in July. In Volume 12 of the Trigun Maximum manga, it is revealed in a flashback that it was severed by Knives in retaliation for Vash shooting him in the shoulder after Knives massacred an entire town. It is later replaced by a cybernetic arm that contains an integrated gun. Vash says his full name is Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Sicidabohertz Gombigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent Pierre Andri Charton-Haymoss Ivanovici Baldeus George Doitzel Kaiser III, but this may just be another exaggerated joke. Vash's main weapon is the \\"Angel Arm,\\" a large cannon capable of destroying cities. The anime depicts it as a modified version of the Dan Wesson ppc 357, specially created by Knives to fuse with Vash and transform into the \\"Angel Arm\\" itself. In the manga however, it is shown as being a natural part of a Plant, with far greater versatility, capable of being manipulated into various forms other than a cannon. In the manga, it is powered by the life-force of its user, and using the power slowly causes Vash's life to drain, which causes his hair to slowly turn black. Vash later learns better control over his power, forming smaller cannons and defensive feathers, though his hair continues to grow darker until it becomes almost completely black. The anime, however, depicts no such restrictions. A recurring joke in the anime is that characters will facetiously mistake a cat for Vash. For example, when he and Wolfwood are eating, Vash disappears and a cat turns up in his place. This prompts Wolfwood to say \\"I always had my suspicions that you were no mere mortal, but I never imagined that you were actually a cat.\\" AnimeOnDVD describes Vash's character as \\"..running a gamut of emotions and attitudes (and shows off his way cool dancing moves) as well as a bit of what makes him the most feared person and worthy of the $$60,000,000,000 price on his head...\\"AnimeOnDVD - Trigun Vol. 1 Review In a review for Volume 5, the reviewer stated that the change in Vash's character; \\"..brings things to a different and more interesting level..\\"AnimeOnDVD - Trigun Vol 5 Review Vash's history was described as \\"..really interesting but they tend to have more questions asked than really answered.\\"AnimeOnDVD - Trigun Vol 6 Review T.H.E.M Anime Reviews say that Vash \\"...is the poster-child for the misunderstood hero..\\"T.H.E.M Anime Reviews - Trigun Various merchandise on Vash's appearance has been made including plush dolls,Amazon.com - Trigun: Vash 9\\" Plush Doll keychainsAmazon.com - Trigun: Vash 3.5\\" PVC Keychain & action figures.Amazon.com - Trigun: The Planet Gunsmoke, Vash the Stampede action figure IGN ranked Vash as the 17th top anime character of all time, praising his character design. =Meryl Stryfe= AKA \\"Derringer Meryl\\" and her junior coworker, Milly, are agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society sent to evaluate claims regarding Vash the Stampede. She's hotheaded and strong willed. Initially, she finds Vash to be a nuisance and dismisses the idea that he is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon. As time passes, she realizes that Vash isn't the villain that he is made out to be nor the buffoon that he presents himself to be. Gradually, she comes to respect Vash and love him deeply, though in the anime her love is more romantic than in the manga. Meryl eventually forms a special bond with him that allows her to overcome the obstacles that she is faced with. She hides dozens of derringer-style \\"throwaway\\" pistols under her traveling cape and is an excellent shot, although she rarely has occasion to use them. In the manga she becomes frightened of Vash's plant-like nature. At one point she sees his memories as a child growing up and struggling alone to the destruction of July City through his eyes. After Bernardelli shuts down while Knives is ravaging the planet, she and Milly assume support roles along with Brad and Luida to help combat Knives. At the end of the manga's story, the two become investigative reporters for the planet's first television broadcasting channel, continuing to follow Vash wherever he goes. =Milly Thompson= AKA \\"Stungun Milly\\" is a fellow Bernardelli agent, and friend and assistant to Meryl. Despite physically towering over Meryl, Milly looks up to her and always refers to her in a respectful manner. She appears rather simple, but has a kind heart and also reveals a strength of character and genuine optimism. Milly comes from a very large family, and writes huge masses of letters to them constantly (known as \\"The Milly Monthly\\"). Milly manages to hide a very heavy concussion gun, referred to as a \\"stun-gun\\", under her coat. The shots, which pop out into the shape of an X-shaped claw, are so powerful they can even knock over trucks. Although she does not have a relationship with Wolfwood in the manga, events after his death indicate that she might have had a romantic interest in him. In the anime, Milly spends the night with Wolfwood before his death and her reaction to the loss of Wolfwood in the anime is considerably greater than in the manga. The manga version of Milly has blond hair whereas the anime depiction has browner-colored hair. =Nicholas D. Wolfwood= , also known as Nicolas the Punisher, is a member of the Eye of Michael, an organization of assassins. After showing potential in the orphanage in which he was raised, Chapel trained and modified him, giving him enhanced abilities and the ability to regenerate from heavy injuries using special vials, though this causes him to age much faster than normal. He was given a special large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which contains two machine guns and a rocket launcher. In the anime one of the Punisher's unused arms is shown to contain a rack of pistols. Wolfwood later shoots Chapel and takes his place in the Gung-Ho Guns in an attempt to kill Knives. He fails to do so and is instead sent by Knives to protect Vash until he is able to meet him. After Vash is captured, Wolfwood rescues him and battles his childhood friend, Livio, and his master, now in a wheelchair. He manages to kill Chapel and defeat Livio as well as Livio's alternative personality, Razlo, but having overdosed on the regenerative vials, he soon dies while having a drink with Vash. In the anime, Wolfwood was raised by an abusive guardian, whom he later shoots and kills. He was taken in by Chapel, who trained him to be his successor. He meets Vash while he is stranded in the desert and the two join forces. Wolfwood's purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs, trying to keep other children from suffering as he did in his own childhood. He initially holds the ideals that he must kill, though he eventually comes to accept Vash's ideals. He eventually fights his master, but spares him after defeating him. Legato forces Chapel to shoot Wolfwood, who stumbles into a church and dies. Vash then takes his gun as an act of honor and uses it fighting against Knives. During the series, Wolfwood develops a relationship with Milly that crosses from close friendship into romance and him sleeping with her shortly before his death. =Millions Knives=Adult Millions Knives *Young Millions Knives is the main antagonist of the Trigun manga and anime and is one of the few fully sentient Plants and Vash's twin brother. They are both born during a mission to further the human race, and they are taken care of by Rem until Knives disrupts the course of the ships, causing them to crash. While Vash believes all beings have potential for good and deserve life, Knives believes in the survival of the fittest. After discovering experiments performed on other plants, he decides that humans are evil and grotesque, and that they need to be eradicated. Vash does not agree with his plans and seeks to stop him, and Knives seeks to dissuade Vash from basing his life around the \\"idealistic nonsense\\" preached by Rem. His character changes, even if slightly, from the manga to the anime; the manga version is shown to be apathetic towards humans but has a caring attitude with other Plants (as he mourns the death of Plants and even apologizes to one for his impulsiveness when \\"sacrificing all of those companions\\" when he was younger) and cares about Vash to the point of almost absorbing his twin brother so they can stop fighting and prevent his death. Before his general hatred, Knives is shown to be the most enthusiastic of the twins to interact with human beings, before the discovery of Tessla. In the anime, Knives evolves from an introverted child to a ruthless sociopath bent on exterminating all humans on the planet. Although he is the primary antagonist, he appears only in flashbacks for most of the series and only appears in person during the last few episodes. Acting on a tip from Wolfwood, Vash finds Knives at a desert oasis in the final episode, leading to a cataclysmic battle. They hold each other to a stalemate at first, but Knives gains the upper hand and tries to annihilate Vash with the power of both brothers' angel arms. Vash shoots him repeatedly, disabling him, then bandages his wounds and carries him back to the nearest town. His role is far more prominent in the manga. Many years after landing, the two meet in the city of July, and the face off leaves Vash without his left arm and Knives in a very critical state. He slowly regenerates over a period, and forms the Gung-Ho-Guns to act for him. After he revives and learns that he is slowly dying by using his abilities, he begins absorbing other plants into himself, which causes his powers to grow exponentially. After fusing with thousands of plants, Knives launches his \\"Ark\\", a floating ship designed to leave humans without any resources. As he absorbs more and more plants, his Ark takes on the form of a sentient organism, capable of defending itself and, in some cases, even teleporting short distances. Vash and Knives eventually fight for a final time, and after the battle, Knives saves Vash from the exploding Ark. After he brings Vash to safety, Knives uses the last of his power to make an apple-tree and then dies. =Legato Bluesummers= is a man who devotes himself to Knives, and makes it his main goal to have Vash experience eternal pain and suffering. He serves directly under Knives, which also gives him command of the Gung-Ho Guns. In the manga, Legato takes over while Knives is injured, and uses the Gung-Ho Guns to play a \\"game\\" with Vash. He gives Vash a case and each Gung-Ho Gun a half coin to place into it, stating to him that \\"something interesting will happen\\" after it is completed. After Knives recovers, Legato's body is crushed and his neck twisted for using the Gung-Ho Guns for his personal agenda. Legato is consequently restricted to a coffin-like container, which is carried by an ogre. Legato later gains a new coffin with metal appendages that allows limited movement. He eventually learns to use his threads to manipulate and strengthen his own body, and takes up a ball and chain weapon and a handgun to battle. He later fights Vash with the coin case completed and subsequently activated, which nullifies his threads, and loses. He then forces Vash to kill him by threatening to kill Livio. In the anime, Legato, recruited by Knives to make Vash's life a living hell, is placed as the leader of the Gung-Ho Guns and receives Vash's left arm from Knives, granting him the ability to manipulate victims with telepathy. He worships Knives as a god, and sees humans like himself as garbage, only good for consuming resources. Legato forces Vash to kill him by using his powers to threaten Milly and Meryl. Legato thus becomes the first person that Vash ever consciously and willfully kills, fulfilling Legato's promise to \\"make Vash the Stampede feel eternal pain and suffering\\". =Rem Saverem= was a crew member of a SEEDS ship from Earth meant to populate another planet. On Earth, Rem had a lover named Alex, and she took part in the mission in order to start over after his death. In the manga, a sentient Plant was born during the mission and named Tessla. The crew proceeded to perform extensive tests on Tessla, actions opposed by Rem and her crew mate, William Conrad, and which ultimately ended with Tessla's dissection and death. Vash and Knives were born later and, fearing for their safety, Rem kept their birth secret from the other members while they were in stasis. In the anime, Vash and Knives were the only sentient Plants whom Rem protected from the other members of the crew. She raised and mentored them. Her teachings of love and peace, especially that no one has the right to take a life, had a profound influence on Vash. The reason why Vash wears a red coat is that Rem told Vash about her favorite flower, the Red Geranium, which means determination. When Knives sabotaged the fleet, putting it on a crash course with the planet on which Trigun is set, she put him and Vash in an escape pod, but chose to stay behind and attempted to prevent the crash rather than escaping. She managed to undo Knives' tampering, allowing a number of the ships to land safely, but perished when her ship exploded in the atmosphere. Her last words to Vash were \\"take care of Knives\\". Gung-Ho Guns The are a group of assassins assembled to cause great pain to Vash the Stampede. Each one is human, but has sacrificed their humanity in order to gain power, often leaving them mutilated. Each Gung-Ho Gun has an assigned number, but not all numbers are revealed. In the manga, Legato uses them to play a \\"game\\" with Vash. He has them each carry half a coin, and gives Vash a case that contains the other half of every coin. He explains that if Vash can reassemble the coins (12 in all), something interesting will happen; it turns out that the filled case can block Legato's powers during their later fight. =Monev the Gale= Monev the Gale was hired as an assassin to fight Vash. Knives locks him in a cell to train his body for twenty years in order to gain the skill and power required to kill Vash. He wears a powered battle suit and carries two high- powered gatling guns on his arms. These guns fire extremely fast due to the pressure chambers located on his back, and have tremendous stopping power, enough to tear through entire buildings. He also carries a wide variety of weapons in a big cloth rucksack, including an enormous minigun, powerful enough to punch through a bank vault. He is defeated by Vash and killed afterward as punishment. His life is spared in the anime, but he is later killed by E.G. Mine along with Dominique (see below) due to his failure. =Dominique the Cyclops= Dominique the Cyclops has an ability known as the \\"Demon's Eye\\", which causes hypnosis and sensory paralysis in her foes, momentarily stunning them and making her movements appear immediate. This effect happens when she lifts her eye-patch, which reveals a reptilian eye in the manga and a red eye in the anime. Vash defeats her by placing pressure on a finger he had injured previously, allowing him to concentrate on the pain and avoid focusing on her eye. In the anime she survives her encounter with Vash but is killed by E.G. Mine and her body is tied to a cross to display for Vash. She commits suicide in the manga to avoid being punished. =E.G. Mine= E.G. Mine is a violent man who wears a suit that resembles a sphere and contains control threads for deploying lethal spikes. Further manipulating these threads, Mine can hurl them towards an enemy. He is quickly defeated in the manga, and he is killed by Rai-Dei after Vash defeats him in the anime. =Rai-Dei the Blade= Rai-Dei(Èõ∑Ê≥•) is a samurai who seeks the knowledge learned only when facing death. He carries a sword with a built in gun that can be fired from the hilt, but not meant for shooting, instead when he fires the gun in the middle of his swing it allows him to swing his sword with enough force to create a sonic blast. In the anime, he expresses anger in the fact that Vash is refusing to make his mark true and aim to kill, claiming he wants \\"a real battle\\". He escapes after Vash's Angel Arm is forced to activate, though Wolfwood soon kills him. In the manga, he wears \\"roller skates\\" that allow him to move at phenomenal speeds. After Vash defeats him, Rai-Dei attempts to attack Vash from behind, but is quickly killed by Wolfwood. =Leonof the Puppet-Master= Leonof the Puppet-Master is an elderly man who controls numerous puppets with an elaborate system of wires. He can manipulate them to look like real people, and uses them to do horrible things to people close to Vash. His real name is Emilio, having known Vash during his childhood. His love interest dies sometime after, and he goes into puppet making to mend his broken spirit. He cares for her body for a number of years until he battles Vash in the ruins of the station he had Vash lived on. During the battle, his love's corpse falls off a cliff, causing him to jump after it and fall to his death. The anime does not feature his background, and he is simply an assassin who can use his puppets to do various tasks, such as delivering reports to Legato, spying on people, and attacking them. After Leonof kills Brad using a puppet double of his longtime friend Jessica, Wolfwood kills Leonof in turn. Vash uses some of Leonof's control wires in his fight against Hoppered the Gauntlet, and later during his final showdown with Knives. =Gray the Ninelives= Gray the Ninelives is a very large man known for being indestructible. The manga version shows that he is actually formed from nine dwarfs controlling a mechanical suit from the inside, allowing them to keep fighting until all nine are dead. The suit is destroyed and only two survive. They are captured and turn over their coin, and later escape. The anime version is a cyborg whose only remaining human part is his brain, which is deeply encased in armor. Wolfwood shoots out a pipeline filled with corrosive liquid, which pours down on Gray and melts his armor to expose the brain and internal frame, and he then blows Gray's upper body apart with the rocket launcher in his Cross Punisher. However, the legs remain active and deploy a hidden launcher of their own to destroy one of the plants powering the ship, leading to its crash. =Hoppered the Gauntlet= Hoppered the Gauntlet is a masked man who wears a set of armor to cover his degenerated and vestigial legs, while using his large arms to move. The armor acts like a top and he uses a shield to propel himself at high speeds. He seeks to kill Vash to avenge a mute and blind woman detached from the world, killed during the destruction of July. He eventually loses his mask, exposing a large cross carved into his face. During his final battle, he sees Vash's memory of July, has a revelation that he has made the wrong choice, and he is killed after turning against the Guns. The anime does not feature his backstory or expose his face, and instead has him just wish to make Vash suffer. After Vash deflects his attack with a well- placed gunshot, he hurls himself into one of the plants powering the ship, leading to its crash. =Zazie the Beast= Zazie the Beast is a collective of group-minded insects able to take over the bodies of humans. These insects are the original inhabitants of the planet No Man's Land, who form an alliance with Knives to see whether humans or Plants are better to co-exist with them. They originally take over the body of a young boy, but it is destroyed by Hoppered after spying on him. Zazie later reappears in the body of a teenage girl, though it is also destroyed by Legato after trying to infect Knives. The last body is an odd-looking man in disco-clothing used to deliver his coin to Vash. The main hive is destroyed by Knives soon afterward. In the anime, Zazie is a demon who has possessed the body of Bete, a troubled young boy capable of controlling sand-worms with a high-frequency device he wears on his head. Vash shoots and destroys the device, and Zazie takes full control of Bete to hold Vash, Meryl, and Milly at gunpoint. He is killed by Wolfwood, prompting a heated disagreement between the two over their morals. (In the manga, the conflict is triggered by Wolfwood's killing of Rai-Dei.) =Midvalley the Hornfreak= Midvalley the Hornfreak is a violent musician who is able to use his tenor saxophone to generate destructive sound as well as play frequencies that drive those that hear it into a murderous frenzy. He is also capable of neutralizing sounds completely by playing counter-frequencies. He and his band originally just killed for money until being found by Knives, who killed all except Midvalley after they refused Knives's offer to join him. Terrified and resentful of Knives and Legato, Midvalley attempts to betray and desert the Guns, but once discovered by Legato, he is quickly killed himself. Legato uses Midvalley's body to attack Hoppered, and it is buried with his saxophone on his gravestone afterward. In the anime, Midvalley plays Sylvia, a hybrid between an alto and tenor saxophone, mainly acting as Legato's bodyguard before being the last Gun to fight Vash. In their battle, Midvalley reveals his ability to synchronize sound waves with pain receptors in the body. Vash damages his horn with several carefully placed shots, preventing him from being able to play, and Midvalley commits suicide by triggering the now-jammed machine guns hidden in the bell so that they backfire into his chest. =Caine the Longshot= Caine the Longshot is a member of the Gung-Ho Guns invented for the anime in place of Elendira the Crimsonnail. He is a mute, talented sniper who utilizes a rifle with a barrel many meters long; its scope allows him to fire on targets from many miles away. The poncho he wears can change its coloration to perfectly blend in with his surroundings, and he also wears a broad-brimmed hat and a steel mask whose left eye is patched shut. Vash distracts him long enough to shoot his rifle to pieces, but instead of surrendering, Caine commits suicide by shooting himself in the head with a revolver. He is later buried in the desert, with his hat and a piece of the rifle barrel marking the grave. =Elendira the Crimsonnail= Elendira the Crimsonnail, referred to as the lost thirteenth Gung-Ho Gun in the manga, is the most powerful of the group. She is a transgender woman, and wears feminine clothing and a pillbox hat. She shoots giant nails from a large briefcase that transforms into a crossbow with great proficiency, being capable of launching several in less than a second. However, underneath her outer garments she also wears restraining armour, and after disabling it, she is able to move at blinding speed. Elendira also has the power to project the image of the death of her opponents by touch, crippling them with the realistic illusion. She is jealous of Legato, as Legato is not part of the Guns, suggesting that Legato is more important to Knives than she. Elendira was apparently one of Knives' very first companions, seen walking with him as a child along with Legato. She fights Livio twice, the first time skewering his torso with many nails after launching him through several buildings. Their subsequent rematch results in a similar outcome, despite Livio and Razlo's combined efforts to match her speed. However, Elendira is ultimately killed when Livio grabs her and uses one of the nails going through his torso to run Elendira through. =Chapel the Evergreen= Merely known as \\"Chapel\\" in the manga, he is a member of the \\"Eye of Michael\\", an organization of ecclesiastical assassins founded by a church that worships Plants. They provide Knives with mercenaries, with three slots of the Gung-Ho Guns reserved for the Eye of Michael's best. Chapel, also known as 'Master C', is the mentor of Wolfwood, teaching him all the skills in being an assassin. He is subsequently shot and left as a paraplegic by Wolfwood, who impersonates Chapel. He is only middle aged, but, like the rest of the members of the Eye, the artificial modifications on his body which grants him enhanced strength and reflexes and limited regenerative abilities have aged him considerably. He is wheelchair bound after Wolfwood shot him, and wields a large cross-shaped machine gun similar to Wolfwood's Punisher with four spiked ends at the base of the cross. Wolfwood kills Chapel with an immense head butt, cracking his skull and breaking his neck. The anime features Chapel the Evergreen as Wolfwood's direct mentor. He carries the parent version of Wolfwood's Cross Punisher, though Chapel's splits into twin machine guns. He cares for Nicholas after Nicholas kills his abusive guardian. He dresses in a dark green suit and has red goggles grafted to his face. He is killed by Knives after an unsuccessful attempt to kill Legato for taking control of him and forcing him to kill Wolfwood. =Livio and Razlo= Livio the Double Fang is a childhood friend of Wolfwood and the final member of the Gung-Ho Guns from the Eye of Michael. He wields the Double Fangs, two small cross-shaped machine guns strapped on his arms that fire from both ends. His body has been enhanced through increased metabolic rate, allowing him to recover from near fatal wounds in a matter of seconds. He grows up in the same orphanage as Wolfwood, having the nickname \\"Livio the Crybaby\\". Razlo the Tri-P(unisher) of Death is a violent and psychotic split personality, treated as another member of the Gung-Ho Guns. After repeated abuse by his father, Livio eventually developed the Razlo personality, with Razlo taking all the abuse, allowing the Livio persona to not know about it. Razlo only appears after Livio has suffered intense pain or violence, and often commits act of violence, such as killing Livio's parents. He uses three Punishers, the same gun as Wolfwood owns, with the aid of a bionic arm, thus giving him the nickname 'the tri-p of death', short for Tri-Punisher of Death. He is aided by three servants who carry his Punishers while Livio's persona is active. The two fight with Wolfwood and they are defeated, though Wolfwood dies after sustaining immense injuries while overdosing himself on the regeneration drug. In the aftermath of the fight Livio comes to terms with Razlo's existence stating that he is now strong enough to face life on his own without the questionable help of his psychotic personality, who recedes in the back of his mind. Vash decides to forgive Livio afterward, and he becomes Vash's partner in an act of redemption, seeking to live as Wolfwood would have. Livio fights against Elendira. Unable to win himself, Livio allows Razlo to awake and help him kill the Crimsonnail, by utilizing Razlo's faster reflexes and better eyesight. Livio later lives together with the children in his old orphanage and is shown paying his respects to Wolfwood's gravestone. Other characters =Kuroneko-sama= is a black cat who reoccurs in the background of the anime and manga. She appears in every episode of the anime and randomly in the manga. Nightow has stated that she is just something easy and calming to draw in between action scenes. His most common response to queries as to her nature or significance at anime convention panels is \\"Kuroneko-sama is a small black cat.\\" In Trigun Maximum, Kuroneko-sama only appears in Nightow's commentary at the end of each issue, often criticizing the author's lazy and silly nature. Kuroneko-sama also makes several cameo appearances in the anime adaptation of Nightow's other work, Blood Blockade Battlefront.

It was written in Cartagena de Indias, on 15 December 1812. This is the first of Bol√≠var's public documents, which due to his later fame as the \\"Liberator of five nations,\\" have become quite well known. The document contained the conceptual framework of his new agenda, which he then acted out in the field.  Background  Prior to the document's publication, Bol√≠var had been an officer in the Venezuelan army. The First Republic, however, was defeated due to a number of movements that confronted and exploited each other such as the royalists who fought for the old order, the supporters of independence who fought for creole supremacy, and the pardos, blacks, and slaves who fought for their liberation. The conflict was exacerbated by a number of factors such as the shortage of provisions and the effects of the 1812 Caracas earthquake, among others. Bolivar started acting on his own, leaving La Guaira on a Spanish ship. He briefly stayed in Cura√ßao before finally arriving in Cartagena. he accepted a commission in the army of the United Provinces of New Granada (Colombia), which later granted him permission to lead a force to free Venezuela, in what became known as the Admirable Campaign.  The Manifesto  In Cartagena Manifesto, Bolivar outlined a framework that would prevent New Granada from suffering the fate of Venezuela since the territory reproduced the prevailing pattern of colonial dissent from loyal juntas to independent governments. The political, economic, social, and natural causes which Bol√≠var mentioned included: *The use of a federal system, which Bolivar considered weak for a time of war *Bad administration of the public income by the republican government *The earthquake of Caracas of 1812, which worsened the economic and political situation *The impossibility of establishing a permanent army due to the intransigence of the general population *The opposing influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which clandestinely promoted anti-republican views Bolivar advocated a strong central government and powerful executive to avoid infighting between city, state, and national authorities, which in his view created stalemate, dissipating funds and energy. He stated that \\"the government must necessarily adjust itself, so to speak, to the context of the times, men, and circumstances in which it operates. If these are prosperous and serene, it has to be gentle and protective, but if they are calamitous and turbulent, it has to be severe and armed with a strength equal to the dangers.\\" References  External links  Manifiesto de Cartagena ‚Äì Analitica.com (text of the Manifesto, in Spanish) * Manifiesto de Cartagena ‚Äì Monograf√≠as.com (commentary on the Manifesto, in Spanish) Independence of Colombia Independence of Venezuela Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Colonial Colombia Colonial Venezuela Political manifestos 1812 in Colombia 1812 in Venezuela 1812 in the Viceroyalty of New Granada 1812 documents ","title":"Cartagena Manifesto"},{"id":"1851052","text":"Gerster is a surname.

Project Exile shifted the prosecution of illegal technical gun possession offenses to federal court, where they carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in federal prison under the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, rather than in state court. Note that federal law (18 U.S. Code ¬ß 922(g) & 924) provides for a penalty of ten years in federal prison for being a \\"prohibited person\\", i.e., a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, as well as for falsifying information in order to obtain one, or furnishing a gun to a convicted felon. The program has since been copied by several other cities, sometimes under other names. In Atlanta, for example, the program was known as FACE 5 (Firearms in Atlanta Can Equal 5 years in federal prison). While many have discontinued or modified their programs, Project Exile is still in effect in Rochester, NY. Origin and implementation The program was designed to address the gang violence which had plagued Richmond. At the time of its inception, the level of murders and shootings had regularly increased each year, with Richmond's murder-per-capita rates being one of the highest five for the country. In 1997, 140 people were murdered, 122 of them with firearms.United States House of Representatives House Judiciary Committee: \\"PROJECT EXILE AND VIRGINIA EXILE - SOLUTIONS FOR THE GUN PROBLEM WHICH WORK\\" 2000 There was strong community support for federal intervention. The African American community was being devastated by the violence (80% of all the homicide victims in Richmond were African-American). Half of the victims had no prior criminal record and many were innocent bystanders, the result of drug dealers' poor marksmanship and wild shooting at targets of opportunity. The guiding principle of the program was to remove from the streets those who were mostly likely to commit gun violence: criminals with guns. This included convicted felons caught with guns (federal law prohibits felons from owning firearms) and those who committed crimes with a gun. It also intended to deter would be-offenders with strict sentencing, specifically longer sentences with no possibility of bail or early release. Project Exile was named for the idea that if the police catch a criminal in Richmond with a gun in a crime, the criminal has forfeited his right to remain in this community, will face immediate federal prosecution and stiff mandatory federal prison sentences (often five years), and will thus be \\"exiled\\" to federal prison, often far away from the criminal's home town. In 1997, the program was implemented in conjunction with an extensive public outreach and media campaign to educate citizens about lengthy federal prison sentences for gun crimes and to maximize deterrence. The message An Illegal Gun Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison was placed on 15 billboards, a fully painted city bus carried the message changing routes every day, TV commercials, Metro Richmond traffic reports, over a million supermarket bags were also used to advertise Project Exile. Rochester, NY became the second city to implement the plan in 1998 under the leadership of Mayor Bill Johnson. In 2001, after the launch of a similar state program named Virginia Exile, Project Exile evolved from a federal-only program to a larger cooperative effort with state and local authorities meeting bimonthly to review ongoing arrests to determine in which venue to bring the case so as to ensure the maximum possible penalty. President George W. Bush made the program a part of his Project Safe Neighborhoods crime- prevention plan, which included increased funding for U.S. attorneys to prosecute gun crime. Politics In Congress, Project Exile had both supporters (such as Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, Sue Myrick of North Carolina, and Bob Ehrlich of Maryland) and opponents (such as Representatives Bobby Scott of Virginia and Maxine Waters of California).Congressional Record-House, 5207-5211 (April 11, 2000) =Support= The National Rifle Association (NRA) and the Brady Campaign were both early and vocal supporters of Project Exile. The NRA lobbied the U.S. Congress to help secure $2.3 million for emulation of Exile in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Camden County, New Jersey, where similar firearms-related violence has plagued the communities. The NRA has remained a strong supporter of the program as its focus is on severely punishing all gun crimes especially illegal possession rather than by making gun purchases more difficult. NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre stated \\"By prosecuting them they prevent the drug dealer, the gang member and the felon from committing the next crime... Leave the good people alone and lock up the bad people and dramatically cut crime.\\" =Opposition= Project Exile was opposed by some gun-rights groups and some black leaders, the latter saying that it disproportionately affected African Americans.Joanne Kimberlin, Project Exile flexes federal muscle at gun crime, Virginian-Pilot (March 4, 2008). Families Against Mandatory Minimums also opposed the project. A \\"Project Exile Condemnation Petition\\" was launched by Brian Puckett of GunTruths.com,Keep And Bear Arms Website: \\"We Condemn 'Project Exile' - A Coalition of American Leaders in the Firearms Movement\\" retrieved April 21, 2013 Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America,Gun Owners Of America: \\"Liberal Think Tank Finds That Project Exile Doesn't Work\\" by Larry Pratt September 8, 2008 Angel Shamaya of KeepAndBearArms.com, and former NRA director Russ Howard. Other opponents who were members of this anti-Exile coalition included Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, Libertarian Party presidential candidate Harry Browne, and science fiction writer L. Neil Smith. Results Project Exile was widely praised after its first year's results were released.San Francisco Gate: \\"Gun Enforcement Holds Down Richmond's Homicide Rate / \`Project Exile' helping reverse violent trend\\" by Michael Janofsky February 17, 1999Baltimore Sun: \\"Changing a culture of gun violence - No compromise: Unbending enforcement makes criminals less likely to carry guns and kill. Getting Away With Murder\\" February 08, 2000The Free Lance-Star: \\"Stopping Gun Crime: Project Exile is the Best Program Yet Devised to Stop the Carnage on our Streets\\" March 30, 2000 Within the first year (1997-1998) Project Exile resulted in: * The first Exile case made by Officer Gene Baskette, and Officer Mark Wooten of the Street Enforcement Unit of the Richmond Police Dept. *372 persons indicted for Federal gun violations. *440 illegally possessed guns seized. *300 persons arrested or held in State custody. *222 arrestees (more than 74 percent) held without bond. *247 persons convicted. *196 persons sentenced to an average of 55 months of imprisonment. During the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%. By 2007, homicides in Richmond were down to 57 compared to 122 in the year before Project Exile. Research analysts offered different opinions as to the program's success in reducing gun crime. Jens Ludwig and Steven Raphael, in a 2003 analysis of the program, argued that the decline in gun homicide was part of a general regression to the mean across U.S. cities with high homicide rates.Jens Ludwig & Steven Raphael, \\"Prison Sentence Enhancements: The Case of Project Exile \\" in Evaluating Gun Policy: Effects on Crime and Violence (Brookings Institution Press, 2003), p. 251. A 2005 study by Richard Rosenfeld and others, published in Criminology & Public Policy, disagreed, concluding that Richmond's gun homicide rate fell more rapidly than the rates in other large U.S. cities, when controlling for other variables.Richard Rosenfeld, Robert Fornango & Eric Baumer, Did Ceasefire, Compstat, and Exile Reduce Homicide?, 4 Criminology & Pub. Pol'y 419 (2005) Legacy Project Exile, which was confined to Richmond and surrounding areas, has since been supplanted by Virginia Exile, the Commonwealth's statewide program which carries bail restrictions and imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in a Virginia prison for those who: *have a prior conviction for a violent felony and are convicted of possessing a firearm; *are convicted of possessing a firearm on school property with the intent to use it, or displaying it in a threatening manner; *are convicted of possessing a firearm and Schedule I or II drugs such as cocaine or heroin, or convicted of possessing more than a pound of marijuana with the intent to sell.

Lawler is best known for his 41-year tenure as the voice of the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Clippers. Going back to the franchise's six-year stint in San Diego (1978‚Äì84), Lawler has broadcast virtually every Clippers game since the franchise moved from Buffalo, New York in 1978, whether it be radio and/or television. There were only two seasons when Lawler did not serve as the team's primary play-by-play broadcaster: 1981‚Äì82 (Jerry Gross) and 1984‚Äì85 (Eddie Doucette); Lawler returned as the full-time voice in 1985‚Äì86. In 2019, Lawler was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Although the Clippers have been among the least successful NBA franchises, Lawler would provide Clippers fans with his enthusiastic commentary, which has made him a fan favorite. He has broadcast more than 3,000 Clippers games, including more than 1,600 consecutive games. He reached the 2,500-game milestone in a game versus the Boston Celtics, on February 26, 2011. Lawler reached the 3,000-game milestone on December 10, 2016 versus the New Orleans Pelicans. Life and career Lawler was born in Ohio and raised in Peoria, Illinois. His broadcasting career began in the 1960s upon graduating from Bradley University in his hometown. Lawler initially worked as a sports announcer at 1440 KPRO in Riverside, California and did some announcing at the Riverside International Raceway nearby. From there, Lawler went on to work in Philadelphia, where he broadcast games for the Flyers of the National Hockey League, the 76ers of the National Basketball Association, the Phillies of Major League Baseball, Big 5 college basketball, and Temple college football. He also worked as a sports reporter for then-CBS station WCAU-TV, before returning to Southern California for good in the late 1970s, calling the San Diego Conquistadors of the American Basketball Association and the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League. Lawler has worked with Basketball Hall of Famer and current ESPN/ABC commentator Bill Walton, on locally televised Clippers broadcasts. Their broadcasts were wildly popular among Clippers (and many NBA) fans, because of their witty banter. Walton left the Clippers to work exclusively with ABC/ESPN when the two networks acquired the NBA broadcasts in 2002. Lawler's biggest broadcasting influences included Irv Kaze, a former sports executive (who had a stint as a San Diego Clippers general manager and hired Lawler in 1978) and long-time Los Angeles-area sports talk show host, before he died in 2003; and Los Angeles Lakers voice, Chick Hearn, who like Lawler, grew up in Illinois before moving on to Southern California. Lawler and former Clippers guard Shaun Livingston are alumni of Peoria (Central) High School. Lawler had previously worked on Clippers telecasts on Prime Ticket/Fox Sports West alongside former Clipper player and former color analyst, Mike Smith, over 15 seasons from 2002 to 2017. He worked alongside former San Antonio Spurs player Bruce Bowen, during the 2017/18 season. Unlike other announcers who use headsets while calling the game, Lawler relies exclusively on a handheld microphone during games. His reasoning for it is because he feels he has \\"much more control over the microphone by holding it.\\" He also added \\"I've been doing it so long that if I wear a headset, I don't know what to do with my hands.\\" Lawler and his wife, Jo, have three grown children and seven grandchildren. On March 3, 2016, Lawler was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Clippers coach Doc Rivers and several players attended the ceremony.http://www.foxsports.com/san-diego/story/clippers-broadcaster-to- get-hollywood-star-030116 On September 12, 2018, Lawler announced he would retire at the end of the 2018-19 season. He has missed only three games in his 40-year career.https://clutchpoints.com/clippers-news-longtime-broadcaster- ralph-lawler-retiring-after-2018-19-season/ On February 15, 2019, Lawler was named the 2019 winner of the Curt Gowdy Media Award for electronic media by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. QuotesBingo!: when a player makes a three-point basket. The \\"Bingo\\" term derives from one-time Clipper and Cleveland Cavalier player Bobby \\"Bingo\\" Smith, who hit 22 threes for the San Diego Clippers in the three point shot's inaugural 1979-1980 season. *Bank Shot Bingo: The rare three-point basket off the backboard elicits this enthusiastic \\"Lawlerism.\\" *...Plus One: A scoring play and a foul resulting in one free-throw. *Lawler's Law: The first team to 100 points wins the game.In a March 2009 interview with Larry Fleischer of InsideHoops.com, Lawler admitted to having lifted the idea of \\"Lawler's Law\\" from Al Domenico, a former trainer of the Philadelphia 76ers. Lawler recalled that \\"Al used to always say 'I'm telling you first team to 100 always wins.' When I started with the Clippers in San Diego in 1978, I thought maybe I'll steal that from him and make it alliterative and Lawler's Law kind of worked, so I used it a few times and began to hear it back from fans around the league and (I said) 'oh this works' and every city I go to now, the people quote it ‚Äî it's amazing.\\" See: Larry Fleischer, \\"Ralph Lawler Interview,\\" Inside Hoops.com, March 27, 2009. Retrieved May 4, 2010. *Lawler's Law Corollary: The team that shoots 50% in field goal percentage wins the game. *Lawler's Overtime Law: The first team to lead by four points in overtime wins the game. *Fasten your seat belts, gang. We're going down to the wire!: It refers to when a close game is coming down to final minutes (or seconds). The phrase originates from Lawler's desire to emulate Hank Fisher, who was a radio broadcaster for the Bradley Braves men's basketball team during Lawler's childhood. According to Lawler, Fisher used to tell fans to, \\"get up on their feet and help this ballclub get to the win\\" whenever the Braves were in a crunch time situation. *Oh Me, Oh My!: When a player makes an unbelievable and exciting play. Used with positive or negative inflections of the voice, according to whether a player plays for the Clippers or an opponent. *The Lob! The Jam!: When the team scores off of an alley-oop. *Out of the Box: When the team with the most turnovers is winning by over fifteen points. *Settle Down Now, Mike Smith/Bruce Bowen: When Ralph has to tell his announcing pair, Mike Smith (Bruce Bowen in later seasons), to calm down after an exaggerating claim or stat. *My computer-like mind tells me that's‚Ä¶: introduction to giving a statistical percentage figure (such as shooting percentage, for a player or a team) after having given the raw data. Presumably the \\"computer-like mind\\" is actually a calculator Lawler employs. *Wedgie!: Whenever the ball gets stuck between the rim and the glass of the backboard during a shot attempt or a dunk.

Ampakines, also stylized as AMPAkines, are a subgroup of AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators with a benzamide or closely related chemical structure. They are also known as \\"CX compounds\\". Ampakines take their name from the AMPA receptor (AMPAR), a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor with which the ampakines interact and act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of. Although all ampakines are AMPAR PAMs, not all AMPAR PAMs are ampakines. They are currently being investigated as potential treatment for a range of conditions involving mental disability and disturbances such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or neurological disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), among others. More recently developed ampakine compounds are much more potent and selective for the AMPA receptor target, and while none of the newer selective ampakine compounds have yet come onto the market, various ampakines are in clinical trials. Development Cortex Pharmaceutical ampakines CX-546, CX-516, and CX-614. A wide range of ampakines have been developed by RespireRx, which hold patents covering most medical uses of this class of drugs. The best known compounds that have come out of the RespireRx drug development program are CX-516 (Ampalex), CX-546, CX-614, CX-691 (farampator), and CX-717. ORG-26576 was developed by RespireRx but then licensed to Organon for development. Several other compounds such as CX-701, CX-1739, CX-1763 and CX-1837 have also been announced as being under current investigation, and while little information has yet been released about them, CX-1739 is believed to be the most potent compound in this class to date, reportedly some 5x the potency of CX-717. Presently, CX717 is in phase II clinical trials as a possible non-stimulant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ADHD. As the AMPA receptors also mediate respiratory drive, CX717 is also being investigated as a therapy in opioid-induced respiratory depression and spinal-cord injury. Mechanism of action Ampakines work by allosterically binding to a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, called AMPA receptors. The ampakines are mostly low-impact AMPAR PAMs, though with some exceptions, such as tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632). Side effects Few side effects have been determined, but an ampakine called farampator (CX-691) has side effects including headache, drowsiness, nausea, and impaired episodic memory. Medical applications An ampakine called CX456 has been proposed as a treatment for Rett syndrome, after favorable testing in an animal model. Ampakines have been investigated by DARPA for potential use in increasing military effectiveness.

The episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 11 June 2005. It is the first of a two-part story. The concluding episode, \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", was first broadcast on 18 June 2005. In the episode, set 100 years after the events of the 2005 episode \\"The Long Game\\", the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his travelling companions Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) are secretly brought on board the game show broadcasting satellite Satellite Five by its controller (Martha Cope), so they can fight against the controller's \\"masters\\", the Dalek race. Plot The 'Anne Droid', on display at the Doctor Who Experience. The Ninth Doctor, Rose, and Jack find themselves separated, waking up with temporary amnesia in various television game shows which are more fatal than their twenty-first century counterparts. On The Weakest Link and Big Brother, losing contestants are disintegrated. On What Not to Wear, participants undergo brutal cosmetic surgery. The Doctor escapes Big Brother with a contestant called Lynda, and Jack escapes What Not to Wear. The Doctor discovers that they are on the space station Satellite Five, now known as \\"The Game Station\\", in the year 200,100. The station is now under the control of the Bad Wolf Corporation, which shares the name with a set of words that are following the Doctor and Rose through time and space. Lynda explains that 100 years ago, when the Doctor last visited, Satellite Five stopped broadcasting and humanity became confused and lost. The three search for Rose. They find her just as she loses the final round of The Weakest Link and is promptly disintegrated by the Anne Droid. The Doctor, Jack, and Lynda are arrested, but escape their capture and travel to the control room on Floor 500. There they meet the Controller, a cybernetic human. The Controller uses the cover of a solar flare to speak directly to the Doctor, telling him that her masters cannot hear her during the flare. The Controller used a teleport called a transmat to hide the Doctor and his companions in the games as her masters do not watch them. The solar flare ends before she can tell the Doctor who is controlling her. Jack finds the TARDIS hidden in a restricted area, which he uses to figure out that contest losers are not actually disintegrated but transmatted off the station. The Controller begins giving the Doctor the coordinates that the transmat leads to, knowing that her masters will hear. The Controller disappears in a transmat beam and wakes up on a spaceship, where she is killed by her masters. Rose wakes up on the floor of a spaceship and is horrified to see a Dalek approaching her. The Doctor and Jack discover a signal coming from the station that is hiding something at the edge of the solar system. They cancel the signal and reveal a fleet of Dalek spaceships. The Daleks open a communication channel to the Doctor, threatening to kill Rose if he interferes. The Doctor refuses to back down and vows to rescue Rose and wipe out the Daleks. =Continuity= The term \\"Bad Wolf\\" appears in every episode of the first series except for \\"Rose\\" and the two-part stories which only have one explicit reference between the two episodes. Production A working title for the episode was \\"Gameshow World\\". It was the last of the 2005 Doctor Who episode titles to be revealed. Prior to this, the episode was referred to in promotional literature as \\"The Parting of the Ways (Part 1)\\", with \\"Part 2\\" eventually becoming simply \\"The Parting of the Ways\\".The Doctor Who Complete New Series Boxset at the BBC Shop The concept of the Anne Droid and a futuristic version of The Weakest Link was pitched by Russell T Davies in his second meeting with the BBC about bringing back Doctor Who in 2000 or 2001. The idea had come from his trip to New York City for the launch of the American version of Queer as Folk, where he had seen \\"a vast screen in Times Square with a gigantic Anne Robinson blasting us tiny mortals with her voice\\". The production team originally intended to show Jack's naked buttocks on screen. The scene was shot, but the BBC's editorial policy department stepped in and vetoed it, the only time they over-ruled the production team during the 2005 series. According to the DVD commentary for this episode, the music that is heard as the Dalek fleet is revealed includes a chorus singing \\"What is happening?\\" (transliterated: Mah Kor'ei) in Hebrew. Russell T Davies mentioned that the \\"arc word\\" for the subsequent series was mentioned in this series, as well as being an anagram. One of the answers during The Weakest Link scenes was that the Great Cobalt Pyramid was built on the ruins of the famous Old Earth Torchwood Institute, \\"Torchwood\\" being an anagram of \\"Doctor Who\\". In 2006, a spin-off series titled Torchwood began, set in modern-day Cardiff and involving a team investigating paranormal and alien incidents, and featuring John Barrowman reprising his role of Captain Jack Harkness. =Cast notes= Nisha Nayar, the actress cast as the Female Programmer in this episode, previously appeared as one of the uncredited 'Red Kang' extras in the 1987 classic series story Paradise Towers. This made her the second actor to appear in both the classic and new series of Doctor Who, following William Thomas's appearance in the previous episode, \\"Boom Town\\". Martha Cope later played Captain Oswin in the audio play The Nowhere Place and Talia in Bedtime Story. Paterson Joseph later played Victor Espinoza in the audio play Earth Aid. Sebastian Armesto later played Anders in the audio play Grand Theft Cosmos. According to Doctor Who Confidential, although Anne Robinson was invited to voice the Anne Droid, the expectation was that she would decline. A celebrity voice impersonator had already been hired to record the lines when Robinson accepted. Broadcast and reception The episode received final rating of 6.81 million viewers, the lowest figure of the series. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 86. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan had a positive reaction to \\"Bad Wolf\\", praising Eccleston, the parodies, and the Susanna and Trinny robots. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised the \\"mad energy\\" to the finale and Eccleston's emotion over losing Rose. However, he was critical of the popular culture references, feeling that it would not age well and he could not find a \\"coherent satirical point in their inclusion\\". SFX gave \\"Bad Wolf\\" a score of nine out of ten, calling the two-parter Davies' \\"finest work this season\\", praising the humorous parodies and the reveal of the Daleks. The episode's cliffhanger has been singled out by critics. It was listed by Charlie Jane Anders of io9 among the greatest cliffhangers of the programme, while Den of Geek's Mark Harrison listed it as the Ninth Doctor's best cliffhanger. It was also chosen by Morgan Jeffery and Chris Allen of Digital Spy among the five best Doctor Who cliffhangers; Jeffery wrote that it \\"isn't the strongest episode of his tenure ‚Äì let's not forget the Trinny and Susannah robots ‚Äì but you'd be hard-pressed to fault the climax\\".

It is part of the ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) group, owned by ThyssenKrupp. The Howaldtswerke shipyard was founded in Kiel in 1838 and merged with Hamburg-based Deutsche Werft to form Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in 1968. The company's shipyard was formerly used by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft until the end of World War II. History HDW was founded October 1, 1838 in Kiel by engineer August Howaldt and entrepreneur Johann Schweffel under the name Maschinenbauanstalt und Eisengie√üerei Schweffel & Howaldt (Machine Factory and Iron Foundry Schweffel & Howaldt), initially building boilers. The first steam engine for naval purposes was built in 1849 for the Von der Tann, a gunboat for the small navy of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1850, the company built an early submarine, Brandtaucher, designed by Wilhelm Bauer. It had been intended to build the boat in Rendsburg but Danish forces advanced too close during the First Schleswig War, so construction was moved to Kiel. The first ship built under the company's new name Howaldtswerke was a small steamer, named Vorw√§rts, built in 1865. Business expanded rapidly as Germany became a maritime power and, by the start of the 20th century, around 390 ships had been completed. In 1892 the company started a subsidiary in Austrian-Hungarian Fiume on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The subsidiary closed ten years later but the yard remains open under the name 3. Maj. With Kiel being one of the two main bases of the Kaiserliche Marine, the shipyard also benefited much from navy maintenance, repair and construction contracts. During World War I the company also built a number of U-boats. By 1937, the company had yards in Kiel and in Hamburg, and was taken over by the Kriegsmarine. During World War II, Howaldtswerke built 33 VIIC U-boats in Hamburg and 31 in Kiel. After the end of World War II, Howaldtswerke was the only major shipyard in Kiel that was not dismantled. The yard flourished during the \\"economic miracle\\" of the 1960s, with the construction of freighters and tankers, and again expanded by opening a shipyard in Hamburg. Howaldtswerke merged with Deutsche Werft in Hamburg in 1968, and the company took the new name Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW). Pressure from cheaper competitors in Japan and South Korea caused the closure of the Hamburg yard in 1985. In March 2002, the American financial investor One Equity Partner (OEP) took over the majority of Babcock AG at HDW. Shortly after that, Babcock AG had to file for insolvency and called for a reserved transaction, but the OEP was able to avoid this.*Torsten Oltmanns, Ralf-Dieter Brunowsky: Re: think CEO 2. Managers in the media trap (abstract; in German), original title: Manager in der Medienfalle, BrunoMedia, Cologne 2009, , S. 35 In January 2005, HDW became a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), which also part-owned Kockums of Malm√∂, Sweden and 24.9% of Hellenic Shipyards Co. of Skaramangas, Greece. The group employs around 6,600 workers.

He was twice President of Chile, from 1841 to 1846 and from 1846 to 1851. Born in Concepci√≥n, he served as the president of Chile between 1841 and 1851. At the age of 16 he was imprisoned as a revolutionary by the Spanish authorities, but was soon released, and in 1818 joined the army of San Martin under whom he served as colonel throughout the Chilean War of Independence. After three years of continuous warfare (1820‚Äì23), he accomplished the temporary conquest of the Araucanian Indians. He was appointed brigadier general in 1831. In 1832 he crossed the Cordillera and defeated decisively the Pincheira brothers in the battle of Epulafqu√©n. Then Bulnes commanded the Chilean army in 1838 against Gen. Santa Cruz in Peru; and, after taking Lima and winning the battles of Huaraz and Puente del Buin, combined his forces with those of Gamarra and defeated Santa Cruz at the Battle of Yungay (January 19, 1839), thus putting an end to the confederation between Peru and Bolivia. Presidency (1841‚Äì1851) His presidencies were characterised by educational and cultural expansion, supported by the encouragement of foreign intellectuals to come to Chile. The National Institute was reformed and several junior schools were established along with the Jos√© Abelardo N√∫√±ez Upper School. In Santiago the University of Chile was founded during his watch, in 1842, as well as a technical training school from which the University of Santiago is descended. Bulnes also presided over a general amnesty in order to reconcile the groups who had opposed one another in the Civil War of 1829. Regarding the nation's strategic goals, Bulnes founded Fuerte Bulnes in 1843 in order to establish and enforce sovereignty over the Magellan Straits. The settlement was relocated to Punta Arenas six years later because the original site offered insufficient space for the development of a settled community: it was and remains the most southerly municipality in the world, and has been a focus for economic development in the south of the country. Germans were targeted to colonise the hitherto very sparsely inhabited southern part of Chile in the wake of the 1848 revolutions which provided an impetus for emigration from the European perspective. It was also during the presidency of Bulnes that the former colonial power, Spain, acknowledged the independence of Chile and became involved in the construction of Chile's first railway.

Their first, self-titled album was released in 1977; by the end of the decade they were one of the biggest French rock bands around, opening shows for The Rolling Stones in Paris, Quebec, the United States and Japan. The band split in 1986 for personal reasons. They have sold around 10 million albums to date, a record still unbeaten for a French rock band.

The elided name also suggests the word portable, meaning \\"cellphone\\" in French, thus implying an upgrade to modern times). Les Insus? were composed of Aubert, Bertignac and Kolinka but with the bassist Corine Marienneau replaced on the bass guitar by Aleksander Angelov (hence the reason they were not able to use the name \\"T√©l√©phone\\"). Another concert was given in Lille on September 15. Les Insus? also gave a concert in Lyon, at Le Transbordeur, on 6 October 2015. On November 29, 2015, the new group announced a real tour in France (in which Corine Marienneau would not participate) for 2016. The tour was scheduled from 27 April to 11 November in several major cities and several festivals.

He was twice President of Chile between 1831 and 1841. Joaqu√≠n Prieto was of Spanish and Basque descent. Early life Prieto was one of five sons of a Creole officer in Concepci√≥n. After finishing school, he joined the cavalry garrison in his home town. In 1810, he joined the Chilean fight for independence against his father's will. He met Manuela Warnes Garc√≠a de Z√∫√±iga in Buenos Aires and married her in 1812. During the Chilean War of Independence, he served as a captain. In the dispute between Bernardo O'Higgins and Jos√© Miguel Carrera, he took the side of O'Higgins, who then made him Quartermaster general of the southern army. After the defeat in the Battle of Rancagua, which he wasn't a part of, Prieto fled to Mendoza, Argentina to build up the Liberation Army of the Andes. After the victory of the Chileans in the battle of Chacabuco in 1817, in which he also wasn't involved, he was appointed Commanding General of Santiago, where he dealt with defense strategies and military matters. Then, he turned his attention to Peru, in order to support its fight for independence. His military accomplishments - especially in the south of the country - earned the respect of conservative-centralist circles, which encouraged him to start a political career. He did so in 1823; in this year he was elected into the Chilean House of Deputies and appointed into State council. In this position, he advocated a strong and influential central government and fought the federalist independence ambitions of the regionalists. In 1828, he was elected vice-president of Chile. Political career and Civil War of 1829 Prieto's military career continued to progress. In 1828, he was promoted to general and commander of the army in the south. In 1829 presidential elections, neither he nor his liberal-federalist opponent Joaqu√≠n Vicu√±a received an absolute majority. The liberal majority in Congress nominated Francisco Ram√≥n Vicu√±a, president of the senate, as vice-president. The conservatives considered this move to be unconstitutional and started a civil war. As commander of the southern army, Prieto Vial marched onto Santiago. On December 14, 1829, he and his troops met the liberal army under Francisco de la Lastra and defeated them at the Battle of Ochagav√≠a. Then, in 1830, an agreement was finally found after the defeat of Ram√≥n Freire at the Battle of Lircay. Administration After the transitional president Jos√© Tom√°s Ovalle died, Fernando Err√°zuriz Aldunate became Provisional President from March 8 to March 31, 1831, rapidly replaced by Prieto himself on April 10. On September 18, 1831, Prieto was finally able to take over the job as elected President for a first term of five years. His main focus on first taking power was to restore law and order; for that he relied on Diego Portales, who continue to be the almost universal minister and provided the necessary political stability for the country to recover from the decade of anarchy. He also instructed Manuel Bulnes to seize the bandits commanded by the brothers Pablo and Jos√© Antonio Pincheira who made the area around Concepci√≥n unsafe. On May 25, 1833 a new constitution was passed, which - with a few amendments - would be valid until 1925. It provided for a 5-year long term of office for the president, who could be re-elected only once. The president received much authority. During his 10-year-long presidency, Prieto expanded the governmental power and laid the foundation for a public administration in Chile. The first educational establishments like the Instituto Nacional were founded and in 1837 the ministries for justice and public education were created. Prieto's foreign policy was dominated by Chile's war with Peru between 1836 and 1839. The Chilean army under Manuel Blanco Encalada suffered heavy losses, which climaxed in the Treaty of Paucarpata, following which Manuel Bulnes took over the leadership of the army and led it into the victorious Battle of Yungay. =Cabinet= Later life In 1841, the victorious hero Bulnes was elected as the successor of Prieto. After his resignation Prieto served as Senator until 1852 and even took over the command of the infantry and the navy of Valpara√≠so until 1846. In 1846, he moved to Santiago de Chile, where he died on November 22, 1854 at the age of 68.

The episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 18 June 2005. It was the second episode of the two-part story. The first part, \\"Bad Wolf\\", was broadcast on 11 June. In the episode, the Dalek race invades the human satellite Satellite Five in the year 200,100, intending to make more Daleks by harvesting dead humans. The alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) plan to use the satellite's transmitter to try to destroy every Dalek, while at the same time sending his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) home to keep her safe. The episode featured Christopher Eccleston making his last appearance as the Ninth Doctor and marks the first appearance of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. Plot The Ninth Doctor uses the extrapolator on the TARDIS to generate a protective shield around it as he materialises the TARDIS around Rose to rescue her from the Daleks. The Doctor discovers the Daleks' Emperor survived the Time War and escaped to Earth in a crippled ship, where he rebuilt the Dalek race by harvesting DNA material from humanity. Returning to Satellite Five, Captain Jack uses the extrapolator to shield the top six floors of the station and sets up defensive positions. The Doctor attempts to create a delta wave generator which will destroy the Daleks, but also life on Earth. The Doctor tricks Rose into going inside the TARDIS, and uses his sonic screwdriver to direct the TARDIS to return Rose to her home time to keep her safe. The Daleks invade the station, exterminating everyone in their path. After being returned home, Rose begins to notice the words \\"Bad Wolf\\" - words which also exist on Satellite Five - and realises that they are a message rather than a warning. She convinces Mickey and Jackie to help her open the heart of the TARDIS. Mickey uses a truck borrowed by Jackie to pull the panel on the console open and Rose is bathed in the light of the TARDIS. The TARDIS doors slam on Mickey and Jackie as they try to enter, and it then dematerialises. The Daleks reach the top of Satellite Five, exterminating Jack and Lynda in the process. They file into the control room while the Doctor contemplates firing the delta wave, eventually deciding he cannot do it. Before the Daleks can kill the Doctor, Rose arrives in the TARDIS, wrapped in the glow of the time vortex. She declares that she is the \\"Bad Wolf\\", spreading the words ‚ÄúBad Wolf‚Äù throughout time and space as a message to lead her there. Rose disintegrates the Dalek fleet. The Doctor begs her to relinquish her new power, but instead she resurrects Jack. Rose begins to suffer the effects of the power, and the Doctor kisses her, absorbing the entire power of the vortex into his own body to save her life. He releases it back into the TARDIS and carries an unconscious Rose back inside. They leave in the TARDIS before Jack can get back to them. As a result of absorbing the energy of the time vortex, every cell in the Doctor's body begins to die. He then regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. The Emperor Dalek, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. Production This was the first episode in this series which was not given a press screening prior to the broadcast. Radio Times stated, \\"No preview tape was available for this episode.\\" The episode was, however, screened for BAFTA on 15 June 2005. According to Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Magazine, Jack was left behind because they wanted to explore the effects of the regeneration on Rose (noting that Jack would have taken the regeneration \\"in his stride\\"). Jack returned in the Doctor Who spin- off series Torchwood, which began broadcasting in October 2006. In an interview in Doctor Who Magazine, Russell T Davies stated that an alternate ending for this episode was written and filmed, with the intention that it would be shown to press previewers to hide the secret of the regeneration. The \\"false\\" ending would have featured similar dialogue to the televised final scene, but the TARDIS would have scanned Rose and the viewers would have seen the display read: \\"LIFEFORM DYING\\". Davies considered this scene inferior to the one actually shown but suggested that it might be suitable as an extra on a DVD someday. On the DVD commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner and Billie Piper briefly discuss this ending, which Gardner describes as featuring Rose's death; unlike Davies, Gardner expresses doubts that it will be issued on DVD (it was not included in the Series 1 DVD set). David Tennant's portion of the regeneration scene was actually filmed much later than Eccleston's and without the presence of Billie Piper. Tennant's segment was recorded with him speaking to a piece of sticky tape indicating Piper's eyeline and then edited into the broadcast version. It was recorded on 21 April 2005. The Doctor claims that he is known in Dalek legend as \\"the Oncoming Storm\\", a title that first appeared in the Virgin New Adventures novel Love and War by Paul Cornell (who wrote the episode \\"Father's Day\\"). In the novel, the title was applied to the Doctor by the Draconians. Eccleston's planned departure was leaked early by the BBC on 30 March 2005. They claimed that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April, they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. In 2010, Eccleston denied the typecast claim, explaining that he was not comfortable in the working environment. He later stated that he could not get along with some of the \\"senior people\\". According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure was announced revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. Tennant was offered to replace the role when he was watching a pre-transmission copy of Casanova with Davies and Gardner. Though Tennant initially believed the offer was a joke, he accepted the role after he realised they were serious and was announced as Eccleston's replacement on 16 April 2005. Broadcast and reception \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" received overnight ratings of 6.2 million viewers, a 42% audience share and the most-watched programme of the night. When final consolidated ratings were calculated, figures rose to 6.91 million. The episode was broadcast in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on 9 June 2006. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 89. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan wrote that the finale was \\"something of an anti climax\\", with the Bad Wolf resolution being a \\"let down\\" and the regeneration \\"a bit rushed\\" and \\"lacking in the sort of emotional tension that has been one of this series hallmarks\\". SFX gave \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" a score of nine out of ten, calling the two-parter Davies' \\"finest work this season\\", especially praising the emotional moments. However, he felt that two aspects of \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" let the story down: the Bad Wolf resolution and the deus ex machina of Rose's transformation. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the episode, stating that it was \\"inventive, gripping entertainment\\" and that \\"for the first time, Doctor Who has a proper, exhilarating season finale.\\" Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised the \\"mad energy\\" of the two-parter but felt the Dalek plan was \\"convoluted and a whole bunch of seemingly important stuff ... is brushed aside in the rush to the Doctor's big moral dilemma\\". Wilkins also pointed out that the story had to deal with Eccleston's abrupt departure, and as a result there was little thematic build-up and the regeneration feels \\"bolted on to the rest of the story\\". Despite this, Wilkins ranked it the best regeneration and the third best regeneration story (as of 2010).

Initially, the University's new law school used one of the old university buildings and the main, original building was leased first to Seattle Public Schools and then to the Seattle Public Library. As construction of commercial buildings began, this original building was moved a few blocks to a site along Fifth Avenue. However, the building fell into increasing disrepair, and an effort led by Edmond Meany to move it to the new campus and rehabilitate it was unsuccessful.IX.

On December 9, 1902, the regents voted to lease rather than sell, although one strip on the northwest corner of the site was sold to the U.S. government for a federal building, on the assumption that this building would increase the value of the rest of the tract. The initial 1902 lessee, the University Site Improvement Company, began construction on building for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, but the lease was soon forfeited. Next, the land was leased on November 1, 1904 by James A. Moore, who completed the P-I building and oversaw the continuation of Fourth Avenue through the old campus. In 1907, the same year he opened the Moore Theatre and Hotel, Moore transferred the remaining 47 years of his lease to the Metropolitan Building Company who engaged the New York firm of Howells & Stokes to assemble a master plan for integrated development. Howells & Stokes intended to create a \\"city within a city.\\" At the time, it was the largest development of a downtown site undertaken in the United States. Howells & Stokes' design included a department store, offices, a hotel, housing and a small plaza, all to be built in a similar style and scale. All buildings in the tract were to be 11 stories tall, with terracotta ornamentation at the top and street levels and brick in-between. Their decoration would combine elements of the Beaux Arts and commercial (Chicago school) styles, such as symmetry and a clearly marked storefront. Ten structures were proposed; of these, five were actually built. Howells & Stokes employed Abraham H. Albertson in Seattle to be their local representative and oversee the construction. After the firm closed in 1917, Albertson and other former employees continued the project under the successor firm Howells & Albertson. As of 2007, the Cobb Building is the only one of the original buildings to survive. Currently, the Metropolitan Tract contains over of rentable office space, over of rentable commercial space, some 450 hotel rooms and access to over 2,000 parking spaces. The tract is managed and operated through two long- term leases: one with Legacy Hotels for The Fairmont Olympic Hotel and garage, and the other with UNICO Properties, Inc., for all the other buildings in the Tract.The Metropolitan Tract, University of Washington Real Estate Office.

It is named after the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill. Churchill has the largest student body population in district 39 with about 2000 students in the campus. Churchill is fed by the surrounding elementary schools in its catchment area. They include Sir Wilfrid Laurier Elementary School, Dr. Annie B. Jamieson Elementary School, Sir William Osler Elementary School, J.W. Sexsmith Elementary School, and David Lloyd George Elementary School. Although not within Churchill's catchment area, L'√âcole Bilingue, Kerrisdale Elementary School, L'√âcole Quilchena and Sir James Douglas Elementary School feed into its French Immersion Program. Special programs =IB programme= Churchill Secondary offers an International Baccalaureate Programme, which attracts many students from the school district to apply. The school also offers the IB Certificate Programme, which allows students in the regular BC provincial curriculum to take part in IB courses. This option is only open when there is a vacancy in that particular class. IB courses include English, French, Japanese, Mandarin, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Art, Psychology, Film Studies, Theatre, Mathematics, and Theory of Knowledge. French Immersion students entering the IB Programme may opt to take a more advanced French course, allowing them to earn a BC French Dogwood Diploma and a bilingual IB diploma simultaneously. Information sessions are held each year for entry into the program which requires a written application, previous academic performance record, standardized testing (PSAT), and an interview. As part of Global Families, a project where IB students choose a developing country to educate others on, students host World Awareness Day in which they set up displays in downtown Vancouver to teach the public about their country of choice. Students can also get involved as a member of IB Council or as an IB Director. The program prepares students for post-secondary studies, with the possibility of receiving post-secondary credit for transferable courses, and many of Churchill's IB graduates go on to study at the University of British Columbia. =Prelude programme= There is also a Pre-IB programme in grade 10 which is called Prelude from 2016. Prelude is available for both French Immersion and English students. There is one class of French Immersion Prelude students and two classes of English Prelude Students. =Ideal Mini School= Ideal Mini School is a grade 8‚Äì12 mini school program. =Synergy programme= The Synergy programme is for students in grades 8 and 9 who have demonstrated excellence and wish to augment their learning through an enhanced curriculum.

It is the longest extant species of beetle in the world, and is also one of the largest flying insects in the world. Etymology Dynastes hercules is known for its tremendous strength and is named after Hercules, a hero of classical mythology who is famed for his great strength. Taxonomy D. hercules has a complex taxonomic history and has been known by several synonyms. It is in the subfamily Dynastinae (rhinoceros beetles) in the larger family Scarabaeidae (commonly known as scarab beetles). Not counting subspecies of D. hercules, seven other species are recognized in the genus Dynastes. =Subspecies= Several subspecies of D. hercules have been named, though still some uncertainty exists as to the validity of the named taxa.Huang, J., Knowles, L. The species versus subspecies conundrum: quantitative delimitation from integrating multiple data types within a single bayesian approach in Hercules beetles. Systematic Biology, vol. 65, 2015, 15p. *Dynastes hercules ecuatorianus Ohaus, 1913 *Dynastes hercules hercules (Linnaeus, 1758) *Dynastes hercules lichyi Lachaume, 1985 *Dynastes hercules morishimai Nagai, 2002 *Dynastes hercules occidentalis Lachaume, 1985 *Dynastes hercules paschoali Grossi & Arnaud, 1993 *Dynastes hercules reidi Chalumeau, 1977 (= baudrii Pinchon, 1976) *Dynastes hercules septentrionalis Lachaume, 1985 (= tuxtlaensis Moron, 1993) *Dynastes hercules takakuwai Nagai, 2002 *Dynastes hercules trinidadensis Chalumeau & Reid, 1995 (= bleuzeni Silvestre and Dechambre, 1995) Description Adult body sizes (not including the thoracic horn) vary between in length and in width. Male Hercules beetles may reach up to in length (including the horn), making them the longest species of beetle in the world, if jaws and/or horns are included in the measurement. The size of the horn is naturally variable, more so than any variation of the size of legs, wings, or overall body size in the species. This variability results from developmental mechanisms that coincide with genetic predisposition in relation to nutrition, stress, exposure to parasites, and/or physiological conditions. D. hercules is highly sexually dimorphic, with only males exhibiting the characteristic horns (one on the head, and a much larger one on the prothorax). The body of males is black with the exception of the elytra, which can have shades of olive-green. They have a black suture with sparsely distributed black spots elsewhere on the elytra. They have a slightly iridescent coloration to their elytra, which varies in color between specimens and may be affected by the humidity of the local environment in which they develop.. At low humidity the elytra are olive-green or yellow in color, but darken to black at higher humidity due to changes in light refraction. Females of D. hercules have punctured elytra which are usually entirely black, but sometimes have the last quarter of the elytra colored in the same way as the males. File:Dynastes hercules (female).jpgFemale File:Dynastes hercules hercules01.JPGMale Distribution and habitat Populations of D. hercules may be found from southern Mexico to Bolivia in mountainous and lowland rain forests. Known populations include the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. Chromosomal analysis has shown that the genus Dynastes in fact originated from South America. Life cycle Larva of D. hercules Not much is known about the life cycle in the wild, but much evidence has been gained through observations of captive-bred populations. The mating season for adults typically occurs during the rainy season (July to December). Females have an average gestation period of 30 days from copulation to egg-laying, and may lay up to 100 eggs on the ground or on dead wood. The eggs have an incubation period of approximately 27.7 days before they hatch. Once hatched, the larval stage of the Hercules beetle may last up to two years in duration, where it will go through 3 metamorphosis stages, also known as instars. The larvae have a yellow body with a black head. The larvae can grow up to in length and weigh more than 100 grams. In laboratory conditions at 25 ¬± 1¬∞C, the first instar stage lasts an average of 50 days, the second stage an average of 56 days, and the third an average of 450 days. After the third instar stage, the pupal stage lasts about 32 days, where it will transition into an adult. Adult beetles can live for three to six months in captivity. Diet and behavior =Diet= The larvae of the Hercules beetle are saproxylophagous, this means that they feed on rotting wood, in which they also reside during the two-year developmental stage. The adult Hercules beetle feeds on fresh and rotting fruit. They have been observed feeding on peaches, pears, apples, and grapes in captivity.Krell, F., Krell, V. Longevity of the Western Hercules beetle, D. grantii Horn (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae). The Coleopterists Bulletin, vol. 69, 2015, 1p. =Behavior= Within their native rain forest habitats, the adult beetles, which are nocturnal, forage for fruit at night and hide or burrow within the leaf litter during the day. The adult D. hercules beetles are capable of creating a 'huffing' sound, generated by stridulating their abdomen against their elytra to serve as a warning to predators. Like most insects, communication within the species is a mix of chemoreception, sight, and mechanical perception. Experiments on D. hercules have shown that a male placed in the vicinity of a female will immediately orient towards her and seek her out, suggesting chemical communication through strong sexual pheromones. = Combat Behavior Between Males = It has been observed in wild habitat and in captivity that male D. hercules will engage in combat to win possession and mating rights to a female. Male Hercules beetles typically use their large horns to settle mating disputes; these fights can cause significant physical damage to the combatants but may also include possible damage to the female in the process. During fights, the males attempt to grab and pin their rival between the cephalic and thoracic horns to lift and throw them. The successful male wins mating rights with the female, though the beetles remain polygynandrous. =Physical strength= Reports suggest the Hercules beetle is able to carry up to 850 times its body mass. Actual measurements on a much smaller (and relatively stronger: see square-cube law) species of rhinoceros beetle shows a carrying capacity only up to 100 times their body mass, at which point they can barely move. Relationship to humans D. hercules does not negatively affect human activities, either as an agricultural pest or disease vector. The beetles can be kept as pets.  Relationship to the environment  D. hercules is a beneficial contributor to the rain forest ecosystem, primarily during their larval stage where they are saproxylophagous.

He has been the host of The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll on CFRA in Ottawa since March 7, 2016. In June 2015, Carroll was named #5 on Newsmax's 50 most influential local talk radio hosts. Biography Carroll was born in Scotland on July 29, 1959 and grew up in Coatbridge near Glasgow. He came with his family to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the late 1960s. The family first lived in Don Mills in an apartment (later in a townhouse in Scarborough), where he attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute, a few years before Mike Myers. Bill married Sylvie LaPointe in July 2003. They have two children, Killian and Magalie. Like Bill's father, Magalie was born with spina bifida. Bill has cited as one of the reasons for his relocation to California was to be closer to Ramon Cuevas, a physical therapist who had worked with Magalie. Career Out of high school in 1980, Carroll moved to New Liskeard, Ontario. \\"My first job was as news director for the station CJTT. This meant I was also the morning news anchor and the news reporter ‚Äî I was a one-man department. But it was a great place to learn about broadcast journalism. \\"I hadn't formally studied journalism, so once I got the job I bought every book on broadcast journalism I could find. At night I would study to be a broadcast journalist, and practice during the day.\\" Bill was the co-host of MuchMusic's game show spoof Test Pattern, along with Dan Gallagher. After a stint in Peterborough, Ontario, he joined Q107 in Toronto, on a news program named \\"Barometer\\". He subsequently worked at its sister station TALK 640 as morning host, before joining CFRB in 1998; first as a weekend newscaster and entertainment reporter, then as news director, before assuming his talk show. In October 2004, Carroll was named to host Global Television's Focus Ontario, a weekly public affairs show. His tenure there lasted until fall 2005, when he was replaced by Sean Mallen. On December 21, 2012, Carroll made an announcement on his Facebook page. \\"Today I have in my hand a new long term agreement to remain at KFI. Awesome! But that's not all. Starting January 7th next year, my Toronto fans can hear me each weekday on Talk Radio AM640 as they drive home from 4 to 7 PM. A completely different show for Toronto listeners on issues they care about. 640 in L.A. and 640 in T.O. It's almost poetic. To my Toronto fans, thanks so for missing me.\\" He was joined on AM640 Toronto by Sandy Salerno and Chris Chreston. On January 7, 2016, at the end of the final hour of his daily broadcast, Carroll announced that this would be his last show on KFI, and that he was leaving, effective immediately, and moving back to Canada to be closer to family. On February 5, 2016, at the end of his show, Carroll announced that he had decided not to stay on CFMJ- AM640 as he was not able to secure a long term contract renewal and wanted certainty for his family. The February 5th show was his last show for CFMJ. On February 18, 2016, Carroll was announced as the new morning host on AM 580 CFRA in Ottawa to premiere on March 7. The new program is to be called \\"The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll\\". News =FLICK-OFF Campaign= On April 26, 2007 the Ontario Provincial government launched a new environment campaign with a slogan \\"FLICK-OFF\\". The phrase resembled the derogatory phrase fuck off (because the 'L' and the 'I' together could be perceived as a 'U'). Carroll claimed children will see the derogatory word, sending the wrong message. He sarcastically told the government and some callers to Flick-off on live radio. =Switch over= On December 15, 2006, it was announced on The Six O'clock News Hour that Bill Carroll would be replacing Ted Woloshyn as host of The Morning Show starting January 2007. Woloshyn had announced that very morning that he was resigning, after celebrating his tenth anniversary as CFRB Morning host (following Wally Crouter's 50-year tenure). However, Carroll unlike Woloshyn, started his show at 6:00 am instead of 5:30 am. His show ends at 10:00 am instead of 8:30 am. In 2009, he was moved to the 9 am to 1 pm slot as host of an eponymous program which ran until his move to Los Angeles the next year. =Lawsuit= In March 2007, Tim Hortons filed a defamation lawsuit against Carroll, Standard Radio, which owned CFRB, and CanWest for his allegations on CFRB and Global TV that the Canadian taxpayers were footing the bill for its well-publicised franchise in Afghanistan. Carroll said on his Global TV commentary: \\"Tim Hortons has been sliding by on the great publicity about the Kandahar franchise all these months and then Global uncovers the dirty little secret. You and I, the taxpayers, are picking up $4 or 5 million dollars a year so that they can look good to the public ... Shame on Tim Hortons.\\" Tim Hortons Inc. is seeking $35 million from all three for the false statement. Personal Carroll sat as a member of the Board of Governors for the Canadian student newspaper, The Prince Arthur Herald.\\"Board of Governors - The Prince Arthur Herald\\" , \\"The Prince Arthur Herald\\", 2011.

It is located on the B709, around south-west of the town of Selkirk. Local area Ettrick Water is the river which flows through the Ettrick Valley, and across its flood plain, the Ettrick Marshes, within Selkirkshire. It is the second fastest rising river in Scotland, and it runs through the village of Ettrickbridge some dozen miles downstream, and the old town of Selkirk. Ettrick Forest was a large Royal forest that is much depleted due to sheep farming and industrial forestry, though at some places by the banks of the Water, and in the ravines of its tributaries, places difficult for sheep and of small interest to loggers, the remnants of the fauna which composed the ancient forest can still be seen and enjoyed. Traditionally, hill farming of sheep and cattle farming have been important. In recent years, tourism has become increasingly important. Literary connections The area around Ettrick has several literary connections. The poet James Hogg (1770‚Äì1835), known as the \\"Ettrick Shepherd\\", was born at a farm within Ettrick parish, near Ettrick Hall, and is buried in Ettrick Kirkyard. \\"Laverlaw\\", the fictional estate of Sandy Arbuthnot, Lord Clanroyden, in the works of John Buchan, is set near Ettrick. Robert Louis Stevenson's hero David Balfour in Kidnapped hails from the fictitious village of \\"Essendean\\" in Ettrick Forest. It is also mentioned in the traditional Scottish folksong, \\"Ettrick Lady\\", recorded by The Corries. Most recently, the Ettrick valley was used as the setting for the story \\"No Advantages\\", from Alice Munro's 2006 short story collection, The View from Castle Rock. Ettrick was also home to one of Scotland's most enduring theologians, Rev Thomas Boston (1676‚Äì1732), Ettrick's minister from 1707. His seminal work, Human Nature in its Fourfold State, was widely read throughout Scotland by people of all classes and is still in print today. Tibbie Shiel, the topic of much literature, was born here and is buried here.

Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 80. She is the elderly and mild-mannered Ruler of the Gillikin Country. Her only significant appearance in Baum's work is in Chapter 2 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), in which she introduces Dorothy to Oz and sends her to meet the Wizard, after placing a protective kiss on her forehead. She makes a brief cameo appearance at Princess Ozma's birthday party in The Road to Oz (1909), but is otherwise only mentioned elsewhere in the series. L. Frank Baum presented her as an extremely kind and gentle character who stood against the oppression and subjugation of people. She became the Ruler of the Gillikin Country in the North after freeing the Gillikins from the clutches of Mombi, the erstwhile Wicked Witch of the North. However, the character's kindness and magnanimity of spirit was not confined to her own domain, and she was loved not only by her own subjects but also by other people in Oz, such as the Munchkins. Although she wasn't as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East and was hence unable to depose her the way she deposed Mombi, the Good Witch of the North was nonetheless exceedingly sensitive to the plight of the enslaved Munchkins, who regarded her as their friend. She also appears as a highly altered player in Ruth Plumly Thompson's The Giant Horse of Oz (1928), in which she is called Tattypoo. Her role was significantly expanded in the 1902 musical extravaganza, in which L. Frank Baum named her Locasta. The character was more famously conflated with that of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, for the 1939 film version. Literature = The classic books = In the original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch of the North is summoned to the Munchkin Country when Dorothy Gale's falling house kills the Wicked Witch of the East. She arrives at the site of the Wicked Witch's death with three Munchkins and is the only one brave enough to speak to Dorothy, who, having killed the Witch of the East, is believed to be a powerful sorceress. She welcomes Dorothy to the Land of the Munchkins, points out the body of the dead witch and then introduces herself as the Witch of the North. Having been told that all witches are evil, Dorothy is initially frightened of her, but she assures Dorothy that she is a good witch who is much loved by her people. She also mentions that she is not as powerful as the Witch of the East had been, or she would have liberated the Munchkins from slavery herself. Using a magic slate formed from her hat, she advises Dorothy to travel to the Emerald City to seek the aid of the powerful Wizard of Oz in returning to Kansas. She kisses Dorothy on the forehead, a magical act that serves to protect Dorothy on the journey, because \\"no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North\\". This statement is proven to be correct later in the book, when the sight of the shining mark left by the kiss prevents Dorothy from being harmed by the Winged monkeys or the Wicked Witch of the West. The sight of this mark is also one of the factors which convinces the Wizard to admit Dorothy to his presence. At the beginning of The Marvelous Land of Oz, it is revealed that the Good Witch of the North had banned the practice of magic by any other witch in Gillikin Country (thereby minimizing potential future threats). The Gillikin Country had once been under the power of Mombi, but she was overpowered and routed by the Good Witch of the North, as revealed in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz. Thus, the Wicked Witch of the North was forced to be no more than a lowly wizardess, under the Good Witch of the North's rule. In Baum's fifth Oz book, The Road to Oz, the Witch of the North is one of the many guests who attend Ozma's birthday party. She amuses the attendees by transforming ten stones into ten birds, the ten birds into ten lambs, and the ten lambs into ten little girls, who gave a pretty dance and were then transformed back into ten stones once again. The name of the Good Witch of the North in Baum's own stage version of The Wizard of Oz is Locasta.  The 1939 movie  Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland, right) with Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) in 1939 film The Wizard of Oz In the classic 1939 MGM movie The Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch of the North is called Glinda, which is the name of the Good Witch of the South in the Oz novels. In the movie, Glinda the Good Witch of the North, portrayed by Billie Burke, is only slightly matronly and quite beautiful, and in addition to meeting Dorothy on her arrival in Oz, she also supervises her progress on her journey to the Wizard and helps her find her way back to Kansas at the end of the story. She wears a coral pink ball gown with a matching crown and carries a long magic wand with a glittering star on the tip. Although the existence of a \\"Good Witch of the South\\" is implied by the cardinal point names of Glinda and the other two witches, the film makes no direct reference to such a character.  Later works  In The Giant Horse of Oz, Ruth Plumly Thompson names the Good Witch of the North \\"Tattypoo\\"; as the story unfolds, Tattypoo turns out to be the bewitched form of a beautiful Munchkin queen named Orin. Orin had originally been kidnapped by the former Wicked Witch of the North, Mombi, who was in love with her husband, King Cheeriobed of the Ozure Isles. In order to remove her rival, Mombi kidnapped Orin soon after the birth of her son, Prince Philador. She then transformed Orin into an old witch who had no recollection of her former life as Queen of the Ozure Isles. Eventually, as Tattypoo, Orin was able to displace Mombi as the ruler of the Gillikins. After being restored to her real self, twenty five years later, Orin loses the magical powers she acquired as the Good Witch of the North. She returns to her husband and son and resumes her life as Queen of the Ozure Isles, no longer wishing to rule the Gillikin Country. At the end of the book, Princess Ozma proclaims Jo King and Queen Hyacinth from a Gillikin province named Up Town as the new rulers of the Gillikins. In 2000, Dave Hardenbrook published The Unknown Witches of Oz, with Locasta, the Good Witch of the North, as the main protagonist. Dave Hardenbrook wished to reconcile L. Frank Baum's original version of the character with Ruth Plumly Thompson's version. In Hardenbrook's novel, Locasta and Queen Orin were \\"switched\\" by Mombi, the same way Mombi \\"switched\\" herself with the maid Jellia Jamb in L. Frank Baum's novel, The Marvelous Land of Oz. Locasta, the true Good Witch of the North, was lost in the Great Outside World, while the enchanted Queen Orin took her title under the name of Tattypoo. Hardenbrook's novel outlines Locasta's return to the Land of Oz.Hardenbrook Dave (2003). OZ / NONESTICA FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS, Nonestica  The Online Oz Fan Club! In Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic Land series, the Witch's name is Villina. When the Wicked Witch of the East tried (in that continuity) to exterminate the humanity by means of a magical hurricane, Villina changed the spell so that it only affected one house (which, as her magical book said, was always empty during storms), and dropped it upon the Wicked Witch. Her magical slate is changed into a tiny book which transforms into a giant tome when blown upon, and, in addition to the divination qualities, also functions as an encyclopedia. She appears in two books after the first one (although in one of them she appears off stage, and it is narrated to the main characters). Wicked Both Gregory Maguire's 1995 revisionist novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West and the musical Wicked (based on the book), follow the model of the 1939 movie in giving the name \\"Glinda\\" to the character who grows up to become The Good Witch of the North. See the article on Glinda the Good Witch for more information on this character. The Wiz In William F. Brown and Charlie Smalls's Broadway hit, The Wiz, the Good Witch of the North is named \\"Addaperle\\". She is portrayed by Clarice Taylor. Amber Riley played the role in the 2015 television special. In the 1978 film version, her name is \\"Miss One\\" (played by Thelma Carpenter). Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, is a separate character in both stage and film versions. Animation In the 1982 anime film, The Good Witch of the North is again the grandmotherly figure of the novel. In the American version, she is voiced by an unbilled Elizabeth Hanna, who also played the Wicked Witch of the West. While appearing very young, Glinda (Wendy Thatcher) refers to the Good Witch of the North as her sister. Glinda, along with her other good witch counterpart, appear in a little-known 1995 version of The Wizard of Oz made for British television. After the defeat of the Wicked Witch of the West, she reveals to Dorothy (Denise Van Outen) that the Ruby Slippers ended up in the possession of the Wicked Witch of the East after falling off the feet of a previous visitor from over the rainbow (Z√∂e Salmon, in a cameo appearance) after she wished to go back to where she came from. She refuses to take possession of them, as she's afraid of being tempted by their power, so she summons the other good witch, who takes them after Dorothy wishes herself home. In The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, Glinda and the Good Witch of the North are again separate characters (and the Good Witch of the North has the name Tattypoo), although they are both played by Miss Piggy (as are the two Wicked Witches). Miss Piggy's other role was herself. Prior to Dorothy's return, she appears with Kermit and tries to get rid of Dorothy. After Dorothy's return, she returns for the Muppets' show. The VeggieTales episode The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's from Big Idea Productions contains Madame Blueberry as \\"Splenda the Sweet But Non-Fattening Fairy\\" (brand name for a sugar substitute) replacing both of the two Good Witches. She makes no appearance in the Disney film Oz the Great and Powerful because this film has Glinda as the Good Witch of the South. Television The \\"Witch of the North\\", played by Karen Holness, makes an appearance in the third season of Once Upon a Time. She is initially a good witch, helping out Glinda as part of the Sisterhood of Witches. Later, after the Wicked Witch of the West takes over Emerald City, She is relocated back to the North, where she becomes the cruel \\"Wicked Witch of the North\\" and is responsible for turning Stanum into the Tin Man.

The school is a function of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tulsa and operates in the Lasallian tradition of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (Christian Brothers or the French Christian Brothers). Bishop Kelley is a comprehensive secondary school with a college- preparatory style curriculum consisting of tracks designed to fit a variety of learning abilities and interests. Bishop Kelley students come from 53 different zip codes, with incoming freshmen and transfer students matriculating from more than 30 middle schools across Northeast Oklahoma. Students come from a variety of faith and educational backgrounds. They are traditionally welcomed with extensive freshman orientation activities. Though Bishop Kelley is the flagship diocesan Catholic high school for the Diocese of Tulsa, it serves both Catholic and non-Catholic students. The school consistently ranks as one of the best private high schools in Oklahoma. History Bishop Kelley was established in 1960 to serve as Tulsa's citywide Catholic high school. At the time of its founding, its forerunners, Holy Family High School (founded 1899) and Marquette High School (founded in 1926), closed and consolidated their student bodies into the newly formed Bishop Kelley High School. While the initial plans for the school were developed under Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness' leadership, it was the pioneering Bishop Victor Joseph Reed who oversaw its founding. Bishop Reed was a famous Catholic reformer who attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, where he was associated with the more progressive bishops, lending his support to the use of vernacular in the Mass and to an emphasis of pastoral over administrative skills in bishops. Bishop Reed is in part responsible for the high school's legacy of lay leadership. In 1960, the year Bishop Kelley High School was founded, Bishop Reed established the first mixed (clerical and lay) diocesan board of education in the United States. The school was named for Bishop Francis Kelley, the second bishop of Oklahoma. The founder of the Catholic Church Extension Society, Bishop Kelley was an accomplished author and diplomat, whom H.L. Mencken described as \\"a charming Irishman\\" who \\"has had a brilliant career in the Church.\\" He famously partnered with California oilman Edward L. Doheny to support Catholic philanthropy. At its founding, male students were taught by the LaSallian (French) Christian Brothers, who still teach at the school, while the Sisters of Divine Providence from San Antonio, Texas taught the female students. By 1965, the school had become entirely coeducational. By 1982, the Sisters of Divine Providence had been reassigned to other ministries. The original school building was designed by architect Robert Lawton Jones, a Tulsa Catholic who had been a protege of Mies Van der Rohe.

The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 when the forces of North Korea invaded South Korea. 17,000 Australians fought under the command of the United Nations until the armistice in 1953.http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/war-memorial This memorial commemorates and honours those who died and served. Sculpture Sculpture The design of the memorial characterises the period of the Korean War. The use of white and grey tones, and granite and gravel, recall the harsh climate and terrain that were lasting impressions for those who fought there. On both sides of the memorial are figures representing Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen who served in Korea. Battlefield boulders are set in fields of stainless steel poles which symbolise those who died. A central walk-way leads to a semi-enclosed contemplative space. A boulder from a Korean battlefield is a focal commemorative point with the words \\"Peace and Independence\\" inscribed in Korean. Inside are images, maps and text etched into stainless steel panels telling the story of the Australians who served in the Korean War, on the left telling the general story and on the right telling of particular involvement of the Navy (nine ships and an air group), Army (3 RAR, and elements of 1 & 2 RAR), and Air Force (77 Squadron and other elements). A scroll recognises the 21 nations that committed troops or medical units to the UN command. The obelisk at the front commemorates those who died with no known graves. The inscription, taken from the UN Memorial Cemetery, Busan, is a poignant link with the Australians who are buried there. Dedications A ground-breaking ceremony was conducted on 17 September 1999 by Kim Dae-jung, President of the Republic of Korea and John Howard MP, Prime Minister of Australia, which is commemorated by a foundation stone. The memorial was dedicated in the presence of Sir William Deane AC K.B.E., Governor-General of Australia and John Howard MP, Prime Minister of Australia.

Background Although in 1915 Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, the Italian government of Antonio Salandra had entered into clandestine discussions to join the Triple Entente. This led to the signing of the secret Treaty of London on 26 April by which Italy agreed to enter the war within one month. On 4 May Italy renounced the Triple Alliance, but did not yet enter the war in the side of the Entente as a majority in parliament continued to favour neutrality. The former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was warned that Salandra intended to take the country to war, and on 9 May he returned to Rome to try to prevent this. On 10 May he tried to persuade King Victor Emmanuel that a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies would show that parliament did not support entry into the war. Realising that he could not secure a majority, on 13 May, Salandra resigned. Popular unrest The return of Giolitti to Rome made nationalists and pro-war advocates fear that he would once again become Prime Minister and keep Italy out of the war. This led to the publication of many hostile stories in the press, asserting that Italian pride and honour demanded war. In a speech on 12 May, Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio incited violence, saying that those who refused to take up arms were traitors, and urging the Romans to throw all the filth into the sewers. The following day, the neutralist deputy and former minister Pietro Bertolini was assaulted by an angry mob in the Piazza Colonna while riding on a tram. Other deputies, Luigi Facta, Antonio Graziadei, :it:Domenico Valenzani and :it:Vito De Bellis were also threatened and jeered at. In a number of cities there were violent demonstrations and a number of newspaper offices were sacked. In Bologna, the socialist deputy :it:Nino Mazzoni was chased and beaten. On 14 May, when news of Salandra‚Äôs resignation became public, a crowd of young people besieged the Palazzo Montecitorio where the Italian Chamber of Deputies was sitting, and attempted to set fire to its doors. They were disgusted with representative democracy and in favour of an irridentist war to secure Trieste and Trentino. They articulated a belief that unless it declared war, Italy would become an ‚Äúeffeminate‚Äù country. Protests spread into government departments on 15 May, when senior officials led their demonstrations of support for Salandra, who seems to have at least tacitly welcomed this unusual breach of civil service norms. Impact Giolitti declined the king‚Äôs offer to form a government, and on 16th May Salandra was invited to return as Prime Minister. Strongly influenced by these demonstrations of public ardour, on 20 May parliament voted to declare war on the Central Powers and on 22 May it granted full power to the government to censor the press and to pass public order laws for the duration of the war. On 23 May Italy entered the war. ‚ÄúRadiosomaggismo‚Äù has been discussed as an early indicator of the rise of fascism in Italy, as it involved a popular movement with violently reactionary views. Both its takeover of the streets and the disillusionment of sections of the middle class with the traditional liberalism of Giolitti that it represented were characteristics of the fascist movement when it emerged.

The idea behind Hubs and Authorities stemmed from a particular insight into the creation of web pages when the Internet was originally forming; that is, certain web pages, known as hubs, served as large directories that were not actually authoritative in the information that they held, but were used as compilations of a broad catalog of information that led users direct to other authoritative pages. In other words, a good hub represents a page that pointed to many other pages, while a good authority represents a page that is linked by many different hubs. The scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages. History =In journals= Many methods have been used to rank the importance of scientific journals. One such method is Garfield's impact factor. Journals such as Science and Nature are filled with numerous citations, making these magazines have very high impact factors. Thus, when comparing two more obscure journals which have received roughly the same number of citations but one of these journals has received many citations from Science and Nature, this journal needs be ranked higher. In other words, it is better to receive citations from an important journal than from an unimportant one. =On the Web= This phenomenon also occurs in the Internet. Counting the number of links to a page can give us a general estimate of its prominence on the Web, but a page with very few incoming links may also be prominent, if two of these links come from the home pages of sites like Yahoo!, Google, or MSN. Because these sites are of very high importance but are also search engines, a page can be ranked much higher than its actual relevance. Algorithm Expanding the root set into a base set In the HITS algorithm, the first step is to retrieve the most relevant pages to the search query. This set is called the root set and can be obtained by taking the top pages returned by a text-based search algorithm. A base set is generated by augmenting the root set with all the web pages that are linked from it and some of the pages that link to it. The web pages in the base set and all hyperlinks among those pages form a focused subgraph. The HITS computation is performed only on this focused subgraph. According to Kleinberg the reason for constructing a base set is to ensure that most (or many) of the strongest authorities are included. Authority and hub values are defined in terms of one another in a mutual recursion. An authority value is computed as the sum of the scaled hub values that point to that page. A hub value is the sum of the scaled authority values of the pages it points to. Some implementations also consider the relevance of the linked pages. The algorithm performs a series of iterations, each consisting of two basic steps: *Authority update: Update each node's authority score to be equal to the sum of the hub scores of each node that points to it. That is, a node is given a high authority score by being linked from pages that are recognized as Hubs for information. *Hub update: Update each node's hub score to be equal to the sum of the authority scores of each node that it points to. That is, a node is given a high hub score by linking to nodes that are considered to be authorities on the subject. The Hub score and Authority score for a node is calculated with the following algorithm: * Start with each node having a hub score and authority score of 1. * Run the authority update rule * Run the hub update rule * Normalize the values by dividing each Hub score by square root of the sum of the squares of all Hub scores, and dividing each Authority score by square root of the sum of the squares of all Authority scores. * Repeat from the second step as necessary. HITS, like Page and Brin's PageRank, is an iterative algorithm based on the linkage of the documents on the web. However it does have some major differences: * It is query dependent, that is, the (Hubs and Authority) scores resulting from the link analysis are influenced by the search terms; * As a corollary, it is executed at query time, not at indexing time, with the associated hit on performance that accompanies query-time processing. * It is not commonly used by search engines. (Though a similar algorithm was said to be used by Teoma, which was acquired by Ask Jeeves/Ask.com.) * It computes two scores per document, hub and authority, as opposed to a single score; * It is processed on a small subset of ‚Äòrelevant‚Äô documents (a 'focused subgraph' or base set), not all documents as was the case with PageRank.  In detail  To begin the ranking, we let \\\\mathrm{auth}(p) = 1 and \\\\mathrm{hub}(p) = 1 for each page p . We consider two types of updates: Authority Update Rule and Hub Update Rule. In order to calculate the hub/authority scores of each node, repeated iterations of the Authority Update Rule and the Hub Update Rule are applied. A k-step application of the Hub-Authority algorithm entails applying for k times first the Authority Update Rule and then the Hub Update Rule. =Authority update rule= For each p , we update \\\\mathrm{auth}(p) to \\\\mathrm{auth}(p)=\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum olimits_{q \\\\in P_{to}} \\\\mathrm{hub}(q)where P_{to} is all pages which link to page p. That is, a page's authority score is the sum of all the hub scores of pages that point to it. =Hub update rule= For each p , we update \\\\mathrm{hub}(p) to \\\\mathrm{hub}(p)=\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum olimits_{q \\\\in P_{from}} \\\\mathrm{auth}(q)where P_{from} is all pages which page p links to. That is, a page's hub score is the sum of all the authority scores of pages it points to. = Normalization = The final hub-authority scores of nodes are determined after infinite repetitions of the algorithm. As directly and iteratively applying the Hub Update Rule and Authority Update Rule leads to diverging values, it is necessary to normalize the matrix after every iteration. Thus the values obtained from this process will eventually converge.  Pseudocode  G := set of pages for each page p in G do p.auth = 1 // p.auth is the authority score of the page p p.hub = 1 // p.hub is the hub score of the page p for step from 1 to k do // run the algorithm for k steps norm = 0 for each page p in G do // update all authority values first p.auth = 0 for each page q in p.incomingNeighbors do // p.incomingNeighbors is the set of pages that link to p p.auth += q.hub norm += square(p.auth) // calculate the sum of the squared auth values to normalise norm = sqrt(norm) for each page p in G do // update the auth scores p.auth = p.auth / norm // normalise the auth values norm = 0 for each page p in G do // then update all hub values p.hub = 0 for each page r in p.outgoingNeighbors do // p.outgoingNeighbors is the set of pages that p links to p.hub += r.auth norm += square(p.hub) // calculate the sum of the squared hub values to normalise norm = sqrt(norm) for each page p in G do // then update all hub values p.hub = p.hub / norm // normalise the hub values The hub and authority values converge in the pseudocode above. The code below does not converge, because it is necessary to limit the number of steps that the algorithm runs for. One way to get around this, however, would be to normalize the hub and authority values after each \\"step\\" by dividing each authority value by the square root of the sum of the squares of all authority values, and dividing each hub value by the square root of the sum of the squares of all hub values. This is what the pseudocode above does.  Non- converging pseudocode  G := set of pages for each page p in G do p.auth = 1 // p.auth is the authority score of the page p p.hub = 1 // p.hub is the hub score of the page p function HubsAndAuthorities(G) for step from 1 to k do // run the algorithm for k steps for each page p in G do // update all authority values first p.auth = 0 for each page q in p.incomingNeighbors do // p.incomingNeighbors is the set of pages that link to p p.auth += q.hub for each page p in G do // then update all hub values p.hub = 0 for each page r in p.outgoingNeighbors do // p.outgoingNeighbors is the set of pages that p links to p.hub += r.auth  See also  PageRank References * External links *Create a data search engine from a relational database Search engine in C# based on HITS Link analysis Articles with example pseudocode ","title":"HITS algorithm"},{"id":"1851224","text":"Tom√°s S√©amus Cardinal √ì Fiaich KGCHS (3 November 1923 ‚Äì 8 May 1990) was an Irish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the Catholic Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh from 1977 until his death. He was created a Cardinal in 1979. He was born in 1923 in Cullyhanna,Early years of Cardinal O‚ÄôFiaich and raised in Camlough, County Armagh. Early life and education Tom√°s √ì Fiaich (he began life as Thomas/Tom Fee but while a lecturer in St. Patrick's College Maynooth adopted the fully Gaelicised version) was born in Cullyhanna, South Armagh where his father was a local schoolmaster. He was educated locally before attending St Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh and then proceeded to begin his studies for the priesthood in St Peter's College, Wexford on 6 July 1948. Cardinal John D'Alton appointed him as an assistant priest in Clonfeacle parish, but after √ì Fiaich returned to full health he commenced post-graduate studies in University College, Dublin, (1948‚Äì50), receiving an MA in early and medieval Irish history. Further study followed at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, (1950‚Äì52), culminating in √ì Fiaich receiving a licentiate in historical sciences. In 1952 he returned to Clonfeacle where he remained as assistant priest till following summer 1953 and his appointment to the faculty of St Patrick's College, Maynooth. Member of staff at Maynooth College √ì Fiaich was an academic and noted Irish language scholar, folklorist and historian in the Pontifical University in St Patrick's College, Maynooth, the National Seminary of Ireland.Website for St Patrick's College, Maynooth From 1959 to 1974 he was Professor of Modern Irish History at the college.Irish Times Obituary In this capacity he suggested to Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le that he begin research on Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and his works. He \\"was an inspired lecturer, an open and endearing man, who was loved by his students... Tomas O'Fiaich was my Good Samaritan.\\"Jordan, Anthony J. The Good Samaritan: memoir of a biographer. Westport Books ; pp. 94 & 106‚Äì97 He served as vice president of the college from 1970 to 1974 and was then appointed college president. He held this position until 1977.Significant appointments of Tom√°s √ì Fiaich Archbishop of Armagh Following the relatively early death from cancer of William Cardinal Conway in April 1977, Monsignor √ì Fiaich was appointed Archbishop of Armagh by Pope Paul VI on 18 August 1977. He was consecrated bishop on 2 October 1977. The principal consecrator was the papal nuncio Archbishop Gaetano Alibrandi; the principal co-consecrators were Bishop Francis Lenny, the auxiliary Bishop of Armagh, and Bishop William Philbin, the Bishop of Down and Connor.Ordination of Tom√°s √ì Fiaich to bishop Pope John Paul II raised √ì Fiaich to the cardinalate on 30 June 1979; he was appointed Cardinal-Priest of S. Patrizio that same day.S. Patrizio Cardinal Titular Church =Papal visit 1979= The first major event in √ì Fiaich's cardinalate was the first ever papal visit to Ireland from 29 September to 1 October 1979 by Pope John Paul II. The Pope celebrated Mass before one million people in Phoenix Park, Dublin. His major speech calling on all the organisations that were prolonging The Troubles to end their activities was made in the Archdiocese of Armagh and was followed by a visit to the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo. Cardinal √ì Fiaich was at the Pope's side during the entire visit. =Criticism= √ì Fiaich took a more understanding, or at least a less critical, stance than other episcopal colleagues on militant republicanism in part because of his own upbringing in Crossmaglen. His approach, including visits to republican prisoners in the Maze, triggered many complaints but √ì Fiaich was always adamant that he had pastoral responsibilities and that the strict work of politics especially in an era of Margaret Thatcher as well as Taoisigh such as Jack Lynch and Garret FitzGerald, was not his sphere. Unionists were also critical of √ì Fiaich. Some of √ì Fiaich's sternest critics were in the Irish media, notably The Sunday Independent (which had a very strong anti-terrorism stance) and The Irish Times. He was, however, strongly defended on occasion by The Irish Press (a more nationalist paper) and An Phoblacht (which had a very pro-Sinn F√©in/IRA stance). =Hunger strikes= During the IRA hunger strikes √ì Fiaich was believed by many to have been a privately influential figure among militant republican supporters, credited with helping end the first hunger strike through direct contact with militant republicans in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland.Cardinal O‚ÄôFiaich visits the Maze He visited the Maze and witnessed the \\"Dirty Protest\\" (where prisoners rubbed their faeces on the walls of their cells and left food to rot on cell floors, while just wearing blankets and refusing to wash, in protest at the withdrawal of Special Category Status from militant republican prisoners). He stated: :\\"I was shocked at by the inhuman conditions . . . where over 300 prisoners are incarcerated. One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being. The nearest approach to it that I have seen was the spectacle of hundreds of homeless people living in sewer pipes in the slums of Calcutta.\\" The bust of Cardinal √ì Fiaich in Ranafast, Co. Donegal, Republic of Ireland. When hunger striker Raymond McCreesh died, √ì Fiaich said: :\\"Raymond McCreesh was captured bearing arms at the age of 19 and sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. I have no doubt that he would have never seen the inside of a jail but for the abnormal political situation. Who is entitled to label him a murderer or a suicide?\\" While the Cardinal showed deep concern for the treatment of prisoners, he was equally critical of those who used violence to further the cause of Irish nationalism.Cardinal O‚ÄôFiaich criticises violence =David Armstrong affair= In 1983, the Reverend David Armstrong, a Presbyterian minister, was forced to leave Limavady due to threats that followed his wishing Father Kevin Mullan's Catholic congregation \\"Happy Christmas\\". Cardinal √ì Fiaich gave the clergyman a cash donation to help him resettle in England. (8 October 2008) =Vatican service= During his tenure, Cardinal √ì Fiaich attended many synods and meetings of the Sacred College of Cardinals. The main meetings were * First Plenary Assembly of the Sacred College of Cardinals, Vatican City, 5‚Äì9 November 1979 * World Synod of Bishops (Ordinary assembly), Vatican City, 26 September ‚Äì 25 October 1980 * World Synod of Bishops (Ordinary assembly), Vatican City, 29 September ‚Äì 28 October 1983 * World Synod of Bishops (Extraordinary assembly), Vatican City, 24 November ‚Äì 8 December 1985 * World Synod of Bishops (Ordinary assembly), Vatican City, 1‚Äì30 October 1987Attendance at meetings in Vatican City Reordering of Armagh Cathedral √ì Fiaich's re-ordering of the high Victorian neo-Gothic St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh proved very contentious. He had the highly decorated High Altar and rood screen replaced by a plain white Wicklow granite altar table. Though Cardinal √ì Fiaich himself wrote approvingly of the new design for the sanctuary, many others were highly critical, arguing that the new sanctuary design defaced what had been a particularly fine nineteenth-century building, with the brutal simplicity of the white oval altar contrasting with the original features surviving. One critic, writing in The Sunday Independent, compared √ì Fiaich's altar to something from the set of Star Trek. The altar table installed during his time as Archbishop of Armagh was subsequently removed by Se√°n Cardinal Brady and a more classical replacement installed. Death √ì Fiaich died of a heart attack on the evening of 8 May 1990 while leading the annual pilgrimage by the Archdiocese of Armagh to the Marian shrine of Lourdes in France. He had arrived in France the day before and had complained of feeling ill shortly after saying Mass at the grotto in the French town.

Plot Set on the fictional San Piedro Island in the northern Puget Sound region of the state of Washington coast in 1954, the plot revolves around a murder case in which Kabuo Miyamoto, a Japanese American, is accused of killing Carl Heine, a respected fisherman in the close-knit community. Much of the story is told in flashbacks explaining the interaction of the various characters over the prior decades. Carl's body had been pulled from the sea, trapped in his own net, on September 16, 1954. His water-damaged watch had stopped at 1:47. The trial, held in December 1954 during a snowstorm that grips the entire island, occurs in the midst of deep anti-Japanese sentiments following World War II. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, the San Piedro Review, Ishmael Chambers, a World War II US Marine Corps veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese at the Battle of Tarawa while watching his friends die. Torn by a sense of hatred for the Japanese, Chambers struggles with his love for Kabuo's wife, Hatsue, and his conscience, wondering if Kabuo is truly innocent. Through extended flashbacks, the reader learns that Ishmael had fallen in love with Hatsue when the two attended high school together right before the war. They had been secretly dating at this time and lost their virginity to each other. Spearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran, and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks. Leading the defense is the old, experienced Nels Gudmondsson. Several witnesses, including Etta Heine, Carl's mother, accuse Kabuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. Kabuo Miyamoto (a decorated war veteran of the Japanese- American 442nd Regimental Combat Team), experienced prejudice because of his ancestry, following the Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor. He accepts the murder trial as a kind of karma for his part in killing young Germans during the war. Also involved in the trial are Horace Whaley, the town coroner, and Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sells his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is contested in the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Mr. Heine. Kabuo and Carl Heine Jr. were close friends as children. Kabuo's father eventually approached Heine Sr. about purchasing of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the US and Japan following Pearl Harbor, and all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps. Hatsue and her family, the Imadas, are interned in Manzanar camp in California. Under some pressure from her mother, Hatsue breaks up with Ishmael through a Dear John letter and marries Kabuo while at Manzanar. Ishmael's last thoughts before passing out on a navy hospital ship when his arm is amputated at the Battle of Tarawa are of anger towards Hatsue. In 1944, Carl Sr. died due to a heart attack and Etta Heine sold the land to Jurgensen. When Kabuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter towards Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Jurgensen suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Heine Jr., hours before Kabuo arrived to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the disputed land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder. Ishmael's search of the maritime records at Point White lighthouse station reveals that on the night that Carl Heine died, a freighter, the SS West Corona, had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42 a.m., just five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realizes that Carl was likely to have been thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels as Hatsue's rejected lover, Ishmael comes forward with the new information. Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kabuo Miyamoto are dismissed. Hatsue thanks Ishmael, whom she had avoided since marrying Kabuo, and Ishmael is finally able to let his love of Hatsue go, whilst his agnosticism hardens into atheism.

A circus wagon A circus train is a method of conveyance for circus troupes.

Barnum Circus had grown so large that it was decided that they would only play at large venues, and that they would travel by train. P.T. Barnum had two of his partners, William Cameron Coup and Dan Costello, come up with a system to load the circus wagons on to railroad flat cars. Using a system of inclined planes, called runs, and crossover plates between cars, they developed a system of ropes and pulleys, along with a snubber post\\" to get the wagons on and off of the flat cars. They used horses to pull the wagons up the run and then would hitch a second team to pull it down the run cars (flats). The off-loading was much the same as loading, but a snubber post was used to help brake the wagons' descent down the run. That system, first used in 1872, was used by the RBBBC until its closing, although through more modern methods.Youtube The RBBB Circus Train unloads its cargo and load the animalskinglyheirs.com, Circus Trains: The Second Greatest Show on EarthTrain 21, The Ringling Bros. & Barnum & Bailey Circus Train (Red Show) Exits Northeast Pa., May 3, 2016 When the circus switched to travel by train they began by using flatcars from the Pennsylvania Railroad, which turned out to be hazardous because the Pennsylvania Railroad's cars were in poor shape. In mid-season it was decided that they would buy their own cars, and when the P.T. Barnum Circus left Columbus, Ohio, it traveled on the first circus-owned train.

The RBBB circus trains were more than in length, and included living quarters for the performers and animal keepers. There were also special stock cars for the exotic animals and flatcars for the transportation of circus wagons, equipment, and even a bus used for local transportation at performance sites.

The nuclear site of Pierrelatte includes many nuclear installations, of which the largest are the Eurodif fuel factory and the Tricastin nuclear power station. Enriched uranium is the preferred fuel for light water reactors, a common nuclear power technology.  History  In 1973 France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Sweden formed the joint stock company EURODIF. Sweden withdrew from the project in 1974. In 1975 Sweden's 10 per cent share in EURODIF was transferred to Iran as a result of an arrangement between France and Iran. The French government subsidiary company Cogema and the Iranian Government established the Sofidif () enterprise with 60 per cent and 40 per cent shares, respectively. In turn, Sofidif acquired a 25 per cent share in EURODIF, through which Iran attained its 10 per cent share of EURODIF. In 1974, the Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, lent $1 billion (and another $180 million in 1977) for the construction of the factory, in order to have the right to buy 10% of the production. Iran remains a shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif. The Franco- Iranian consortium shareholder still owns 25% of Eurodif. The factory, named after Georges Besse, its founder, provides uranium to forty producers of nuclear electricity, including EDF, France's largest electric power company. In 1986, Eurodif manager Georges Besse was assassinated; the act was allegedly part of an Iranian campaign to blackmail France after pulling out of the agreement between Eurodif and Iran (see Eurodif and Iran's nuclear program); the act was also allegedly claimed by left-wing militants from Action Directe, but they denied any responsibility during their trial. Naturally occurring uranium contains 0.7% of uranium 235. Currently, it is enriched up to 5% by a gas diffusion process using uranium hexafluoride (UF6). France plans to abandon the gas diffusion process currently used by the Eurodif factory for a centrifuge process. The project announced by Areva NC to make the change was the subject of a public discussion in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region from September 1 to October 22, 2004. The advantage of the new process is that it is more energy efficient: Eurodif currently uses the power generated by all three (2,700 MW) of Tricastin's nuclear reactors for uranium enrichment, whereas the centrifuge-based plant could make similar amounts of uranium with only 50 MW. Dismantling the original Eurodif facility is planned to be completed by the end of 2020.

Philadelphia, Lippincott. An almost forgotten part of this flight is the \\"race\\" that developed between Jerrie Mock and Joan Merriam Smith who had flown from a field near San Francisco CA on March 17, 1964. Joan's departure date and flight path was the same as the aviator Amelia Earhart's last flight and though not in direct competition with each other, media coverage soon began tracking the progress of each pilot fascinated with who would complete the journey first; Mock did. The story of this race is told in a book written by Taylor Phillips entitled, Racing to Greet the Sun, Jerrie Mock and Joan Merriam Smith Duel to Become the First Woman to Solo Around the World (2015). Jerrie Mock was subsequently awarded the Louis Bl√©riot medal from the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale in 1965. In 1970 she published the story of her round-the-world flight in the book Three-Eight Charlie. While that book is now out of print, a 50th anniversary edition was later published including maps, weather charts and photos. Three-Eight Charlie is a reference to the call sign, N1538C, of the Cessna 180 Skywagon Mock used to fly around the world. Before her death, Mock, mother of three children, resided in Quincy, Florida; northwest of the state capital, Tallahassee. Early life Mock with father on April 18, 1964 Geraldine \\"Jerrie\\" Fredritz Mock was born November 22, 1925, in Newark, Ohio to Timothy and Blanche (Wright) Fredritz. Her paternal grandparents were German emigrants.1900 United States Federal Census During her childhood, she found that she had more in common with the boys. Her interest for flying was sparked when she was 7 years old when she and her father had the opportunity to fly in the cockpit of a Ford Trimotor airplane. In high school, she took an engineering course of which she was the only girl and decided flying was her passion. She graduated from Newark High School in 1943 and went on to attend Ohio State University. At OSU, she became a member of Phi Mu. She would leave her studies at OSU behind to wed her husband, Russell Mock in 1945. Flight around the world During her flight, Mock traveled over Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam, among other countries. After stressful days traveling over the Atlantic, Mock was greeted by the president of the Aero Club of Morocco and stayed the night in a French home, where Mock reports, \\"there were no nightmares of thunderheads over the Atlantic. Dressed in red satin, I danced in marble palaces.\\" Mock later journeyed to Saudi Arabia, where she landed at Dhahran Airport. In her book Three-Eight Charlie, Mock says that after landing in Saudi Arabia the crowd of men around her looked puzzled. One of the men approached her aircraft. ‚ÄúHis white-kaffiyeh-covered head nodded vehemently, and he shouted to the throng that there was no man. This brought a rousing ovation‚Äù, she recalled. Mock was quite a spectacle in Saudi Arabia where women would not be allowed to drive cars until 2017, much less fly a plane. Traveling the world gave Mock new perspective and experiences.

The Potocki family is one of the wealthiest and most powerful aristocratic families in Poland. History The Potocki family originated from Potok in the Krak√≥w Voivodeship; their family name derives from that place name. The family contributed to the cultural development and history of Poland's Eastern Borderlands (today Western Ukraine). The family is renowned for numerous Polish statesmen, military leaders, and cultural activists. The first known Potocki was ≈ªyros≈Çaw z Potoka (born about 1136). The children of his son Aleksander (~1167) castelan of Sandomierz, were progenitors of new noble families such as the Moskorzewskis, Stanis≈Çawskis, Tworowskis, Borkowskis, and Stos≈Çowskis. Jakub Potocki (c. 1481-1551) was the progenitor of the magnate line of the Potocki family, with descendants living today, including those living in America. The magnate line split into three primary lineages, called: * \\"Linia hetma≈Ñska\\" (\\"Srebrna Pilawa\\"), in English: \\"Hetman's lineage\\" (\\"Silver Pilawa\\"). Note some sources refer to Pilawa as Pi≈Çawa. * \\"Linia Prymasowa\\" (\\"Z≈Çota Pilawa\\"), in English: \\"Primate's lineage\\" (\\"Golden Pilawa\\") * \\"≈ªelazna Pilawa\\", considered the oldest ones, in English: \\"Iron Pilawa\\" The \\"Z≈Çota Pilawa\\" line received the title of count from the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 1606. The entire family began using the Count title after the partitions of Poland. The title was recognized 1777 and 1784 in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and 1838, 1843, 1859, 1890 1903 in Russia and 1889 by the Pope and in the Kingdom of Poland (Congress Poland). In 1631 Stefan Potocki, who started the \\"Z≈Çota Pilawa\\" lineage, died and was buried in Zolotyi Potik (pl. Z≈Çoty Potok, Golden Potok, a village owned by this lineage), his descendants started to use the Pilawa coat of arms in golden colour. Because of that the lineage is called the \\"Z≈Çota Pilawa\\" (Golden Pi≈Çawa). There are also four branches called: * \\"Ga≈ÇƒÖ≈∫ ≈Ça≈Ñcucka\\" (Branch of ≈Åa≈Ñcut) * \\"Ga≈ÇƒÖ≈∫ krzeszowicka\\" (Branch of Krzeszowice) * \\"Ga≈ÇƒÖ≈∫ tulczy≈Ñska\\" (Branch of Tulczyn) * \\"Ga≈ÇƒÖ≈∫ wilanowska\\" (branch of Wilan√≥w) Named after the hubs of their respective constellations of properties. The family became prominent in the 16th and 17th centuries as a result of the patronage of Chancellor Jan Zamoyski and King Sigismund III Vasa.

Purported members Avraham ben Avraham, birth name Valentin Potocki. Purportedly converted to Judaism, moved to Vilna to hide his identity but was executed for heresy on May 23, 1749 (the second day of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot). His remains are believed to be have been secretly buried next to the Vilna Gaon, with a monument to that effect first erected in 1927. Though his existence is generally accepted among Orthodox Jews, many secular scholars contest his existence due to a lack of primary sources. He was first mentioned in writing by Rabbi Yaakov Emden in 1755, six years after he would have died. * Maria Patocka: said to be the mother of Crimean khan Adil Giray.

Though his name is commonly written \\"Yamakawa,\\" he himself wrote it as \\"Yamagawa\\" in English. Biography Yamakawa was born as the third son to Yamakawa Naoe, a senior samurai of the Aizu Domain (present day Fukushima Prefecture). He became a member of the Byakkotai, a unit of the newly reorganized Aizu domain army composed mostly of boys aged 15 to 17 years, who fought in defense of Aizu during the Boshin War. After the Meiji Restoration, through the mediation of the Zen monk Kawai Zenjun, Yamakawa was placed in the care of Ch≈çsh≈´ retainer Okudaira Kensuke. Yamakawa was sent by the new Meiji government to study physics at Yale University, where he was the first student from Japan to graduate. On his return to Japan, he was posted to Tokyo Imperial University working as an assistant and interpreter, and became Japan‚Äôs first Japanese professor of physics in 1879. (There had already been several foreign professors, such as Thomas Corwin Mendenhall and William Edward Ayrton.) During the Meiji and Taish≈ç periods he helped found the Kyushu Institute of Technology in 1907 and served as president of Tokyo Imperial University (1901-1905 and 1913-1920), Kyushu Imperial University (1911-1913), and Kyoto Imperial University (1914-1915). He was later ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. Later in his life he was also a Privy Councilor (appointed in February 1923) and a member of the House of Peers. He and his brother Yamakawa Hiroshi are known amongst historians of the late Edo period as authors of two monumental texts Kenjir≈ç's being \\"Aizu Boshin Senshi,\\" which catalogues the actions of his home domain during the war. He also authored several other history texts, including \\"Hosh≈´ Aizu Byakkotai J≈´ky≈´shi-den,\\" which he wrote with fellow Aizu native Munekawa Toraji. Yamakawa's sisters, Yamakawa Futaba (1844 ‚Äì 1909) and Yamakawa Sutematsu (1860-1919), later Princess ≈åyama Sutematsu (Â§ßÂ±± Êç®Êùæ), are also well-known.

The station calls itself \\"News Radio 710.\\" WNTM is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and the broadcast license is held by iHM Licenses, LLC. Its studios are located in the same building as Channel 5 WKRG-TV on Broadcast Drive in Mobile, and the transmitter is just north of downtown. (Both stations had been co-owned at one time.) WKRG-TV supplies local news and weather, while Fox News Radio supplies national newscasts. Programming WNTM has a local wake-up show hosted by tongue-in-cheek commentator \\"Uncle Henry,\\" formerly of WABB, followed by nationally syndicated shows from Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. The station's lineup includes Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, America Now with Meghan McCain, Clyde Lewis, and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Weekends feature paid brokered programming in the morning and repeats of weekday shows. Sunday nights include syndicated shows from Bill Handel and Bill Cunningham. History The station was originally owned by movie theater owner, architect, and broadcasting pioneer Kenneth R. Giddens, whose family-owned WKRG-TV Inc. put WKRG (710 AM) on the air on September 26, 1946. It became a CBS affiliate December 15, 1947. At that time it operated with 1 KW power during the day and 250 W at night. The station would have an FM companion broadcasting on 99.9 MHz starting on October 16, 1947 (today's WMXC), followed by television partner WKRG-TV on September 5, 1955. Like competitor WABB-FM, WKRG-FM was a simulcast of the AM station before finding its own format of beautiful music in 1965. In March 1970, the Federal Communications Commission enforced new rules preventing future radio and television ownership combinations in the same market, which allowed the stations of WKRG-TV, Inc. to remain standing, or \\"grandfathered\\". For much of its history, the former CBS-affiliated WKRG had a format of middle of the road music and talk shows. Such talk shows included an afternoon program hosted by future WKRG-TV sports director Randy Patrick, but the talk radio format would soon dominate the schedule later in the 1980s as FM reigned with its superior sound. The next change for WKRG Radio in the 1980s was a new location, as WKRG-TV, Inc. moved from its long-time home on downtown Mobile's St. Louis Street to its current facility close to the city's two malls, Springdale Mall and Bel Air Mall. WKRG Radio, including both 710 AM and 99.9 FM were sold off in late 1994. A new journey awaits these two legendary stations. On October 12, 1994, WKRG became known as WNTM, with call letters standing for \\"News Talk of Mobile\\", making it clear that the new owners at Capital Broadcasting want to keep the talk radio format. Along with radio programs such as The Rush Limbaugh Show, some former WKRG Radio staff would stay in this midst of change. The station's owners would also inherit studio & office space on the third floor of WKRG-TV's facility. Clear Channel Communications would take ownership of 710 AM and 99.9 FM in 1997. Interesting enough, Clear Channel also owns what would become WKRG-TV's biggest rival in decades, the new NBC affiliate WPMI. After WPMI started its news operation in January 1996, the resources of this new addition to the Mobile-Pensacola news media would be put to good use for WNTM in the years to come. Logo as \\"Fox NewsRadio 710 WNTM\\" On August 12, 2004, WNTM received another change in call letters, this time to WPMI, due to the station's close relationship with WPMI-TV. The station has also seen an expansion of local news from WPMI-TV, along with the timeslots of regularly scheduled programs. The new partnership also meant the end of affiliation with ABC News Radio, meaning no more of Paul Harvey's daily and weekend broadcasts for listeners on the central Gulf Coast. In the three-year period as WPMI, the station changed its radio network affiliation twice. After almost a year with NBC News Radio, WPMI radio became affiliated with Fox News. Ironically, WPMI-TV was affiliated with the Fox television network before joining NBC in 1996. On June 28, 2007, the call sign reverted to WNTM. On August 1, 2007, the station entered into a strategic partnership with WKRG-TV, similar to its previous relationship with WPMI-TV, gaining access to its former sister station's news and weather resources. However, the radio/tv news partnership has now been re-established with WPMI NBC 15. Notable personalities Numerous radio personalities have been heard over Mobile's 710 AM, including a few voices from the WKRG Radio years still around today. Until November 2007, former WKRG-FM disc jockey Scott O'Brien hosted \\"Mobile's First News\\" and \\"Ask the Expert\\" in the morning. Michael P. Sloan was a newsbreak reader and Daniel Shane McBryde hosted his own afternoon program during the first WNTM era; both are WABB veterans. Alex Mathis later joined McBryde as producer and fill-in host. Long time radio personality Yvonne Morrison hosted \\"The Garden Show\\" alongside reporter Charlie Moss on Saturday mornings. Overnight, the station broadcasts the syndicated Coast to Coast AM hosted by George Noory. The station also broadcasts the syndicated Saturday night program Somewhere In Time hosted by Art Bell.

Neurosarcoidosis can have many manifestations, but abnormalities of the cranial nerves (a group of twelve nerves supplying the head and neck area) are the most common. It may develop acutely, subacutely, and chronically. Approximately 5‚Äì10 percent of people with sarcoidosis of other organs (e.g. lung) develop central nervous system involvement. Only 1 percent of people with sarcoidosis will have neurosarcoidosis alone without involvement of any other organs. Diagnosis can be difficult, with no test apart from biopsy achieving a high accuracy rate. Treatment is with immunosuppression. The first case of sarcoidosis involving the nervous system was reported in 1905. Signs and symptoms =Neurological= Abnormalities of the cranial nerves are present in 50‚Äì70 percent of cases. The most common abnormality is involvement of the facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or both sides of the face (65 percent resp 35 percent of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. Seizures (mostly of the tonic-clonic/\\"grand mal\\" type) are present in about 15 percent and may be the presenting phenomenon in 10 percent. Meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain) occurs in 3‚Äì26 percent of cases. Symptoms may include headache and nuchal rigidity (being unable to bend the head forward). It may be acute or chronic. Accumulation of granulomas in particular areas of the brain can lead to abnormalities in the function of that area. For instance, involvement of the internal capsule would lead to weakness in one or two limbs on one side of the body. If the granulomas are large, they can exert a mass effect and cause headache and increase the risk of seizures. Obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, too, can cause headaches, visual symptoms (as mentioned above) and other features of raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. Involvement of the spinal cord is rare, but can lead to abnormal sensation or weakness in one or more limbs, or cauda equina symptoms (incontinence to urine or stool, decreased sensation in the buttocks). =Endocrine= Granulomas in the pituitary gland, which produces numerous hormones, is rare but leads to any of the symptoms of hypopituitarism: amenorrhoea (cessation of the menstrual cycle), diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to inability to concentrate the urine), hypothyroidism (decreased activity of the thyroid) or hypocortisolism (deficiency of cortisol). =Mental and other= Psychiatric problems occur in 20 percent of cases; many different disorders have been reported, e.g. depression and psychosis. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in up to 15 percent of cases of neurosarcoidosis. Other symptoms due to sarcoidosis of other organs may be uveitis (inflammation of the uveal layer in the eye), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pains), lupus pernio (a red skin rash, usually of the face), erythema nodosum (red skin lumps, usually on the shins), and symptoms of liver involvement (jaundice) or heart involvement (heart failure). Pathophysiology Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause that leads to the development of granulomas in various organs. While the lungs are typically involved, other organs may equally be affected. Some subforms of sarcoidosis, such as L√∂fgren syndrome, may have a particular precipitant and have a specific course. It is unknown which characteristics predispose sarcoidosis patients to brain or spinal cord involvement. Diagnosis MRI findings (T1-weighted images) in a patient with neurosacoidosis showing thickening of infundibulum and both optic nerves (white signal marked with yellow arrows; width 6 mm). Right image: MRI brain with contrast showing near resolution of enhancement after treatment. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis can only be made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample). Because of the risks associated with brain biopsies, they are avoided as much as possible. Other investigations that may be performed in any of the symptoms mentioned above are computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) studies. If the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is suspected, typical X-ray or CT appearances of the chest may make the diagnosis more likely; elevations in angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium in the blood, too, make sarcoidosis more likely. In the past, the Kveim test was used to diagnose sarcoidosis. This now obsolete test had a high (85 percent) sensitivity, but required spleen tissue of a known sarcoidosis patient, an extract of which was injected into the skin of a suspected case. Only biopsy of suspicious lesions in the brain or elsewhere is considered useful for a definitive diagnosis of neurosarcoid. This would demonstrate granulomas (collections of inflammatory cells) rich in epithelioid cells and surrounded by other immune system cells (e.g. plasma cells, mast cells). Biopsy may be performed to distinguish mass lesions from tumours (e.g. gliomas). MRI with gadolinium enhancement is the most useful neuroimaging test. This may show enhancement of the pia mater or white matter lesions that may resemble the lesions seen in multiple sclerosis. Lumbar puncture may demonstrate raised protein level, pleiocytosis (i.e. increased presence of both lymphocytes and neutrophil granulocytes) and oligoclonal bands. Various other tests (e.g. ACE level in CSF) have little added value. =Criteria= Some recent papers propose to classify neurosarcoidosis by likelihood: * Definite neurosarcoidosis can only be diagnosed by plausible symptoms, a positive biopsy and no other possible causes for the symptoms * Probable neurosarcoidosis can be diagnosed if the symptoms are suggestive, there is evidence of central nervous system inflammation (e.g. CSF and MRI), and other diagnoses have been excluded. A diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis is not essential. * Possible neurosarcoidosis may be diagnosed if there are symptoms not due to other conditions but other criteria are not fulfilled. Treatment Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is generally treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need to remain on steroids long- term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, thalidomide and infliximab have been reported to be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations. Prognosis Of the phenomena occurring in neurosarcoid, only facial nerve involvement is known to have a good prognosis and good response to treatment. Long-term treatment is usually necessary for all other phenomena. The mortality rate is estimated at 10 percent Epidemiology Sarcoidosis has a prevalence of 40 per 100,000 in the general population. However, though those with the GG genotype at rs1049550 in the ANXA11 gene were found to have 1.5‚Äì2.5 times higher odds of sarcoidosis compared to those with the AG genotype, while those with the AA genotype had about 1.6 times lower odds. Furthermore, those with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) may be at even higher risk. One study of 80 CVID patients found eight of these had sarcoidosis, suggesting as high a prevalence in CVID populations as one in 10. Given that less than 10 percent of those with sarcoidosis will have neurological involvement, and possibly later on in their disease course, neurosarcoidosis has a prevalence of less than four per 100,000. Sarcoidosis most commonly affects young adults of both sexes, although studies have reported more cases in females. Incidence is highest for individuals younger than 40 and peaks in the age-group from 20 to 29 years; a second peak is observed for women over 50. Sarcoidosis occurs throughout the world in all races with an average incidence of 16.5/100,000 in men and 19/100,000 in women. The disease is most prevalent in Northern European countries and the highest annual incidence of 60/100,000 is found in Sweden and Iceland. In the United States sarcoidosis is more common in people of African descent than Caucasians, with annual incidence reported as 35.5 and 10.9/100,000, respectively. Sarcoidosis is less commonly reported in South America, Spain, India, Canada, and the Philippines. There may be a higher susceptibility to sarcoidosis in those with coeliac disease. An association between the two disorders has been suggested. The differing incidence across the world may be at least partially attributable to the lack of screening programs in certain regions of the world and the overshadowing presence of other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, that may interfere with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis where they are prevalent. There may also be differences in the severity of the disease between people of different ethnicities. Several studies suggest that the presentation in people of African origin may be more severe and disseminated than for Caucasians, who are more likely to have asymptomatic disease. Manifestation appears to be slightly different according to race and sex. Erythema nodosum is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese patients, ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races. Sarcoidosis is one of the few pulmonary diseases with a higher prevalence in non-smokers. Notable cases The American television personality and actress Karen Duffy wrote \\"Model Patient: My Life As an Incurable Wise-Ass\\" on her experiences with neurosarcoidosis.

Won by Hagler by third round knockout, the fight is considered by many to be among the finest boxing matches in history, due to its constant action, drama, and violent back-and-forth exchanges.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/apr/15/boxing-hagler- hearns-30-years-on Background By 1985, Marvelous Marvin Hagler had been the undisputed champion of the middleweight division since September 27, 1980, after having been widely regarded as the No. 1 challenger for much of the late 1970s. His first two shots at the world middleweight title resulted in controversy: the first was an unpopular draw against then-champion Vito Antuofermo in 1979 (allowing Antuofermo to retain the title), and the second was a three-round technical knockout (TKO) of Alan Minter, in London, which led to a riot by Minter's fans. The hard road to the middleweight championship, however, may have helped motivate Hagler to remain dominant during his reign. Hagler was renowned for his conditioning and durability, suffering only one official knockdown in his career, against Juan Domingo Roldan, an incident Hagler always insisted should have been ruled a slip. By the time he fought Thomas Hearns, he had defended the title ten times, winning all but one by knockout; the sole Hagler defense that went the distance was a 15-round decision victory over Roberto Dur√°n. Hagler was then approaching the middleweight record of 14 title defenses, held by Carlos Monz√≥n. When Hagler vs. Hearns took place, Hearns had recently moved up from the welterweight to the junior middleweight to the middleweight division. Hearns was regarded as one of the hardest punchers of all time, winning 30 of his first 32 bouts by knockout. In Hearns's first title shot in 1980, he scored a spectacular second-round knockout over WBA champion Pipino Cuevas. Hearns defended that title three times before meeting Sugar Ray Leonard in a thrilling fight dubbed \\"The Showdown.\\" Hearns lost by technical knockout in the 14th round despite leading on all three scorecards. He then successfully campaigned at junior middleweight, winning the WBC title from Wilfred Ben√≠tez, and defeating Roberto Dur√°n. Hearns defeated several middleweights during this period, including Marcos Geraldo by first-round knockout. Geraldo had gone the distance against both Leonard and Hagler. Given the pair's renowned punching power and the way both men had won their respective fights coming into the bout, it garnered significant media attention and fan interest around the world. It was held at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 15, 1985. In the United States and Puerto Rico, it was broadcast by HBO (in Puerto Rico, also by Wapa canal 4) with Barry Tompkins, Sugar Ray Leonard and Larry Merchant, while Curt Gowdy served as host. Al Michaels and Al Bernstein acted as commentators for the closed circuit television for Top Rank. In the UK the fight was shown on ITV with Reg Gutteridge and Donald Curry commentating. Hearns received a massage before the fight, much to the chagrin of his trainer Emanuel Steward. In HBO's Legendary Nights: The Tale of Hagler- Hearns, Steward stated that he felt the massage weakened Hearns' legs during the fight and led him to adopt a more aggressive approach than he normally would have. The fight =Round 1= Hagler, normally a slow starter, stormed Hearns from the opening bell, landing with many devastating right hands eventually pinning him to the ropes. Hearns threw his devastating right hand to Hagler's chin, stunning Hagler for a moment before Hagler was able to tie him up in a clinch. Seconds later, however, the two were trading power punches, with Hagler trying to get inside and to pin Hearns to the ropes again. In the process, he succeeded in stunning Hearns with a hard left hand. Hearns tied up Hagler again and tried to slow the pace by boxing rather than trading power punches with Hagler, who was still the aggressor. This lasted for only a moment, however. Before long the two once again started to trade power punches. (During these exchanges Hearns broke his right hand.) The slugfest continued for the better part of the next two and a half minutes as both fighters traded heavy blows with little regard for defense or pacing. Hagler developed a cut on his forehead but didn't slow as he pinned Hearns to the ropes and meted out more punishment, eventually hurting Hearns at the end of the round. Sportscaster Barry Tompkins, doing the blow-by-blow commentary for HBO's broadcast of the fight, yelled out, \\"This is still only the first round!\\" as the fighters traded heavy shots at round's end. Al Bernstein remarked, \\"Perhaps one of the best opening rounds in middleweight history!\\" It is considered by The Ring magazine to be the greatest round in boxing history, and it won round of the year honors for 1985. In a subsequent HBO broadcast featuring both Hagler and Hearns in studio commenting on the fight, Hearns revealed, \\"that first round took everything I had, man.\\" When asked in the ring after the bout if he was hurt by Hearns' first right hand, a blow that caused him to step back and then fall into a clinch, Hagler commented, \\"He definitely tried to put the bomb on me... . He can punch... .\\" The scorecards were split with Reno judge Herb Santos scoring the round 10-9 for Hagler, along with U.K judge Harry Gibbs while Dick Young of California had Hearns ahead 10-9. It was described as a war zone for both fighters. =Round 2= By the beginning of the second round, it looked as though Hearns had no legs under him, as he slowed the pace by boxing Hagler. Hearns stumbled several times as he attempted to move around the ring and change direction, prompting HBO commentator Sugar Ray Leonard to note, \\"I don't like the way Tommy's moving...a little rubbery-legged.\\" In the studio broadcast of the fight, Hearns commented, \\"My legs were gone, man. Even before I came out to fight, my legs felt weak.\\" Hagler experimented by switching to orthodox style for a moment, but switched back to southpaw, as he found more success countering Hearns' jab. By the end of the round, Hagler pinned Hearns to the ropes, successfully landing a volley of punches. The action in round two had slowed from the blistering pace of round one. Judges Herb Santos and Harry Gibbs again scored the round 10-9 for Hagler while judge Dick Young scored the round 10-9 for Hearns. =Third and final round= In round three, Hearns again tried to set the pace. About a minute into the round, the cut on Hagler's forehead inflicted in the first round opened up, resulting in a tremendous flow of blood down the middleweight champion's face. Referee Richard Steele halted the action to have the ringside physician examine Hagler. He informed Steele, \\"No the cut's not bothering his sight, let him go.\\" Facing the new threat of losing the fight via stoppage on cuts, Hagler attacked Hearns with the aggression of the first round. A tremendous overhand left to the head drove Hearns back to the ropes. Hearns backed away, smiling so as to suggest the punch had not hurt him. Hagler landed a hard right hook high on Hearns' head. The blow staggered Hearns, who awkwardly stumbled backwards into the ropes, Hagler running after him in hot pursuit. The champion smashed a vicious right hand to Hearns' chin. Hearns went limp and fell forward, as Hagler landed two uppercuts. As Hearns fell face first to the canvas, Sugar Ray Leonard yelled into his microphone \\"He's gone...he's gone!\\" Hearns staggered to his feet at the count of nine, but he was unable to continue. Referee Steele stopped the bout as he held Hearns upright. The image of a blood-soaked Hagler being carried around the ring in victory by his handlers and Hearns being carried back to his corner in semi-consciousness remains to this day a graphic testimony of the intensity of \\"The War.\\" It was widely regarded as the pinnacle of Marvin Hagler's career and cemented his legacy as one of the greatest middleweights of all time. At the time of the stoppage, judges Herb Santos and Harry Gibbs had Hagler ahead 20-18 while judge Dick Young had Hearns ahead 20-18. In the immediate aftermath of the fight, Donald Curry (who was working for British television) was highly critical of the loser. He said \\"Tommy fought the wrong fight. He should have started cautiously, lose the first couple of rounds. Don't get into a dogfight, but that's what he did. He got into a dogfight with Marvin and he lost.\\" British fight publication Boxing News called it \\"eight minutes of mayhem\\", while The Ring called the fight \\"the most electrifying eight minutes ever,\\" and it won fight of the year for 1985, despite lasting only three rounds.

It is a coming of age tale set in Mississippi in the 1970s. The film gained Wood a young actor's award. Plot Stephen, a shell-shocked Vietnam veteran, returns from a mental hospital, which he entered voluntarily because he was suffering from nightmares about the war and had in consequence lost three jobs in a row. After having been treated and finally coming home again, he gets a new job as custodial engineer at a grammar school, but loses it again within less than one week because of a law forbidding people who spent time in a mental hospital to work within the vicinity of children. However, the Simmons family desperately needs money, so Stephen continues looking for work, and finds a job picking potatoes. There he makes friends with a man called Moe Henry, with whose help he succeeds in obtaining a job working in a mine - his best one yet. In the meantime, the twins Lidia and Stu try to get away from the dreary reality of their lives. They find a tree in a forest close to their house and decide to build a tree house there. At first they and their friends argue over who has to construct it and who is allowed to use it; the three boys - Stu, Chet and Marsh - want it all to themselves, while the girls - Lidia, Elvadine and Amber - want them to work on it and share it afterwards. After several deals, they agree to build the tree house together. The girls get everything they need from the garbage heap belonging to the Lipnickis, a neighboring family with a reputation for bullying, who have a grudge against the Simmons and their friends. Unfortunately Billy, the youngest of the Lipnicki kids, discovers Lidia, Elvadine and Amber on his father's territory, so the girls have to pay him to keep quiet, but later after he falls under a candy coma his brothers force him to betray Lidia's secret. While the children are busy building their tree house, Stephen and Moe are caught in a collapse as they drain water out of a cavern. Moe is caught under falling rubble, but Stephen, who in Vietnam had to leave his best friend to die in order to be rescued himself, is determined to save him, even if it costs him his own life. He frees Moe, but is hit by falling rocks himself, and though the two men are both rescued, Stephen is badly hurt and comatose, being put on life-support in the hospital. While Stu and Lidia fear for their father's life, the Lipnickis find the treehouse and take it over, stealing the lock and key, which belonged to Stephen. However, they agree to return them if Stu can win a bet - swimming a lap around the inside of a water-tower while it drains - which he does. The children can keep the place, but not before the Lipnickis throw the key onto the rotted, treacherous roof of the water-tower, telling Stu that if he wants it, he can get it back himself. Shortly afterwards, their father is taken off life-support, and dies. When the kids run away from home to the tree house, they discover that the Lipnickis have returned. In the fight that erupts between them, the tree house is destroyed. Meanwhile, Billy Lipnicki protests against all the fighting, asking why they can't share the fort, but is ignored. He takes it on himself to go to the water tower to retrieve the key, but the roof caves in just as Stu and the others find him, and he almost drowns in the water tower. Stu rescues and resuscitates him together with Lidia, and Billy tells them he saw an angel, one who \\"looked like [Stu,] only bigger,\\" (implied to be Stephen) who told him he had to stay on Earth and take care of his family. From that time on the Lipnickis stop fighting with the others and stay out of their way, except for Billy, who becomes a good friend to them. The twins and their friends start to rebuild the tree house, but give it up after a couple of days due to lack of interest. Also, they find out that their father bought them a new house before he died and are happy to have a proper home again at last.

The eleventh satellite of ISRO in IRS series. The satellite was built, launched and maintained by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Weighing around 1560 kg at launch, its applications will mainly be towards cartography in India. It was launched by PSLV-C6, on 5 May 2005 at 04:44:00 UTC from the newly built Second Launch Pad at Sriharikota. Images from the satellite will be available from GeoEye for worldwide distribution. The satellite covers the entire globe in 1867 orbits on a 126-day cycle. Adjacent paths are covered by a separation of eleven days. Cartosat-1 carries two state-of-the-art panchromatic (PAN) cameras that take black and white stereoscopic pictures of the Earth in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The swath covered by these high resolution PAN cameras is 30 km and their spatial resolution is 2.5 metres. History Department of Space, Government of India, has launched a series of satellites for Earth's resource management and monitoring. These satellites have been very successful in providing data in various scales ranging from 1:1 Million to 1:12,500 scale. Each of the Indian Remote Sensing satellite missions ensured data continuity while introducing improvements in the spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions. Considering increase demand for large scale and topographic mapping data DOS launched the Cartosat-1 in 2005. Cartosat-1 is dedicated to stereo viewing for large scale mapping and terrain modelling. Specifications =Payload= The Cartosat-1 satellite has two panchromatic cameras with 2.5 m spatial resolution, to acquire two images simultaneously, one forward (PAN FORE) looking at +26¬∞ and one aft (PAN AFT) of the satellite at -5¬∞ for near instantaneous stereo data. The time difference between the acquisitions of the same scene by the two cameras is about 52 seconds. The spacecraft body is steerable to compensate the Earth rotation effect and to force both fore and aft cameras to look at the same ground strip when operated in stereo mode. The cameras are mounted on the satellite in such a way that near simultaneous imaging of the same area from two different angles is possible. This facilitates the generation of accurate three-dimensional maps. The cameras are steerable across the direction of the satellite's movement to facilitate the imaging of an area more frequently. =Communications= The images taken by Cartosat-1 cameras are compressed, encrypted, formatted and transmitted to the ground stations. The images are reconstructed from the data received at the ground stations. The National Remote Sensing Centre is responsible for acquisition, processing of data relayed by the Cartosat-1. A spherical Phased Array Antenna with steerable beam is used to transmit the data to the required ground station. A solid state recorder with 120 Gb capacity to store about 9 minutes of payload data is available for global operation of the payloads. The stored images can be transmitted when the satellite comes within the visibility zone of a ground station. =Optics and detectors= Each Panchromatic camera consists of three 3 mirror off-axis all reflective telescope with primary, secondary and tertiary mirrors. These mirrors are made from special zerodur glass blanks and are light weighted to about 60%. These mirrors are polished to an accuracy of l/80 and are coated with enhanced AlO2 coating.

Their name is derived from a Biblical passage known as Ephesians 4:29, which, in the New International Version of the Bible, reads as follows: \\"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\\" The band members originated from Snyder Memorial Baptist Church and various areas in North Carolina as well as Texas. They were named as the Gospel Music Association 2005 New Artist of the Year. History =Early years= In late 1999, bassist Scotty Beshears and guitarist/vocalist Jason Roy met in North Carolina at the final performance of Roy's band All Too Familiar. Beshears had formerly been involved with Elijah's Ride, another independent band. They teamed up with drummer Christian Fuhrer to form a new band which blended modern pop-rock music with Christian-themed lyrics. The trio began to perform under the name \\"Building 429\\". According to Jason Roy, the band's name originated from a youth group. Roy's wife Cortni had once belonged to a youth group that had a system called the \\"429 Challenge,\\" based on Ephesians 4:29. Whenever someone in the group spoke negatively about another, others were allowed to issue a verbal \\"four twenty-nine.\\" This resulted in the offender having to say something nice to the person that was offended. The band members took this challenge and created a name around it - building one another up, hence, \\"Building 429\\". Throughout the year 2000, Building 429 held a relentless touring schedule, with over 100 shows played and 3,000 copies of their first (self-titled) CD sold. In 2001, they deepened their sound by adding a second guitarist, Paul Bowden, to their lineup. Further success saw the band place first on Flicker Records' A&R; online website and forum. Much of the band's early success can be attributed to their extensive touring schedule and tendency to write and perform upbeat, commercially-friendly pop-rock songs. In the summer of 2002, Building 429 released the EP Preflight, featuring three rough-mixed recordings from their forthcoming second independent release and four acoustic demos. This EP was only available at live shows and on the band's website. In the fall of 2002, the band's second full-length independent album, entitled Flight, was released. Initially packaged as a CD-R in a sleeve with no artwork (save for a thermal printed disc label), the album was sold at shows and through the band's website. In 2003, the album was re-titled Building 429 and was professionally pressed and repackaged in a full-sized jewel case with complete artwork. 2002 ended with Saul Johnson replacing Chris Fuhrer as drummer. =Work with Word Records= In 2003, Building 429 continued to tour in and around North Carolina promoting their music and independent album. When Saul Johnson left the band mid-year, Michael Anderson was hired as drummer. Anderson had formerly played for Remember Jonah, a North Carolina based Christian rock band that had played with Building 429 earlier in the year. During the summer, Building 429 joined rock worship band Sonicflood on tour. This experience would garner the band national exposure, leading to a record deal with Warner Music Group label Word Records. Studio work immediately began on the band's major-label debut album. \\"Glory Defined\\", Building 429's first nationally serviced radio single, rose to No. 1 on eight combined Christian AC and CHR charts in early 2004, remaining No. 1 on Christian Radio Weekly's (CRW) AC chart for ten consecutive weeks and claiming the spot faster than any single in the history of the publication. The song was the title track from the Glory Defined EP, released April 6, 2004. The EP featured three full-mix tracks (the title track, \\"Free\\", as well as \\"Show Me Love\\") and two \\"unplugged\\" songs, \\"The Space In Between Us\\" and \\"All You Ask of Me\\". A second, AC mix version of \\"Glory Defined\\" was also on the EP. On July 27, 2004, Building 429's national debut, Space In Between, was released. Produced by Jim Cooper, the album gave three more radio hits, including \\"Above It All\\", \\"The Space In Between Us\\" and \\"No One Else Knows\\". The release of the album was followed by major touring with artists such as Jeremy Camp, Tree63, and Sonicflood. Building 429 received four Dove Award nominations and was honored as New Artist of the Year by the Gospel Music Association in 2005. Touring also continued alongside artists Todd Agnew, BarlowGirl, Casting Crowns and Paul Colman. An expanded edition of Space in Between was released in August 2005, which included the full original album plus two tracks from the Glory Defined EP (\\"All You Ask of Me\\" and \\"Free\\"), the AC mix of \\"Glory Defined\\", a radio mix of \\"No One Else Knows\\" and a cover of Chris Tomlin's \\"Famous One\\". Early in 2005, Jesse Garcia (formerly of Afterglo) was asked to fill in for guitarist Paul Bowden after Bowden suffered an elbow injury during an autograph session. When Bowden returned, the band decided to keep Garcia on as a third guitarist and keyboardist, allowing lead vocalist Jason Roy to concentrate more on singing during concerts. By the fall of 2005, the band was back in the studio to record their second album, Rise. Produced by Monroe Jones, Rise (released March 14, 2006) featured a heavier sound more in line with the band's live performances. The first singles to be released from the record included \\"Searching For a Savior\\", \\"Fearless\\" and \\"I Belong to You\\". The album also included guest vocals from former dc Talk member Michael Tait on the track \\"Empty\\" and a medley of Blessid Union of Souls' hit \\"I Believe\\" and Andra√© Crouch's \\"Jesus is the Answer\\". In January 2006 it was announced that guitarist Paul Bowden would be leaving the band at the end of the month to pursue other areas of ministry. Following the release of Rise, Building 429 headlined their own tour with TAIT, the band fronted by former dc Talk member Michael Tait. Parts of the tour also featured Travel the Road missionaries Tim Scott and Will Decker. In September 2006, the band returned to the studio to begin recording the follow-up album to Rise. The end of 2006 saw Building 429 travel to Germany for their first overseas tour; shows were performed in Heidelberg, Hanau, Baumholder, and Denmark. In January 2007, the band officially announced through its e-mail list, website and MySpace page that bassist and band founder Scotty Beshears had left the band to pursue \\"another chapter\\" in his life. Touring bassist Aaron Branch was then hired; however, the band officially remains a threesome according to its MySpace page and website. Recording continued throughout January for Building 429's third major studio release, entitled Iris to Iris. \\"Grace That is Greater\\", a track from the album, was made available as a digital single through the iTunes music service on March 6, 2007. During the spring of 2007, Building 429 joined another former dc Talk member, TobyMac, on the \\"Portable Sounds Tour\\", which also featured Thousand Foot Krutch and Family Force 5. Iris to Iris, released May 1, 2007 and produced by Brown Bannister, took the band's album lineup in a different direction. According to the band's MySpace page, Jason Roy (principal songwriter) felt that initial songwriting sessions were not turning out material that was right for the band or the project. The band \\"sensed that God was calling them in a new direction.\\" After praying about the circumstances and the music they were creating, the band made the decision to strictly focus the songs on God. After that, according to Roy, \\"the songs just started to flow. It was the easiest, most fulfilling, and most fun songwriting process we have ever experienced.\\" The resulting 11-track Iris to Iris became a collection of original worship songs and two hymn reworkings (\\"Grace That is Greater\\" and \\"Search Me O God\\"), making for a mellower and more ethereal- sounding record than past recordings from the group. Building 429 also saw a change in writing, as band members Michael Anderson and Jesse Garcia joined Jason Roy in the songwriting process, along with veteran Christian songwriter Chris Eaton (Amy Grant, Point of Grace, and Jaci Velasquez). In May 2007 the band embarked on a month-long schedule of tour dates with up-and-coming band Jackson Waters to promote Iris to Iris. After performing a few festivals in the summer, Building 429 continued with a second leg of their touring with Jackson Waters, adding Storyside:B and 2006 GMA New Artist of the Year The Afters to the performance lineup. Touring continued in 2008 with Pillar, Wavorly and Brooke Barrettsmith. on Pillar's \\"For the Love of the Game\\" tour (February 22 ‚Äì April 6), and with Remedy Drive and Bread of Stone on the LifeLight Communications' \\"Lifelight\\" tour (April 9‚Äì19).

The unit's parent formation is 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (2 CMBG). The squadron was housed in eight separate buildings but consolidated into one in 2011.  History  The Special Service Force Headquarters and Signal Squadron (SSF HQ & Sig Sqn) was renamed 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group Headquarters and Signal Squadron on 1 June 1995, coincident with the name change of its parent formation. The squadron has provided personnel and equipment for many United Nations (UN) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) missions, particularly Operation ALLIANCE (Former Yugoslavia) in 1996, Operation PRUDENCE (Central African Republic) in 1998 and Operation KINETIC (Kosovo) in 1999. The squadron has been involved with significant domestic operations including the Winnipeg flood in 1997, the ice storms in 1998, and the G8 Summit in Huntsville in 2010. Afghanistan = Kabul (2003-2005) = In July 2003, the squadron deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation ATHENA Rotation 0 with a transfer of command authority on 17 July 2003. Under the command of Major Sean Sullivan, the unit provided integral communications support to the Canadian-led Kabul Multi-National Brigade (KMNB) led by Brigadier-General Peter Devlin, then Commander 2 CMBG. Although the core of the squadron was stationed within Camp Warehouse, the squadron had several outstations in allied locations throughout KMNB including Kabul International Airport and radio rebroadcast site on TV Tower Hill. They returned to CFB Petawawa in January 2004. The remainder of the time in Kabul prior to the move to Kandahar in 2005, 2 CMBG HQ & Sig Sqn only provided individual augmentation to the subsequent rotations. = Kandahar (2006-2011) = The G6 (Communications - General Staff System) Staff for the National Command Element of Rotation 2 (Task Force 3-06) was composed of the leadership of 2 CMBG HQ & Sig Sqn. This period saw some of the heaviest fighting during the Afghanistan Campaign including Operation Medusa. A complete squadron again deployed in May 2008 as Task Force Kandahar Signal Squadron under the leadership of Major (promoted Lieutenant-Colonel on tour) James Lambert as part of Task Force 5-08 (also called Rotation 5.5). When Brigadier-General Denis Thompson passed command of Task Force Kandahar to his successor, Brigadier-General Jonathan Vance on 19 February 2009, the squadron redeployed to Canada. The squadron deployed to Kandahar once again in August 2010 under Lieutenant-Colonel Chris McGuffin to support the last Task Force Headquarters (Task Force 5-10) under the combat-operations mandate. The squadron handed over to the Mission Transition Task Force in July 2011. =Fallen soldiers= During the Afghanistan campaign, the squadron lost two soldiers killed in action: * Corporal Matthew McCully of Orangeville Ontario, was killed on 25 May 2007 when he stepped on a land mine while on foot patrol. * Corporal Kenneth O'Quinn was killed on 3 March 2009 when the vehicle he was in detonated an improvised explosive device (IED).

At the 2006 census, its population was 49,822, in 10,966 families. In ancient times it had been known as Samangan, having been established by the Sassanid king Hormizd I, although an Elamite tomb has been found as well. The historical territory of Ramshir is located in this area, only away from the city. According to a Sahih Bukhari hadith, Ramhormoz is the ancestral homeland of Salman the Persian. Today residents of the city are primarily Bakhtiari, Southern Lurs of the Bahma'i tribe, and native Khuzi Persians. History The proper history of the city begins in the Sassanid era, although there have been Elamite remains found in and around the city as well. The tomb of the Sassanid founder of the city, Hormizd I, is commonly thought to be situated within the city. \\"With the gradual Muslim conquest of Khuzestan in the 7th century, RƒÅmhormoz was the scene of a peace agreement between the local Sasanian satrap, HormozƒÅn, and the commander of the Muslim army.\\"Chase F.

This satellite carries the in-orbit designation of VO-52, and is an OSCAR series satellite. History It was launched by PSLV-C6 on May 5, 2005. The main payload was an Indian Remote Sensing satellite, CARTOSAT-1 weighing . HAMSAT was placed into a polar sun synchronous orbit. It carries two transponders, one built by William Leijenaar (Call Sign: PE1RAH), a Dutch Radio Amateur and graduate engineering student from the Higher Technical Institute at Venlo and the other by Ham enthusiasts with help from the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). Each transponder is recognized by its beacon. The Indian transponder has an unmodulated carrier on 145.940 MHz. The Dutch transponder is modulated with telemetry information on 145.860 MHz. Both are linear transponders offering the CW, SSB and FM modes of amateur radio communication. They operate Mode-B for U-V operation with UHF uplink and VHF downlink. The satellite joins many previous satellites in amateur radio service; mostly launched by AMSAT. HAMSAT VO-52 failed in Space on 11 July 2014, while on its 49,675th orbit, due to the failure of on-board lithium ion batteries that have met their end of life. Although the satellite's systems and sub-systems are working normal as per the latest telemetry received, the on-board computer recurring to ‚ÄòReset‚Äô mode due to the failure of batteries is hindering operation. Hence, it was decided not to expect any more meaningful and reliable services from HAMSAT VO-52. On 21 July 2014, ISRO has decommissioned ‚ÄòHAMSAT-VO52‚Ä≤ officially. HAMSAT VO-52 was designed for one year mission life, but lasted for almost 10 years. The satellite was designed to be maintenance-free, and autonomous. It was a test-bed for many new concepts such as a Bus Management Unit (BMU), lithium-ion based power system, automatic spin rate control and spin axis orientation control (SAOC) for maintaining the Satellite attitude without ground commanding. HAMSAT was known as ‚ÄúOSCAR-52‚Äù among Amateur HAM operators, and was popular internationally because of its high sensitivity receiver and strong transmitter. SpecificationsThe satellite is spin stabilized. It spins at about 4 RPM. *UHF Uplink and VHF Downlink *Uplink transponder frequency: 435.250 MHz *Downlink transponder frequency: 145.900 MHz *Beacon frequencies: 145.860 MHz CW telemetry and 145.936 MHz unmodulated carrier *Transponder bandwidth: 60 kHz *Transmitter output power: 1 watt *Antennas: VHF and UHF turnstiles *Communication modes: CW, SSB, FM *Electrical power: Gallium Arsenide solar panels charging a Lithium Ion battery *Onboard computer: MAR 31750 processor in the spacecraft's electronic bus management unit for attitude control, telemetry, telecommand for ground control, sensor and actuator functions.

Over these seven days, Italy saw widespread rioting and large-scale strikes throughout the Italian provinces of Romagna and the Marche.\\"Red Week\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Accessed 2 February 2015. (http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/494603/Red-Week) Map showing regions affected by the Red Week riots: Emilia-Romagna, and Marche (below) Origins The rioters were protesting in response to a series of reforms introduced in 1914 initiated by the previous Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti (Salandra was PM by June 1914) which aimed to 'consume' the working class into Italy's liberal system. The final spark that caused the outbreak of the mass strikes was the death of three anti-militarist men in June. Despite a widening of suffrage and a change in the government's policies concerning industrial disputes (in favour of workers), a general strike was called in support of large demonstrations in many major industrialised towns, which in turn had been caused by the shooting of three socialist protesters. However, due to the nature of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), the strike was uncoordinated and rioters were headed off by government troops. The situation was regarded so grave that the government deployed ‚Äú100,000 soldiers,‚Äù including many reservists, resulting in the death of 17 rioters and a thousand injured.John R. Schindler, Isonzo: The Forgotten Sacrifice of the Great War, Connecticut and London, Praeger, 2001, p. 12 The widespread riots paralyzed almost every major city for two days.David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 74 The would-be revolutionaries briefly seized control of ‚Äúentire towns in central Italy; railways were cut, bridges destroyed,‚Äù while the insurgents displayed red flags on public buildings.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and it Monarchy, New Haven & London, Yale University Press, 1989, p. 197 Effects The riots during Red Week frightened the lower middle classes, and proved that Italy's problems of unification were more than just the growing pains of a young nation. Italy's Wars of Unification (Risorgimento) and following trade measures had failed to iron out inequalities between its industrialised North and agricultural South - the needs of both could not simultaneously be satisfied by Giolitti's liberal politics. Benito Mussolini was the only prominent Marxist to defend the popular street uprising that was referred to in Italy as Settimana Rossa (Red Week).Ernst Nolte,Three Faces of Fascism: Action Fran√ßaise, Italian Fascism, National Socialism, Translated from the German by Lelia Vennewitz, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, (1966) p. 154 Mussolini considered Red Week as his ‚Äúgreatest achievement and disappointment‚Äù during his leadership of the Italian Socialist Party, regarding the strike as the pinnacle of radical class struggle but also as an abysmal failure.Giuseppe Finaldi, Mussolini and Italian Fascism, New York and London, Routledge, 2014, p. 24 Although Mussolini hailed Red Week as the beginning of the end of capitalism in Italy, it became evident to many within the labor and socialist movement that rebellion, general strikes and revolutionary ‚Äúmyths‚Äù did not constitute revolution.Giuseppe Finaldi, Mussolini and Italian Fascism, New York and London, Routledge, 2014, p. 24 The strikes resulted in making reactionary elements of the nation stronger as the middle class and conservatives rallied behind their government to put down the rebellion, while the socialists were left with disappointment and recrimination for engaging in an unsuccessful uprising. The failure of Red Week provided evidence of the severe limitations of current class socialism. Mussolini argued that Italy‚Äôs industrial sector was not mature enough and had neither a fully developed modern bourgeoisie nor a modern proletarian movement.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 84 Following the events of June 1914, editorials in Benito Mussolini's political journal Avanti! urged that more drastic measures be taken against the Italian government, and Italy's joining of the First World War subsequent to the Red Week gave huge credence to Mussolini's rhetoric against the sycophantic government, which had presented itself as an easy target for its entry into the Great War.

Medieval great halls were the ceremonial centre of the household and were not private at all; the gentlemen attendants and the servants would come and go all the time. The great chamber was at the dais end of the hall, usually up a staircase. It was the first room which offered the lord of the household some privacy from his own staff, albeit not total privacy. In the Middle Ages the great chamber was an all-purpose reception and living room. The family might take some meals in it, though the great hall was the main eating room. In modest manor houses it sometimes also served as the main bedroom. By the seventeenth century communal meals in the hall had been abandoned and the great chamber was the best dining room. There was often a more modest room called the parlour, where the family took its meals when eating alone. Large houses gradually acquired a greater range of specialised living rooms, such as libraries, drawing rooms, and music rooms. By the early 18th century, great chambers had been replaced by rooms called \\"saloons\\", and these soon lost their function as dining rooms. Many great chambers survive. Hardwick Hall has a very large and little-altered example from around 1600. In many other cases they were redecorated and given more specialised functions as drawing rooms or ballrooms or libraries.

It first aired on Comedy Central on March 19, 2003. In the episode, an alien satellite dish is placed in Cartman's butt. Shortly after, the boys are abducted by the aliens that installed it. They find out that the planet Earth is simply an intergalactic reality show. When word gets back to their home planet, the aliens decide to cancel the show, and something must be done if the boys want to save the day. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. It was originally intended to air as the 100th episode, but \\"I'm a Little Bit Country\\" aired as the 100th episode instead.  Plot  This episode begins almost identically to the very first South Park episode, \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", with Cartman arriving and talking about a dream where he was abducted by aliens. There are some minor differences from the previous episode such as Cartman calling Ike a \\"semen-puking asshole dickhead\\" after Kyle tells him not to call his brother a \\"dildo\\" and Ike saying more profane statements like \\"Suck my balls\\" and \\"Don't kick the goddamn baby!\\". When the children realize that all this has happened before, they come to the conclusion that they are stuck in a \\"repeat\\", they and Chef decide to do something about the anal probe Cartman has; they first see a proctologist, then a scientist. Cartman then refuses to activate the satellite unless Kyle is the one who sticks his finger into his ass. Cartman torments Kyle seven times by continually farting, and finally Kyle gets fed up and plugs him. The scientist, Jeff Goldblum, discovers that he can reverse the polarity of the message that the alien ship is transmitting. A group of Visitors then show up, and the children and Chef flee. However, the children are ultimately abducted. The kids wake up on the ship, and meet Najix, an alien who looks like Stan's dad, and explains that he chose an appearance that would be most pleasing to them. They hate this as it is too reminiscent of the movie Contact, which they hated. He shows his true form, a grotesque, terrifying monster, with yellow and green skin, four legs, and sharp teeth, So the children have him go through a series of transformations, mostly of celebrities or famous television characters, until Cartman suggests \\"a taco that craps ice cream\\". Najix then explains he and the other aliens make a reality show called Earth, and all of Earth's species, such as Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, are taken from their respective home planets for the purposes of the show, and everyone around the world is unknowingly being filmed and watched. The scientist discovers this at the same time on Earth by translating the binary code that resulted from reversing the polarity of the message he proceeds to tell everyone, which leads the alien network heads to cancel the show and prepare to destroy the Earth. The scientist concludes that the show is cancelled thanks to associating the term \\"chaos theory\\" up to \\"cancelled\\", then uses his word association skills with the word \\"jackets\\" to come up with a plan to send the ship a computer virus to disable their computers. Chef responds \\"That doesn't make any goddamned sense!\\". When word spreads to the rest of the planet that Earth is one big reality show, humans become elated that they're famous. In outer space, Najix is informed that Earth is being cancelled, because humans' knowledge that they are a reality television show has ruined the program's quality. When the boys are informed that Earth will be destroyed in order to make way for something more useful, they go to the planet Fognl to meet the alien producers, the \\"Joozians\\", Jewish caricatures with large noses and stereotypical accents, described as controlling all media in the universe. The aliens are unmoved by the boy's pleas to save Earth, explaining that after 100 episodes, the show should be cancelled because shows tend to lose quality after 100 episodes. The Joozians then go to a strip bar, and inhale a purple powder in a manner similar to cocaine. They later get a hotel room with a hooker, and engage in acts that Kenny photographs. When the Joozians later sober up and express shame and embarrassment at their prior acts, the boys agree not to publicize their photo of the Joozians' sexual interlude if the Joozians agree to refrain from destroying Earth. The Joozians agree to this, though they decide to wipe out the truth about Earth's nature as a reality show from the memories of all humans, including those of the boys. Back on Earth, the boys have no memory of what transpired, but Kenny still has the photo, and though no one can remember what it is, Chef tells Kenny to keep it, as he feels sure that it is something very important. The episode ends with another advertisement for Earth, promising that in the next episode the \\"Americans and Iraqis have an all-out brawl\\". (The invasion of Iraq was launched on March 19, 2003, the night of this episode's original airing.) Reception and release \\"Cancelled\\", along with the fourteen other episodes from The Complete Seventh Season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season an 8/10.

It is the seat of the canton that bears its name. The westernmost city on mainland Ecuador, Salinas is an important tourist center. Salinas, Ecuador's largest coastal resort, offers one of the country's best real estate investment markets and most popular and most upscale beach lifestyle. It was the site of the ISA World Junior Surfing Games Ecuador in 2009. There are two major yacht clubs in Salinas, the first is Salinas Yacht Club, which is smaller than the Puerto Lucia Yacht Club, in Santa Elena, in an area known as 'La Libertad' which, in Spanish means 'The Freedom Town'. Puerto Lucia boasts a hotel, several restaurants, a private beach and apartment buildings, as well as the large marina and port. It was a small fishing village until June 30, 1929, when it was established as the rural parish of Santa Elena. On December 22, 1937, an official decree was signed by the Commander in Chief, General Alberto Enriquez Gallo and published in Official Gazette No. 52 of December 27 of that year, that elevated the parish to the rank of canton. Its cantonal head is the town of Salinas, and is composed of the rural parishes Ancon, and Jose Luis Tamayo Anconcito (Muey).

The plan The plan was to divert river water at the rate of up to 280 cubic metres per second into a separate canal for six power stations. This was on top of the three dams already in the upper Waitaki. The scheme would have produced approximately 520MW of power ‚Äî enough to supply a city the size of Christchurch. Objections The objections to the scheme included land issues, the disruption during construction, and concerns about the sustainability of the river. Meridian was working on a large scale mitigation process, whereby issues could be identified and mitigated, when the scheme was finally canceled. Abandonment and impact On 29 March 2004, Meridian announced that they would not continue with Project Aqua. Among their reasons were the uncertainty in gaining access to the water, that Aqua could not come on line soon enough to meet New Zealand's growing electricity demand, the amount of money it was costing the company, design changes due to geology reports, and the Resource Management Act making it difficult to get consent for large water based projects. Meridian's 2004 annual report states that they lost NZ$38.7 million on the project. At the time of cancellation they had spent considerably more than this, but much of the expenditure was for assets such as land that they would later sell.

The official clubs for the 2019/20 school year are as follows: Bike Club, Business Club, Canadian Youth Leaders Association, Chess Club, Coffee House, Compassionate Leadership Club, Craft Club, Debate Club, Diversity Club, Environmental Club, Eric Hamber Eternal Dragon (Dragon boating), Footlights, Garden Club, Gender and Sexuality Alliance, Gourmet Club, Griffin's Nest, Hamber Christian Fellowship, Hamber Reads, Healing Harmonies, Helping Others Succeed Together, Japanese Culture Club, Jia, Kpop club, Library Monitors, Lighting Crew, Math Club, Mental Health Awareness Club, Model United Nations, Multicultural Club, Photography Club, Reach for the Top, Science Club, Sketchbook Club, Ski/Snowboard Club, Sound Crew, South Asian Club, The Knitting Club, Uniform Room, Wish Youth Network Society, Writing Club, and Youth for Youth Association.  Football  In 2010, under the direction of PE Teacher Bobby Gibson, Eric Hamber became the only public school in Vancouver to have an American Football program. In the 2010 season, the Eric Hamber Griffins competed in the Junior Varsity AA league only. In the 2011 season, the Griffins competed with teams in both the Junior Varsity AA and Varsity Tier II leagues. In 2012, both the Junior Varsity and Varsity teams competed in the AA league. That year, the Junior Varsity team made the playoffs, becoming the first Griffins Football team to do so, losing in the first round. In 2013, the Griffins Junior Varsity team competed in an amalgamated AA/AAA league while the Varsity team was relegated at the school's request to the Tier II development league. The Junior Varsity team failed to make the playoffs while the Varsity team was defeated in the first round of the Tier II championship. Beginning in 2014, Eric Hamber stopped fielding both a Junior Varsity and Varsity team, opting to join the teams and compete with a roster consisting of Grade 9 to 12 players in the Tier II development League. In the 2014 season, the Griffins made it to the final of the Tier II Provincial Championship. In 2015, the Griffins continued to field only one team, with that team losing in the semi-finals of the provincial tournament. Starting in 2012, Eric Hamber began a Grade 8 football program in the spring. The team does not play in the formal Grade 8 fall league but organizing exhibition games with other schools during the spring sports season. The program also organizes a flag football program in the spring for feeder elementary schools to promote a culture of football amongst students who are likely to eventually attend to Eric Hamber. Eric Hamber Griffins Football runs with relative independence from the athletics department of the school due to its unique province-wide league and player- based funding. Player fees range from $250-300 based on the season and funding is available for those who can't afford the costs.  In media  Eric Hamber has a history in television and film; one of the parking lots was extensively used in the early days of television series 21 Jump Street, including a memorable confrontation involving Johnny Depp.https://sites.google.com/site/80sfilmlocations/list-of-tv- shows/21jumpstreet1987-91/recurring-locations It was later used as the high school in the 2007 film Juno.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/locations Eric Hamber was used for the filming of TV series iZombie in November 2015. = Canada Sings = In 2011, several of Eric Hamber's staff were part of a glee club called \\"The Edutones\\" on the show Canada Sings. They defeated the opposing The Distillery Restaurants Corporation's \\"Run DRC\\" glee club and won $10,000 for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation.

The CSA developed from a Baptist congregation, the Zarephath-Horeb Community Church, founded in 1971 in Pontiac, Missouri. Over time, Zarephath-Horeb evolved into an extremist paramilitary organization and was rechristened CSA. The group operated a large compound in northern Arkansas called \\"the Farm\\". In April 1985, law enforcement officers investigating the group for weapons violations and terrorist acts carried out a siege of the compound. After a peaceful resolution, officers arrested and later convicted CSA's top leaders, and the organization dissolved. Leadership The founder of the CSA was James Ellison, who was jailed in federal prison along with his \\"high priest\\" Kerry Noble. Robert G. Millar became one of Ellison's spiritual advisers, and also founded Elohim City. Ellison was mentored by Richard Girnt Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations, and Robert E. Miles, founder of the Mountain Church in Cohoctah, Michigan. Both extreme right-wing leaders taught and practiced the theology of Christian Identity, a belief system the FBI includes on its watch list as an extremist religion. Ellison had close ties to the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations, based in Hayden Lake, Idaho, and led by Butler, who was described as \\"the glue of the Aryan Nations movement in the Northwest, if not the country\\" by the supervisor of the Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force.Associated Press in Los Angeles Times/August 28 ???? Miles had a prison ministry and newsletter, relating mostly to the violent white Aryan groups, of which there are many, most notably the Aryan Brotherhood. After Ellison was released from prison, he moved to Elohim City, where he married Millar's granddaughter. The CSA community's Council of Elders was influenced and mentored by many outside sources. The nine-man council deliberated on the spiritual meaning and the direction of CSA activities. Jim Ellison, Kerry Noble, and William Wade were the only known members of the council. Members In June 1982, the CSA had an estimated 90 to 120 members, consisting of men, women, and children. In April 1984, the number of members had been reduced to less than 70. Other known members of The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord include: *James Rolston *Steven Scott (alleged member) *Nick Kimmett *William \\"Bill\\" Thomas *Mitchell L. Rolston (alleged member) *Leonard Ginter *Richard Wayne Snell (alleged member) *Arthur Russell *Timothy Wayne Russell *Rudy Loewen *David Giles *Frank Kumnick (alleged member) *Randall Rader (former member) *Ardie McBrearty (former member) *Andrew \\"Andy\\" Barnhill Purpose The CSA believed that doomsday was imminent, and the 224-acre compound that was set up in Elijah became a community for its members. There they trained their members in paramilitary operations. The group believed in white supremacy and was anti-Semitic. Like other prominent anti-Semitic groups that believed in antisemitic canards, they called the United States government ZOG, short for Zionist Occupied Government. In 1982, the military leader of the group, who ran their \\"End Time Overcomer Survivial\\" training camps and used the name Randall Rader during his stay at the CSA compound, left the group along with 30 of his followers in a rift with Ellison, following the latter's attempt to take a second wife, and joined the newly forming group The Order in Idaho. The CSA initially professed that the United States government would dissolve due to its corruption, whereas The Order advocated revolution. However, in July 1983, The CSA published a manifesto called A.T.T.A.C.K. (Aryan Tactical Treaty for the Advancement of Christ‚Äôs Kingdom), which declared war against the government. This was seen by followers as the Second American Revolution. Operations CSA assassins monitored the homes of their targets, practiced mock assassinations of these targets with scoped rifles, and practiced attacks in a mock residential training facility known as Silhouette City. The 224 acre property on Bull Shoals Lake in Marion County Arkansas that the CSA operated from until the group's collapse in 1985 was purchased by Ellison from the Campus Crusade for Christ in 1976. In 1983, suffering financially, especially after Randall Rader's defection to the Order, the CSA stopped making payments on the mortgage, and on December 20th, the bank foreclosed, selling the property back to the Campus Crusade. The group squatted on the land however, mounting regular armed patrols to intimidate the local sheriff, who continuously delayed their eviction. The perimeter of the CSA compound had 100, 200, and indicator plates nailed to trees to allow the defenders to adjust their sights accordingly to engage attackers. The central rallying point in the event of an attack was a concrete bunkhouse that housed the communications radios next to the tower, which was constructed for defense. The perimeter of the compound had built-in bunkers for one to three men, and each was numbered as a post and assigned to individuals as an area of responsibility. The line infantryman carried a Ruger Mini-14 .223 Remington rifle. As in the early days of the United States Marine Corps, the squads were set up in four-man fire teams. One man in the fire team carried a Heckler and Koch Model 91 rifle in .308 caliber. These had been modified via a technique that the organization sold to \\"brother groups,\\" converting the rifles to an illegal selective fire weapon (capable of firing either single shots or fully automatic). The Elite \\"A\\" Team had black clothing and some fairly sophisticated weapons, such as the .22 caliber Ruger target pistol fitted with an integral silencer, and several MAC-10 submachineguns in both 9 mm and .45 ACP, also with attached suppressors. These men trained in the covert aspects of military action and were to be the core of the defense initiative. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) later determined that the CSA had obtained 155 Krugerrands, one live light antitank rocket, 94 long arms, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns, and machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and a quantity of C-4 explosives. Within \\"Silhouette City\\", the CSA also ran a boot camp-style program known as the End Time Overcomer Survival Training School - which was conducted by Order member, Randall Rader. Here, the group trained an estimated 1,500 of like-minded Christian Identity adherents in combat techniques and paramilitary exercises. The facility was festooned with targets crudely caricaturing Blacks, Jews, and police who wore the star of David in-lieu of badges. Upon completing this training, a newly-trained militant would leave to join or start other similar militia groups. The CSA and its paramilitary arm taught basic pistol and rifle use as well as personal home defense, rural and urban warfare, weapons proficiency, general military fieldcraft, Christian martial arts, and natural wilderness survival. In 1983, CSA member William Thomas accompanying Richard Wayne Snell and Steven Scott attempted to dynamite a natural gas pipeline which crossed the Red River on its way from the Gulf of Mexico to Chicago. This event ran as part of the group's A.T.T.A.C.K. operations. According to Kerry Noble, the group predicted this to result in riots (due to it being in winter). However, the trio was unsuccessful in carrying out the act of terror. The CSA had links with other radical organizations, including the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mountain Church, and The Order, which were all dangerous white supremacist organizations which advocated the violent overthrow of the United States Government. Many of their members were seen traveling in and out of the compound, and after a search of the compound, several stolen vehicles including one belonging to The Order were recovered. According to a report conducted by the California Department of Justice, The Pagans Motorcycle Club provided the CSA with training in booby trap devices and survival techniques in return for weapons and ammunition. In 1983, the CSA declared war on the US ZOG, starting with a failed arson attempt on the Springfield Metropolitan Community Church. Things began to go downhill for the organization not soon after when Richard Snell, an alleged member, was arrested for killing an African-American police officer. Snell was later tied to the killing of a gun store owner in 1981, obtaining and using the same gun, the serial number of which had been removed by the CSA armorer, Kent Yates. The killing of the gun store owner was just a part of a massive campaign of property theft the CSA had launched to offset the loss of income from their training camps. Using their proximity to the state border, the CSA hoped that committing crimes in Missouri and crossing the border back into Arkansas would conceal their activities. Yates was arrested on Friday, July 13, 1984, on an outstanding warrant out of New Mexico for firearms violations in Farmington. He was later also charged and convicted of weapons manufacture and modification for the CSA. After the incident with Snell, the FBI began to seek ways to infiltrate the CSA compound and stop the organization which was deemed dangerous. Its agents obtained warrants under Arkansas state law to arrest Ellison, the leader of the CSA, for multiple firearms violations. (The FBI later claimed that at all times it had an \\"inside man\\" in the CSA.) Siege On 16 April 1985, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the CSA compound. Beginning on 19 April 1985, the FBI and the ATF, led by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), positioned around 300 federal agents in Elijah. It was necessary to keep the operation a secret, but this was not easy in the small community. However, the FBI and ATF agents took advantage of Pontiac being a common destination for anglers by pretending to be fishermen and registering at different motels near the various fishing destinations. On the morning of 19 April, they moved in and surrounded the CSA compound, putting some of their agents in fishing boats to seal off the lakeside area of the compound. There they waited, until a few hours later when two guards emerged from the compound. They appeared to be unaware of the presence of the officers and walked towards a sniper hold-out until an officer yelled commands to return to the compound, with which the guards complied. Later, an unnamed individual emerged from the compound and talked with the federal agents and reported to Ellison that the FBI agents were outside and willing to negotiate his surrender and the emptying of the compound. Ellison emerged later. FBI agents had expected that he would not go down without a firefight, but the FBI negotiators convinced him that the CSA would certainly lose if they had one. Interviewed on March 9 1993 by KXAS-5 News, during the Waco standoff, Kerry Noble asserted that the CSA was expecting to be relieved by both other far- right groups and acts of gods. When neither manifested, group morale and willingness to resist were severely affected. FBI negotiators convinced Ellison that they wanted peaceful cooperation, and he asked that his spiritual adviser, assumed to be Millar, come to the compound to instruct him. The individual was flown to the area and seemed eager to convince Ellison to stand down. They allowed the individual into the compound, and the FBI instructed him to call in every 30 minutes to report on how negotiations were going. U.S. Attorney Asa Hutchinson, who later successfully prosecuted Ellison and other leaders of the CSA, put on an FBI flak jacket and entered the compound to join the negotiations, leading to a peaceful conclusion to the armed stand-off. After several calls requesting more time, early on the morning of the fourth day of the siege, Arkansas State Police entered the compound and escorted out the remaining members without further bloodshed. Women and children had earlier been evacuated to nearby motels. Charges Ellison and most of his leadership were charged in federal court with illegal weapons possession and racketeering. In September 1985, Ellison, Kerry Noble, and four other CSA members (Gary Stone, Timothy Russell, Rudy Loewen, and David Giles) were sentenced to lengthy federal prison terms. A seventh CSA member, Stephen Scott, pleaded guilty in an Arkansas federal court to charges he dynamited a natural gas pipeline near Fulton, Arkansas in 1983, and was also sent to prison. Ex-CSA member Kent Yates also pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to make and transfer automatic weapons silencers.The Covenant, Sword, Arm Of The Lord - James Ellison - Kansas City 100A-16708. Ellison faced the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after he was convicted on federal racketeering and weapons charges. However, Ellison was released in 1987 after agreeing to testify against the leader and six senior members of the Aryan Nations. All seven men were arrested and indicted on charges of sedition. The jury found all the defendants not guilty on all charges. Upon his release from federal prison, Ellison moved to Elohim City. Richard Wayne Snell, the man who shot and killed the police officer and a pawn shop owner, was sentenced to death by lethal injection, which was carried out on 19 April 1995, the same day as the Oklahoma City bombing. Possible ties to the Oklahoma City bombing There are several claims that the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was tied to the \\"New Day\\" teachings of Elohim City. No proof, however, has been established. Elohim City was assembled to gather \\"prophets of the New Day\\". Leader Robert G. Millar envisioned himself to be the \\"Shepherd of Shepherds\\" traveling to numerous alternative societies, many of which were and are still communes. His ambition was to unite these underground organizations. He appeared several times at the Padanaram Settlement, in southern Indiana, but contrary to reports, members of the Padanaram Settlement did not concur with the radical callings of either Millar or Ellison, who made two appearances there. \\"The Valley\\" was and still is known more for being a cultural hub for artists and philosophers, and until roughly 2003 it operated a sawmill. Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted and executed for perpetrating the Oklahoma City bombing, had no association with the CSA and had just enlisted in the U.S Army when the CSA compound was besieged and broken up. The Oklahoma City bombing occurred exactly on the 10th anniversary of the start of the siege of the CSA compound in 1985. The most plausible link is the fact that Richard Wayne Snell, who was executed on the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, had planned a similar attack on the Murrah building in 1983 after becoming upset with the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, Snell was heard taunting jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution. However, McVeigh has stated that he chose the date of 19 April to coincide with the violent end of the Waco siege exactly two years prior. McVeigh had traveled and visited Waco during the 51-day siege and cited it and 1992 Ruby Ridge events as his primary motivation for carrying out the bombing. The single incident in which the CSA was involved, the robbery of a pawn shop in Springfield, Missouri, was in fact, foiled by a CSA member on the orders of Jim Ellison, unknown to Wayne Snell, who headed up the plan. It was regarding this event in which Ellison saw a \\"sign from God\\" which he interpreted to mean that they should not carry out the attempt; not the attack on the Oklahoma City Federal Building. The death knell of the CSA was its attempt to kill FBI special agent Jack Knox, the lead agent assigned to investigate the group; Asa Hutchinson, the federal prosecutor; and the federal judge who presided over the affair that brought about the eventual action against Gordon Kahl, a tax protester and a member of the Posse Comitatus, by federal agents at CSA member, Leonard Ginter's home (called 'The Bunker', due to its construction from concrete covered with earth). Ellison revered Kahl as a hero. Like McVeigh, Kahl was a decorated American soldier; Kahl earned a Silver Star in the Korean War, and McVeigh earned a Bronze Star in the first Gulf War ‚Äì Desert Storm. Media In 2013, Kerry Noble appeared on the Investigation Discovery show Dangerous Persuasions talking about his time with the group. He was also interviewed for an episode of Brainwashed on the Slice Network in Canada and discussed his time with the CSA. The Discovery Channel crime series The FBI Files' sixth season featured an episode whose topic was the CSA. The episode reveals the details of the federal investigation into the group, the 1985 siege, and the aftermath. The episode originally aired 10 December 2002.

They have produced graphics cards, motherboards, modems, sound cards and MP3 players, however the company began with the production of the TrackStar, a PC add-on card which emulated Apple II computers. They were one of the major players in the 2D and early 3D graphics card competition throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Diamond Multimedia is a subsidiary of Tul Corporation.  History  The company was founded by Chong Moon Lee and H. H. Huh, who acted as the technical designer. Diamond Multimedia later merged with S3, Incorporated in 1999 after a long-time cooperative business arrangement, when S3 decided to expand their business from producing graphics chipsets to manufacturing retail graphics cards. The move paralleled the 1999 3dfx purchase of STB Systems, which changed 3dfx from a graphics chipset supplier to companies including Diamond, into a vertically- integrated graphics vendor and direct competitor to S3. However, the first major product after the merger, branded as the S3 Savage 2000, was a commercial failure. Growth in the add-on sound card market, also an ongoing Diamond business, was tempered by the 2000 bankruptcy of Aureal Semiconductor and subsequent asset purchase by vertically-integrated Creative Technologies. With these market failures, the new combined Diamond/S3 company decided to change direction and leave the PC addon-board market. SONICblue was formed. Diamond Multimedia resurfaced in 2003 after the brand and assets had been purchased by Best Data. Diamond again built expansion boards. The company was the defendant in a significant copyright case for its Rio digital music player, which the Recording Industry Association of America claimed infringed copyrights; the Ninth Circuit deemed it to be a fair use, however, in RIAA v. Diamond.RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia, 180 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1999).  Graphics cards  =Speedstar= Diamond's earliest line, now defunct, was the SpeedStar series, initially based on the Tseng Labs ET4000 and ET4000AX chipsets, and expanded further in additional releases. The SpeedStar line was launched as a series of high-performance ISA graphics cards that excelled in MS-DOS applications up through the early 1990s. However, as Microsoft Windows gained market share and newer graphics products entered the market, it was later relegated to the cheaper, value-oriented products and the SpeedStar branding was expanded to other products.

The line later included chipsets with combined 2D and 3D capabilities. Initially the Stealth line was Diamond's high-end brand but transitioned to midrange after the Viper line was introduced. Notable members of the Stealth family have been the Diamond Stealth 3D 2000, by far the most popular S3 Virge-based board. The Diamond Stealth32, using the Tseng Labs ET4000/W32p chipset, was capable of impressive price/performance, especially in DOS. The Diamond Stealth64 Graphics 2001, with the ARK 2000PV/MT chipset, was known for excellent DOS performance at the time. The Diamond Stealth II S220, using the Rendition Verite V2100 2D/3D accelerator, was popular with enthusiasts for its excellent price/performance for both 2D and 3D gaming. A special BIOS patch was released by Diamond for the Stealth II S220 which brought its clock speed up to the same level as the high-end Verite V2200 chip, resulting in equal performance at a significantly lower price. In the middle of the Stealth line-up, Diamond chose to implement a numbering scheme to differentiate their cards. For example, the Diamond Stealth Video VRAM was rechristened the Diamond Stealth Video 3xxx. The numbers had more than a random meaning. Specifically, they tell the buyer the card's memory amount and type. The Stealth Video 3240 uses VRAM (3), is equipped with 2MB initially (2), and is upgradeable to 4MB (4). If the first digit was (2), then the card used standard DRAM. The numbering scheme confused many people since Diamond just renamed current cards with new names. The Stealth Video 3240 was simply the old Stealth Video VRAM. New cards did also use the scheme, however, such as the S3 Trio64V+ cards.

The boards were designed to be an all- encompassing entertainment solution, as the chipset and board included full 2D/3D acceleration, an audio engine capable of General MIDI synthesis, and the ability to use Sega Saturn gamepad controllers. The architecture of the NV1 predates the Microsoft Direct3D philosophy and, as such, game compatibility was a problem with the Diamond Edge boards. Limited and slow Direct3D-supporting drivers did eventually show up, but performance was inadequate and buggy. The audio engine further received poor reviews regarding MIDI quality, which was a common standard for multimedia music playback at the time.

When the 3D engine was called into use, the 3dfx-based card would disconnect the 2D pass-through signal and begin driving the display directly. Both Voodoo and Voodoo2 based offerings were in production until the STB-3dfx merger. The series was highly successful as the Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 chipsets introduced consumer-grade 3D graphics into the PC and arcade markets, whereas such capabilities had previously been present primarily in very high-end CAD and graphic design workstations. A critically acclaimed feature of the Monster 3D II (and all other Voodoo2 boards) was the capability to connect two identical boards in a SLI (Scan-line Interleave) configuration. In SLI, a pair of Voodoo2 boards splits the effort of rendering the 3D scene between alternating raster lines, allowing performance to be nearly doubled.

Initially it consisted of a graphics accelerator board for VLB or PCI that was a combination of two graphics chips. For non-GUI environments such as DOS, the original Viper used an Oak Technology OTI-087 display chip with its own 256 KB DRAM. This chip was rather slow and basic. The Viper SE card moved to a Weitek 5186 chip with 1 MB DRAM for non-GUI functions. For GUI environments such as Windows, the Viper cards used a Weitek graphics co- processor which accelerated many drawing functions and performed very well for its time. The original Viper used the Weitek P9000/P9001, while the Viper SE used a Weitek P9100, both lines equipped with 2-4 MB VRAM. The separate slow DOS chip was a problem for owners who played DOS games because these chips were quite slow and had limited and buggy VESA BIOS Extensions implementations. While the GUI accelerator was very capable, drivers from Diamond were rather buggy and were only revised a few times during the lifetime of the card.Seemann, Torsten. Diamond Viper Resource Page, accessed March 2009. Towards the end of the 1990s, the Viper line consisted of NVIDIA- based graphics cards. The Diamond Viper V330 used the highly integrated RIVA 128 accelerator that featured very capable 2D, 3D and video acceleration. The later Diamond Viper V550 and V770 utilized the RIVA TNT and RIVA TNT2 accelerators which were evolutions of the RIVA 128. In 1999, Diamond was acquired by S3 Graphics and became primarily a supplier of products based upon their graphics accelerator chips. The Diamond Viper II Z200 was based upon the S3 Savage 2000, a supposed NVIDIA GeForce 256 killer. Unfortunately the chip itself was not fully functional and the drivers were very buggy.

This brand was originally created decades ago as just \\"Fire\\" by the design team of the professional computer graphics pioneer SPEA Software AG from Starnberg (Germany) that was about 1996 acquired by Diamond. Products whilst under the hood of Diamond were: *Diamond Fire GL, based on the 3Dlabs GLINT 300SX and S3 Vision968 (for 2D) chips, PCI interface *Diamond Fire GL 1000, based on the 3Dlabs Permedia NT (Permedia + GLINT Delta) chips, PCI interface *Diamond Fire GL 2000, based on the 3Dlabs GLINT 300SX, GLINT Delta and Avance Logic ALG2564 (for 2D) chips, PCI interface *Diamond Fire GL 3000, based on the 3Dlabs GLINT 500TX, GLINT Delta and Avance Logic ALG2564 (for 2D) chips, PCI interface *Diamond Fire GL 4000, based on the Mitsubishi 3DPro/2mp chipset and Cirrus Logic CL- GD5446 (for 2D) chip, PCI interface *Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro, based on 3Dlabs Permedia2 chip, PCI/AGP interface The FireGL team was bought by ATI (later AMD) in 2001 once the combined Diamond/S3 dropped out of the graphics market to form SONICblue. ATI continues the Fire GL lineup. As of September 2007, thus long after that business, Diamond was also preparing a new video card, based on the latest-generation R600 graphics core. This was the same core as used for ATI driven FireGL V8650 and V8600 cards. Diamond altered the PCB reference design and labeled their device VFX 2000 series professional workstation graphics card. It came with at least 2 GB GDDR4 memory on board.Fudzilla report, retrieved September 3, 2007 =Radeon HD= Radeon HD series.

The Monster Sound cards were the first to support hardware mixing acceleration with Microsoft's new DirectSound and DirectSound3D audio APIs. Most, if not all, also supported Aureal's burgeoning A3D API. The original Monster Sound card was distinct in this regard, but also controversial because it possessed poor DOS game compatibility which was still critical at the time. DOS game audio was only functional within a Windows 95 DOS box. It came equipped with a 2MB AdMOS MIDI daughterboard. The Monster Sound M80 was similar to the original Monster Sound, but lacked 4 speaker support. It also had a reduced quality AdMOS MIDI daughterboard (1MB). Monster Sound MX200 had excellent General MIDI quality because of the high quality patch set (licensed from Roland) it was equipped with on its 4MB Dream daughtercard. Otherwise it was technically identical to the original Monster Sound. The Diamond Monster Sound MX300 was based on the Vortex2 audio ASIC from Aureal Semiconductor. It was a substantial step forward in gaming audio, with impressive 3D audio positioning and other effects. It utilized the then state-of-the-art Aureal A3D 2.0 3D audio API. Monster Sound MX400 was advertised as being one of the first sound cards with hardware MP3 decoding acceleration. This was a redundant feature because the central CPUs in PCs at the time were more than capable of handling MP3 playback. It was also somewhat complicated to make use of the MP3 acceleration because special software was needed to use it. The Vortex2-equipped MX300 was a superior card for 3D audio. Aureal had gone into bankruptcy and was dissolved, so their last generation of chips were never released. Diamond instead used ESS's less powerful chips to continue the line. The MX400 was the last of the Monster Sound cards. *Diamond Monster Sound PCI *Diamond Monster Sound M80 PCI *Diamond Monster Sound MX100 PCI *Diamond Monster Sound MX200 PCI *Diamond Monster Sound MX300 Aureal Vortex2 PCI *Diamond Monster Sound MX400 ESS Canyon3D PCI =Sonic Impact= The Sonic Impact was the value-oriented sound card line from Diamond.

An early advertisement from 1984 also claimed it would add CP/M compatibility via the included Z80 processor. The TrackSTAR was redesigned to fit in the shorter expansion slot of the Tandy 1000 and was key to that marque's expansion into the educational computer market. =Rio PMP300= Diamond's innovation created the Rio PMP300, one of the first consumer MP3 players, but they soon sold their MP3 player line and no longer provide support for it. =SupraMax DSL modems= The SupraMax line is a popular value DSL modem line. The brand has a lineage going back to Supra, Inc.. =Diamond Micronics motherboards= Diamond began manufacturing PC-compatible motherboards after purchasing Micronics Computers Inc. in 1998. =Maximum DVD= Diamond was an early (1997) entrant into PC DVD kits with their Maximum DVD 1000DB-VAR (Value Added Reseller) and 2000-RETKIT (RETail KIT). These kits bundled a 'feature reduced' (several pin headers and other parts not installed) full length PCI MPEG2 analog overlay decoder card made by divion. This card connected to the VGA card with an external passthrough cable, a 3.5mm (1/8\\") external patch cord to the soundcard's line-in jack, and the analog audio cable from the included Toshiba SD-M1002 DVD-ROM drive connected to the divion card while a second cable passed the audio on to the soundcard's internal connector. Diamond also made kits called the Maximum DVD 1500 and 2500. (Hardware specifications unknown.) The drivers and player software for these are not compatible with the DVD 1000 and 2000. They are a slightly newer product with the 'Navigator' player software having a cleaner user interface. None of these DVD kits are DirectX compatible and as the drivers are the VxD type, they will only work with Windows 95 through 98SE. Dual-layer DVDs are not supported in original Windows 95 or 95a, but are in the various versions of 95 OEM Service Release 2. Windows 98 or 98SE is not recommended due to problems that may happen with video color and alignment. Only the bundled player software can use the hardware MPEG2 decoding of the card. =SCSI adapters= Diamond produced the capable but relatively low-cost FirePort 40 SCSI adapter in the late 1990s.

It is located at the 63 kilometer marker on the road from Guayaquil to Manab√≠. It is the seat of Pedro Carbo Cant√≥n, founded in 1984. As of the census of 2001, there are 36,711 people residing within canton limits.Cantons of Ecuador at statoids.com A new census was conducted in 2010 but results are yet unknown. The city is named after Pedro Carbo Noboa, a 19th-century politician, diplomat and writer from Guayaquil. History The area now known as Pedro Carbo was once called \\"Rio Nuevo\\" (new river) and was an important town in the parroquia \\"San Juan de Soledad\\", now known as the town of Isidro Ayora (located to the east of Pedro Carbo). On August 1, 1893 the name was changed to Caama√±o and was designated a rural parroquia of the cant√≥n Daule, located to the east. The town kept the name Caama√±o until 1895 during the Liberal Revolution, when its name was changed to honor Pedro Carbo Noboa. In the Territorial Division Law of 1897, the change was officially documented. Finally on July 12, 1984 the president of the Republic, Dr. Oswaldo Hurtado Larrea, declared the formation of Cant√≥n Pedro Carbo, which was published in the Civil Registry N¬∞ 790 on July 19, 1984 Nomenclature Pedro Carbo is named after Pedro Carbo Noboa, a politician, diplomat and writer. He was born in Guayaquil March 19, 1813, son of Coronel Jos√© Carbo Unzueta and Mrs. Josefa Noboa. He grew up in Guayaquil then moved to Mexico for a time before returning to Guayaquil. He became a public figure in 1835 when he was appointed Official Mayor of the Ministry of Interior and Exterior Relations. His subsequent political roles include Secretary of the Encoder Commission, Secretary of Ecuadorian Legation and worked in business negotiations with New Granada and Peru. In 1845 he was named General Minister of the Provisional Government after the Marxist Revolution. As a commissioner for the government of Guayaquil, he also played an integral part in the negotiations of terms for the Virginia Treaty. He attended the National Convention as the Deputy of the Province of Guayas in 1845 and later represented the provinces of Guayas, Pinchincha and Chimborazo in various Assemblies. He was proposed as a presidential candidate in 1864 but did not run and instead focused his energies on attacking the regime of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, after which he went into exile in Paris then Peru. He died December 24, 1894. Geography Pedro Carbo is located in the coastal province of Guayas, Ecuador. It is located at the 63 kilometer marker on the road from Guayaquil to Manab√≠. Territorial Limits North and East: Paj√°n Canton (Manab√≠ Province) South: Santa Elena Canton (Santa Elena Province) East: Isidro Ayora Canton and Colimes Canton (Province of Guayas) Area: Cant√≥n Pedro Carbo has an area of 363.7 mi2 (942 km2) Climate: The annual average temperature is 80.6 ¬∞F (27 ¬∞C) with an average yearly rainfall of 31.2 inches (79.3 cm). Most of the high temperatures and rainfall occur during the hot rainy season (invierno) which lasts from mid-December to mid-June, while the cooler dry season (verano) lasts from mid-June to mid-December. Part of the cant√≥n consists of dry tropical forests, which contain a diverse ecosystem with a wide variety of flora and fauna. The river \\"Pedro Carbo\\" which only has water during the rainy season, passes through the cant√≥n and is a source of water for agriculture and tourism. Economy The area is primarily agriculturally based with a majority of families with at least one member of the household working in some form of agriculture. The primary crops are rice, corn, sunflowers (for cooking oil), peanuts, a variety of beans, mangos, and bananas. In areas near water sources is where the most diversity in crops can be found. Cattle and goats are the primary animal husbandry products. Many residents also use local reeds and wood in craft trades, such as expert woodworkers and Panama hat weavers. The streets are lined with merchants selling a wide variety of products, from fruits and vegetables, to street food, to clothing and items for the home. Celebrations The two main local holidays in Pedro Carbo are: -The celebration in honor of Saint Pablo and Saint Pedro, the patron saints of the cant√≥n. Celebrated June 29 each year. -The celebration of the date when Pedro Carbo was declared a cant√≥n. Celebrated July 19 each year. The town has a variety of other celebrations and holidays throughout the year, including many international celebration and recognition days. Holidays are typically celebrated with a parade down the main street, public dances, and social ceremonies.

He was born in Roosevelt, New York and attended Syracuse University. He was the first president of the National Football League Players Association following the AFL-NFL merger, serving from 1970 to 1973. Mackey was also a major reason the NFLPA created the \\"88 Plan\\", which financially supports ex- players who required living assistance in later years. A five-time Pro Bowler, Mackey was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992, the second pure tight end elected. College Career Mackey played three seasons at Syracuse University (1960-1962), alternating between the running back, tight end, and wide receiver position. His first two seasons were on the same team as Ernie Davis, the 1961 Heisman Trophy winner. Mackey caught a total of 27 passes for 481 yards and 5 touchdowns, while also rushing for 259 yards and 4 more scores.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/john-mackey-2.html As a Junior, he set a school record with 321 receiving yards, and caught 4 passes in Syracuse's 15-14 win over the University of Miami in the 1961 Liberty Bowl.https://cuse.com/news/2011/7/7/FB_0707110503.aspx In Mackey's three seasons, Syracuse had a 20-10 record and won the Liberty Bowl each year.https://www.syracuse.com/orangefootball/2011/07/syracuse_great_john_mackey_and.html NFL career Mackey was drafted by the Baltimore Colts with the 19th pick in the second round of the 1963 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he averaged over 20 yards per catch, scored seven touchdowns, and earned a trip to the Pro Bowl. He also returned 9 kickoffs for 271 yards, an average of 30 yards per return.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MackJo00.htm He went on to play a total of 10 NFL seasons as tight end, and became known for his size and speed. Mackey played his first nine seasons with the Colts before leaving the team in 1971. He played his final season with the San Diego Chargers, retiring at the end of the 1972 season. Although a knee injury forced him into early retirement, Mackey only missed one game in his whole career. During his 10 seasons in the NFL, Mackey scored 38 touchdowns and caught 331 passes for 5,236 yards. He also rushed 19 times for 127 yards. His career yards per catch average of 15.8 is currently the second highest total among all Hall of Fame tight ends, trailing only Jackie Smith.https://athlonsports.com/nfl/25-greatest-tight-ends-nfl-history =Super Bowl V= Mackey played in Super Bowl V on January 17, 1971. He was involved in a famous game-changing play where he caught a record-setting 75 yard pass from quarterback Johnny Unitas after the ball was deflected twice, once by fellow Colts player Eddie Hinton and once by opposing Dallas Cowboys defenseman Mel Renfro. Baltimore won the game 16‚Äì13, following a 32-yard field goal by Jim O'Brien with five seconds left. =Honors= During his playing career, Mackey played in five Pro Bowls, including in his rookie season. He was also named All-NFL three times. In 1992, Mackey was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming only the second pure tight end to be awarded this honor. Mackey has been included in several lists of great NFL players. In 1999, The Sporting News ranked Mackey at 48 on their list of \\"The 100 Greatest Football Players.\\" He also placed at number 42 on the NFL Network's list of the \\"Top 100 Football Players\\" in 2010. In 2001, the John Mackey Award was established by the Nassau County Sports Commission. The award is given yearly to the top college tight end. On September 15, 2007, Mackey's alma mater, Syracuse University, retired number 88 in his honor. On September 27, 2017, Mackey was installed, posthumously, into the Nassau County High School Athletic Hall of Fame as an athlete. His widow, Sylvia, accepted the honor on his behalf. This was the third class of the Hall of fame, which is housed in the renovated Nassau County Veterans' Memorial Coliseum. Post-playing career =NFL Players Association presidency= In 1970, Mackey became the first president of the National Football League Players Association following the merger of the National Football League and the American Football League. Although the NFL and AFL each had a candidate for president in mind, Mackey emerged as the leader both sides could agree on. Mackey held the position of president until September 1973. In his first year as president, Mackey organized a strike following a lockout by owners, with NFL players seeking additional pension contributions and insurance benefits, as well as higher pre- and post-season pay. The strike resulted in increased fringe benefits for NFL players totalling more than $12 million. According to former teammate Ordell Braase, Mackey \\"had a vision for that job, which was more than just putting in time and keeping the natives calm. You don't get anything unless you really rattle the cage.\\" In 1972, Mackey became the lead plaintiff in a court action which led to the overturning of the so-called \\"Rozelle Rule,\\" which limited a player's ability to act as a free agent. In 1976, the Rozelle Rule was ruled to violate antitrust laws in Mackey v. NFL. =Post-career health problems= Several years after retiring from the NFL, Mackey began to suffer from symptoms of dementia. In one notorious incident at an airport checkpoint, Mackey refused to remove his Super Bowl and Hall of Fame rings at the metal detector. When a guard insisted he take them off, Mackey bolted through the checkpoint.

Although Mackey received a small pension, it was not sufficient to cover the costs of his care, leading his wife Sylvia to reach out to NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Once made aware of the problem, Tagliabue and NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw responded with the \\"88 plan\\" in February 2007. Named for Mackey's jersey number, the plan provides $88,000 per year for nursing home care and up to $50,000 annually for adult day care for former NFL players, including Mackey, suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's. Mackey died July 6, 2011 at the age of 69. It was revealed by a study by the University of Boston on his brain that he died of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

He is the CEO of Whole Foods Market, which he co-founded in 1980. Named Ernst & Young entrepreneur of the year in 2003, Mackey is a strong supporter of free market economics, has strong anti-union views, and co-wrote the bestselling book Conscious Capitalism, which was released in 2013. He is one of the most influential advocates in the movement for organic food.\\"The Whole Foods Shebang\\", Grist Magazine, December 17, 2004 Early life and education Mackey was born on August 15, 1953, in Houston, Texas, the son of Margaret Wescott (Powell) and William Sturges \\"Bill\\" Mackey, Jr. He has a sister and a brother. John Mackey's father Bill was a professor of accounting, CEO of LifeMark, a health-care company, and investor of Whole Foods Market, before he died in 2004. In the abstract to the book: Conscious Capitalism, Mackey thanks his father for teaching him valuable life lessons. Mackey's mother Margaret died in 1987 when John was thirty-four years of age. John and Margaret had a strained relationship, partly due to her desire for a different future regarding her son. Margaret felt that such a ‚Äúfine mind‚Äù should devote its time doing something more productive than retailing. John did not agree, but in later years he regretted that he did not make it more clear that he loved her. Mackey was a student of philosophy and religion at the University of Texas at Austin and Trinity University in the 1970s, and worked at a vegetarian co-op.The Observer, \\"Peace, love and profitmeet the world's richest organic grocer\\", The Observer. Retrieved July 17, 2007 Mackey spent almost six years studying various topics, deciding to focus solely on his interests and not purely seek out a degree. Mackey credits his generalist approach to learning as the main reason he was able to be successful in business. Mackey, who was a vegetarian for 30 years, now identifies as a vegan. Career Mackey co-founded his first health food store, SaferWay, with his girlfriend Renee Lawson (Hardy) in Austin in 1978. They met while living in a vegetarian housing co-op. They dropped out of college. They borrowed $10,000 and raised $35,000 more to start SaferWay. At the time, Austin had several small health food stores. The two ran the market on the first floor, a health food restaurant on the second, and, for a short time, lived in the third story of their building. In two years, they merged SaferWay with Clarksville Natural Grocery run by Mark Skiles and Craig Weller and renamed the business Whole Foods Market. All four (Mackey, Hardy-Lawson, Skiles and Weller) are considered co-founders of the business. Mackey built Whole Foods into a multinational organization, with outlets in major markets across the country, as well as Canada and the United Kingdom. Along the way he bought out smaller competitors. In 2007 Whole Foods purchased a major natural foods supermarket competitor, Wild Oats Markets, Inc. Mackey serves on multiple nonprofit boards of directors - including Students For Liberty, Global Animal Partnership, Conscious Capitalism and the Humane Society of the United States. =Animal welfare= Whole Foods was the first grocery chain to set standards for humane animal treatment. Mackey was influenced by animal rights activist, Lauren Ornelas, who criticized Whole Foods' animal standards regarding ducks at a shareholder meeting in 2003. Mackey gave Ornelas his email address and they corresponded on the issue. He studied issues related to factory farming and decided to switch to a primarily vegan diet that included only eggs from his own chickens. Since 2006, he has followed an entirely plant-based diet. He advocates tougher animal standards. Despite Whole Foods' welfare standards, Mackey has been criticized by abolitionist vegans such as Gary L. Francione, who believes the Whole Foods company policies betray the animal rights position. By other accounts, Mackey is the \\"driving force\\" behind significant changes in animal welfare. For instance, he started a non-profit foundation, the Animal Compassion Foundation, to address making animal welfare more economically viable. Foreword by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson and Leila Masson. The Animal Compassion Foundation folded in 2008 with the formation of the Global Animal Partnership, a nonprofit organization that is independent of Whole Foods Market. Mackey is on the Board of Directors of Global Animal Partnership. Additionally, he is a board member of Farm Forward, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that implements innovative strategies to promote conscientious food choices, reduce farmed animal suffering, and advance sustainable agriculture, and he has been a member of the Board of Directors for the Humane Society of the United States since 2009. =Letter to employees= In 2006, Mackey announced he was reducing his salary to $1 a year, would donate his stock portfolio to charity, and set up a $100,000 emergency fund for staff facing personal problems. He wrote: \\"I am now 53 years old and I have reached a place in my life at which I no longer want to work for money, but simply for the joy of the work itself and to better answer the call to service that I feel so clearly in my own heart.\\" He has instituted caps on executive pay at the company. =Yahoo! Finance postings= On July 20, 2007, The Wall Street Journal revealed that Mackey was, for at least seven years, using the pseudonym \\"Rahodeb\\" (an anagram of his wife's name, Deborah) to post to Yahoo Finance forums. He referred to himself in the third person and criticized rival supermarket chain Wild Oats Markets.His approximately 2000 or more posts are still available online (8000 according to MSN Web Search), by searching for site:finance.yahoo.com rahodeb. The Federal Trade Commission approved a complaint challenging Whole Foods Market's approximately $670 million acquisition of its chief rival, Wild Oats Markets, Inc. It authorized the FTC staff to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in federal district court to halt the deal, pending an administrative trial on the merits. After an extensive regulatory battle with the FTC, a federal appeals court consented to the deal. Whole Foods officially completed its buyout of Wild Oats on August 27, 2007. In May 2008, after an SEC investigation cleared him, Mackey started blogging again. In a 2,037 word post, he wrote about why he began blogging in the first place and how his upbringing drove him to defend himself and Whole Foods. He admitted he made a mistake in judgment, but not in ethics.The CEO's Blog Back to blogging =Resignation as chairman= On December 24, 2009, Mackey resigned from the position of Chairman of the Board of Whole Foods Market, a position he held since 1978. On his blog, he said, \\"John Elstrott will now take the title of Chairman of the Board, which will accurately reflect the authority and the responsibilities that he has had for many years.\\" Mackey remains a member of the Board of Directors. Political views =Libertarianism= In a debate in the October 2005 issue of Reason magazine among Mackey, economist Milton Friedman, and entrepreneur T. J. Rodgers, Mackey said that he is a free-market libertarian.Rethinking the Social Responsibility of Business, Reason, October 2005. He said that he used to be a democratic socialist in college.,\\"Whole Food's John Mackey on Capitalism's Moral Code\\". January 2013. As a beginning businessman, he was challenged by workers for not paying adequate wages and by customers for overcharging, during a time when he was having difficulty breaking even. He began to take a more capitalistic worldview, and discovered the works of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman.Salon, Interview: John Mackey. Consulted on July 17, 2007. Mackey is an admirer of some of Ayn Rand's novels.\\"Give BB&T; Liberty, but Not a Bailout\\", The New York Times, August 1, 2009. Mackey co-founded the organization Freedom Lights Our World (FLOW) to combine his commitments to \\"economic and political freedom as well as personal growth, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship.\\"John Mackey, Foreword, to Michael Strong, Be the Solution: How Entrepreneurs and Conscious Capitalists Can Solve All the World's Problems (Wiley & Sons, March 2009), p. xiv He supports such changes as green tax shifts, environmental trusts, world legal systems to allow the poor to create legal businesses, and a citizen's dividend to help the poor in the developed world.Be the Solution, op. cit., pp. 139-96 The name and focus of FLOW have since become Conscious Capitalism, Inc., which was initially created as a program of FLOW and evolved to the point at which it became the organization's principal focus. In 2010 the name of the organization was formally changed. The Conscious Capitalism Institute was chartered in 2009. In 2010 the original FLOW group merged with the Institute group to become one unified organization. In 2013, Mackey was interviewed on Harvard Business Reviews Ideacast podcast about his views on conscious business. Mackey said, \\"If you want to be competitive in the long term, your business needs to have discovered its higher purpose and it needs to adopt a stakeholder philosophy\\". He eschewed the conventional thinking that \\"business has to be sort of ruthless and heartless to be successful\\". =Healthcare reform= Mackey opposed the public health insurance option that ultimately did not become part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Mackey asserted that a better plan would be allowing consumers to purchase health insurance across state lines and use a combination of health savings accounts and catastrophic insurance, as Whole Foods does.The Whole Foods Alternative to ObamaCare, The Wall Street Journal, August 11, 2009. Mackey's statement that Americans do not have an intrinsic right to healthcare led to calls for a boycott of Whole Foods Market from the Progressive Review and from numerous groups on Facebook.\\"Whole Foods CEO's Health Care Views Provoke Some Customers to Boycott Store\\", FOXNews.com, August 15, 2009. Alternatively, Tea Party movement advocates organized a number of buycotts in support of Mackey's suggestions. In August 2009, Mackey wrote the editorial in the Wall Street Journal expressing his viewpoints on universal healthcare in the United States. \\"While we clearly need health-care reform, the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system,\\" he wrote. He continued: \\"Many promoters of health-care reform believe that people have an intrinsic ethical right to health careto equal access to doctors, medicines and hospitals. While all of us empathize with those who are sick, how can we say that all people have more of an intrinsic right to health care than they have to food or shelter?\\" In an NPR interview in 2013, Mackey compared the Obama administration's healthcare law to \\"fascism\\" instead of socialism, stating, \\"[t]echnically speaking, it's more like fascism. Socialism is where the government owns the means of production. In fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production, but they do control itand that's what's happening with our health care programs and these reforms.\\"David Catron, Is Obamacare Socialism or Fascism?, The American Spectator, January 18, 2013 The day following the interview, Mackey wrote that he regretted having made the remark, stating that he \\"made a poor word choice to describe [the U.S.] healthcare system.\\" Instead, he called it \\"government-controlled health care\\". =Unions= Mackey is known for his strong anti-union views, having once compared unions to herpes in that \\"it won't kill you, but it's very unpleasant and will make a lot of people not want to be your lover.\\" Whole Foods Market, along with Costco and Starbucks, teamed up in 2008 to create an alternative to the Employee Free Choice Act. The three companies invited other corporations, unions and public interest groups to join them, proposing instead that unions be given more access to meet with workers, stricter penalties for labor violations and a guaranteed right to request secret ballots in all circumstances. Mackey commented in 2005: > \\"It's illegal in the United States for there to be company unionsspecial > unions which are formed and controlled by the employees and managers of the > company to represent their interests and collectively bargain on their > behalf. These type of unions are legal in many countries such as Japan, but > are illegal in the United States. Instead the law requires that all unions > be outside unions. I believe this law should be repealed and that company > unions should be as legal as any other kind of voluntary association.\\"John > Mackey's Blog, Whole Foods Market.com. October 20, 2005. =Environment= Mackey does not consider himself to be a skeptic of scientific opinion on climate change (see Climate change denial). Nevertheless, he rejects the scientific evidence for dangerous anthropogenic global warming, believing instead that \\"climate change is perfectly natural and not necessarily bad.\\" In a 2010 discussion of books on his reading stack with journalist Nick Paumgarten, Mackey explained his views on human-caused climate change were similar to those of Australian geologist and author Ian Plimer: > ...Mackey told me that he agrees with the book [ Heaven and Earth ]'s > assertion that, as he put it, \\"no scientific consensus exists\\" regarding the > causes of climate change; he added, with a candor you could call bold or > reckless, that it would be a pity to allow \\"hysteria about global warming\\" > to cause us \\"to raise taxes and increase regulation, and in turn lower our > standard of living and lead to an increase in poverty.\\" Personal life His company, Whole Foods, has a market value of $11.7 billion (2011). As of 2011, he drove a five-year-old Honda Civic, uses low- cost hotels and always flies commercial. For an interview with Barron's magazine, he wore khaki shorts and a checked shirt. =Religion= During his twenties, he experimented with different religions and philosophies. A girl influenced him to become a Christian for a short while. Now he recognizes himself as a perennialist, also called the Perennial philosophy. =Family= Mackey had a longtime relationship with Mary Kay Hagen. He married his wife, Deborah Morin, in 1991.Travis County, Texas, Marriage records, certificate 81119 They have no children. Both practice yoga. They spend the week in Austin and weekends at their ranch west of Austin. Legacy and honors Mackey was named the 2003 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year, and one of the top 30 CEOs in 2007 by Barron's magazine. In May 2008, he received an honorary bachelor's degree from Bentley College.

It is administered as part of the municipality of Itanha√©m in the State of S√£o Paulo. The island is small in size, only , and has a temperate climate. The island's terrain varies considerably, ranging from bare rock to rainforest. It is the only home of the critically endangered, venomous Bothrops insularis (golden lancehead pit viper), which has a diet of birds. The snakes became trapped on the island when rising sea levels covered up the land that connected it to the mainland. The ensuing selection pressure allowed the snakes to adapt to their new environment, increasing rapidly in population and rendering the island dangerous to public visitation. Queimada Grande is closed to the public in order to protect both people and the snake population; access is only available to the Brazilian Navy and selected researchers vetted by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, the Brazilian federal conservation unit. Geography Located approximately off the coast of the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the island is approximately in area. The island ranges in elevation from sea level to above sea level. The island has a temperate climate that is similar to its neighbouring island Nimer. of the island is covered by rain forest; the remaining areas consist of barren rocks and open grassland. Queimada Grande ranges from an average of in August to in March, and rainfall ranges from per month in July to in December.  History  Ilha da Queimada Grande has a variety of vegetation. The island is partly covered in rainforest and partly bare rock and grassy cleared areas, a result of deforestation. The deforestation is the origin of the island's name: the term \\"Queimada\\", in Portuguese, means ‚Äúburnt‚Äù because when locals attempted to clear land for a banana plantation on the island, they had to clear rain forest using this technique. A lighthouse was constructed in 1909 to steer ships away from the island. The last human inhabitants left the island when the lighthouse was automated. The island and the Ilha Queimada Pequena to the west are protected by the Ilhas Queimada Pequena e Queimada Grande Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, created in 1985. The Brazilian Navy has closed the island to the public and the only people who are allowed on the island are research teams who receive waivers to collect data.  Endangerment  Because there are so many snakes on one island, by some estimates one snake to every square meter (10.8 square feet) of the island, there is competition for resources. Despite a population of 41 recorded bird species on Queimada Grande, the golden lancehead relies on only two: the Troglodytes musculus (the southern house wren), which is usually able to avoid the golden lancehead as a predator, and the Chilean elaenia (a species of flycatcher), which feeds on vegetation in the same area as the snake. The island was thought to have a population of about 430,000 snakes, but recent estimates are much lower. The first systematic study of the population of the golden lancehead found the population to be 2,000 to 4,000, concentrated almost entirely in the rainforest area of the island. This might have happened because there was a limited amount of resources and the population became level, but in 2015 an estimate by a herpetologist on a Discovery Channel documentary stated that the population remains at 2,000 to 4,000 golden lanceheads. The Bothrops insularis also may be at risk from inbreeding, effects of which are evident in the population. Because of the overall low population of the golden lancehead, the snake was labelled critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It also was placed on the list of Brazil's endangered animals. The island is also home to a smaller population of Dipsas albifrons, a non- venomous snake species.

It was released on September 16, 1997 by LaFace Records, in North America. The album features guest appearances from Monica, Jermaine Dupri, and Lil' Kim. The album was supported by three singles, all platinum-selling: \\"Nice & Slow\\", \\"My Way\\", and \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\". With most of the album production by Babyface and Dupri, the album debuted at number 15 on Billboard 200 and number four on US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums charts. The album eventually topped the Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart for 3 weeks and it also peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and became a commercial success. It was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). My Way earned Usher a nomination for Grammy-nominations and became his breakthrough album.  Critical reception  In a contemporary review, The Source magazine said with My Way, \\"Usher proves that he's aiming to become more than just R&B; music's best kept secret\\". Asondra R. Hunter from Vibe said that Usher is sensual through his mild and gentle tone and tasteful, refined lyrics. Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, cited \\"Just Like Me\\" and \\"You Make We Wanna...\\" as highlights, and quipped that Usher was \\"the sweetest nonvirgin a mama could ask\\". He gave My Way a one-star honorable mention, indicating \\"a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like.\\" In a negative review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke felt that the album has too many downtempo songs, and criticised the writing and production quality. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave My Way four out of five stars and praised Usher's vocal restraint, but noted inconsistency in quality.[ My Way ‚Äì Usher]. Allmusic. Rovi Corporation. Retrieved on June 24, 2013. In a 2002 review, Q magazine also gave it four stars and wrote that it established Usher's reputation as a young and skillful performer of R&B; slow jams. Keith Harris, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), gave it three-and-a-half stars and said that, although Dupri's combination of hi-hat hits, acoustic-guitar arpeggios, and occasional guest raps from him and Lil Kim can inhibit the album, My Way was the work of a significant, enterprising artist. Yahoo! Music's Billy Johnson Jr. credited the album for Usher's breakthrough into the music industry, and lauded the production of the three singles. Commercial performance My Way debuted at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 chart dated October 4, 1997, selling 66,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It entered the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums at number four on that same week.

Accessed October 17, 2020 Academics BCA is divided into seven academic and professional divisions which are often referred to by their single-word nicknames or acronyms. However, BCA is treated as a single high school within the district and the state. BCA has an extended school day from 8:00 AM to 4:10 PM. The day starts with a 4-minute Information Gathering Session (IGS) followed by 27 modules (commonly referred to as \\"mods\\") that last 15 minutes each. There are 18 academic departments at BCA: Biology, Business, Chemistry, Culinary Arts, Engineering, English, Health/PE, History, Journalism, Mathematics, Music, Physics, Studio Arts and Graphic Communications, Technology, Theater Arts, Senior Experience, Visual Arts, and World Languages. All academies require four years of English Language, mathematics, social studies, and physical education, as well as three years of science and world language. All students take three years of projects and clubs, with clubs placed at the last three mods on Wednesday. Seniors participate in Senior Experience,Senior Experience, Bergen County Academies.

In addition, 40 hours of community service are required for graduation. While offering some 14 AP courses, BCA does not emphasize them. BCA gives its teachers great freedom in curriculum design to adequately engage the intellectual capacity of the student body. Thus, courses often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity. Such courses include Series Hybrids and Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics and Lasers, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Foundations of Nanotechnology, Interactive Design, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, Bioengineering, Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics and International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology. Research is available to students in all academies: the independent research opportunities offered allow students to compete in science fairs on local to international levels as well as submit papers for publication. Students of all academies participate in various studio and performing arts courses. The BCA Concert and Chamber Choirs have won excellent ratings and awards at local and national competitions under Dr. Patrick D. Finley. The instrumental performance program has offered other features, including an opportunity for students to play with the North Jersey Philharmonic, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and the New Jersey Guitar & Music Society. The music program was founded by BCA's current music director, Michael Lemma. The school features two studio art labs, one of which is a visual arts lab with compositing and printing equipment that trains students in graphic communication and print media. The theatre department puts on plays and musicals each year. = Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology (Science  AAST) = AAST was founded on a charter school framework in 1992 with the mission of preparing students for careers in math and science by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment. AAST has departed from this model and has since adopted a more standard college-preparatory curriculum. The roots of the program can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, as well as its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies. = Academy for Business and Finance (Business  ABF) = ABF is the only academy in which most students participate in the full IB Diploma Programme. Students in ABF take courses in economics, marketing, management, business law, management information systems, and business ethics.

Originally grouped with APT and AVAGC as \\"career\\" academies, ACAHA was set apart from the college prep programs of AAST, ABF, AEDT and AMST. After being reorganized into the academic, college-prep academies, the name changed to the present name in 2002 to reflect the new curriculum. Head instructor Mary Beth Brace has been recognized as Advisor of the Year for SkillsUSA and has received attention for her devotion as a baking and culinary arts instructor. Chef John Branda, who worked in the food service industry for 30 years, was the saucier at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and co-owner of an upscale Fair Lawn, New Jersey restaurant. = Academy for Engineering and Design Technology (Engineering  AEDT) = This academy's core curriculum is similar to that of AAST, but provides more room for courses in electronics and design. The program encourages students to take part in competitions such as \\"BattleBots IQ.\\" Students in AEDT take courses such as Digital Electronics, Principles of Engineering, Introduction to Engineering Design, and Electrical Engineering. =Academy for Medical Science Technology (Medical  AMST)= Students in AMST have more required biology courses than other academies, which include Medical Science Seminar, Biotechnology Lab, Advanced Topics in Medicine, and Anatomy and Physiology. AMST is mainly for students who are more interested in pursuing a career in the medical field and have common interests in all sciences. Students in AMST will be given chances to use state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment to conduct experiments relating to medicine. AMST focuses more on biology and chemistry than other academies, and places students on the path towards pursuing a career in the medical field which requires all the basic knowledge and skills taught throughout the courses in this academy. =Academy for Technology and Computer Science (CompSci  ATCS)= ATCS has a focus on the world of computers and the Internet. Its students are well-prepared for careers such as computer programming, software engineering, and other computer- and engineering-related professions. The updated curriculum focuses on software development with Python and Java, and introduces students to computational theory. However, students also have the opportunity to take courses in C, Assembly, Web Development, and more. ATCS is the progenitor of hackBCA, the first ever high school hackathon, drawing major corporate sponsorship and hundreds of high school students to the school in a 24-hour hacking event. =Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (Visual/Theater/Music  AVPA)= AVPA is unique for being subdivided into three divisions: Visual, which focuses on combining skill and passion into one cohesive movement; Music, which requires students to take AP music theory and digital music classes, as well as master a focused voice/instrument; and Theatre, which stages all plays at the school and has resources similar to and sometimes better than Broadway plays. Depending on their focus, students in AVPA take classes in drawing, painting, and printing, acting and stagecraft, music theory, digital recording, musicianship and present a formal Senior Recital.AVPA Main, Bergen County Academies.

History The school is considered the brainchild of John Grieco and began as a single academy, \\"The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology\\" (AAST), which shared the current campus with the Bergen County Technical High School now located in Teterboro. The first group of AAST students was inducted in 1992 for the graduating class of 1996. In 1997, additional academies opened on the campus: the Academy for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology (AEDT), and the Academy for Medical Science Technology (AMST). The following year saw the opening of three career institutes, renamed a year later to become academies: the Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), the Academy for Power and Transportation (APT), and the Academy for Visual Arts and Graphic Communications (AVAGC). Soon, all seven programs began focusing on college preparation, adopting a liberal arts curriculum with a focus on their respective fields. In 2001, a dispute initiated by the Bergen County School Administrators' Association focused on what Paramus Superintendent Janice Dime called \\"elitism.\\" Several sending districts threatened to withdraw funding from the school. In response, the Bergen County Technical Schools agreed to increase the transparency of the admissions process and enter into talks with a number of sending districts. In 2002, APT was eliminated. ABCT was split into the Academy for Business and Finance (ABF) and the Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS). In 2012, ATCS turned its attention away from Telecommunications towards Computer Science, and was rechristened the Academy for Technology and Computer Science. ACA added hotel administration to its coursework and became the Academy for Culinary Arts and Hospitality Administration (ACAHA). AVAGC expanded its scope to include performing arts and became the Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA).Home Page, Bergen County Academies Parent Partnership Organization.

It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography.Snow Falling on Cedars: Awards & Nominations, msn.com, 1999 Plot Set on the fictional San Piedro Island in the northern Puget Sound region of the Washington state coast in 1950, the plot revolves around the murder case of Kabuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a Japanese American accused of killing Carl Heine, a White fisherman. The trial occurs in the midst of deep anti-Japanese sentiments following World War II. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), a World War II veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese in the Pacific War. Ishmael struggles with his childhood, and continuing, love for Kabuo's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), and his conscience, wondering if Kabuo is truly innocent. Spearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran (Richard Jenkins), and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks (James Rebhorn). Leading the defense is the old, experienced attorney Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow). An underlying theme throughout the trial is prejudice. Several witnesses, including Etta Heine (Celia Weston), Carl's mother, accuse Kabuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. This stance is not without irony, as Kabuo (a decorated war veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team), experienced prejudice because of his ancestry, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. By the same standard, Etta, a German American, could be blamed for Nazi war crimes. Also involved in the trial is Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sold his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is a contested issue during the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Carl Sr. Kabuo and Carl Jr. were close friends as children. Kabuo's father, Zenhichi, eventually approached Carl Sr. about purchasing of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the U.S. and Japan, and all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps. In 1944, Carl Sr. died and Etta sold the land to Ole. When Kabuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter toward Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Ole suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Jr., hours before Kabuo arrived, to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder. Ishmael's search of the maritime records reveals on the night that Carl Heine died a freighter had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42am, five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realizes that Carl was thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels at Hatsue's rejection, Ishmael comes forward with the new information. Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head on his boat's gunwale, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kabuo are dismissed. Hatsue thanks Ishmael by allowing him to hold her \\"one last time.\\" Production Scenes of Maine's Portland Head Light were filmed during the ice storm of 1998.

Although often considered a type of derivative work, film adaptation has been conceptualized recently by academic scholars such as Robert Stam as a dialogic process. A common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis of a feature film. Other works adapted into films include non-fiction (including journalism), autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays, historical sources and other films. From the earliest days of cinema, in nineteenth-century Europe, adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking. Elision and interpolation In 1924, Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norris's novel McTeague with his film Greed and the resulting film was 9¬Ω hours long. It was cut, at studio insistence, to four hours, then without Stroheim's input, cut again to around two hours. The end result was a film that was largely incoherent. Since that time, few directors have attempted to put everything in a novel into a film. Therefore, elision is all but essential. In some cases, film adaptations also interpolate scenes or invent characters. This is especially true when a novel is part of a literary saga. Incidents or quotations from later or earlier novels will be inserted into a single film. Additionally and far more controversially, filmmakers will invent new characters or create stories that were not present in the source material at all. Given the anticipated audience for a film, the screenwriter, director or movie studio may wish to increase character time or to invent new characters. For example, William J. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Ironweed included a short appearance by a prostitute named Helen. Because the film studio anticipated a female audience for the film and had Meryl Streep for the role, Helen became a significant part of the film. However, characters are also sometimes invented to provide the narrative voice. Interpretation as adaptation There have been several notable cases of massive inventive adaptation, including the Roland Joffe adaptation of The Scarlet Letter with explicit sex between Hester Prynn and the minister and Native American obscene puns into a major character and the film's villain. The Charlie Kaufman and \\"Donald Kaufman\\" penned Adaptation, credited as an adaptation of the novel The Orchid Thief, was an intentional satire and commentary on the process of film adaptation itself. All of those are cases of Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. The creators of the Gulliver's Travels miniseries interpolated a sanity trial to reflect the ongoing scholarly debate over whether or not Gulliver himself is sane at the conclusion of Book IV. In those cases, adaptation is a form of criticism and recreation as well as translation. Change is essential and practically unavoidable, mandated both by the constraints of time and medium, but how much is always a balance. Some film theorists have argued that a director should be entirely unconcerned with the source, as a novel is a novel and a film is a film, and the two works of art must be seen as separate entities. Since a transcription of a novel into film is impossible, even holding up a goal of \\"accuracy\\" is absurd. Others argue that what a film adaptation does is change to fit (literally, adapt), and the film must be accurate to the effect (aesthetics), the theme, or the message of a novel and that the filmmaker must introduce changes, if necessary, to fit the demands of time and to maximize faithfulness along one of those axes. In most cases adaptation, the films are required to create identities (for example, a characters' costume or set decor) since they are not specified in the original material. Then, the influence of film-makers may go unrecognized because there is no comparison in the original material even though the new visual identities will affect narrative interpretation. Peter Jackson's adaptations of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit by author JRR Tolkien represent an unusual case since many visual and stylistic details were specified by Tolkien. For the Harry Potter film series, author JK Rowling was closely consulted by the filmmakers, and she provided production designer Stuart Craig with a map of Hogwarts' grounds and also prevented director Alfonso Cuar√≥n from adding a graveyard scene because the graveyard would appear elsewhere in a later novel. An often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music. In a literary text, a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event, but in the process of adaptation, filmmakers must determine specific the sound characteristics that subliminally affects narrative interpretation. In some cases of adaptation, music may have been specified in the original material (usually diegetic music). In Stephenie Meyer's 2005 Twilight novel, the characters Edward Cullen and Bella Swan both listen to Debussy's Clair de lune and Edward composes the piece Bella's Lullaby for Bella. While Clair de lune was a pre- existing piece of music, Bella's Lullaby was not and required original music to be composed for the 2008 movie adaptation. In the 2016 sci-fi film 2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be adapted from the story by Kurt Vonnegut, the film-makers decided to abandon Vonnegut's choice of music. They stated that they felt that it worked in his prose only because it was not actually heard. Filmmakers' test screenings found that Vonnegut's style of music confused audiences and detracted from narrative comprehension. The film's composer, Leon Coward, stated, \\"You can try to be as true to Vonnegut's material as possible, but at the end of the day also you‚Äôre working with the material that you as a team have generated, not just Vonnegut's, and that‚Äôs what you've got to make work.\\" Theatrical adaptation Stage plays are frequent sources for film adaptations. Many of William Shakespeare's plays, including Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and Othello, have been adapted into films. The first sound adaptation of any Shakespeare play was the 1929 production of The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. It was later adapted as both a musical play called Kiss Me, Kate, which opened on Broadway in 1948, and as the 1953 Hollywood musical of the same name. The Taming of the Shrew was again retold in 1999 as a teen comedy set in a high school in 10 Things I Hate about You, and also in 2003 as an urban romantic comedy, Deliver Us from Eva. The 1961 musical film West Side Story was adapted from Romeo and Juliet, with its first incarnation as a Broadway musical play that opened in 1957. The animated film The Lion King (1994) was inspired by Hamlet as well as various traditional African myths, and 2001's O was based on Othello. Film adaptations of Shakespeare's works in languages other than English are numerous, including Akira Kurosawa's films Throne of Blood (1957, an epic film version of Macbeth), The Bad Sleep Well (1960, inspired by Hamlet) and Ran (1985, based on King Lear); and Vishal Bhardwaj's \\"Shakespearean trilogy\\" consisting of Haider (2014, a retelling of Hamlet), Omkara (2006, based on Othello) and Maqbool (2003, based on Macbeth). Another way in which Shakespearean texts have been incorporated in films is to feature characters who are either actors performing those texts or characters who are somehow influenced or effected by seeing one of Shakespeare's plays, within a larger non-Shakespearean story. Generally, Shakespeare's basic themes or certain elements of the plot will parallel the main plot of the film or become part of a character's development in some way. Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way.McKernan, Luke and Terris, Olwen (eds.) Walking Shadows: Shakespeare in the National Film and Television Archive (British Film Institute Publishing, 1994). The authors list 45 uses of Hamlet which do not include films of the play itself, on pp.45-66. They list 39 such instances for Romeo and Juliet on pp.141-156, and 23 uses of Othello, on pp.119-131. √âric Rohmer's 1992 film Conte d'hiver (A Tale of Winter) is one example. Rohmer uses one scene from Shakepeare's A Winter's Tale as a major plot device within a story that is not based on the play at all. In Britain, where stage plays tend to be more popular as a form of entertainment than currently in the United States, many films began as a stage productions. Some British films and British/American collaborations that were based on successful British plays include Gaslight (1940), Blithe Spirit (1945), Rope (1948), Look Back in Anger (1959), Oh, What a Lovely War! (1969), Sleuth (1972), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), Shirley Valentine (1989), The Madness of King George (1994), The History Boys (2006), Quartet (2012), and The Lady in the Van (2015). Similarly, hit Broadway plays are often adapted into films, whether from musicals or dramas. Some examples of American film adaptations based on successful Broadway plays are Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), Born Yesterday (1950), Harvey (1950), A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), The Odd Couple (1968), The Boys in the Band (1970), Agnes of God (1985), Children of a Lesser God (1986), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), Real Women Have Curves (2002), Rabbit Hole (2010), and Fences (2016). On one hand, theatrical adaptation does not involve as many interpolations or elisions as novel adaptation, but on the other, the demands of scenery and possibilities of motion frequently entail changes from one medium to the other. Film critics will often mention if an adapted play has a static camera or emulates a proscenium arch. Laurence Olivier consciously imitated the arch with his Henry V (1944), having the camera begin to move and to use color stock after the prologue, indicating the passage from physical to imaginative space. Sometimes, the adaptive process can continue after one translation. Mel Brooks' The Producers began as a film in 1967, was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2001, and then adapted again in 2005 as a musical film. Television adaptation Feature films are occasionally created from television series or television segments. In some cases, the film will offer a longer storyline than the usual television program's format and/or expanded production values. During the 1970s, many UK television series were turned into films including Dad's Army, On the Buses, Steptoe and Son and Porridge. In 1979, The Muppet Movie was a big success. In the adaptation of The X-Files to film, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Additionally, adaptations of television shows will offer the viewer the opportunity to see the television show's characters without broadcast restrictions. These additions (nudity, profanity, explicit drug use, and explicit violence) are only rarely a featured adaptive addition (film versions of \\"procedurals\\" such as Miami Vice are most inclined to such additions as featured adaptations) ‚Äì South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a notable example of a film being more explicit than its parent TV series. At the same time, some theatrically released films are adaptations of television miniseries events. When national film boards and state-controlled television networks co-exist, filmmakers can sometimes create very long films for television that they may adapt solely for time for theatrical release. Both Ingmar Bergman (notably with Fanny and Alexander but with other films as well) and Lars von Trier have created long television films that they then recut for international distribution. Even segments of television series have been adapted into feature films. The American television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live has been the origin of a number of films, beginning with The Blues Brothers, which began as a one-off performance by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Radio adaptation Radio narratives have also provided the basis of film adaptation. In the heyday of radio, radio segments, like television segments today, translated to film on several occasions, usually as shorts. Radio series turned into film series include Dr. Christian, Crime Doctor and The Whistler. Dialog-heavy stories and fantastic stories from radio were also adapted to film (e.g. Fibber McGee and Molly and The Life of Riley). The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy began as a radio series for the BBC and then became a novel that was adapted to film. Comic book adaptation Comic book characters, particularly superheroes, have long been adapted into film, beginning in the 1940s with Saturday movie serials aimed at children. Superman (1978) and Batman (1989) are two later successful movie adaptations of famous comic book characters. In the early 2000s, blockbusters such as X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002) have led to dozens of superhero films. The success of these films has also led to other comic books not necessarily about superheroes being adapted for the big screen, such as Ghost World (2001), From Hell (2001), American Splendor (2003), Sin City (2005), 300 (2007), Wanted (2008), and Whiteout (2009). The adaptation process for comics is different from that of novels. Many successful comic book series last for several decades and have featured several variations of the characters in that time. Films based on such series usually try to capture the back story and ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of the character instead of adapting a particular storyline. Occasionally, aspects of the characters and their origins are simplified or modernized. Self-contained graphic novels, and miniseries many of which do not feature superheroes, can be adapted more directly, such as in the case of Road to Perdition (2002) or V for Vendetta (2006). In particular, Robert Rodriguez did not use a screenplay for Sin City but utilized actual panels from writer/artist Frank Miller's series as storyboards to create what Rodriguez regards as a \\"translation\\" rather than an adaptation. Furthermore, some films based on long-running franchises use particular story lines from the franchise as a basis for a plot. The second X-Men film was loosely based on the graphic novel X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills and the third film on the storyline \\"The Dark Phoenix Saga\\". Spider-Man 2 was based on the storyline \\"Spider-Man No More!\\" Likewise, Batman Begins owes many of its elements to Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\" and the film's sequel, The Dark Knight, uses subplots from Batman: The Long Halloween. The Marvel Cinematic Universe starting in 2008 is a shared universe with films combining characters from different works by Marvel Comics. The DC Extended Universe starting in 2013 uses the same model for DC Comics. The highest-grossing film is 2019's Avengers: Endgame and the most profitable comic book film adaptation is Joker from that same year. Video game adaptation Video games have also been adapted into films, beginning in the early 1980s. Films closely related to the computer and video game industries were also done in this time, such as Tron and Cloak & Dagger, but only after the release of several films based on well-known brands has this genre become recognized in its own right. Video game films can take several forms, such as live-action works like Super Mario Bros., traditionally animated such as films based on the Pok√©mon, or computer-animated such as Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. There also exist Original Video Animations (OVAs) based on popular games such as Dead Space: Downfall, Halo Legends, Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic which may be released direct-to-video. Similar to comic book-based films in the past (especially from 1980s), films based on video games tend to carry a reputation of lackluster quality and receive negative reaction from both film critics and fans of the source material. This is generally due to difficulties in adopting a story meant to be played interactively into a linear movie-going experience. Some, such as Super Mario Bros., were particularly negatively received and are considered among the worst films ever made. Super Mario Bros. was criticized for being too dark, violent and unfaithful (in plot) to the popular video game series. Another likely reason for the failure of video game adaptations is that structural conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers. Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Nintendo franchises including Mario and Zelda, said in a 2007 interview: In an interview with Fortune in August 2015, Miyamoto said, \\"Because games and movies seem like similar mediums, people‚Äôs natural expectation is we want to take our games and turn them into movies. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always felt video games, being an interactive medium, and movies, being a passive medium, mean the two are quite different.\\" Until 2019, no video game film - live-action or animated - had received a Rotten Tomatoes \\"fresh\\" rating, with a score over 60%. Three films since, Detective Pikachu, The Angry Birds Movie 2, and Sonic the Hedgehog have been able to break into the \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Both Detective Pikachu and Sonic the Hedgehog have posted better-than-expected domestic takes, with Sonic, as of May 2020 holding the highest domestic opening box-office for a video game film. Its success led to a planned sequel announced in May 2020. Though video game films are critically panned, they tend to do well from the international take at box offices. Warcraft, based on the World of Warcraft game, holds the highest take of any video game adaptation with , while the six Resident Evil films hold the highest take for a series of on an average production budget between . Other financially successful video game films include: Mortal Kombat, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Silent Hill, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Among the most well-known video game filmmakers is Uwe Boll, a German writer, director, and producer whose works include House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, Postal, and Far Cry, all of which were almost universally panned by critics. In 2016, he retired from filmmaking, citing market failures and funding difficulties. Similarly, Paul W.S. Anderson has gained a reputation for his panned video game adaptations, particularly the first Mortal Kombat film and the Resident Evil series. Adaptations from other sources While documentary films have often been made from journalism and reportage, so too have some dramatic films, including: All the President's Men (1976, adapted from the 1974 book); Miracle, (2004, from an account published shortly after the 1980 \\"miracle on ice\\"); and Pushing Tin (1999, from a 1996 New York Times article by Darcy Frey). An Inconvenient Truth is Al Gore's film adaptation of his own Keynote multimedia presentation. The 2011 independent comedy film, Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins was based on Kermode and Mayo's Film Review of Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. Films adapted from songs include Coward of the County, Ode to Billy Joe, Convoy, and Pretty Baby (each from a song of the same name). Films based on toys include the Transformers franchise and the G.I. Joe films; there is a longer history of animated television series being created simultaneous to toy lines as a marketing tool. Hasbro's plans to for films based on their board games began with 2012's Battleship. While amusement park rides have often been based on action movies, conversely the 1967 Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was adapted into Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003. Remakes and film sequels are technically adaptations of the original film. Less direct derivations include The Magnificent Seven from The Seven Samurai, Star Wars from The Hidden Fortress, and Twelve Monkeys from La Jet√©e. Many films have been made from mythology and religious texts. Both Greek mythology and the Bible have been adapted frequently. Homer's works have been adapted multiple times in several nations. In these cases, the audience already knows the story well, and so the adaptation will de-emphasize elements of suspense and concentrate instead on detail and phrasing. Awards Many major film award programs present an award for adapted screenplays, separate from the award for original screenplays. In the case of a film which was adapted from an unpublished work, however, different awards have different rules around which category the screenplay qualifies for. In 1983, the Canadian Genie Awards rescinded the Best Adapted Screenplay award they had presented to the film Melanie when they learned that the original work had been unpublished;\\"Melanie adaptation Genie returned\\". Cinema Canada, No. 96 (May 1983). p. 12. and in 2017, the film Moonlight, which was adapted from an unpublished theatrical play, was classified and nominated as an adapted screenplay by some awards but as an original screenplay by others.\\"Oscars: Moonlight ineligible for Best Original Screenplay\\". Entertainment Weekly, December 15, 2016. Adaptation of films When a film's screenplay is original, it can also be the source of derivative works such as novels and plays. For example, movie studios will commission novelizations of their popular titles or sell the rights to their titles to publishing houses. These novelized films will frequently be written on assignment and sometimes written by authors who have only an early script as their source. Consequently, novelizations are quite often changed from the films as they appear in theatres. Novelization can build up characters and incidents for commercial reasons (e.g. to market a card or computer game, to promote the publisher's \\"saga\\" of novels, or to create continuity between films in a series) There have been instances of novelists who have worked from their own screenplays to create novels at nearly the same time as a film. Both Arthur C. Clarke, with 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Graham Greene, with The Third Man, have worked from their own film ideas to a novel form (although the novel version of The Third Man was written more to aid in the development of the screenplay than for the purposes of being released as a novel). Both John Sayles and Ingmar Bergman write their film ideas as novels before they begin producing them as films, although neither director has allowed these prose treatments to be published. Finally, films have inspired and been adapted into plays. John Waters's films have been successfully mounted as plays; both Hairspray and Cry-Baby have been adapted, and other films have spurred subsequent theatrical adaptations. Spamalot is a Broadway play based on Monty Python films. In a rare case of a film being adapted from a stage musical adaptation of a film, in 2005, the film adaptation of the stage musical based on Mel Brooks' classic comedy film The Producers was released.

Later editions were published under the title October Sky as a tie-in to the 1999 film adaptation. It is a story of growing up in a mining town, and a boy's pursuit of amateur rocketry in a coal mining town. The book won the W.D. Weatherford Award in 1998, the year of its release. Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. October Sky was followed by The Coalwood Way (2000), Sky of Stone (2002), and Carrying Albert Home (2015). Rocket Boys was made into a film in 1999, titled October Sky (an anagram of \\"Rocket Boys\\"). The book was then re-published as October Sky shortly afterwards.  Plot summary  Homer \\"Sonny\\" Hickam Jr. lives in a small coal mining town in West Virginia named Coalwood. Sonny, after seeing the Russian satellite Sputnik, decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book Rocket Boys, the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie October Sky, he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him \\"out of Coalwood\\". Sonny's mother is afraid that he will have to work in the mines after high school. Sonny's first attempt at rocketry (which occurred when he was 14) consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane body as a casing. It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cooke, Sherman Siers, Jimmy \\"O'Dell\\" Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA (Big Creek Missile Agency). Their first real rocket, powered by black powder, is named Auk 1. This an allusion to the great auk, which is a flightless seabird that became extinct in the mid-19th century. Auk 1 flies six feet before the solder melts, and the nozzle, a washer, separates from the casement. They call themselves \\"Rocket Boys\\" and call the place where they are launching their rockets \\"Cape Coalwood\\", in honor of Cape Canaveral. The Rocket Boys enjoy mixed success during their three-year rocket launching campaign (1957 to 1960). They employ several fuel mixtures including rocket candy and a mixture called \\"zincoshine\\", which is composed of zinc dust and sulfur, along with alcohol from moonshine, supplied by a local bootlegger, as a binder for the mixture. They launch a total of 35 rockets, all sequentially numbered Auk I‚ÄìXXXI. (There are five different Auk XXIIs.) They also win a National Science Fair gold medal for their rockets, for their project titled \\"A Study of Amateur Rocketry Techniques.\\"  Characters  Homer \\"Sonny\\" Hickam Jr. is the author and narrator of the memoir. He is 8 years old at the beginning of the story but is in high school for most of the book, and he serves as the leader of the Rocket Boys. He is nearsighted and wears glasses, and he plays in the school band. * Elsie Hickam is Homer Hickam's wife and the mother of Jim and \\"Sonny\\" Hickam. She has a tense relationship with her husband through most of the story. She is supportive of Sonny's rocket building, and often finds herself at odds with her husband, Homer Sr., about the rocket building. She often tells Sonny, \\"Don't blow yourself up.\\" She works on a mural of Myrtle Beach throughout the memoir. * Homer Hickam Sr. is Elsie Hickam's husband and the father of Jim and \\"Sonny\\" Hickam. He is the hard-headed mine foreman in Coalwood. He takes his job very seriously, going out of his way to help miners in distress. He is almost always at odds with the union leader, John Dubonnet, who dated Elsie when they were all in high school together. Homer Sr. seems to not care about Sonny's affairs as much as he does Jim's; Sonny points this out in the book much to Homer Sr.'s chagrin. He has a spot on his lung that is the common miner's disease, black lung (Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis), but refuses to quit work, although most men who are discovered to have this illness are forced into retirement, but allowed to stay in Coalwood. * Jim Hickam is Homer Hickam Jr.'s older brother and the son of Elsie and Homer Hickam. He is a star athlete, which leads to him having several conflicts with \\"Sonny\\" over how Homer seems to favor Jim over \\"Sonny\\". He dates the girl Sonny is in love with, Dorothy Plunk, but later dumps her like he does with many of his girlfriends. * Quentin Wilson is one of the more intelligent members of the Rocket Boys, the one who does the most math. Quentin carries a suitcase stuffed with books wherever he goes and finds excuses to get out of gym class. He is excitable and often confounds the other members and townspeople with his advanced vocabulary. * Jimmy \\"O'Dell\\" Carroll is small and excitable, the most emotional member of the group. His father drives the town garbage truck, allowing O'Dell access to many useful items, frequently scrounged to further the group's efforts. He is always scheming of ways of making money, from the failed iron scrap attempt‚Äîwhich took an entire summer, yielded a net loss of one dollar, not counting the destruction of borrowed equipment and almost killing Sonny‚Äîto the profitable harvesting of ginseng. * Sherman Siers has a weakened left leg as a result of polio, but does not let it slow him down. He is also the most observant and practical member of the team. At the age of 34, Sherman died unexpectedly of a heart attack. * Roy Lee Cooke is Sonny's best friend. He teaches Sonny something about girls. In the follow-up memoir titled The Coalwood Way, it is revealed that he is known as The Big Creek Lovemaster. Roy Lee also knows the moonshiner in town, John Eye, who provides the boys with the alcohol needed for their special propellant they call Zincoshine. On page 302, Roy Lee states that if they were successful in flying the rocket, \\"She wouldn't be able to get out of her panties fast enough,\\" (referring to a cheerleader). * Willie \\"Billy\\" Rose is a member of the Rocket Boys who joins the group about a year after it is founded. He has excellent eyesight and can find rockets very well. He is the best runner in the group. * Miss Riley is a chemistry and physics teacher at Big Creek High School who inspires the Rocket Boys to compete in the National Science Fair. She gives Sonny a book called Principles of Guided Missile Design that is extremely useful to the Rocket Boys in the future. She also orchestrates the Rocket Boys' entry into the National Science Fair. She is diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma shortly before Sonny leaves for the science fair. At first her affliction goes into remission, but later she dies of her disease. * Jake Mosby is a womanizing alcoholic who helps the BCMA in paying off debts. Jake is a mining engineer. He also introduces them to a writer of a small newspaper, Basil Oglethorpe. He later settles down a bit and starts dating Miss Riley for a period of time, trying to be dependable for her. He is a veteran of the Korean War, and compares the BCMA's rocket launches to his war experiences. * Basil Oglethorpe is the writer of a small newspaper called the McDowell County Banner. He makes sure to attend the boys' rocket launches and uses them to boost popularity for his newspaper. * Mr. Ferro is in charge of a group of company machinists who help the BCMA build their rockets. * Mr. Caton is a machinist in Mr. Ferro's team. He is the main builder of the BCMA's rockets. * Dorothy Plunk is Sonny's dream girl; he even describes her as \\"God's Perfection\\" at one point in the memoir. While Sonny spends most of his time infatuated with her, although she still spends time with him, Dorothy only wants a friend relationship and goes out with other boys. For a large section of the book, Sonny ignores her, because she started a relationship with his brother Jim. She was also the valedictorian of Sonny's graduating high school class and got the spot Sonny wanted in a calculus class because her grades were higher. * Valentine Carmina is an older girl who likes Sonny. Ultimately, it is implied she has sex with him in the backseat of a car on the same night Dorothy breaks his heart. Homer later describes the event as her pity to him. * Mr. Isaac Bykovski is a worker in the mine who helps Sonny with his first rockets. Homer Sr. makes him work in the mine as punishment for helping Sonny. Later, Homer Sr. offers him his job back in the machine shop, but Bykovski does not accept the offer because he made more money in the mine. He is later killed in a mine collapse while operating a loader. * Geneva Eggers is a middle-aged woman who was rescued as a baby by Homer Hickam Sr. when her house was on fire. The rest of her family was still in the house when it went up in flames but she was the only one whom Homer Sr. saw. Everyone else in her family perished. It is implied that after the fire, she turned to prostitution in order to support herself. During the novel, she invites Sonny into her home when he almost freezes to death on a December night and gives him a new set of clothes. Sonny feels uncomfortable changing in front of her and, sensing the hesitation, she replies, \\"Oh, come on. You ain't gonna show me nothin' I ain't already seen too many times.\\" * Buchanan \\"Buck\\" Trant is a football player who hates Sonny. He insults Sonny and even starts to tear down \\"Cape Coalwood.\\" See also Homer Hickam * October Sky References 1998 non-fiction books Model rocketry American memoirs Books adapted into films West Virginia culture Books by Homer Hickam ","title":"October Sky (book)"},{"id":"1851757","text":"The position of Minister of State for Communities and Local Government was a cabinet-level position in the United Kingdom Government.

A prolific filmmaker with strong instincts for crowd-pleasing and publicity, Wong Jing has played a prominent role in the Hong Kong cinema of the last quarter-century. Biography Wong was born in Hong Kong, the son of noted film director Wong Tin-Lam. He graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong with a degree in Chinese literature which he describes as \\"useless\\" (Yang, 2003). Like many Hong Kong film figures of his time, Wong began his career in television ‚Äì in his case, scriptwriting for local juggernaut TVB beginning in 1975 (Teo, 1997). He moved on to writing for the Shaw Brothers studio. There, he made his directing debut with Challenge of the Gamesters in 1981. This start foreshadowed his later successes with movies about gambling, such as God of Gamblers, starring Chow Yun-fat and Andy Lau, which broke Hong Kong's all-time box office record upon its release in 1989, and started a fad for the genre. Wong has directed, produced or written over 175 films (Yang, 2003), occasionally acting in them as well. He works with an efficient mass production method making heavy use of directing assistants and allowing him to work on several movies at once. He works under the umbrellas of two production companies he launched, Wong Jing's Workshop Ltd. and BoB and Partners Co. Ltd. (Best of the Best), the latter in partnership with director Andrew Lau and writer-producer Manfred Wong (Bordwell, 2000). He once commented that his movies were hits because he gave the people what they wanted, and not what he thought they should want. A typical Wong production might be a broad comedy (Boys Are Easy, 1993) or an entry in a currently popular genre, such as martial arts (Holy Weapon, 1993), erotic thriller (Naked Killer, 1992) or gangster film (Young and Dangerous, 1996). It will imbue its model with lightning pacing and frequent shifts in tone to accommodate slapstick and toilet humor, sentimental heart-tugging, cartoonish violence, sexual titillation, and parodic references to well-known Hong Kong and Hollywood films. Wong also directed or produced several of the films of comic actor Stephen Chow, who has been Hong Kong's most popular performer since the early 1990s. Examples of their collaborations include God of Gamblers II (1991), Tricky Brains (1991), Royal Tramp I and II (1992) and Sixty Million Dollar Man (1995). Wong's commercial skills are not limited to the content of his movies or his casting. He was using Hollywood-style cross- media promotional tactics - such as tie-in novels, comic books and other products, and magazine interviews - long before they became common in Hong Kong (Bordwell, 2000). Wong's style, often seen as loud, crass and philistine, may be another factor in his low stock among critics. According to director Ann Hui, he remarked of Hui's acclaimed 1990 drama, Song of the Exile, \\"Who wants to watch the autobiography of a fat woman?\\" In 1994, unidentified assailants attacked him outside his offices and knocked out his teeth; this was widely believed to have been retaliation for injudicious remarks, ordered by Triads, or Chinese organized crime figures, whose involvement in the industry is notorious. (Dannen and Long, 1997), although Wong himself is rumored to be related with the Triads.ÁéãÊô∂ÊõæÊî∂Â∞èÂºü ‚ÄúÈªëÁ§æ‰ºöÂ§¥È¢Ü‚ÄùÈïøÊ≤ôÁé∞Ë∫´ Since the late 1990s, Wong's films have fared much worse in the box office due to the sluggish recession which has been enveloping Hong Kong cinema in the new millennium. However a number of his films released in the 2010s, such as From Vegas to Macau, have seen renewed success for the director, particularly in mainland China. Filmography References Bordwell, David.

This geographical area serves as a collection point for meteorites that have originally fallen on the extensive high- altitude ice fields throughout Antarctica. Such meteorites are quickly covered by subsequent snowfall and begin a centuries-long journey traveling \\"downhill\\" across the Antarctic continent while embedded in a vast sheet of flowing ice. Portions of such flowing ice can be halted by natural barriers such as the Transantarctic Mountains. Subsequent wind erosion of the motionless ice brings trapped meteorites back to the surface once more where they may be collected. This process concentrates meteorites in a few specific areas to much higher concentrations than they are normally found everywhere else. The contrast of the dark meteorites against the white snow, and lack of terrestrial rocks on the ice, makes such meteorites relatively easy to find. However, the vast majority of such ice-embedded meteorites eventually slide undiscovered into the ocean. History The first Antarctic meteorite was discovered during the 1911-14 Douglas Mawson Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Subsequent discoveries of three more were made in 1961 and 1964 by Russian geologists near Novolazarevskaya Station, and USGS geologists in the Thiel and Neptune Mountains. In 1969, Japanese explorers discovered nine meteorites at the Yamato Mountains, and 12 more during the 1973-74 season, 663 during the 1974-75 season, and 307 during the 1975-76 season. Based on that success, William A. Cassidy received funding for ANSMET to commence in the 1976-77 season. Cassidy was the Principal Investigator for the 1976-77 season, and subsequent seasons up to and including the 1993-94 season.  Importance  The ANSMET program, together with parallel Antarctic collection programs run by Japan, China, and other nations, is a major source of the extraterrestrial material that is available for scientific investigation. All of the material collected by ANSMET is curated for the purpose of research and public education, in contrast to meteorites collected privately, the bulk of which are frequently sold to collectors. As of 2003, ANSMET had collected 8409 chondrites and 234 achondrites, in addition to a Lunar meteorite ALH 81005, and the Martian meteorites EETA 79001, ALH77005 and ALH84001.  Method  The search for the meteorites is done visually. A team of four to ten explorers, typically meteorite scientists, lives for 5‚Äì7 weeks on the ice field. Using snowmobiles spaced 30 m apart they scan the blue ice for meteorites. Once a specimen has been located its position is found using GPS and it is given an identification number. It is then placed in a sterile Teflon bag. The teams make sure that the specimen remains frozen throughout its journey back to the Antarctic Meteorite Curation Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Since 1976, ANSMET has returned over 20,000 meteorites. Meteorites of greater interest and undergoing detailed study are kept at JSC for distribution to the scientific community, though, ultimately, all samples collected by ANSMET are transferred to the Smithsonian Institution for permanent storage and curation. These meteorites are housed at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center clean room facility at Suitland, Maryland, which is modeled after the Lunar Processing Laboratory at NASA‚Äôs Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Of the almost 16,000 Antarctic meteorites collected since 1976, over 14,000 have been permanently transferred to the Smithsonian. Curators at the Department of Mineral Sciences at the National Museum of Natural History classify each representative chip of meteorite sent by NASA. Results and descriptions are published in the Antarctic Meteorite Newsletter, issued twice a year. The naming convention for Antarctic meteorites collected by ANSMET is as follows: a three letter prefix based on the location the meteorite is found, followed by two numbers that designate the year of collection, and a three number unique identifier. For example, ALH84001 was collected in the Allen Hills region in 1984. The 2004‚Äì2005 ANSMET expedition consisted of 12 members and collectively they returned 1,230 meteorites. These included over of pallasite meteorites, one of which is the largest yet found in Antarctica at over . The 2006‚Äì2007 ANSMET expedition consisted of a 9-member systematic team (including astronaut Don Pettit) that explored the Grosvenor Mountains and a 4-member reconnaissance team that explored Scott Glacier and Reedy Glacier as possible destinations for future expeditions. The 2009‚Äì2010 ANSMET expedition consisted of 8 members that returned 1010 meteorites. The 2010‚Äì2011 ANSMET expedition consisted of a 9-member systematic team and a 4-member reconnaissance team (including astronaut Serena Aunon-Chancellor) that explored new areas where future teams may go. Collectively they returned over 1200 meteorites. The 2011‚Äì2012 ANSMET expedition returned to the Miller Range. Despite being hampered by heavy snow, the team collected 302 meteorites, which was just enough to bring the total number of meteorites collected by ANSMET over the 20,000 milestone.

Background  The purpose of the NRF is to provide a quick reaction force of high quality to support NATO missions as required. The concept of NRF was first endorsed with a declaration of NATO's Heads of State at the Prague Summit on 22 November 2002. It was then approved by NATO Defence Ministers in June 2003, and the first headquarters created in October 2003 in Italy under command of NATO Joint Force Command in Brunssum, Netherlands, designated NRF 1. Its rotation replacement was designated NRF 2 (2004) at the same time. Rotating forces through the NRF requires nations to meet the demanding standards needed for collective defence and expeditionary operations. As the standards are very high, participation in the NRF is preceded by a six-month NATO exercise program in order to integrate and standardize the various national contingents. Generally, nations carry out a pre-training period in preparation for the NATO exercises of between 6‚Äì18 months. Once activated Reconnaissance Teams deploy within 5 days. This is the first of a number of deployment phases that lead to the deployment of the entire HQ Joint Task Force and Immediate Reaction Forces within 30 days. Tasks The NRF is certified by NATO to perform a wide variety of tasks including: providing an immediate response capability for conducting collective defence of Alliance members in the event of an Article V operation; * crisis management operations; * acting as the initial force deployment as a precursor to deployment of a much larger force; * peace support operations; * disaster relief; * protection of critical infrastructure. Structure The NRF has three elements: * Command and Control element; * Immediate Response Force; * Response forces Pool. Command & Control element: This is based on a deployable Joint Force Headquarters. Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) has overall strategic command of the NRF. NATO's two Joint Force Commands, based in Brunssum, Netherlands and Naples, Italy take one-year turns to command the NRF. Immediate Response Force (IRF): The IRF element is designed to provide the initial response to a crisis and is not scaled to be a stand- alone force for all but the smallest operations. If further land, maritime or air capabilities are required, they will be drawn from the Response Forces Pool. Response Forces Pool (RFP): The RFP consists of a broad spectrum of military capabilities encompassing command and control, combat and support units. There is no fixed size to the RFP. The forces contributed to the RFP are drawn from the much wider pool of Allied or Partners National deployable forces. Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) During the 2014 Wales summit NATO leaders agreed to establish a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF). The VJTF will be a high-readiness \\"Spearhead Force\\" able to deploy at short notice to threats against NATO sovereignty. It will consist of a land brigade numbering around 5,000 troops, supported by air, sea and special forces. The VJTF would be supported by two more land brigades as a \\"rapid reinforcement capability\\" in case of a major crisis. Altogether, the enhanced NATO Response Force will amount to around 30,000 troops. Deployments As of January 2015, units assigned to the NRF have been used on four occasions: * Olympic Games in Athens in 2004; * Afghan presidential elections in 2004; * Humanitarian assistance following Hurricane Katrina in 2005; * Humanitarian relief following the earthquake in Pakistan in 2006. Non-NATO participants Of NATO's non-member partners, Finland and Sweden joined the Response Force in 2008 and 2013, respectively. Ukraine and Georgia began contributions, respectively, in 2014 and 2015.

The largest settlement of the Western Province, Tabubil is located near its banks. Description Known as the Ok Tedi River by the Yonggom people who live on its western bank, it was renamed the Alice River by the Italian explorer Luigi d'Albertis.Peter D.

It is a tributary of the Fly River. Tributaries of the Ok Tedi include the Birim. The Kiunga-Tabubil Highway runs parallel with the river for the majority of its course, until just south of Ningerum where the highway veers southeast towards Kiunga, a port town on the Fly River. The river is extremely fast-moving and has a massive capacity. It is situated on a sand bank, which allows for the river to change course quickly without warning. The sand conditions underneath the river and the extremely high rainfall of the catchment area make it one of the fastest moving rivers in the world. The roar from the river can be heard for many kilometres through the dense jungle of the district. The pristine river was devastated by the Ok Tedi environmental disaster, an enormous open pit copper/gold mine which discharges waste directly into the river. Until its recent seizure by the Papua New Guinea government the mine was owned by BHP Billiton, an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia.

Showmen's Rest in Forest Park, Illinois, is a 750 plot section of Woodlawn Cemetery mostly for circus performers owned by the Showmen's League of America The first performers and show workers that were buried there are in a mass grave from when between 56 and 61 employees of the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus were interred. They were killed in the Hammond circus train wreck on June 22, 1918, at Hessville, Indiana, (about 5 miles east of Hammond, Indiana), when an empty Michigan Central Railroad troop train from Detroit, Michigan, to Chicago, Illinois, plowed into their circus train. The engineer of the troop train, Alonzo Sargent, had fallen asleep. Among the dead were Arthur Dierckx and Max Nietzborn of the \\"Great Dierckx Brothers\\" strong man act and Jennie Ward Todd of \\"The Flying Wards\\". The Showmen's League of America, formed in 1913 with Buffalo Bill Cody as its first president, had recently selected and purchased the burial land in Woodlawn Cemetery at the intersection of Cermak Road and Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park, Illinois, for its members. Services were held five days after the train wreck. The identity of many victims of the wreck was unknown. Most of the markers note \\"unidentified male\\" (or female). One is marked \\"Smiley,\\" another \\"Baldy,\\" and \\"4 Horse Driver.\\" The Showmen's Rest section of Woodlawn Cemetery is still used for burials of deceased showmen who are said to be performing now at the biggest of the Big Tops. A Memorial Day service is held at Woodlawn Cemetery every year. Other Showmen's Rests include one at Mount Olivet Cemetery, Hugo, Oklahoma. Hugo is a winter circus home which calls itself Circus City, USA. In Miami, Florida, the largest Showmen's Rest is at Southern Memorial Park where large elephant and lion statues flank hundreds of markers commemorating circus greats and not-so- greats. Tampa, Florida's Showmen's Rest is located close to the Greater Tampa Showmen's Association near downtown.  Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck Following the wreck of June 22, 1918, the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus had to cancel only two performances: the one in Hammond, Indiana and its next stop Monroe, Wisconsin. This was due in part by the assistance by many of its so- called competitors, including Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus lending needed equipment and performers so that the show could go on. The city of Hammond also joined in to help the surviving circus performers and workers. Many of the city's residents and shopkeepers gave food and clothing as well. Statues of five elephants surround the Showmen's Rest section of Woodlawn Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois. The elephants each have a foot raised with a ball underneath, and the trunks lowered. (Raised trunks are a symbol of joy and excitement; lowered trunks symbolize mourning). The base of the large central elephant is inscribed with \\"Showmen's League of America\\". On the others are the words \\"Showmen's Rest\\". Some nearby residents say the sounds of ghostly elephants can be heard at night. However, as a note, there were no elephants that were buried there. And for those looking for an explanation for the sounds, Brookfield Zoo is only a few miles away (although no elephants are in captivity at the Zoo as of June 2015).

It was the eastern branch of the MCI Internet Exchange. Its name officially stood for \\"Metropolitan Area Exchange, East\\".\\"Who's MAE, and why is she so slow?\\" , Rob Robertson, 11 April 1997, accessed 3 July 2012 MAE-East was founded in the 1990s as one of the first large Internet peering exchanges and by 1997 it was estimated half the world's traffic passed through it. At the time it was located in the underground parking garage of an office building in Vienna, VA. History MAE-East was originally created in 1992, primarily by Scott Yeager of Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS) and Rick Adams of UUNET. Steven Feldman, an Internet architect, recalls \\"A group of network providers in the Virginia area got together over beer one night and decided to connect their networks.\\" The founding networks were AlterNet (UUNET's backbone service), PSINet and Sprint- ICM. See pages 70-76. MFS was the service provider offering metropolitan fiber, co-location facilities, cross connects and switch ports for the ISPs to interconnect. MAE-East was modeled after FIX East and Fix West. It was established as a Distributed Layer 2 exchange (shared 10-Mbps Ethernet over DS3). By February 1993, the 10-Mbps metropolitan Ethernet-over-DS3 connected the Sprint POP (ICMnet and AlterNet), College Park POP (AlterNet and NSFNet), MCI POP (SURAnet), and WillTel POP (PSINet). It did not have a multi-lateral policy or have multi-lateral agreements, meaning it was a neutral exchange from the perspective that any ISP could join, all members were treated the same, but there was no requirement for any other members to peer with that ISP. In 1993, the National Science Foundation awarded MFS/MAE-East a grant establishing it as one of the four original NAPs (Network Access Point). MAE- East then migrated to a collocation-based exchange in order to support higher speeds with the original colo at 1919 Gallows Road in Vienna, in a cinder- block room carved out of the underground P1 parking garage. The MAE upgraded to switched Ethernet and shared FDDI in Fall 1994, growing to seven GigaSwitches] (a precursor to Gigabit Ethernet). The FDDI architecture consisted of collocations at 8100 Boone Blvd (location of MFS offices across the road from Gallows Road), 1919 Gallows Road, and a number of private customer POPs. The GigaSwitch access was limited to 100 Mbps, suffered from Head-of-Line Blocking, reached scaling limits, and was difficult to maintain (i.e., suffered outages). MAE-East FDDI was closed to new customers after 1998 and was shut down in June 2001. MAE-East ATM was created as successor to the FDDI due to the FDDI limitations. MAE-East ATM was trialed in 1997 and went into production in 1998. ATM allowed for high-speed access (e.g. DS3 -OC-12c); managed resources to eliminate congestion; Virtual Private Interconnect (PVCs), which mitigated effects of some behaviors where a single customer could impact the entire exchange. Frame Relay Access was added in 2002-2003 (OC-3c to OC-48c). In 2003, MAE-East ATM/Frame facilities were located at Boone Blvd, Sunrise Blvd, Tyco Road and Ashburn VA. BY 2009, many of the ISPs at MAE-East had moved to Equinix Ashburn, a competing Internet Exchange (IX). Today, several on-line resources (peeringdb.org, internetexchangemap.com) suggest MAE-East is gone. In any event, large providers tend to connect directly to allow higher speeds and reduce costs.

It is affiliated with both the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. The union's headquarters are located in St. Paul, Minnesota, and it represented more than 90,000 members in 2017. An annual Representative Convention of approximately 900 elected delegates meets each year, and is the organization's highest governing body. Between Representative Conventions, a 44-member governing board meets monthly. The governing board sets dues, establishes a budget and carries out the policy directives of the Representative Convention. Three full-time officers ‚Äî a president, vice president and secretary-treasurer ‚Äî guide the union between meetings of the governing board. Education Minnesota employed about 170 staff in 2017. Merger The union was created in March 1997 by the merger of the Minnesota Education Association (MEA) and the Minnesota Federation of Teachers (MFT). The merger was approved by both parent unions, and took effect on Sept. 1, 1998. At the time, the AFT and NEA were discussing a national merger. The two unions had increasingly collaborated for several years, and the merger of the two unions was considered a precursor to national merger. Subsequently, neither parent union laid down many ground rules for the merger. The planned merger between the AFT and NEA fell through after the merger agreement, which had been approved by the AFT, failed to win the necessary two-thirds majority at the NEA convention. Education Minnesota ‚Äî which was affiliated with both the AFT and NEA ‚Äî remained unaffected by the failed national merger. Judy Schaubach, president of MEA, and Sandra Peterson, president of MFT, were elected as co-presidents.The Education Minnesota constitution provided that upon the retirement of either co-president, the office of the president would be held by a single office-holder. Peterson retired in 2002, and Schaubach was elected the organization's sole president the same year. But the lack of pre-merger ground rules came back to haunt the merged union. Disagreement between the two parent unions broke out over payment of per capita dues. Each parent union insisted that it receive its full dues, which would have doubled the dues of Education Minnesota members. The issue remained unresolved for two years, until an agreement was reached that established a new dues level. Back dues to NEA were paid down, while AFT forgave its anticipated dues. Impact on other NEA/AFT mergers Several NEA and AFT state and local teacher unions had merged in the 1960s and 1970s, including affiliates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New Orleans, and throughout Florida. The Education Minnesota merger had encouraged other NEA and AFT state teacher unions in the United States to consider a merger as well. The Montana Education Association and Montana Federation of Teachers merged in September 2000, and discussions were under way in Missouri, New Mexico, New York and Texas. Meanwhile, in 26 states NEA and AFT state affiliates had signed \\"no-raid\\" agreements, which set jurisdictions for each state affiliate and prohibited each union from absorbing the other. Meanwhile, AFT president Sandra Feldman publicly voiced her conclusion that state mergers would continue until a de facto merger of the two unions occurred. Both parent unions recognized a need for ground rules before any additional state mergers. Each union adopted a series of guidelines for approval of state mergers. Through the NEA-AFT joint council, \\"NEAFT,\\" the AFT and NEA agreed to additional guidelines that must be met for future state mergers to move forward smoothly.

He is the only person to hold to every elected seat in the state government under the 1816 constitution. His brief term as governor was marked by the calling of a state constitutional convention and overshadowed by the national anti-slavery debate, where Dunning urged state leaders to issue and forward resolutions to Congress expressing opposition to the expansion of slavery. As a delegate to the subsequent convention, he successfully advocated legislative and educational reform. As the American Civil War broke out, he left the Democratic party and declared for the Union, personally raising many companies of soldiers for the war effort. He returned to the state senate during the war, and then resumed his law practice after his term ended. He remained popular in the state, and declined several nominations to run for office after retiring from politics. Early life =Family and background= Dunning's house in Bloomington Dunning was born in 1806 in Greensboro, Guilford County, North Carolina the youngest of the six sons of James and Rachel North Dunning. He attended the nearby Greensboro Academy and graduated at age seventeen. Upon graduation he enrolled in the state university at Chapel Hill to study medicine. After the death of his father, he, his mother, and one older brother moved to Bloomington, Indiana where Dunning briefly taught school. There he met Sarah Alexander; the couple married on July 6, 1826 and had four children.Gugin, p. 106 He and his wife moved to Louisville, Kentucky for a short time to complete his medical training and then he opened a medical practice in Rockville, Indiana. The practice was short lived as he became more interested in law. He returned to his mother and older brother in Bloomington and began to study law in the office of future Governor James Whitcomb and Congressman Tilghman A. Howard before being admitted to the bar in 1833. Working in the law office, he met Indiana's Democratic Party leaders, and impressed many of them who saw him as a potential candidate for office.Gugin, p. 107 Public office =Legislator= Dunning was elected to represent Monroe County in the Indiana House of Representatives in 1833. He was reelected twice, and served three one years terms, ending in 1836. That year he was elected to the Indiana State Senate representing Monroe and Brown County. During his years in the Indiana General Assembly, he had voted for the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act that had led the state to bankruptcy in 1841. He served two three year terms before opening his Bloomington law practice in 1840. His exit from elected office was probably related to his support of the improvement act. He continued to be active in the party, and was a presidential elector in 1844, and cast his vote for James K. Polk. In 1846 Whitcomb ran for his second term as governor of Indiana. Whitcomb choose Dunning to run as his Lieutenant Governor, and their ticket won. Dunning served in the position until Whitcomb was elected to the United States Senate in December 1848. Whitcomb resigned from office and Dunning was elevated to his seat. =Governor= Dunning served a brief term, but it was a time of several momentous events in the state. Indiana had just emerged from a period of bankruptcy, and Dunning oversaw the final phase of the process, ensuring the public works were turned over to the state's creditors and that the debt reduction deal was fully carried out. Congress was debating the extension of slavery in the western territories during his term, leading to bitter hostilities between northern and southern leaders. Dunning delivered a speech to the General Assembly in which he condemned the expansion of slavery and called for its gradual elimination. He was the first outspoken anti-slavery governor since William Hendricks, and he recommended the assembly pass a resolution for him to forward to Congress. In response, the assembly passed a strong resolution requesting Indiana's congressional delegation to oppose the expansion of slavery.Gugin, p. 108 Governor Whitcomb had already started a movement in the legislature to call a constitutional convention, and Dunning continued to support the effort to have a ballot initiative to replace the constitution. Dunning left office in 1849 and returned to his law practice. Later life =Constitutional convention= In 1850, voters approved a ballot to authorize the formation of a constitutional convention to replace the Indiana Constitution. Dunning was one of the most prominent delegates to attend the convention and took the lead in pushing for several reforms. Among his proposals was a ban on special legislation, because the legislature had become notorious for passing laws that were only applied to certain counties or towns. Dunning was able to have a clause entered into article 4 of the constitution that required all laws passed by the assembly to be applied uniformly across the entire state, ending the practice.Gugin, p. 109 His position on public schools was also added to article 8 of the constitution. The state's literacy rate had dropped from 90% in 1840, to 80% in 1850, and having served on the board of Indiana College between 1841 and 1868, he became aware of the poor condition of public education in the state. His proposals guaranteed equal opportunity for women in public education, something unknown in most of the nation. He also strengthened the free common school cause by requiring the state to fund the public school system, while allowing local school boards to maintain control of their districts' curriculum, hiring, and school arrangements. =Final years= Dunning was nominated by the Democratic party to run for Congress in 1856, but he declined primarily due to the fractured nature of the party at that time. He, along with a large part of the party, was at odds with its state leadership who were sympathetic to the south. In 1860 he did accept a nomination to be a delegate to the party's convention in Charleston, South Carolina, and the second convention held in Baltimore. In both convention he voted in favor of Stephen Douglas, and favored compromise on the slavery issue. When the American Civil War finally broke out in the next year, Dunning publicly declared himself for the Union and set to work raising companies of men for the war effort. In the end, he was personally responsible to the recruitment of nearly two full regiments of men.Gugin, p. 110 In 1861, he left the Democratic party, and was reelected to the state senate as an Independent and supported the Republican governor throughout the war. Governor Oliver P. Morton had a stroke in 1865, and traveled to Europe for treatment and Conrad Baker became acting governor. Dunning was then elected president pro tempore of the senate to fill Baker's place. Dunning's wife died in 1863 and Dunning remarried to the widow of Allen Ashford on September 17, 1865. When his term in the Senate ended in 1867, he was nominated to run again, but declined. He declined a second offer to run for Congress in 1868, preferring to remain in his law practice. Dunning gained a national reputation as a lawyer, and was committed to criminal law. His reputation was such that his clients were \\"assured of success when he was on the case.\\" Dunning continued to be active in public affairs, despite refusing to take public office. He continued to be active in his law practice, hearing cases until a week before his death. Dunning died on May 9, 1884, aged 78, in Bloomington, Indiana, and is buried there in Rose Hill Cemetery.Gugin, p. 111 See alsoList of Governors of Indiana References Notes Bibliography  * External linksBiography and Portrait from Indiana State Library *Political Graveyard *Paris Dunning at FindAGrave Governors of Indiana Indiana Democrats 1806 births 1884 deaths American Methodists Indiana state senators Members of the Indiana House of Representatives Lieutenant Governors of Indiana Politicians from Bloomington, Indiana People from Greensboro, North Carolina Indiana lawyers Delegates to the 1851 Indiana constitutional convention Indiana Independents Democratic Party state governors of the United States 19th- century American politicians ","title":"Paris C.

It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term 'sites' includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment. VPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity. In a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single bridged LAN. VPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast access.  Mesh establishment  Since VPLS emulates a LAN, full mesh connectivity is required. There are two methods for full mesh establishment for VPLS: using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). The \\"control plane\\" is the means by which provider edge (PE) routers communicate for auto-discovery and signalling. Auto-discovery refers to the process of finding other PE routers participating in the same VPN or VPLS. Signalling is the process of establishing pseudowires (PW). The PWs constitute the \\"data plane\\", whereby PEs send customer VPN/VPLS traffic to other PEs. BGP provides both auto-discovery and signalling. The mechanisms used are very similar to those used in establishing Layer-3 MPLS VPNs. Each PE is configured to participate in a given VPLS. The PE, through the use of BGP, simultaneously discovers all other PEs in the same VPLS, and establishes a full mesh of pseudowires to those PEs. With LDP, each PE router must be configured to participate in a given VPLS, and, in addition, be given the addresses of other PEs participating in the same VPLS. A full mesh of LDP sessions is then established between these PEs. LDP is then used to create an equivalent mesh of PWs between those PEs. An advantage to using PWs as the underlying technology for the data plane is that in the event of failure, traffic will automatically be routed along available backup paths in the service provider's network. Failover will be much faster than could be achieved with e.g. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). VPLS is thus a more reliable solution for linking together Ethernet networks in different locations than simply connecting a WAN link to Ethernet switches in both locations. VPLS has significant advantages for both service providers and customers. Service providers benefit because they can generate additional revenues by offering a new Ethernet service with flexible bandwidth and sophisticated service level agreements (SLAs). VPLS is also simpler and more cost effective to operate than a traditional service. Customers benefit because they can connect all of their sites to an Ethernet VPN that provides a secure, high speed and homogenous network. Moreover, VPLS provides a logical next step in the continuing evolution of Ethernet from a 10 Mbit/s shared LAN protocol to a multi-Gbps global service.  Label stack  VPLS MPLS packets have a two- label stack. The outer label is used for normal MPLS forwarding in the service provider's network. If BGP is used to establish the VPLS, the inner label is allocated by a PE as part of a label block. If LDP is used, the inner label is a virtual circuit ID assigned by LDP when it first established a mesh between the participating PEs. Every PE keeps track of assigned inner label, and associates these with the VPLS instance.  Ethernet emulation  PEs participating in a VPLS-based VPN must appear as an Ethernet bridge to connected customer edge (CE) devices. Received Ethernet frames must be treated in such a way as to ensure CEs can be simple Ethernet devices. When a PE receives a frame from a CE, it inspects the frame and learns the CE's MAC address, storing it locally along with LSP routing information. It then checks the frame's destination MAC address. If it is a broadcast frame, or the MAC address is not known to the PE, it floods the frame to all PEs in the mesh. Ethernet does not have a time to live (TTL) field in its frame header, so loop avoidance must be arranged by other means. In regular Ethernet deployments, Spanning Tree Protocol is used for this. In VPLS, loop avoidance is arranged by the following rule: A PE never forwards a frame received from a PE to another PE. The use of a full mesh combined with split horizon forwarding guarantees a loop-free broadcast domain.  Scalability  VPLS is typically used to link a large number of sites together. Therefore, scalability is an important issue that needs addressing. = Hierarchical VPLS = VPLS requires a full mesh in both the control and data planes; this can be difficult to scale. For BGP, the control plane scaling issue has long been addressed, through the use of route reflectors (RRs). RRs are extensively used in the context of Internet routing, as well as for several types of VPNs. To scale the data plane for multicast and broadcast traffic, there is work in progress to use point-to-multipoint LSPs as the underlying transport. For LDP, a method of subdividing a VPLS VPN into two or three tiered hierarchical networks was developed. Called hierarchical VPLS (HVPLS), it introduces a new type of MPLS device: the multi-tenant unit (MTU) switch. This switch aggregates multiple customers into a single PE, which in turn needs only one control and data plane connection into the mesh. This can significantly reduce the number of LDP sessions and LSPs, and thus unburden the core network, by concentrating customers in edge devices. HVPLS (LDP) may also be used to join two VPLS mesh structures together. Without using HVPLS, every node in each VPLS mesh must become meshed with all nodes in the other VPLS mesh. However, with HVPLS, the two meshes can essentially be joined together at certain locations. Techniques such as redundant pseudowires can provide resiliency in case of failures at the interconnection points. = MAC addresses = Since VPLS links multiple Ethernet broadcast domains together, it effectively creates a much larger broadcast domain. Since every PE must keep track of all MAC addresses and associated LSP routing information, this can potentially result in a large amount of memory being needed in every PE in the mesh. To counter this problem, sites may use a router as the CE device. This hides all MAC addresses on that site behind the CE's MAC address. PE devices may also be equipped with content-addressable memory (CAM), similar to high-end Ethernet switches. An alternative mechanism is using MAT (MAC Address Translation).MAC Address Translation for Enabling Scalable Virtual Private LAN Services However, at the time of writing this, there are no vendors providing MAT functionality. = PE auto-discovery = In a VPLS-based VPN with a large number of sites, manually configuring every participating PE does not scale well. If a new PE is taken into service, every existing PE needs to have its configuration adjusted to establish an LDP session with the new PE. Standardisation work is in progress to enable auto-discovery of participating PEs. Three implementations are being worked on: LDP The LDP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by the Label Distribution Protocol to distribute labels across P and PE routers within a single autonomous system.  BGP  The BGP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by Layer-3 MPLS VPNs to distribute VPN routes among PEs participating in a VPN. The BGP4 Multi-Protocol (BGP-MP) extensions are used to distribute VPN IDs and VPN-specific reachability information. Since IBGP requires either a full mesh of BGP sessions or the use of a route reflector, enabling the VPN ID in a participating PEs existing BGP configuration provides it with a list of all PEs in that VPN. Note that this method is for auto-discovery alone; LDP is still used for signaling. The method of establishing VPLS with BGP described above accomplishes both auto- discovery and signalling.  RADIUS  This method requires ALL PEs to be configured with one or more RADIUS servers to use. When the first CE router in a particular VPLS VPN connects to the PE, it uses the CE's identification to request authentication from the RADIUS server. This identification may be provided by the CE or may be configured into the PE for that particular CE. In addition to a username and password, the identification string also contains a VPN name and an optional provider name. The RADIUS server keeps track of all PEs that requested authentication for a particular VPN and returns a list of them to the PE requesting authentication. The PE then establishes LDP sessions to every PE in the list.

As of October 2006, blue memberships can be purchased for one- or three-year periods, or obtained for free by referring friends.

History  Launched by entrepreneur Gabriel Weinberg, the company was acquired by Classmates.com for \\"approximately $10 million in cash\\" in March 2006. At the time of acquisition the company had \\"approximately 50,000 pay subscribers and [was] expected to generate less than a million dollars in revenues\\" that year. United Online CEO Mark Goldston said the acquisition of \\"The Names Database is a great addition to Classmates.com and furthers our overall mission of connecting people.\\" As of 2013, United Online no longer mentions the company in its Form 10-K annual report except once to say it \\"excludes\\" in its \\"active accounts\\" calculation. Before the acquisition, the company's legal name was actually Opobox, Inc. and was doing business as The Names Database. According to Delaware corporation records (where the company was registered), Opobox had been around since 2001. For a period of two years the business was registered but inactive. The Names Database was formed in 2003 after Gabriel Weinberg put up pages of names that were subsequently indexed by search engines.  Criticism  Like other social networks such as Hi5, Names Database has been criticized for being too aggressive at encouraging registrants to refer friends. Upon registration the site immediately asks you to refer friends and then checks the validity of any address you enter, attempting to disallow fraudulent information. However, free access to searching the database is granted in the email confirmation without referring any friends, thus skipping that step. Also, all outgoing emails appear to follow the rules stipulated in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 including proper opt-out links, listed physical addresses and information about how the original email address was collected. Another area of criticism has been the expanded license granted to the site for information entered to it upon registration. However, this license is substantially similar or identical to that granted to other social networking services. Additionally, the site appears to try to collect only the minimal amount of information needed to find an old friend and classmate (name, birth year, email address and high school country with optional maiden name) as opposed to more invasive required information like gender, zip code and birth date as found on other sites. Classmates.com itself (the parent company) has been criticized for controversial business practices and legal issues, but it is unclear how much of this criticism also applies to their subsidiaries. In any case, The Names Database does provide the option of automatically removing one's listing in the database. However, these instructions have not worked since at least March 2013.

Such a printer uses a light-emitting diode (LED) array as a light source in the printhead instead of the laser used in laser printers and, more generally, in the xerography process. The LED bar pulse-flashes across the entire page width and creates the image on the print drum or belt as it moves past. LEDs are more efficient and reliable than conventional laser printers, since they have fewer moving parts, allowing for less mechanical wear. Depending on design, LED printers can have faster rates of print than some laser-based designs, and are generally cheaper to manufacture. In contrast to LED printers, laser printers require combinations of rotating mirrors and lenses that must remain in alignment throughout their use. The LED print head has no moving parts, and the individual assemblies tend to be more compact.  History  Oki Electric Industry claims to have made the first LED printer in 1981. A commercialized variant called OPP6220 was developed in 1986. It was a compact monotonic printer with a resolution of 240 dpi and a speed of 16 ppm. A 1989 model called OL400 was noted for its low cost. By 1997, Oki has pushed the resolution to 1200 dpi, and has produced upscaled models that handle A3-sized paper. The OKIPAGE 8c from 1998 was the first color LED printer for OKI. It simply utilizes a tandem array of four LED-toner pairs.  Variants  OKI Data has developed specialty LED Printers that use a CMYW toner system rather than CMYK. The OKI 920WT and 711WT have been developed for the apparel decorating industry, replacing the typical BLACK toners (\\"K\\") with a White toner. The purpose is to allow the heat transfer application to dark fabrics and maintain the vibrancy of the colors. The LED immediately prints and dries the full color image onto a velum-like material that is then heat pressed to an adhesive sheet for application.

The formula can be thought of as four olivine (Mg2SiO4), plus one brucite (Mg(OH)2). Indeed, the mineral is essentially a hydrated olivine and occurs in altered ultramafic rocks and carbonatites. Most commonly found as tiny indistinct grains, large euhedral clinohumite crystals are sought by collectors and occasionally fashioned into bright, yellow-orange gemstones. Only two sources of gem- quality material are known: the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, and the Taymyr region of northern Siberia. It is one of two humite group minerals that have been cut into gems, the other being the much more common chondrodite.  Properties  A monoclinic mineral, clinohumite is typically a dark to light brownish or orangy yellow, somewhat resembling the hessonite variety of grossular.Arem, Joel E. (1977). Color Encyclopedia of Gemstones. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, 149 pages. Clinohumite's crystal habit is usually granular, but may also be prismatic; crystals are almost always small. Simple and multiple crystal twinning (on {001}) is common, resulting in a highly variable habit. Clinohumite is brittle with a hardness of 6 and a poor basal cleavage. Its specific gravity is 3.2-3.4, and its fracture is conchoidal to uneven; its streak is white. Clinohumite's transparency ranges from transparent to translucent; its luster ranges from a dull vitreous to resinous. Its refractive index (as measured via sodium light, 589.3 nm) is as follows: Œ± 1.631; Œ≤ 1.638-1.647; Œ≥ 1.668;, with a maximum birefringence of 0.028 (biaxial positive). Under shortwave ultraviolet light, some clinohumite may fluoresce an orangy yellow; there is little to no response under longwave UV. The Taymyr material is reported to be a dark reddish brown while the Pamir material is a bright yellow to orange or brownish orange. The Pamir material also has a hardness slightly greater than 6, a lower specific gravity (3.18), and higher maximum birefringence (0.036).Henn, U., Hyr≈°l, J., and Milisenda, C. (2000). \\"Gem-quality clinohumite from Tajikistan and the Taymyr region, Northern Siberia.\\" Journal of Gemmology, Vol. 27, No. 6, pp. 335-340. Phillip Youngman, master faceter of Los Osos, California, noticed not only that Pamir material is harder than expected, but also that it is less brittle than expected. Youngman observed that clinohumite reacted like beryl to cutting and polishing, and that it reminded him of polishing diopside. Like other members of the humite group, the relative amounts of hydroxyl and fluorine vary in clinohumite, and iron commonly substitutes for some of the magnesium, bringing about changes in physical and optical properties. Titanium substitution also causes pronounced changes in optical properties, producing the variety titanclinohumite. Consequently, it is relatively easy to determine that a stone is a humite group mineral, but difficult to determine exactly which member. Other common impurities of clinohumite include aluminium, manganese, and calcium.  Formation and occurrence  Two intergrown crystals (1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm) from Koksha Valley, Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan Clinohumite is a product of contact metamorphism and is commonly found as indistinct grains embedded in limestone. Its type occurrence is within the limestone ejecta of the Mount Vesuvius volcano complex near Naples, Italy, where clinohumite was discovered in 1876. The aforementioned gem-quality occurrences of Pamir and Taymyr were discovered only recently: the former in the early 1980s, and the latter in 2000. These deposits are scarce and only sporadically mined, so clinohumite remains one of the rarest gemstones with only a few thousand carats known to exist in private collections. Other (non-gem quality) occurrences of clinohumite include: the S√∏r Rondane and Balchen Mountains of Antarctica; Mount Bischoff, Waratah, Tasmania; the Saualpe Mountains of Carinthia, the Koralpe mountains of Styria, and the Vals, Virgen, and Ziller valleys of the Tyrol, Austria; the Jacupiranga mine of Cajati, S√£o Paulo State, Southeast Region, Brazil; the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria; Bancroft, Ontario, Notre Dame du Laus, Wakefield, and Villedieu Township, Quebec, Canada; Southern and Western Finland; Bavaria and Saxony, Germany; eastern Greenland; Ambasamudram in Tamil Nadu, India; Honsh≈´, Japan; Suan, North Korea; Nordland, Norway; KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape Province, South Africa; Andalusia, Spain; V√§rmland and V√§stmanland, Sweden; Isle of Skye, Scotland; and the states of California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Utah, and Washington, US.Webster, R., Read, P.

Clinohumite also occurs as a minor component of some masses of peridotite from the Earth's mantle emplaced into the Earth's crust and as a very rare component of peridotite xenoliths.

The odd setting of space group P21/c is chosen to preserve the a and b axes of olivine. The structure is closely related to that of olivine as well as the other humite minerals. Mg and Fe are in octahedral coordination with oxygen and silicon (Si) is in tetrahedral coordination. There are five distinct octahedral sites and two different tetrahedral sites. One of the octahedral sites is bonded to two OH,F atoms and is the site where Ti is partitioned.Friedrich, A., Lager, G.A., Kunz, M., Chakoumakos, B.C., Smyth, J.R., and Schultz, A.J.

The Germans were quick to explore their territory, and the mouth of the Ramu was discovered in 1886 by Vice-Admiral Freiherr von Schleinitz after returning to Finschhafen from an expedition to the nearby Sepik.Souter (1963) p. 73 Schleinitz called the Ramu, Ottilien after his ship the Ottilie. The course of the river was first discovered 10 years later in 1896 after Dr Carl Lauterbach, a botanist, led an expedition organised by the German New Guinea Company (Neu Guinea Kompagnie) to find the headwaters of the Markham River.Souter (1963) p. 77 After crossing the Ortzen Mountains from Astrolabe Bay south of Madang, Lauterbach's party, instead of finding the Markham, found an unknown river flowing northwest. The party canoed along a section before their supplies dwindled; they returned to the coast retracing their route. Another German explorer, Ernst Tappenbeck, who had accompanied Lauterbach previously, led the first expedition to ascend the Ramu in 1898. Tappenbeck was charged with discovering whether the Ottilien found in 1886 was the same river Lauterbech had found. He was accompanied by former Prussian Army officers, a Kompagnie official and an Australian gold prospector Robert Phillip, and travelled in the Neu Guinea Kompagnie steamer Herzog Johann Albrecht.Souter (1963) p. 78 After five days of journey up the Ramu, Tappenbeck left his companions at a well-stocked camp when river water levels fell. He returned four and half months later in another steamer, Herzogin Elisabeth, and the party managed to navigate upstream and go farther still by canoe. By the end of 1898, the expedition had established a station on the river, mapped it and tributaries, and made a large botanical collection. Further explorations for gold and botanical specimens were conducted by the Germans. In 1902, Hans Klink and J. Schlenzig established a new Ramu station that was later connected by a bridle track to the coast.Souter (1963) pp. 111-112 Dr R. Schlecter led another expedition in 1902 in search of gutta- percha trees. Then in 1907, Austrian explorer Wilhelm Dammk√∂hler led an expedition up the Markham Valley and linked the headwaters of the Markham River with the Ramu for the first time. = Australian administration and Second World War = Ramu villagers investigating a camera during an Australian expedition in the 1930s After the First World War, German New Guinea passed over to Australian control and became the Territory of New Guinea. The Ramu reverted to its local name during this time. In 1936, Briton, Lord Moyne, ventured up the Ramu during an expedition to Indonesia and New Guinea. Moyne discovered a race of pygmy-like people inhabiting the middle Ramu region from the mouth of the river in the Aiome foothills. During the Second World War, in 1942 the Japanese annexed the entire Territory of New Guinea from the Australians. Intense fighting occurred between the Imperial Japanese Army and the Australian and US Armies to recapture New Guinea. During the Finisterre Range campaign in 1943 and 1944, the Ramu valley became the scene of a major battle.  Hydroelectric plant  The Ramu flows into Yonki Dam, where it feeds the Ramu 1 power station. A hydroelectric plant was under construction on the toe of the Yonki Dam, however construction is currently (May 2011) suspended.

Location As Sandtown is an unincorporated community with no official recognition, the definition of its borders varies. The borders of Sandtown according to the petition for annexation to AtlantaAtlanta annexation database, case 2006-006 are: Campbellton Road to the north, Atlanta (Arlington Estates and Fairway Acres neighborhoods) to the east, a line roughly following Boreal Way and Erin Road on the south (west of Camp Creek Parkway, Union Road), and Riverside Drive on the west. An earlier 2006 source would have included areas north of Campbellton Road and south of Erin Road.Map of proposed southwest annexations, City of Atlanta, September 2006 History Sandtown, formerly called Buzzard's Roost, was one of the largest Native villages in the area where Atlanta would develop. After the Trail of Tears and the government of Georgia divided the territory into counties, Sandtown ended up in Campbell County (which was absorbed into Fulton County in 1932 along with Milton County). The road now known as Cascade was originally an Indian trail known as the Sandtown Road and ran from the village on the Chattahoochee River near Utoy Creek east through what became Five Points then to the vicinity of Decatur. This was the oldest settled area in current Fulton County. Atlanta's first doctor, Joshua Gilbert, lived along the Sandtown Road near the present-day Cascade Nature Preserve. The Union Army used his home as a hospital during the Battle of Utoy Creek. During the American Civil War there were two roads to Sandtown (the current Cascade and Campbelltown roads), which were prominent locations of Union Army operations during the Siege of Atlanta. The Battle of Utoy Creek was fought along the Sandtown (Cascade) Road in Cascade Heights from 1‚Äì7 August 1864. Major General William T. Sherman's headquarters was along the southern Sandtown (Campbellton) Road on 26 August 1864. In 2006 Sandtown applied for annexation to the city of Atlanta. Atlanta put Sandtown's application on hold. In 2007 a vote in unincorporated southern Fulton County, including Sandtown, on whether to form a new city of South Fulton, Georgia, resulted against such a formation. Transportation The neighborhood is served by State Route 6 (SR 6; Camp Creek Parkway) and SR 154/SR 166 (Campbellton Road SW).

Therefore, any challenge to the law was deemed unripe because there was no actual threat of injury to anyone who disobeyed the law..

She holds a PhD degree in Islamic studies from the University of Glasgow, Scotland and was formerly a lecturer and assistant professor at the Faculty of Usul-al-Din at International Islamic University, Islamabad. Hashmi founded Al-Huda International Welfare Foundation in 1994. The foundation started a number of schools to teach the Quran and Hadith to women in order to \\"help women become better observant muslims by helping them understand the Quran\\". The foundation now runs a network of schools, seminaries and social welfare projects.Courtney Bender, Wendy Cadge, Peggy Levitt, David Smilde, Religion on the Edge: De-centering and Re-centering the Sociology of Religion, p 170. In 2004, the foundation established the Al-Huda Institute in Mississauga (Toronto area), Ontario, Canada. This institute offers courses on exegesis of the Quran and Hadith and attracts students from a number of foreign countries such as Australia. She has gained popularity as a feminist scholar both in Pakistan and abroad, as evidenced by crowds of up to ten thousand that attend her religious lessons, called dars : the number of women who got a diploma or certificate are estimated to be around 15 000 while those who followed her courses without formally enrolling are even more numerous.Faiza Mushtaq, ¬´ A Controversial Role Model for Pakistani Women ¬ª, South Asia Multidisciplinary Academic Journal, 4  2010 Most followers come from liberal, literate and modern backgrounds; and most are women. She has stated that her mission is to bring a renewal in Islam, through better understanding of the core scriptures. In contrast to rigid and confrontational styles of proselytising, Hashmi has emphasized the need for her students to engage in voluntarily educating others through their examples. Early life and education Farhat Hashmi was born in Sargodha, Punjab, on December 22, 1957. Her father, Abdur Rehman Hashmi, was a Muslim scholar, and the local leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. She was educated at a local school; then studied at the Government College for women Sargodha and ultimately completed her Master's degree in Arabic Language from the University of Punjab, Lahore. Her religious education occurred at her home where she was taught the tenets of Islam by her father. She married a fellow scholar of Hadith Muhammad Idrees Zubair and the couple took up posts of lecturers at the International Islamic University (IIU), Islamabad. Soon after they moved to Scotland where they enrolled in the doctorate programme of Islamic studies. During this time, they both travelled to Turkey, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. She emigrated to Canada in 2005.  Career  While teaching at the International Islamic University, Hashmi had started informal religious classes for women. Upon returning to Pakistan she launched Al-Huda International; a non-government welfare trust which seeks to educate women as to how they can interpret and then employ Islamic principles in their daily lives. The establishment of a progressive school purely for women, by a female Islamic scholar was seen by some as a direct response to large seminaries, which women had come to view as being regressive and highly politicised. Hashmi has been noted for her nontraditional style of teaching and original lectures which focus on feminism. She utilizes modern methods of teaching in her lectures and is multilingual in Urdu, Arabic and English, so her female students; a large of whom come from educated, urban families, are able to relate with her. Academic studies have shown that the innovative techniques of teaching introduced by Hashmi are one of the reasons for the institute's popularity. Hashmi began her career as a television preacher on Geo TV, where she hosted the programme Shahru Ramadan during the month of Ramadhan. She also appeared in the programme The Quran & You on Aag TV. She continued to give lectures on exegesis of the Quran on Geo in the show Fahm ul Quran. More recently her lectures have been broadcast as standalone episodes. During her television shows, she appears on air covered with an Islamic veil and niqab; while giving her lectures from her laptop. This has been termed as an \\"image that projects the confluence of pious traditionalism and media savvy prosperity\\". Views She favours greater participation of women in day to day matters of faith, and is of the view that women should be able to pray outside their homes, and they should be able to lead their own prayers. According to Hashmi, women can touch and recite the Quran during their menstrual periods, wearing gloves (either when learning Quran from a teacher or teaching Quran to others), traditionally considered by some to be prohibited.(Pakistan) Daily Times, March 17, 2001\\"A controversial role model for Pakistani women\\" in South Asian Multidisciplinary Academic Journal (SAMAJ) by Faiza Mushtaq in issue 4, 2010 Some other scholars are supportive of her views. Hashmi advocates for a revival of Islam and encourages her followers to interpret the Qur'an for themselves supporting their views with strong evidence. She urges her followers to focus on becoming better Muslims and her lectures are focused on family structures. This view is criticized by her critics, who claim that her religious Dars \\"center around personal and family development, rather than community service\\". Hashmi, however, argues that if all of her students undergo a transformation for the better, their personal transformation will be reflected on a national and a global scale.\\"Awakening Islam\\", in Fort Worth Weekly by Shomial Ahmad on 15 April 2009 Hashmi is in favour of establishing the Sharia Law in Canada. Her views on domestic matters are in accordance with her interpretation of the Sharia Law. According to Hashmi, both men and women have specific spheres of influence within the society. Typically men are the ones who work outside the house, while women work within. However, Hashmi argues that these roles are not set in stone and if a person has fulfilled his or her role, they can help the other in their duties as well. This, and her other arguments which call for women to work outside the roles that have been designated to them by rigid traditionalist scholars, have drawn considerable ire from conservative, right wing scholars. Hashmi considers polygamy to be legal, and has preached that Muslim women should let their husbands marry a second time so ‚Äúother sisters can also benefit‚Äù. This saves men from having a nonmarital relationship, which is forbidden according to the Quran. Criticism Hashmi has been criticised by some Islamic clerics who believe that a woman cannot become an Islamic scholar and interpreter of Quran. She also has been criticized by some ultra- conservative, right-wing preachers and puritan men for breaking gender roles in Islam, especially on her views about women teaching and preaching outside the home. Other conservative sources have criticized her devotees of \\"wearing western clothes\\", of consuming western products and holding informal women- only gatherings. They have also criticized her for using the internet and audiovisual aids in preaching, methods that they deem as western. Liberal and secular outlets have criticized her for \\"not going far enough\\" in her progressive interpretation of Islam. She has also been criticized for allowing polygamy. Due to her unbending religious doctrines she has been termed a Wahabi by some liberal activists like Raheel Raza. Although Hashmi and Al-Huda have stated that they do not follow any particular sect of contemporary Islam and refer to themselves simply as Muslims as was done during the time of early Islam.

Polonius: By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed. Hamlet: Methinks it is like a weasel. The weasel program or Dawkins' weasel is a thought experiment and a variety of computer simulations illustrating it. Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives evolutionary systems‚Äîrandom variation combined with non-random cumulative selection‚Äîis different from pure chance. The thought experiment was formulated by Richard Dawkins, and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.  Overview  In chapter 3 of his book The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known infinite monkey theorem: The scenario is staged to produce a string of gibberish letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 2728, or about 1040, so the probability that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a \\"target\\" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, \\"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\\". A computer program could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's hypothetical monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire lifetime of the universe to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase \\"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\\".For a string of 28 characters, with 27 possible characters (A-Z plus space), any randomly generated string has the probability one in 27^28 of being correct; that is approximately one in 10^40. If a program generating 10 million strings per second had been running since the start of the universe (around 14 billion years, or 10^17 seconds), it would have only generated around 10^24 strings by now. Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of evolutionary change, i.e. that DNA sequences or organic compounds such as proteins are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of amino acids in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as Hoyle's fallacy). Rather, evolution proceeds by hill climbing, as in adaptive landscapes. Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of cumulative selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words: By repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each generation. The sequences progress through each generation: :Generation 01: Note: the 4th character of line 1 is missing in Dawkins' text; however line 2 suggests it was probably a T :Generation 02: :Generation 10: :Generation 20: :Generation 30: :Generation 40: :Generation 43: Dawkins continues: Implications for biology The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or genes) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival (\\"fitness\\") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to \\"die.\\" Dawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his \\"biomorphs\\" program: Regarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations: A full run of a weasel program, with 100 offspring per generation, and a 5% mutation chance per character copied. Only the \\"fittest\\" string of each generation is shown. Note that, in generation 8, the 25th character, which had been correct (\`A\`), becomes incorrect (\`I\`). The program does not \\"lock\\" correct characters, rather it measures at each iteration the closeness of the complete string to the 'target' phrase. More complex models In The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of gene selection involving entities he calls biomorphs. These are two-dimensional sets of line segments which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of \\"genes\\" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as \\"airplane\\" or \\"octopus\\" biomorphs. As a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of \\"genetic space,\\" where each possible gene is treated as a dimension, and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, \\"however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead\\". In Climbing Mount Improbable, Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the spider web. He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a \\"trial and error\\" process. Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.  Example algorithm  Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a \\"Weasel\\" style algorithm could run as follows. # Start with a random string of 28 characters. # Make 100 copies of the string (reproduce). # For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (mutate) the character with a new random character. # Compare each new string with the target string \\"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\\", and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position). # If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2. For these purposes, a \\"character\\" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not \\"locked\\". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.

BTS was previously an independent statistical agency within DOT. *The Office of Research, Development and Technology, which was part of the former Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), an agency that was disestablished by the Mineta Act; *The Office of Intermodalism which was created by the ISTEA and was formerly part of the Office of the Secretary in DOT; *The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was formed in 1970 to provide analytical, scientific, and engineering support to the newly established USDOT. The Center had been part of RSPA. *The Transportation Safety Institute (TSI), established in 1971 to assist DOT modal administrations in accomplishing their mission- essential training requirements. TSI had been part of RSPA. *The Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO), which is composed of program managers and coordinators of the USDOT's multimodal Intelligent Transportation Systems research initiatives. Created in 1991, the JPO was previously part of the Federal Highway Administration. Organization RITA is led by two presidential appointees. Within RITA there are several program offices, which report directly to the Administrator. Those offices are: =Office of Research, Development and Technology (RD&T;)= RITA's Research, Development, and Technology (RD&T;) office's mission is to coordinate research across all modes of transportation and to promote advanced innovative transportation solutions. RD&T; coordinates a research planning council, a planning team, and several research clusters that are dedicated to certain multimodal research subjects. The planning council ensures crossmodal collaboration and coordination in research being done with DOT and its partners, and advises the Secretary of Transportation on research issues. The planning team supports the council by reviewing and coordinating departmental research plans and budgets, assessing research, and promoting best practices in research performance and technology transfer.http://www.rita.dot.gov/rdt/ University Transportation Centers (UTC) The University Transportation Centers Program funds transportation research at 136 colleges and universities and helps advance the education and training needed to support a 21st Century transportation system. Research and education programs provided by UTCs address critical national transportation challenges while developing the next generation of transportation professionals. UTC colleges and universities trained 32,000 practicing transportation professionals in 2009.http://utc.dot.gov/ Climate Change Center The virtual DOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting, an online, interactive knowledge base on transportation and climate change, includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, the potential impacts of climate change on the infrastructure, approaches for integrating climate change considerations into transportation decision making, and ideas for adaptation and mitigation.http://www.climate.dot.gov Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Technologies Program This program develops and validates remote sensing technologies for application to transportation infrastructure in the three major areas listed below. Congress authorized approximately $7 million a year for this work. *Cost and time reduction for corridor planning and collecting information for environmental assessment, *Freight congestion management at ports, border crossings and gateways, and in urban areas, and *Paved and unpaved roads and bridge systems management and condition assessment. =Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)= Established as a policy-neutral statistical agency in 1992, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) provides comprehensive data about America's transportation networks. The data reveals how people, goods, and vehicles move through the system, as well as measure the impact of social, economic, and environmental factors on system performance. BTS is the source of much of the nation's data on the operations and finances of commercial airlines. BTS also conducts the Commodity Flow Survey, the only nationwide intermodal freight data source. As a federal statistical agency, BTS releases data based on a published schedule. BTS issues monthly press releases on the Freight Transportation Services Index, airline traffic, scheduled passenger airline employment and North American surface freight. Quarterly releases are issued on average domestic air fares and airline financials, including baggage fees and reservation change fees. BTS is the source of available statistics on airline on-time data and tarmac data. BTS‚Äô tarmac data was widely used in deliberations on the issue of lengthy tarmac times, which has been well-publicized in the last three years. BTS‚Äô data is the key indicator of the effectiveness of the federal rule implementing a three-hour time limit on planes sitting on the tarmac. The rule went into effect April 29, 2010. In May, BTS issues an annual press release on airline employment by job category, with totals for pilots, maintenance workers and outsourcing of maintenance. In November, BTS issues an annual press release on the update of the North American Transportation Statistics Database, a project conducted jointly with Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. Census Bureau.http://www.bts.gov National Transportation Library (NTL) Established in 1998, the National Transportation Library is a part of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that maintains and facilitates access to statistical and other information needed for transportation decision-making at the Federal, state, and local levels. It also coordinates with public and private transportation libraries and information providers to improve information sharing among the transportation community. The NTL's reference staff assists US DOT staff and the general public in locating transportation-related documents and reports, statistics, and subject experts at DOT. Reference staff is available from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST to answer telephone calls and emails, or reference requests can be submitted at any time via the web through Ask-A-Librarian.http://ntl.custhelp.com/cgi- bin/ntl.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php =Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO)= Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) focuses on intelligent vehicles, intelligent infrastructure and the creation of an intelligent transportation system involving these two components to enhance surface transportation safety and mobility and contribute to America's economic growth. The Federal ITS program supports the overall advancement of ITS through investments in major initiatives, exploratory studies and a deployment support program. Increasingly, the Federal investments are directed at targets of opportunity ‚Äì major initiatives ‚Äì that have the potential for significant payoff in improving safety, mobility and productivity. The ITS Program places priority on research in intelligent vehicles, intelligent infrastructure and the development of a nationwide transportation system. The ITS Program supports major investments in technology initiatives, exploratory research, and deployment support activities designed to help state and local jurisdictions optimize technology deployments. Connected vehicle research is the ITS Joint Program Office's leading initiative. Connected Vehicle Technology is fundamentally about wireless communications between vehicles and other vehicles as well as between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure such as traffic signals, work zones and grade crossings. In each case the communication involves devices that are either embedded in, or brought into, the vehicle or infrastructure. The wireless communication uses Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), a technology similar to WiFi, which supports applications designed to prevent crashes, increase mobility and improve the environment. =Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)= The Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) program is responsible for coordinating and developing PNT technology, PNT policy, and spectrum management. These responsibilities previously were performed by Office of the Secretary and were delegated to RITA by the Secretary of Transportation in August 2007. All modes of transportation rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and other PNT capabilities to provide safe and reliable operation of transportation systems. PNT is crucial for planning and tracking shipments, mapping routes, and other transportation functions, and is increasingly used for safety functions. The Office of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing represents all Federal civil departments and agencies in the development, acquisition, management, and operations of GPS, as well as providing civil PNT system analysis including requirements and architecture development and performance monitoring. RITA serves as the coordinator for the inland component of the Nationwide Differential GPS System (NDGPS), an augmentation to GPS which provides increased accuracy and integrity signals to surface transportation applications of GPS. The NDGPS signal is also used by many other civil economic sectors.http://pnt.rita.dot.gov/ =John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center= The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, partners with organizations across government and the private sector to research and develop solutions to emerging transportation issues. The Volpe Center is funded through a fee-for-service structure, which means all costs are covered by sponsored project work. The Volpe Center was established in 1970 to provide analytical, scientific, and engineering support to the newly established U.S. Department of Transportation. From the beginning, the Center was envisioned as a place where a broad range of skills could be focused on major issues that cut across the traditional modal structure of the transportation enterprise.http://www.volpe.dot.gov/about/history/ Housed on the campus of NASA's former Electronics Research Center, the Center opened as the Transportation Systems Center thanks to growing congressional awareness of the need to apply advanced technology to national transportation problems and the efforts of then-U.S. Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe, as well as those of the Massachusetts congressional delegation. In 1990, the Center was renamed in John A. Volpe's honor.http://www.volpe.dot.gov/about/history/ =Transportation Safety Institute (TSI)= Located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) conducts worldwide safety, security, and environmental training for public and private sector transportation professionals. TSI offers more than 700 courses and seminars https://www.tsi.dot.gov/tsilms/reports/trainingschedule.aspx designed to prepare safety professionals to handle emergencies and other critical incidents through a hands-on, real-world training experience, such as using staged debris fields for aircraft crash investigation training. TSI funding comes through a fee-for-service structure, which means all costs are covered by sponsored project work.http://www.tsi.dot.gov/about.aspx RITA Activities =Distracted Driving Summit= The first Distracted Driving Summit was held in 2009 in Washington, D.C., with the second annual Summit held on September 21, 2010, in Washington. The Summit aims to raise awareness about the dangers of distracted driving and also to examine emerging technology, policy, and other innovations to curb distracted driving in the United States. =U.S. Department of Transportation Safety Council= In October 2010, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood convened the first meeting of the U.S. DOT Safety Council, formed to tackle critical transportation safety issues facing the Department's 10 operating administrations. Before taking office, LaHood noticed that the department's agencies were pursuing many important safety initiatives without a formal process for sharing data, best practices, and strategies. He established the Safety Council to serve a cross-modal safety leadership role, enabling an even stronger safety culture in the department, and designated RITA to coordinate council activities. The goals of the Safety Council are to further enhance the safety focus throughout all of the department's agencies and to improve the impact of the department's safety programs. Transportation Deputy Secretary John Porcari chairs the Council, which comprises the heads of the Department's 10 agencies. The Council will be action-oriented and data-driven, emphasizing open dialogue about common issues and providing a forum for fresh ideas and different perspectives.http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2009/dot17209.htm =RITA Publications= RITA publishes several different annual statistical reports as well as weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual press releases and updates regarding transportation statistics which reflect what is going on in the world of transportation in addition to the larger U.S. economy. All of RITA's publications can be found on RITA's website. One important RITA publication is the Transportation Statistics Annual Report (TSAR), which includes data on all modes of transportation. The most recent TSAR can be found on RITA's website.http://www.rita.dot.gov/publications/ Role within Department of Transportation RITA is one of ten Operating Administrations within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The others are: *Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) *Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) *Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) *Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) *Federal Transit Administration (FTA) *Maritime Administration (MARAD) *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) *Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) *Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) *Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) RITA works with these different modal administrations to coordinate communication of research performed in the different modes, promoting synergy across the modes of transportation.

In the case of a rook and pawn versus a rook, it is also known as the third rank defense, because of the importance of the rook on the third cutting off the opposing king. It was analyzed by Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor in 1777. (Also see rook and pawn versus rook endgame.) Many rook and pawn versus rook endgames reach either the Philidor position or the Lucena position. If played accurately the defending side tries to reach the Philidor position; the other side tries to reach the winning Lucena position. Jes√∫s de la Villa said \\"[The Philidor position] is perhaps the most important position in endgame theory\\" . Philidor analyzed many positions, some of which have his name associated with them (see the subsequent sections). Philidor position, rook and pawn versus rook { align=\\"right\\"  Image:Chess kll45.svg  Image:Chess rll45.svg  Image:Chess pdl45.svg  Image:Chess kdl45.svg  Image:Chess rdl45.svg } The diagram shows an example of Philidor's position. The important characteristics of the position are (from the point of view of the defender): * The defending king (White in this diagram) is on the queening square of the pawn (or adjacent to it). The pawn can be on any . * The opposing pawn has not yet reached the defender's third rank (its sixth rank). * The opposing king is beyond the defender's third rank. * The defender's rook is on the third rank, keeping the opposing king off that rank. Black would like to get his king to the e3-square and threaten checkmate to force the white king away from the queening square of the pawn, e1. The white rook on the third rank prevents that. If Black checks with the rook from the side, White simply keeps the king in front of the pawn by alternating between squares e1 and e2. If Black offers an exchange of rooks White should take it, since the resulting king and pawn endgame is drawn (see King and pawn versus king endgame). So Black's only winning chance is to advance the pawn. The basic idea for the defender is to keep his rook on his third rank until the pawn advances to that rank, then check the opposing king from behind. Here is a possible continuation: :1... Rb2 If 1...e3, advancing the pawn immediately, then 2.Ra8 draws since Black's king cannot escape checks without losing the e-pawn, when the resulting position with each side playing with a king and a rook, is a draw. :2. Rc3 Ra2 :3. Rb3 e3 There is little else for Black to try. If Black retreats the rook, the white king can advance, drawing easily. If Black shuffles (...Rc2‚ÄìRa2‚ÄìRc2), White can do the same (Ra3‚ÄìRh3‚ÄìRa3). With 3...e3, Black threatens to advance with Kf3, and if he is unopposed, checkmate with the rook or advance the pawn. (A passive defense does not work.) :4. Rb8 Since now Black's king cannot move to e3, it is safe to move the rook away to the far end of the board (the defender's seventh or eighth rank). Note that 4.Rb4+ () loses immediately to 4...Kf3 when Black will checkmate or force the exchange of rooks followed by ...Kf2 and promotion of the pawn. :4... Kf3 :5. Rf8+ Ke4 :6. Re8+ The black king cannot hide from the checks without giving up the pawn; nor can he approach the rook: :6... Kf4 :7. Rf8+ Ke5 7...Kg5 is also answered by 8.Re8. :8. Re8+ Black is forced to play ...Kd4 or ...Kf4, making no progress. The defender's rook must be on his seventh or eighth rank to employ the Philidor defense. (Positions can be drawn with the rook in other positions, using different defenses.) To sum up the defense: the defender should keep his king in front of the opposing pawn and keep his rook on the third rank until the pawn advances to that rank, then go to the far end of the board (the seventh or eighth rank) and check the king from behind. If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block the checks, the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame. Philidor actually studied a position that leads to the type of position above. In the diagrammed position, if it is Black's turn to move, he moves : 1... Rb4 and then his rook will reach his third rank, and the position is basically the same as the diagram above, with colors reversed, e.g. 2. Ke6 Rb6+ 3. Kf5 Rc6 establishes the standard defensive setup. If White is to move, he wins with accurate play by : 1. Ke6 Kf8 2.Ra8# was threatened. Moving the king to the \\"short side\\" of the pawn is relatively better than to the other side. : 2. Ra8+ Kg7 : 3. Kd6 Rd4+ : 4. Ke7 Rb4 : 5. e6 etc., and wins . Note that Black reaches a draw after 1.Kd6 Re4!, for example 2.Ke6 Kf8 3.Ra8+ Kg7 4.Kd6 Kf7 and White cannot break through. Philidor's defense can also be used if the pawn is less advanced. In that case, the defending rook can occupy its fourth rank instead of its third rank and the defending king should be on at least its second rank. When the pawn reaches the rank of the defending rook, the rook moves to its eighth rank to check the opposing king from behind (assuming that the opposing rook is not on that rank) , . Philidor thought that the only way to draw was to keep the defending rook on its third rank until the pawn reached that rank and then attack from behind. In 1897 Max A.K.S. Karstedt (1868‚Äì1945) showed that this is not strictly true and Johann Berger (1845‚Äì1933) expanded on that. There are other ways to draw; however, the alternate defenses are more complicated . Queen versus rook { align=\\"right\\"  Image:Chess kll45.svg  Image:Chess qll45.svg  Image:Chess kdl45.svg  Image:Chess rdl45.svg } Philidor studied many endgame positions. Another one that he studied in 1777 (and is also called Philidor's position) involves a queen versus a rook (see the diagram). If Black is to move in this position, he quickly loses his rook by a fork (or gets checkmated). For example, : 1... Rb1 : 2. Qd8+ Ka7 : 3. Qd4+ Ka8 : 4. Qh8+ Ka7 : 5. Qh7+ thus forking the rook on b1. If, on the other hand, White is to move in this position, he would like to be in this position except with Black to move. This can be accomplished by triangulation: : 1. Qe5+ Ka8 : 2. Qa1+ Kb8 : 3. Qa5 and now it is back to the same position but Black has to move (and is in zugzwang) , . Nunn describes that with the pieces in the center of the board the queen ought to force the rook towards the Philidor position. Nunn describes the various retreat positions for the rook, the \\"fourth, third, second\\" rank defenses, then the \\"Philidor position\\". It is usually easy for White to force Black into the Philidor position . With Black to play in the Philidor position, the rook can be won in a few moves . Rook and bishop versus rook { align=\\"right\\"  Image:Chess kll45.svg  Image:Chess rll45.svg  Image:Chess bll45.svg  Image:Chess kdl45.svg  Image:Chess rdl45.svg } Another famous position studied by and named after Philidor is in the ending of a rook and bishop versus a rook (diagram). White wins because his king has reached the sixth rank and black's king is poorly placed (opposite the white king) . If this type of position arises, it is usually because of inferior defense. Nevertheless, it is tricky to win .

He first served in Russia, but spent most of his episcopate in Japan (1908 - 1945) in the Russian Orthodox Christian mission and in the Japanese Orthodox Church.  Early life in Russia  He was born on June 16, 1871 as Alexiy in a village of Guzi near Novgorod, Russia, in the family of a rural priest Tikhomirov. He studied well, entered in the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and graduated in 1896. In 1895 Alexiy took the monastic vows with the name Sergius. Later he taught theology at the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary, and in 1899 became the prefect of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy, in the rank of archimandrite. In 1905 he was raised to episcopacy and was consecrated Bishop of Jamburg, vicar to the Archbishop of St. Petersburg, at the age of 35 years. Throughout his tenure at the Academy he was a prolific preacher as well as an author of a number of works on the Church history of his native Novgorod region.  His life in Japan  In 1908 bishop Sergius was sent to Japan, to become a successor to archbishop Nicholas (Kasatkin).–¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø–æ–¥–≤–æ—Ä—å–µ –≤ –Ø–ø–æ–Ω–∏–∏, Orthodox Magazine, in Russian, April 2005 Having acquainted himself with Japan and quickly mastered the language, Sergius showed himself a committed spokesmen for the Orthodox Christian faithful of Japan's recent acquisitions in Southern Sakhalin (Japan had acquired Southern Sakhalin, or Karafuto in Japanese, as a result of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905); and he secured the return of confiscated Church property to the faithful. In 1912 archbishop Nicolas reposed, and Sergius took over as ruling bishop of the Japanese Orthodox mission. Some five years later he had to face the difficulties caused to the mission by the Russian Revolution of 1917: having no aid from an established church in Russia meant the loss of almost the entire budget of the mission, which had to cut back its activities but survived. In 1923 the Great Kant≈ç earthquake destroyed the headquarters of the Japanese Orthodox Church, severely damaging the Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral. Raising funds for its restoration became a central activity of bishop Sergius and the Japanese faithful for the next years, and they succeeded in independently raising a vast sum and restoring the cathedral by 1929. In 1931 the then archbishop Sergius was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan bishop by the Moscow Patriarchate. However, the 1930s saw the rise of militarism and nationalism amongst the Japanese, many of whom became prejudiced against Christianity and all things foreign. In 1940 Sergius was ousted from his position at the head of the Japanese Orthodox Church, so that the Church might comply with the Japanese government's demand for all ruling clergy in Japanese religious organizations to be native. Sergius spent the wartime years in obscurity, and in 1945 he was arrested by the Japanese special police on suspicion of being a Soviet Russian spy. By the time of his release his health was terminally undercut, and he died on August 10, 1945, five days before the end of World War II. His remains rest beside those of St. Nicolas of Japan, in the Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo.

At , he is the tallest player in Major League Baseball history. He is also an Olympic Gold Medalist in baseball. Early years Rauch attended and graduated from Oldham County High School. He grew up in Westport, Kentucky. Rauch played college baseball at Morehead State University, where he double majored in physics and business. He was also a member of the social fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kentucky Zeta Chapter. Professional career =Chicago White Sox= Rauch, weighing 290 pounds, was drafted in the third round of the 1999 amateur draft by the Chicago White Sox. He debuted with the White Sox on April 2, . In 2002, Rauch's first stint in the big leagues resulted in a 6.59 ERA in eight games and six starts. He did not play in the majors in , then returned to the majors in after a strong Triple-A campaign. However, against major league batters he again posted a high ERA of 6.23. In July 2004, Rauch was traded to the Montr√©al Expos along with Triple-A reliever Gary Majewski for Carl Everett. =Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals= On August 13, 2004, Rauch hit a home run against the Houston Astros off Roger Clemens, making him the tallest man ever to hit a home run in Major League Baseball. Despite a strong finish to the season in Montr√©al, Rauch was sent to the minors when the Expos moved to Washington. After putting up better numbers in the minors, Rauch finished the season with the Nationals, used mostly as a reliever, and going 2-4 with a 3.60 ERA. In , Rauch had his best season, posted a 4-5 record, a 3.35 ERA, and appearing in 85 games, second most in the NL. In , Rauch led the Major Leagues in appearances with 88. He finished the year with an 8-4 record, four saves, and a 3.61 ERA. His eight victories led the team in wins, a rarity in baseball for a relief pitcher. On February 2, , Rauch signed a two-year contract with the Nationals, worth a total of $3.2 million. Before being traded, Rauch spent most of the year as the closer in place of injured Chad Cordero. Rauch won the first game in the history of Nationals Park. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On July 22, 2008, Rauch was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for second base prospect Emilio Bonifacio. =Minnesota Twins= On August 28, 2009, Rauch was traded to the Minnesota Twins for RHP Kevin Mulvey. He appeared in 17 games for the Twins before the end of the season, posting a 5-1 record with a 1.72 ERA. On April 2, 2010, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire named Rauch the team's closer, replacing the injured Joe Nathan. On April 6, 2010 Rauch earned his first save as a Twin with a perfect ninth with two strikeouts versus the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a 5-3 win. Rauch served as the team's closer through August, when the Twins acquired Matt Capps. During his time as closer, he saved 21 games in 25 opportunities. After the Twins acquired Capps, Rauch returned to his previous role as a set-up man and long reliever. =Toronto Blue Jays= On January 17, 2011 the Blue Jays signed Rauch to a one-year deal worth $3.5M that included a club option for $3.75M in 2012. Blue Jays manager John Farrell suffered a dislocated jaw while attempting to restrain Rauch from going after umpire Alfonso Marquez during a game on July 2, 2011. Both Rauch and Farrell were ejected from the game. After pitching in a game against the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2011, Rauch was taken to a Seattle hospital for an emergency appendectomy. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 16, 2011. At the time of injury, Rauch led the Blue Jays in appearances (with 51), posting a 5-4 record with a 4.47 earned run average and 11 saves. =New York Mets= Rauch with the New York Mets On December 6, 2011, Rauch agreed to a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the New York Mets. On May 1st, 2012, Rauch faced Houston Astros 2nd baseman Jos√© Altuve. The 18-inch (460mm) height difference is believed to be the biggest between pitcher and batter with exception of a 1951 publicity stunt in which a 3-foot-7-inch (1.09m) Eddie Gaedel had one plate appearance for the St. Louis Browns. =Miami Marlins= On February 5, 2013, Rauch agreed to a one-year deal with the Miami Marlins. Rauch was designated for assignment on May 18. At the time of his designation, Rauch had a 1‚Äì2 record with an earned run average of 7.56. He was released on May 23, 2013. =Baltimore Orioles= On June 1, 2013, it was announced that the Orioles had signed Rauch to a minor league contract. On July 3, Rauch opted out of his minor league contract. He went 1-0 with a 2.89 ERA in 10 appearances over 9.1 innings, striking out 10. =Kansas City Royals= On January 23, 2014, Rauch signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals with an invitation to Spring training. He was released on March 28. Rauch retired following the 2014 season.

Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the case had become moot and so declined to render a decision on the merits.. American student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law in the state of Washington before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to graduate within a few months of the decision being rendered.Karabel, Jerome. The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Boston: Mifflin, 2005. The Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the plaintiff. The case did not constitute \\"voluntary cessation\\" on the part of the defendant law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was \\"capable of repetition, yet evading review\\" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review. DeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's affirmative action policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in DeFunis, the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.  Background  In 1970, Marco DeFunis, a white man, applied for entry to the law program at the University of Washington. He was denied even though the year in question would be his final year. DeFunis, believing he had been rejected because of affirmative action, thought the school had taken applicants who were approved because of not their accomplishments but their race. He took his case to court and stated that of affirmative action violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Lower courts  The case was first heard in the Superior Court of Washington, in which the University of Washington moved to have the case dismissed on the grounds that relief could not be granted. The court rejected the proposed dismissal and filed an injunction that forced the school to admit DeFunis. The university argued that it used a complex formula to predict applicants' success, the Predicted First- Year Average (PFYA), but it was not the only thing taken into account during the application process. Applicants with higher PFYA scores were reviewed and were presented by a committee member before the whole committee. The committee member who represented a student was usually up to chance but not in the case of African American and other minority students. Their files were reviewed by three specific board members: Professor Geoffrey Crooks (director of the school's Council on Legal Education Opportunities program), Vincent Hayes (a second-year black law student), and Associate Dean Robert S. Hunt (the sole evaluator of the files of minorities other than African Americans). The court found that in reviewing the files of minority applicants, the committee attached less weight to the PFYA in making a total judgmental evaluation as to the relative ability of the particular applicant to succeed in law school. Also, the chairman testified that although the same standard was applied to all applicants (the relative probability of the individual succeeding in law school), minority applicants were directly compared to one another, but they were not compared to applicants outside of the minority group. As a result, the committee admitted a group of minority applicants, placed a group of such applicants on a waiting list, and rejected other minority applications. The dean of the law school testified that the law school has no fixed admissions quota for minority students but that the committee sought a reasonable representation of such groups in the law school. He added that the it has accepted no unqualified minority applicants but only those whose records indicated that they were capable of successfully completing the law school program. Because of the judgmental factors in the admissions process, as outlined, the ultimate determination of applicants to whom admission was offered did not follow exactly the relative ranking of PFYAs. Of those invited, 74 had lower PFYAs than plaintiff; 36 of them were minority applicants, 22 were returning from military service, and 16 were applicants judged by the committee as deserving invitations on the basis of other information contained in their files. There were 29 applicants with higher PFYAs than plaintiff's were denied admission. Of the 36 minority group students invited 18 actually enrolled in the first-year class. The law faculty was, as the court observes, motivated by a laudable purpose: to increase the number of minority students studying law and with the avowed purpose of equalizing opportunities among applicants who come from the lower income and economic groups with those who come from the higher. That policy of ethnic minority selection apparently was not to apply to faculty positions, as the record does not show that any qualified white applicant for the teaching staff was refused or that any faculty member ousted to make room for law teachers with questionable credentials from a minority ethnic group.DeFunis v. Odegaard, 82 Wash. 2d 11, The court's reflected heavily on the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education when it began ruling and so the injunction was filed. The Supreme Court of Washington had strong opinions on the case, with Justice Hale going as far to say, \\"Preferential treatment under the guise of 'affirmative action' is the imposition of one form of racial discrimination in place of another. The questions that must be asked in this regard are: must an individual sacrifice his right to be judged on his own merit by accepting discrimination based solely on the color of his skin? How can we achieve the goal of equal opportunity for all if, in the process, we deny equal opportunity to some?\\" Justice Hunter concurred \\"The majority supports a laudable purpose ‚Äî to enable students of certain minority races to enter the University of Washington School of Law in order that ultimately there will be a greater representation of practicing lawyers of those races in the legal profession ‚Äî with which purpose I do not disagree. This must not be accomplished, however, by clear and willful discrimination against students of other races as the Admissions Committee of the University of Washington School of Law has done in this case by denying admission to the respondent, Marco DeFunis, Jr, to this school, as found by the trial court and amply supported by the record.\\"  Supreme Court  When the case reached the Supreme Court, DeFunis was already in his final year of law school. The court ruled it moot since neither party had anything to gain from the court's ruling.

The Main North Line between Picton and Christchurch and the Main South Line between Lyttelton and Invercargill, running down the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, are sometimes together referred-to collectively as the South Island Main Trunk Railway (SIMT). Construction of a line running the length of the east coast began in the 1860s and was completed all the way from Picton to Invercargill in 1945; the last sections being on the Main North Line south of Picton. But the designation \\"South Island Main Trunk\\" originally referred to only that line between Christchurch and Invercargill.  Construction  Addington Junction, where the Main North Line meets the Main South Line in Christchurch = Main South Line = Construction of the Main South Line began in 1865 when the Canterbury Provincial Railways began work on a broad gauge line south from Christchurch. It reached Rolleston on 13 October 1866 and Selwyn a year later. A number of routes south were considered, and the one chosen was a compromise between a proposal to build a coastal line through fertile territory and a proposal to build an inland line to achieve easier crossings of rivers such as the Rakaia. However, construction had to be postponed as the Canterbury Province government was low on funds, and it did not restart until Julius Vogel announced the central government's \\"Great Public Works Policy\\". The \\"Great Public Works Policy\\" placed a high priority on the completion of the Main South Line. At this time, New Zealand accepted narrow gauge as its national rail gauge, but Canterbury was permitted to extent its broad gauge as far as Rakaia - although it did so on 2 June 1873, it converted its entire network to narrow gauge by 6 March 1876. Further south, the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway was opened on 1 January 1873 as the first railway in the country to adhere to the new national gauge. Although the final portion of this line became the Port Chalmers Branch, most of it was incorporated into the main line northwards and construction progressed through difficult terrain towards Oamaru. South of Dunedin, work was progressing on a link with Invercargill; a line between Invercargill and Gore was opened on 30 August 1875 and a line between Dunedin and Balclutha was opened two days later. Construction to link these sections faced more construction challenges than the earlier work had, and accordingly, the rate of progress slowed. Over the next three years, the line between Dunedin and Christchurch was completed; Christchurch and Timaru were linked on 4 February 1876, followed by Oamaru on a year later, and the difficult section between Oamaru and Dunedin was finally completed on 7 September 1878. All that remained was the Balclutha-Gore link, which was opened on 22 January 1879, completing the Main South Line. = Main North Line = Construction of the Main North Line was one of the longest construction projects in New Zealand's history. Through the 1870s, work on a line from Christchurch to northern centres in Canterbury was undertaken, with a line through Kaiapoi, Rangiora, and Amberley reaching Waipara in 1880, and at the other end, a line linking Blenheim and Picton opened in 1875. Further construction was delayed by disputes over proposed routes. Different regions sought to protect their interests by having the line constructed through their area. Some preferred the coastal route via Parnassus and Kaikoura, while others favoured an inland route to Blenheim with a branch from Tophouse to Nelson. There was also a proposal to use the latter route as the trans-Alpine line (as the Midland Line's route was yet to be chosen), linking Waipara with Reefton and then connecting to Nelson and possibly Blenheim via a line up the Buller Gorge. The people of Marlborough favoured a coastal route and began work south, while in Canterbury, work initially began on an inland route, with Waipara linked to Culverden in 1886. Although the line to Culverden was treated as the main line for decades, it eventually became part of the Waiau Branch. At the start of the 20th century, work began on a coastal route northwards from Waipara, with the line opened to Parnassus in 1912. Construction then proceeded up the Leader River valley as part of a somewhat inland route to Kaikoura via river valleys, but the start of World War I brought a halt to construction and the 3 km of track laid beyond Parnassus was removed. The war also brought a halt to work at the northern end, with the coastal village of Wharanui established as the terminus of the line south from Blenheim. The 1920s saw much indecisiveness and disputes over what route to take between Waipara and Wharanui. The Culverden line now ran all the way as Waiau and some work took place on a line to link Waiau with Kaikoura, but after a few kilometres of formation was made, work came to a halt. The coastal route was then chosen and work had only just restarted when the Great Depression began and brought about more severe delays. Fortunes improved in 1936 sufficiently to allow a resumption of progress, and a more coastal route out of Parnassus than the Leader Valley route was chosen. World War II brought even more delays, but this time, construction progressed through wartime and the Main North Line was finally completed when the northern and southern ends met at Kaikoura on 15 December 1945.  Operation  The Picton-bound TranzCoastal departing Christchurch The South Island Main Trunk has been famous for its passenger services. In the days of steam locomotives, the South Island Limited expresses were particularly famous; drivers of J and JA class locomotives claimed to have broken the official New Zealand railway speed record on a section of track near Rakaia called the \\"racetrack\\". The Main South Line saw the last regularly steam-hauled expresses in New Zealand, with JA locomotives hauling the Friday and Sunday night expresses until 26 October 1971. All other steam-hauled expresses were replaced on 1 December 1970 by the Southerner, which was hauled by DJ class diesel-electric locomotives. This service was one of the most famous in New Zealand, but it ceased on 10 February 2002. For many years, RM (Fiat) railcars ran services on the Main North Line, but they were withdrawn during the 1970s. On 25 September 1988 the tourist-focused Coastal Pacific express began operating along the scenic route between Christchurch and Picton; it continues to operate as the TranzCoastal. In the summer of 1994‚Äì95, this service was augmented by the Lynx Express, which was unsuccessful and not repeated in later years. Commuter services used to operate around major centres along the South Island Main Trunk, and many rural services also operated when country branch lines were operational, but the branch lines progressively closed during the 20th century and commuter services in the South Island ceased in the 1980s. Nowadays, the only Tranz Scenic passenger services on the South Island Main Trunk are the TranzCoastal and the TranzAlpine, which uses the short portion of the Main South Line between Christchurch and Rolleston before running along the Midland Line to Greymouth. Freight services on both lines operated for many years as feeder services from rural districts to nearby major centres and harbours, rather than utilising long-distance services between the important cities. The first through freight from Christchurch to Invercargill did not operate until December 1970. During the 1970s and 1980s, patterns of freight haulage changed dramatically, with the last of the branch lines closing and an emphasis placed upon long-distance haulage. The South Island Main Trunk is now used to carry significant quantities of long-distance freight, and it connects with the North Island via roll-on roll-off ferries between Picton and Wellington. These ferries have allowed freight trains to be operated from Auckland to Christchurch on a 30-hour schedule.

The A-10 also provides access to popular winter resorts at Bromont, Owl's Head, Mont Sutton and Mont Orford. Motorists travelling on the A-10 can see eight of nine Monteregian Hills: Mount Royal, Mont Saint-Bruno, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Gr√©goire, Mont Rougemont, Mont Yamaska, Mont Shefford and Mont Brome. (The ninth, Mont M√©gantic is located beyond the eastern terminus of the autoroute. Description The A-10 carries the name Autoroute Bonaventure (Bonaventure Expressway) from its start in Montreal's city centre to the Champlain Bridge. From there until its terminus in Sherbrooke, the A-10 is called the Autoroute des Cantons-de-l'Est (Eastern Townships Expressway), a reference to the historic name given to the region east of Montreal and north of the U.S. border. The road's main material is asphalt concrete, many parts of the highway are bordered with gravel. =Autoroute Bonaventure= The A-10 begins in Downtown Montreal as an extension of University Street near Place Bonaventure. Two underground ramps provide an interchange with the A-720. At km 1, the A-10 crosses the Lachine Canal, then travels along the St. Lawrence River to an interchange with the A-15 and A-20. This interchange is partially on the Island of Montreal and partially on Nuns' Island. At km 2, it crosses (but does not provide access to) Route 112 at the north end of Victoria Bridge. The A-10 has three lanes in each direction on the majority of its length and the speed limit is 70 km/h. The A-10 is multiplexed with the A-15 and A-20 across the Champlain Bridge. All three autoroutes diverge soon after reaching the southern edge of the bridge. The A-10 serves as an important link for commuters travelling to downtown Montreal from suburban South Shore communities via the Champlain Bridge. It also provides access to the Montreal Technoparc and the Concordia Bridge. The A-10 in Montreal is jointly owned by the city of Montreal, the Soci√©t√© Les Ponts Jacques Cartier, and Federal Bridge Corporation (an agency of the Government of Canada). =Autoroute des Cantons de l'Est= At km 8, the A-10 crosses Taschereau Boulevard. Bus lanes run in both directions along the median for four kilometers between the southern end of the Champlain Bridge and Milan Boulevard. Crossing Brossard, the A-10 runs along the northern edge of the Quartier DIX30 shopping complex before reaching interchanges with the A-30 at km 11 and the A-35 at km 22. The A-10 crosses the Richelieu River at km 28 and enters a rich agricultural region. Between Bromont (km 74) and Magog (km 121) the A-10 passes through a mountainous region, close to two of Quebec's major ski centres (Mont Orford and Mont Brome). Near the northern end of Lake Memphremagog, the A-10 reaches an interchange with the A-55 at km 121. The A-10 continues east as a concurrency with A-55. Between km 123 and 128, Route 112 functions as a frontage road. A-10 and A-55 bypass the city of Sherbrooke to the east and north, reaching interchanges with spur routes A-410 at km 140 and A-610 at km 143. The A-10 reaches its terminus at the junction with A-610, while A-55 continues north to Drummondville. The portion east of Autoroute 55 (linking that autoroute with Route 112) was renumbered as Autoroute 610 on September 29, 2006. History The long Autoroute de l'Est (Eastern Expressway) was opened to traffic in December 1964. Extending from the southern end of the Champlain Bridge to Magog, the highway replaced the old Quebec Route 1 (now Route 112) as the main road link between the two points. An official opening for the highway came one year later, in 1965. The A-10 was the second autoroute, after the Laurentian Autoroute outside Montreal, to be commissioned. Both were opened as toll highways by a Quebec government agency. The A-10 featured five toll stations (at current km 22, km 37, km 68, km 90, and km 115). Motorists were charged $1.50 to make the entire trip. The Autoroute Bonaventure through Montreal opened in 1967 to link approach roads to Expo 67 with the Champlain Bridge. The Autoroute des Cantons de l'Est was the first autoroute in Quebec to use exit numbers based on distance instead of in sequential order, as had previously been the case. As Canada had not yet adopted the metric system, exit numbers referenced the distance in miles from the southern end of the Champlain Bridge. The A-10 did not originally have a route number. Instead, route marker signs featured a red triangular shield featuring the name of the route. Unusually, the directional signs were also originally red. Later, blue shields and signs replaced the red versions. In 1985, the toll system was abolished, and the use of the triangular shields was discontinued. Blue directional signs have gradually been converted to standard green signs used elsewhere in North America. In 2013, motorists could still see blue signs at entrances to and exits of the autoroute. Between 1988 and 2006, A-10 departed its multiplex with A-55 at km 143 and continued eastward for 11 km to a final terminus with Route 112. In October 2006, that section of A-10 was renumbered as A-610. Future Under a project started in 2016, the Autoroute Bonaventure was completely reconfigured by 2018. The Soci√©t√© du Havre de Montr√©al (SHM) is transforming the autoroute into an urban thoroughfare as part of a broader project to redevelop Montreal's harbourfront. The city of Montreal announced in January 2013 that it would take over the SHM's responsibilities, citing concerns over transparency.Christopher Curtis, \\"City to run Bonaventure project; Societe du havre stripped of its duty,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 January 2013, A7.

Sheffield was a centre of blade production since the 14th century. By 1600, Sheffield became the biggest producer of cutlery outside of London. Technological improvements, such as the crucible steel process after 1740, led to rapid industrial growth with significant urban growth occurring during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893. Sheffield remained a major industrial city until the early 1970s. The economic downturn following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks. Urban and economic regeneration schemes began in the late 1980s to diversify the city's economy. Sheffield is now a centre for banking and insurance functions with HSBC, Santander and Aviva having regional offices in the city. The city has also attracted digital start-ups, with 25,000 now employed in the digital sector. Early history Carl Wark, an Iron Age hill fort in southwest Sheffield. The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at Creswell Crags to the east of the city. Artefacts and rock art found in caves at this site have been dated by archaeologists to the late Upper Palaeolithic period, at least 12,800 years ago. Other prehistoric remains found in Sheffield include a Mesolithic \\"house\\"‚Äîa circle of stones in the shape of a hut-base dating to around 8000 BC, found at Deepcar, in the northern part of the city. This has been ascribed to the Maglemosian culture.().Sources:  * The site's culture has similarities to Star Carr in North Yorkshire, but gives its name to unique \\"Deepcar type assemblages\\"https://library.thehumanjourney.net/2597/169/Solent- Thames_chap-5_Late%20Upper%20Palaeolithic_Mesolithic_assess.pdf of microliths in the archaeology literature. A cup and ring-marked stone was discovered in Ecclesall Woods in 1981, and has been dated to the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It, and an area around it of 2 m diameter, is a scheduled ancient monument. During the Bronze Age (about 1500 BC) tribes sometimes called the Urn people started to settle in the area. They built numerous stone circles, examples of which can be found on Ash Cabin Flat, Froggatt Edge and Hordron Edge (Hordron Edge stone circle). Two Early Bronze Age urns were found at Crookes in 1887, and three Middle Bronze Age barrows found at Lodge Moor (both suburbs of the modern city). = Iron Age = During the British Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who in around 500 BC are thought to have constructed the hill fort that stands on the summit of a steep hill above the River Don at Wincobank, in what is now northeastern Sheffield. Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are Carl Wark on Hathersage Moor to the southwest of Sheffield, and one at Scholes Wood, near Rotherham. The rivers Sheaf and Don may have formed the boundary between the territory of the Brigantes and that of a rival tribe called the Corieltauvi who inhabited a large area of the northeastern Midlands. = Roman Britain = The Roman invasion of Britain began in AD 43. By 51 the Brigantes had submitted to the clientship of Rome, eventually being placed under direct rule in the early 70s. Few Roman remains have been found in the Sheffield area. A minor Roman road linking the Roman forts at Templeborough and Brough-on-Noe possibly ran through the centre of the area covered by the modern city, and Icknield Street is thought to have skirted its boundaries. The routes of these roads within this area are mostly unknown, although sections of the former were thought, by Hunter and Leader,Leader, R.E. (1906). The Highways and Byways of Old Sheffield. A lecture delivered before the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society (transcription) be visible between Redmires and Stanage on an ancient road known as the Long Causeway. In recent years some scholars have cast doubt on this, with an initial survey of Barber Fields, Ringinglow, suggesting the Roman Road took a route over Burbage Edge. Peak District.Gov Gives history, route and use. The remains of a Roman road, possibly linked to the latter, were discovered in Brinsworth in 1949. In April 1761, tablets or diplomas dating from the Roman period were found in the Rivelin Valley south of Stannington, close to the likely course of the Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe road. These tablets included a grant of citizenship and land or money to a retiring Roman auxiliary of the Sunuci tribe of Belgium. To . . . . . . . . the son of Albanus, of the tribe of the Sunuci, late a foot soldier in the first cohort of the Sunuci commanded by M. Junius Claudianus. In addition there have been finds dating from the Roman period on Walkley Bank Road, which leads onto the valley bottom. There have been small finds of Roman coins throughout the Sheffield area, for example 30 to 40 Roman coins were found near the Old Great Dam at Crookesmoor, 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins were found at a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along with the name of the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation that there may have been a Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield. Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area is evidenced by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield‚Äîthe word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons. The origins of Sheffield The 9th-century Sheffield Cross. The name Sheffield is Old English in origin. It derives from the River Sheaf, whose name is a corruption of shed or sheth, meaning to divide or separate. Field is a generic suffix deriving from the Old English feld, meaning a forest clearing. It is likely then that the origin of the present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo- Saxon settlement in a clearing beside the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don founded between the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in this region (roughly the 6th century) and the early 9th century. The names of many of the other areas of Sheffield likely to have been established as settlements during this period end in ley, which signifies a clearing in the forest, or ton, which means an enclosed farmstead. These settlements include Heeley, Longley, Norton, Owlerton, Southey, Tinsley, Totley, Wadsley, and Walkley. A monument in Dore commemorating King Egbert's victory. The earliest evidence of this settlement is thought to be the shaft of a stone cross dating from the early 9th century that was found in Sheffield in the early 19th century. This shaft may be part of a cross removed from the church yard of the Sheffield parish church (now Sheffield Cathedral) in 1570., but also see It is now kept in the British Museum. A document from around the same time, an entry for the year 829 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, refers to the submission of King Eanred of Northumbria to King Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield): \\"Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home\\". This event made Egbert the first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England. The latter part of the 9th century saw a wave of Norse (Viking) settlers and the subsequent establishment of the Danelaw. The names of hamlets established by these settlers often end in thorpe, which means a farmstead. Examples of such settlements in the Sheffield area are Grimesthorpe, Hackenthorpe, Jordanthorpe, Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe, Waterthorpe, and Woodthorpe. By 918 the Danes south of the Humber had submitted to Edward the Elder, and by 926 Northumbria was under the control of King √Üthelstan. In 937 the combined armies of Olaf Guthfrithson, Viking king of Dublin, Constantine, king of Scotland and Owain ap Dyfnwal, king of the Cumbrians, invaded England. The invading force was met and defeated by an army from Wessex and Mercia led by King √Üthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh. The location of Brunanburh is unknown, but some historians have suggested a location between Tinsley in Sheffield and Brinsworth in Rotherham, on the slopes of White Hill. After the death of King Athelstan in 939 Olaf Guthfrithson invaded again and took control of Northumbria and part of Mercia. Subsequently, the Anglo-Saxons, under Edmund, re-conquered the Midlands, as far as Dore, in 942, and captured Northumbria in 944. The Domesday Book of 1086, which was compiled following the Norman Conquest of 1066, contains the earliest known reference to the districts around Sheffield as the manor of \\"Hallun\\" (or Hallam). This manor retained its Saxon lord, Waltheof, for some years after the conquest. The Domesday Book was ordered written by William the Conqueror so that the value of the townships and manors of England could be assessed. The entries in the Domesday Book are written in a Latin shorthand; the extract for this area begins: :TERRA ROGERII DE BVSLI :M. hi Hallvn, cu XVI bereuvitis sunt. XXIX. carucate trae :Ad gld. Ibi hb Walleff com aula... Translated it reads: :LANDS OF ROGER DE BUSLI The remains of Beauchief Abbey. :In Hallam, one manor with its sixteen hamlets, there are twenty-nine carucates [~14 km2] to be taxed. There Earl Waltheof had an \\"Aula\\" [hall or court]. There may have been about twenty ploughs. This land Roger de Busli holds of the Countess Judith. He has himself there two carucates [~1 km2] and thirty-three villeins hold twelve carucates and a half [~6 km2]. There are eight acres [32,000 m2] of meadow, and a pasturable wood, four leuvae in length and four in breadth [~10 km2]. The whole manor is ten leuvae in length and eight broad [207 km2]. In the time of Edward the Confessor it was valued at eight marks of silver [¬£5.33]; now at forty shillings [¬£2.00]. :In Attercliffe and Sheffield, two manors, Sweyn had five carucates of land [~2.4 km2] to be taxed. There may have been about three ploughs. This land is said to have been inland, demesne [domain] land of the manor of Hallam. The reference is to Roger de Busli, tenant-in-chief in Domesday and one of the greatest of the new wave of Norman magnates. Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria had been executed in 1076 for his part in an uprising against William I. He was the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls still remaining in England a full decade after the Norman conquest. His lands had passed to his wife, Judith of Normandy, niece to William the Conqueror. The lands were held on her behalf by Roger de Busli. The Domesday Book refers to Sheffield twice, first as Escafeld, then later as Scafeld. Sheffield historian S. O. Addy suggests that the second form, pronounced Shaffeld, is the truer form, as the spelling Sefeld is found in a deed issued less than one hundred years after the completion of the survey. Addy comments that the E in the first form may have been mistakenly added by the Norman scribe. Roger de Busli died around the end of the 11th century, and was succeeded by a son, who died without an heir. The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de Lovetot, the grandson of a Norman baron who had come over to England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield at the start of the 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the town. Also dating from this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that it was founded in 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, who was one of the witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.  Medieval Sheffield  Following the death of William de Lovetot, the manor of Hallamshire passed to his son Richard de Lovetot and then his son William de Lovetot before being passed by marriage to Gerard de Furnival in about 1204. The de Furnivals held the manor for the next 180 years. The fourth Furnival lord, Thomas de Furnival, supported Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War. As a result of this, in 1266 a party of barons, led by John de Eyvill, marching from north Lincolnshire to Derbyshire passed through Sheffield and destroyed the town, burning the church and castle. A new stone castle was constructed over the next four years and a new church was consecrated by William de Wickwane the Archbishop of York around 1280. In 1295 Thomas de Furnival's son (also Thomas) was the first lord of Hallamshire to be called to Parliament, thus taking the title Lord Furnivall. On 12 November 1296 Edward I granted a charter for a market to be held in Sheffield on Tuesday each week. This was followed on 10 August 1297 by a charter from Lord Furnival establishing Sheffield as a free borough.Charter to the Town of Sheffield, 10 August 1297 The Sheffield Town Trust was established in the Charter to the Town of Sheffield, granted in 1297. De Furnival, granted land to the freeholders of Sheffield in return for an annual payment, and a Common Burgery administrated them. The Burgery originally consisted of public meetings of all the freeholders, who elected a Town Collector. Two more generations of Furnivals held Sheffield before it passed by marriage to Sir Thomas Nevil and then, in 1406, to John Talbot, the first Earl of Shrewsbury. Bishops' House. In 1430 the 1280 Sheffield parish church building was pulled down and replaced. Parts of this new church still stand today and it is now Sheffield city centre's oldest surviving building, forming the core of Sheffield Cathedral. Other notable surviving buildings from this period include the Old Queen's Head pub in Pond Hill, which dates from around 1480, with its timber frame still intact, and Bishops' House and Broom Hall, both built around 1500. The fourth Earl of Shrewsbury, George Talbot took up residence in Sheffield, building the Manor Lodge outside the town in about 1510 and adding a chapel to the Parish Church c1520 to hold the family vault. Memorials to the fourth and sixth Earls of Shrewsbury can still be seen in the church. In 1569 George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, was given charge of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary was regarded as a threat by Elizabeth I, and had been held captive since her arrival in England in 1568. Talbot brought Mary to Sheffield in 1570, and she spent most of the next 14 years imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and its dependent buildings. The castle park extended beyond the present Manor Lane, where the remains of Manor Lodge are to be found. Beside them is the Turret House, an Elizabethan building, which may have been built to accommodate the captive queen. A room, believed to have been the queen's, has an elaborate plaster ceiling and overmantel, with heraldic decorations. During the English Civil War, Sheffield changed hands several times, finally falling to the Parliamentarians, who demolished the Castle in 1648. The Industrial Revolution brought large-scale steel making to Sheffield in the 18th century. Much of the medieval town was gradually replaced by a mix of Georgian and Victorian buildings. Large areas of Sheffield's city centre have been rebuilt in recent years, but among the modern buildings, some old buildings have been retained.  Industrial Sheffield  Sheffield viewed from Attercliffe Road, c. 1819. Sheffield's developed after the industrial revolution because of its geography. Fast-flowing rivers, such as the Sheaf, the Don and the Loxley, made it an ideal location for water-powered industries to develop. Raw materials, like coal, iron ore, ganister and millstone grit for grindstones, found in the nearby hills, were used in cutlery and blade production. As early as the 14th century, Sheffield was noted for the production of knives: By 1600 Sheffield was the main centre of cutlery production in England outside London, and in 1624 The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire was formed to oversee the trade. Examples of water-powered blade and cutlery workshops from around this time can be seen at the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and Shepherd Wheel museums in Sheffield. Around a century later, Daniel Defoe in his book A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, wrote: The Shepherd Wheel is an example of the water-powered grinding workshops that used to be commonplace in the Sheffield area. In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock maker in Handsworth, invented a form of the crucible steel process for making a better quality of steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762‚Äì65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town. A map of Sheffield in 1823. Huntsman's process was only made obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued until well into the 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails.Barraclough KC, Steel before Bessemer 2 volumes London 1984 Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of ¬£20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum. Stainless steel was discovered by Harry Brearley in 1912, at the Brown Firth Laboratories in Sheffield. His successor as manager at Brown Firth, Dr William Hatfield, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 stainless steel', which to this day is probably the most common alloy of this type. Sheffield's population, 1700‚Äì2011. These innovations helped Sheffield to gain a worldwide recognition for the production of cutlery; utensils such as the bowie knife were mass-produced and shipped to the United States. The population of the town increased rapidly. In 1736 Sheffield and its surrounding hamlets held about 7000 people, in 1801 there were 60,000, and by 1901, the population had grown to 451,195.United Kingdom Census data. See, This growth spurred the reorganisation of the governance of the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility for the improvement of streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds and struggled even to maintain existing infrastructure. The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light and clean the city's streets. The proposal was defeated. The idea of a Commission was revived in 1810, and later in the decade Sheffield finally followed the model adopted by several other towns in petitioning for an Act to establish an Improvement Commission. This eventually led to the Sheffield Improvement Act 1818, which established the Commission and included several other provisions. In 1832 the town gained political representation with the formation of a Parliamentary borough. A municipal borough was formed by an Act of Incorporation in 1843, and this borough was granted the style and title of \\"City\\" by letters patent in 1893. A photograph of the Dale Dyke reservoir embankment, shortly after its collapse in March 1864. From the mid-18th century, a succession of public buildings were erected in the town. St Paul's Church, now demolished, was among the first, while the old Town Hall and the present Cutlers' Hall were among the major works of the 19th century. The town's water supply was improved by the Sheffield Waterworks Company, who built reservoirs around the town. Parts of Sheffield were devastated when, following a five-year construction project, the Dale Dyke dam collapsed on Friday 11 March 1864, resulting in the Great Sheffield Flood. Sheffield's transport infrastructure was also improved. In the 18th century turnpike roads were built connecting Sheffield with Barnsley, Buxton, Chesterfield, Glossop, Intake, Penistone, Tickhill, and Worksop. In 1774 a wooden tramway was laid at the Duke of Norfolk's Nunnery Colliery. The tramway was destroyed by rioters, who saw it as part of a plan to raise the price of coal. A replacement tramway that used L-shaped rails was laid by John Curr in 1776 and was one of the earliest cast-iron railways. The Sheffield Canal opened in 1819 allowing the large-scale transport of freight. This was followed by the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway in 1838, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway in 1845, and the Midland Railway in 1870. The Sheffield Tramway was started in 1873 with the construction of a horse tram route from Lady's Bridge to Attercliffe. This route was later extended to Brightside and Tinsley, and further routes were constructed to Hillsborough, Heeley, and Nether Edge. Due to the narrow medieval roads the tramways were initially banned from the town centre. An improvement scheme was passed in 1875; Pinstone Street and Leopold Street were constructed by 1879, and Fargate was widened in the 1880s. The 1875 plan also called for the widening of the High Street; disputes with property owners delayed this until 1895. Steel production in the 19th century involved long working hours, in unpleasant conditions that offered little or no safety protection. Friedrich Engels in his The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 described the conditions prevalent in the city at that time: Sheffield became one of the main centres for trade union organisation and agitation in the UK. By the 1860s, the growing conflict between capital and labour provoked the so-called 'Sheffield Outrages', which culminated in a series of explosions and murders carried out by union militants. The Sheffield Trades Council organised a meeting in Sheffield in 1866 at which the United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades‚Äîa forerunner of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)‚Äîwas founded.  The 20th century to the present  Sheffield Winter Gardens 2005 In 1914 Sheffield became a diocese of the Church of England, and the parish church became a cathedral. During the First World War the Sheffield City Battalion suffered heavy losses at the Somme and Sheffield itself was bombed by a German zeppelin. The recession of the 1930s was only halted by the increasing tension as the Second World War loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, but it was the heavy bombing over the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the Sheffield Blitz) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed. Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s saw many large scale developments in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and a new system of roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time many of the old slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate. Contemporary Sheffield, Church street. Sheffield's traditional manufacturing industries (along with those of many other areas in the UK), declined during the 20th century. In the 1980s, it was the setting for two films written by locally-born Barry Hines: Looks and Smiles, a 1981 film that portrayed the depression that the city was enduring, and Threads, a 1984 television film that simulated a nuclear winter in Sheffield after a warhead is dropped to the east of the city. The building of the Meadowhall shopping centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started by the hosting of the 1991 World Student Games and the associated building of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex. Sheffield began construction of a tram system in 1992, with the first section opening in 1994. Starting in 1995, the Heart of the City Project has seen public works in the city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Gallery opened in April 2001, and a 1970s town hall extension was demolished in 2002 to make way for the Winter Garden, which opened on 22 May 2003. A series of other projects grouped under the title Sheffield One aim to regenerate the whole of the city centre. On 25 June 2007, flooding caused millions of pounds worth of damage to buildings in the city and led to the loss of two lives. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been felled as part of a scheme to maintain the city streets. However, there have been plans for the highway maintenance to replant all felled trees across the city, including those historically felled and not previously replanted. In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which aimed to demolish and rebuild a large part of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners to take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.

McIntosh, editor of the Albany News and Advertiser, initiated a campaign to raise the funds necessary to erect the school. It was the first high school in the county. Two years after the school opened, it was destroyed by a fire of unknown origin. Classes were temporarily held in the town courthouse while the academy was rebuilt. After student enrollment rapidly increased during the first two decades, overcrowding led to expansion until a building was built in 1908. Located at the intersection of Monroe Street and Society Avenue, it contained ten classrooms. In 1925, the high school moved to 1000 North Jefferson Street. In the fall of 1954 the school shifted to its current building on Residence Avenue.

It is in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Its population was 65,844 (2019)Data for Tabatinga from IBGE (in Portuguese) and its area is 3,225 km¬≤ Together with the neighbouring Colombian city of Leticia and the Peruvian city of Santa Rosa de Yavari, the urban area has more than 100,000 residents spread along the Amazon River. The first Portuguese settlement in the area was founded in the 18th century as a military outpost. It became an autonomous municipality on February 1, 1983. Formerly, it was part of the municipality of Benjamin Constant. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alto Solim√µes. Etymology The word Tabatinga is of indigenous origin, coming from the Tupi tobatinga,NAVARRO, E. A. M√©todo moderno de tupi antigo: a l√≠ngua do Brasil dos primeiros s√©culos. 3¬™ edi√ß√£o. S√£o Paulo. Global. 2005. p. 118. [Modern method of ancient Tupi: the language of Brazil of the first centuries] (In Portuguese). having its meaning designated as white clay or soil white. It is believed that the indigenous people referred to the region with that name because of the white clay found abundantly at the bottom of the region's rivers. In the Tupi Guarani, the word also means small house. History Post between the borders of Tabatinga and Leticia in 1924, Brazil and Colombia In the middle of the 17th century, near of the Amazon River, the foundation of a village by the Jesuits was registered by the Portuguese empire. A military post and tax office were established near the site in 1766 to become a border region with Colombia and Peru. Fernando da Costa Ata√≠de Teives was responsible for the creation of a military post in the region and also created a border post between the domains of the Kingdom of Portugal and Spain, alongside other military posts. The town of S√£o Francisco Xavier de Tabatinga was then established. Of the three main colonial border settlements (S√£o Francisco Xavier de Tabatinga, Vila Ipiranga and Vila Bittencourt), only the first was actively developing. On June 28, 1866, near the village, the border between Brazil and Peru was drawn. Until then, the region was administratively subordinated to the municipality of S√£o Paulo de Oliven√ßa, however many few municipalities were established in the region. In 1898, with the dismantling of the territory of S√£o Paulo de Oliven√ßa and the emancipation of the district of Benjamin Constant, the city of Tabatinga became part of the newly created municipality, including it as one of the subdivisions of the main district. A post between the borders of Tabatinga and Leticia in 1924 consistently defined the borders between Brazil and Colombia. On 4 June 1968, under Federal Law 5.449, the entire area of the municipality of Benjamin Constant, to which Tabatinga was subordinated, was classified by the Brazilian government as a National Security Area, due to its extensive open border with other countries and its poor border surveillance. For a long time Tabatinga was a district of Benjamin Constant. Tabatinga's political emancipation occurred on December 10, 1981, under the constitutional amendment of the State of Amazonas No. 12, which now defines the Tabatinga district as an autonomous municipality. The installation of municipal offices took place on January 1, 1983. Geography =Ethnic composition= The population of Tabatinga municipality is quite heterogeneous. It is formed by Brazilians, Peruvians, Colombians, among them indigenous people of different ethnic groups, most of whom are Tikunas and Kokamas. Among the Brazilians in Tabatinga, there is the rotating population, corresponding to the military of the armed forces, bank branch workers and people who work for public agencies of the Brazilian government, because it is a border region, a large number of federal police officers, federal revenue agents, federal prosecutors, among others, are seen. The Ticunas Indians form the largest ethnic group in Tabatinga, and the Tukuna Umaria√ßu indigenous reserve is found in the region of the municipality, inhabited by a majority belonging to this ethnic group. The official language of the municipality is Portuguese, but Spanish and tribal languages are understood, including Tikuna language. Economy The city's economy is driven by a significant portion of the informal economy and subsistence agriculture. It is also made up of public sector jobs and the extensive financial exchange of the Colombian city of Leticia, which, based on dollar regulation, takes place in parallel in the city between the Colombian Peso and the Brazilian Real. Security Due to the extensive border with Colombia and Peru, Tabatinga is considered by the Federal Police and the Brazilian Army to be one of the main points of entry of cocaine into Brazil. According to Brazilian police authorities, the precarious enforcement and extensive problems of neighboring nations with illicit narcotics production make Tabatinga a frequent point of entry for drugs bound for Brazil's major cities.

Though her film career was brief, she was a trailblazer for socially critical art cinema in Hong Kong's populist film industry, as well as its first noted woman director. Tang was born in Yunnan province, China. She graduated from the University of Southern California. Tang's best-known films are her first two, The Arch (1968) and China Behind (1974). The first film looks at the subjugation of women and their sexuality in a traditional village through the story of a widow's unconsummated passion for a male houseguest. The second follows the harrowing journey of a group of college students trying to cross illegally into Hong Kong from a China torn by the Cultural Revolution. The bleak portrait in China Behind of both communist China and capitalist Hong Kong brought upon it a thirteen-year ban by the British colonial authorities. In addition to their provocative themes, both films used stylistic devices, such as freeze-frames and expressionistic color, possibly inspired by the European art cinema of the 1960s. Tang made two more, less noted, films, Sup Sap Bup Dup (1975) and The Hong Kong Tycoon (1979). She also launched the territory's first serious film journal, Close-Up, in 1976. It stopped publishing in 1979 (Bordwell, 2000). She ceased filmmaking and emigrated to the United States in 1979, becoming a respected restaurateur in Los Angeles. Many critics, however, see her influence in the so-called Hong Kong New Wave of edgy, groundbreaking young filmmakers in the late '70s and early '80s. References Bordwell, David.

It is a dairy product traditionally manufactured in Campania, especially in the provinces of Caserta and Salerno. The term mozzarella derives from the procedure called mozzare which means \\"cutting by hand\\", separating from the curd, and serving in individual pieces, that is, the process of separation of the curd into small balls. It is appreciated for its versatility and elastic texture and often called \\"the queen of the Mediterranean cuisine\\", \\"white gold\\" or \\"the pearl of the table\\". The buffalo mozzarella sold as Mozzarella di Bufala Campana has been granted the status of Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC - \\"Controlled designation of origin\\") since 1993. Since 1996 it is also protected under the EU's Protected Designation of Origin or DOP Denominazione di origine protetta and Protected Geographical Indication schemes. The protected origin's appellation requires that it may only be produced with a traditional recipe in select locations in the regions of Campania, Lazio, Apulia and Molise. Areas of production A water buffalo on a farm in Paestum. In Italy, the cheese is produced nationwide using Italian buffalo's milk under the government's official name Mozzarella di latte di bufala because Italian buffalo is in all Italian regions. Only selected type Mozzarella di bufala campana PDO is produced in areas ranging from Rome in Lazio to Paestum near Salerno in Campania, and there are production areas in the province of Foggia, Apulia, and in Venafro, Molise. Buffalo mozzarella is a ‚Ç¨300m ($330m) per year industry in Italy, which produces around 33,000 tonnes of it every year, with 16 percent sold abroad (mostly in the European Union). France and Germany are the main importers, but sales to Japan and Russia are growing. Apart from Italy, its birthplace, buffalo mozzarella is manufactured in many other countries around the world. There are producers in Switzerland, the United States, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Venezuela, Argentina, the United Kingdom, near Macroom in Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Colombia, Thailand, Israel, Egypt, India and South Africa, all using milk from their own herds of water buffaloes. Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Buffalo mozzarella from Campania bears the \\"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana\\" trademark. In 1993, it was granted Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status, in 1996 the trademark received registry number 1107/96 and in 2008 the European Union granted Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Protected Geographical Status and PDO indicator. The Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio di Bufala Campana (\\"Consortium for the Protection of the Buffalo Cheese of Campania\\") is an organization of approximately 200 producers, that, under Italian law, is responsible for the \\"protection, surveillance, promotion and marketing\\" of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. PDO Among the many other Italian cheeses that have PDO status are Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Asiago cheese. History in Italy The history of water buffalo in Italy is not settled. One theory is that Asian water buffalo were brought to Italy by Goths during the migrations of the early medieval period. However, according to the Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, the \\"most likely hypothesis\\" is that they were introduced by Normans from Sicily in 1000, and that Arabs had introduced them into Sicily. The Consorzio per la Tutela also refers to fossil evidence (the prehistoric European Water Buffalo, Bubalus murrensis) suggesting that water buffalo may have originated in Italy. A fourth theory is that water buffalo were brought from Mesopotamia into the Near East by Arabs and then introduced into Europe by pilgrims and returning crusaders. \\"In ancient times, the buffalo was a familiar sight in the countryside, since it was widely used as a draught animal in ploughing compact and watery terrains, both because of its strength and the size of its hooves, which do not sink too deeply into moist soils.\\" References to cheese products made from water buffalo milk appeared for the first time at the beginning of the twelfth century. Buffalo mozzarella became widespread throughout the south of Italy from the second half of the eighteenth century, before which it had been produced only in small quantities.

The article, later referenced by blogs and other publications, referred to the Naples waste management issue and referred to other pieces published by the International Herald Tribune and various other national and international newspapers. These articles marked the beginning of an international media attention that raised the threshold of collective attention on the potential harmfulness of buffalo mozzarella from Campania. In particular, they pointed out to varying degrees a relationship between the fires of garbage heaps and the release of dioxins and other cancerous substances, which would end up in the pastures of dairy animals. Alarmed by some positive findings in the dioxin test, the South Korean government was among the first to prohibit the importation of Italian buffalo mozzarella, promising to remove the ban only when the findings confirmed the possible contamination and identification of responsible producers. A chain reaction followed, in which several countries including Japan, China, Russia and Germany took various measures ranging from the mere raising of the attention threshold to the suspension of imports.Articoli vari The Italian institutions activated almost immediately, even in response to pressing requests from the European Union, a series of checks and suspended, in some cases, the sale of dairy products from the incriminated provinces. Tests had shown levels of dioxins higher than normal in at least 14% of samples taken in the provinces of Naples, Caserta and Avellino. In the provinces of Salerno and Benevento, no control indicated dioxins positivity. In any case, the contamination has affected, in a limited defined manner, the farms used to produce the PDO buffalo mozzarella DOP.Vedi il comunicato On 19 April, China definitively removed the ban on mozzarella, originally activated on 28 March 2008, and tests held in December 2013 in Germany on behalf of four Italian consumer associations have highlighted dioxin and heavy metal levels at least five times lower than the legal limit.I test tenuti in Germania assolvono la mozzarella bufala campana dop, Repubblica.it, 13-12-2013 Production stages To produce of cheese, a cheese maker requires of cow milk but only of buffalo milk. Producing 1 kg of butter requires of cow milk but only of buffalo milk. The steps required to produce buffalo mozzarella are: #Milk storage (raw buffalo milk stored in steel containers). #Milk heating (thermic treatment to the liquid, then poured into a cream separator). #Curdling (by introduction of natural whey). #Curd maturation (the curd lies in tubs to reduce the acidifying processes and reach a pH value of about 4.95). #Spinning (hot water is poured on the curd to soften it, obtaining pasta filata). #Shaping (with special rotating shaper machines). #Cooling (by immersion in cold water). #Pickling (by immersion in pickling tubs containing the original whey). #Packaging (in special films cut as bags or in small basins and plastic). Nutrition The digestive system of water buffaloes permits them to turn low grade vegetation into rich milk which, due to its higher percentage of solids, provides higher levels of protein, fat and minerals than cow milk.

Lawn Lake Dam was an earthen dam in Rocky Mountain National Park, United States that failed on July 15, 1982, at about 6 a.m., in an event known as the flood of 1982. The sudden release of 30 million cubic feet (849,000 m3) of water resulted in a flash flood that killed three people camping in the park and caused $31 million in damage to the town of Estes Park, Colorado and other downstream areas. Lawn Lake Lawn Lake was originally a natural lake with a surface area of 16.4 acres (6.6 ha), located at an elevation of approximately 11,000 feet (3,400 m) in the Rocky Mountains. In 1903 a group of farmers from Loveland built a dam to increase it to a surface area of 48 acres (19.4 ha) for the purpose of providing water for irrigation in Loveland. Dam failure Over the years the road that had been cut to permit construction of the dam fell into disrepair and ceased to exist. Because of the dam's remote and difficult location, inspection and repairs lapsed. The Colorado State Engineer determined that the probable cause of the dam failure was deterioration of lead caulking on the joint between the outlet pipe and the gate valve leading to internal erosion of the earth-fill dam. There had been issues reported during inspections in 1951, 1975, 1977 and 1978. The mouth of Lawn Lake (the site of the dam) in July 2007, 25 years after the accident. Lawn Lake in 2007, 25 years after the accident, with the shore still showing the former extent of the lake. When the dam failed the waters rushed down the Roaring River valley, which falls in , at a peak rate of 18,000 cubic feet per second (510 m3/s), scouring a large gully out of the mountain stream and killing one person camping alongside it. At this rate, the lake emptied in about half an hour. When the waters reached the broader valley of Fall River at Horseshoe Park they spread out and slowed, leaving behind a large alluvial fan of debris. The flood continued down Fall River and hit the Cascade Dam which stored water to run a hydroelectric plant about a mile (2 km) downstream. Cascade Dam failed from the onslaught and added its waters to the flood. The Aspenglen campground was destroyed and two campers who returned to recover camping gear lost their lives, due to insufficient warning from park rangers. The flood entered the town of Estes Park and caused severe damage to 177 downtown businesses (75 percent of Estes Park's commercial activity). In Estes Park the flood joined the Big Thompson River and flowed into Lake Estes on the eastern edge of the city. Olympus Dam, part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project, there withstood the deluge and the flood was halted. Aftermath The scar left by the scouring of Roaring River and the alluvial fan at Horseshoe Park are still very apparent 37 years later and will remain for a very long time. Twenty-five years after the accident, the extent of the former reservoir is still clearly evident, and at the mouth of the lake, the start of the Roaring River flows through the location of the former dam. As a consequence of the dam failure, aging dams at Pear Reservoir, Bluebird Lake and Sandbeach Lake in the park were demolished and removed.High Elevation Dam Removals in Rocky Mountain National Park References Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Dam-break Modeling of the July 15, 1982, Lawn Lake Dam and Cascade Lake Dam Failures, Larimer County, Colorado.

Grimaldo is considered the progenitor and eponym of the House of Grimaldi.  Origins  Canella was probably born in Genoa around 1110, son of Genoese patrician Otto Canella, then Consul of Genoa, who would originate from the Lords of Vezzano Ligure, and his wife, Adelasia, probably a local noblewoman. Grimaldo was the youngest of the brothers: Rubaldo, Bellamunto, Otto, Bulzaneto and Anna Canella.  Career  Politician and man-at-arms, Grimaldo appears for the first time in a document dated October 2, 1158. Grimaldo Canella was several times Consul of Genoa, and served as ambassador to Federico Barbarossa in 1158 and to the Emir of Morocco in 1169. He is attested in various notarial deeds between 1162 and 1184. As a man of arms, in October 1170 he led eight Genoese galleys who, under his command, pursued a small army of Pisan galleys and conquered one.  Family  He married a local noblewoman, and had several children, including Oberto, who was known as \\"Oberto, son of Grimaldo.\\" In patronymic terms, this was \\"Oberto Grimaldi,\\" making this son of Grimaldo the first of the family known to bear the surname of Grimaldi. During Grimaldo's lifetime his family already lived in the Genoese area between what would be the Church di San Luca, erected by his son Oberto and his father-in-law around 1180, and the sestiere called della Maddalena. In this age the Grimaldi began their ascent among the largest families of the Republic of Genoa, involved in the first struggles of the time. In this context, the figure of Grimaldo therefore stands as that of the eponymous progenitor, the famous consul whose descendants wanted to keep his name as the surname of the same family. As progenitor Grimaldo is placed between the dark history and the beginning of the fame of the family. In fact, historians and heraldists have fabled about him ancestries and mythical origins. Instead, his figure began to have serious studies only in the modern age even if the unknown on the real origin of the Canella still remains. After nine centuries the name and memory of Grimaldo are still preserved and he is looked upon as the founder of the Grimaldi family. A century later, in 1270, the families of Grimaldi and Fieschi were forced into exile from Genoa. The Grimaldis ended up in the towns around Nice. They made their first attempt to seize the fortress of Monaco in 1297, although they did not control it permanently until 1419. Thus the family became Princes of Monaco.

Products marketed as terminal servers can be very simple devices that do not offer any security functionality, such as data encryption and user authentication. The primary application scenario is to enable serial devices to access network server applications, or vice versa, where security of the data on the LAN is not generally an issue. There are also many terminal servers on the market that have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Usually companies which need a terminal server with these advanced functions want to remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a telecommunications network. A console server (also referred to as console access server, console management server, serial concentrator, or serial console server) is a device or service that provides access to the system console of a computing device via networking technologies. History Historically, a terminal server was a device that attached to serial RS-232 devices, such as \\"green screen\\" text terminals or serial printers, and transported traffic via TCP/IP, Telnet, SSH or other vendor-specific network protocols (e.g., LAT) via an Ethernet connection. Digital Equipment Corporation's DECserver 100 (1985), 200 (1986) and 300 (1991) are early examples of this technology. (An earlier version of this product, known as the DECSA Terminal Server was actually a test-bed or proof-of-concept for using the proprietary LAT protocol in commercial production networks.) With the introduction of inexpensive flash memory components, Digital's later DECserver 700 (1991) and 900 (1995) no longer shared with their earlier units the need to download their software from a \\"load host\\" (usually a Digital VAX or Alpha) using Digital's proprietary Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP). In fact, these later terminal server products also included much larger flash memory and full support for the Telnet part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Many other companies entered the terminal-server market with devices pre-loaded with software fully compatible with LAT and Telnet. Modern usage A \\"terminal server\\" is used many ways but from a basic sense if a user has a serial device and they need to move data over the LAN, this is the product they need. * Raw TCP socket connection: A raw TCP socket connection which can be initiated from the terminal server or from the remote host/server. This can be point-to-point or shared, where serial devices (like card readers, scanners, bar code readers, weight scales, etc.) can be shared amongst multiple devices. TCP sessions can be initiated from the TCP server application or from the terminal server. * Raw UDP socket connection: For use with UDP based applications, terminal servers can convert serial equipment data for transport across UDP packets on a point-to-point basis or shared across multiple devices. * Console management - reverse Telnet, reverse SSH: In console management terminology, users can use reverse Telnet or SSH to connect to a serial device. They run Telnet or SSH on their client (PC) and attach to the terminal server, then connect to the serial device. In this application, terminal servers are also called console servers because they are used to connect to console ports which are found on products like routers, PBXes, switches and servers (Linux or Sun). The idea is to gain access to those devices via their console port. * Connect serial-based applications with a COM/TTY port driver: Many software applications have been written to communicate with devices that are directly connected to a server's serial COM ports (robotic assembly machines, scanners, card readers, sensors, blood analyzers, etc.). Companies may want to network these applications because the devices that were directly connected to the server's COM ports need to be moved to a location some distance away from the application server. Since the original application was designed to talk directly to a specific COM port, a solution seamless to both the application and device must be implemented to enable communication across an IP network. (i.e., a solution that makes the application think it is talking directly to a COM port.) In this application, serial ports can be connected to network servers or workstations running COM port redirector software operating as a virtual COM port. Many terminal server vendors include COM port redirector software with their terminal servers. This application need is most common in Windows environments, but also exists in Linux and Unix environments. * Serial tunneling between two serial devices: Serial tunneling enables users to establish a link across Ethernet to a serial port on another terminal server. * Back to back: This application is designed to solve a wiring problem. For example, a user needs to replace RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485 wire and run their data over Ethernet without making any changes to the server or the ultimate serial device, a user wants to replace a parallel leased line modem network with their parallel Ethernet network, or someone has a pick and place machine that puts ICs on boards, and they want to move the server into a back room where the equipment will be safe from damage. This application is ideal where a device exists with an application written to gather information from that device (common with sensors). This application allows them to eliminate the wiring. It can also be used with industrial devices (Allen-Bradley, Siemens, Modbus) so that those devices can be run transparently across the network. * Virtual modem: Virtual modem is another example of a back-to-back application. It may be used to replace modems but still use an AT command set. An IP address is typed into the AT command set instead of the phone number of a serial device.  Console server  A 32-port serial console server A console server (console access server, console management server, serial concentrator, or serial console server) is a device or service that provides access to the system console of a computing device via networking technologies. Most commonly, a console server provides a number of serial ports, which are then connected to the serial ports of other equipment, such as servers, routers or switches. The consoles of the connected devices can then be accessed by connecting to the console server over a serial link such as a modem, or over a network with terminal emulator software such as telnet or ssh, maintaining survivable connectivity that allows remote users to log in the various consoles without being physically nearby. = Description = A 96 port serial console server. Dedicated console server appliances are available from a number of manufacturers in many configurations, with the number of serial ports ranging from one to 96. These Console Servers are primarily used for secure remote access to Unix Servers, Linux Servers, switches, routers, firewalls, and any other device on the network with a console port. The purpose is to allow network operations center (NOC) personnel to perform secure remote data center management and out-of-band management of IT assets from anywhere in the world. Products marketed as Console Servers usually have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Marketing a product as a console server is very application specific because it really refers to what the user wants to do‚Äîremotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a network or the Internet. Some users have created their own console servers using off-the-shelf commodity computer hardware, usually with multiport serial cards typically running a slimmed-down Unix-like operating system such as Linux. Such \\"home-grown\\" console servers can be less expensive, especially if built from components that have been retired in upgrades, and allow greater flexibility by putting full control of the software driving the device in the hands of the administrator. This includes full access to and configurability of a wide array of security protocols and encryption standards, making it possible to create a console server that is more secure. However, this solution may have a higher TCO, less reliability and higher rack-space requirements, since most industrial console servers have the physical dimension of one rack unit (1U), whereas a desktop computer with full-size PCI cards requires at least 3U, making the home-grown solution more costly in the case of a co-located infrastructure. An alternative approach to a console server used in some cluster setups is to null-modem wire and daisy- chain consoles to otherwise unused serial ports on nodes with some other primary function.

Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., 528 U.S. 167 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case that addressed the law regarding standing to sue and mootness. The Court held that the plaintiff residents in the area of South Carolina's North Tyger River had standing to sue an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued.. Standing was properly based on the fact that the residents alleged that they would have used the river for recreational purposes, but could not because of the pollution. The defendant polluter also claimed that the case was moot because it had ceased polluting, and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution complained of. The Court noted that the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, and could reopen similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the fine sought. Therefore, the case was held not to be moot. The Supreme Court's majority in Friends ruled that plaintiffs did not need to prove an actual (particular) harm to residents. Writing for the majority, Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that injury to the plaintiff came from lessening the \\"aesthetic and recreational values of the area\\" for residents and users of the river because of their knowledge of Laidlaw's repeated violations of its clean water permit. In addition, the case held that a civil penalty could be enforced against an entity even though the interests protected were private. The court agreed with Congress in holding that civil penalties in the Clean Water Act cases \\"do more than promote immediate compliance by limiting the defendant's economic incentive to delay its attainment of permit limits; they also deter future violations.\\" The 7-2 decision was written by Justice Ginsburg, and joined by Justices Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer. Stevens and Kennedy each filed a concurring opinion. Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Thomas.

So, don't expect us to tell both sides of the story. The big newspapers, magazines, TV and radio do that all day long. Here you will hear our side of things.\\" The Bird chose to report on issues not covered in mainstream newspapers. The paper focused on the war in Vietnam, black power, women's liberation, gay activism, red-baiting, Atlanta politics, labor, and environmental issues. The Bird's Women's Caucus challenged the paper's advertising norms and pushed the collective to share tasks more equitably. The Bird included comix by Ron Ausburn and contributions on art and culture by Miller Francis.

It was eventually released on Max Recordings. =The D.C. Years= Between 1992 and 1996, Trusty worked to gain respect and recognition from the established D.C. punk rock scene. In the summer of 1992, Trusty recorded the 7\\" EP Kathy's Keen on De Soto Records with their original drummer, Bircho. In the fall of 1992, with new bassist Brad Long (formerly of the Memphis hardcore band Sobering Consequences) and steady drummer Jim Schaffer (formerly of Washington D.C. based band Senator Flux), Trusty continued touring and writing songs for their CD Goodbye Dr. Fate, as well as several compilation CDs. Goodbye Dr. Fate was completed in the winter of 1994 and released in the spring of 1995. After extensive touring, Trusty released another CD in 1996 named The Fourth Wise Man, also on Dischord Records and continued to tour within North America and Europe. Four years after moving from Little Rock, Trusty became the first band originating from outside Washington, D.C. to be signed by Dischord Records. In early 1998, Trusty disbanded. Bobby Matthews now sings and plays guitar in the Memphis-based band Dragoon, along with former Grifters members Tripp Lamkins and Stan Gallimore. Jim Schaffer has been playing drums with the Baltimore punk rock band, National razor, since 2002. Coming Full Circle In 2008, Trusty signed with record label DC-Jam Records to re-release their first songs ever recorded. The CD is appropriately titled \\"DEMO.\\"  References   External linksDischord Records: Trusty. dischord.com. Retrieved February 2, 2016.

MacPherson was born at his father's property of Springbank on the Limestone Plains, in New South Wales (the present site of Canberra): he was the first Premier of Victoria born in Australia. His father was a Scottish Presbyterian pastoralist. He came to the Port Phillip District as a child with his family and was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated in law. He was admitted to the Victorian bar in 1866 and practised law before becoming a pastoralist near Hamilton in the Western District. MacPherson was elected as a conservative to the Legislative Assembly for Portland in November 1864, and for Dundas in February 1866. In September 1869, when the liberal Premier James McCulloch resigned, MacPherson was commissioned as Premier; at 35 years and 11 months, he became Victoria's youngest Premier. His government was in a weak parliamentary position and had little prospect of survival. However it did succeed in passing an effective land selection act, allowing small farmers to select land on the squatters' pastoral runs, before being defeated in the Assembly and resigning in April 1870. MacPherson served as Chief Secretary in the third McCulloch government in 1875 to 1877, before retiring from politics in July 1878, still aged only 44. In 1880 he returned to Britain and settled in Surrey, where he died in 1894. He married Louisa Featherstonhaugh in 1858: they had seven children.

With McCandless, Cold has released five albums of which two have been RIAA Certified Gold and one RIAA Certified Platinum soundtrack album for A Walk to Remember. He left the band in 2015, leaving vocalist Scooter Ward as the only original member. However, he later rejoined the band full-time in 2019. Career =Grundig= In 1986, McCandless formed the band Grundig along with several other students; Scooter Ward, Jeremy Marshall, and Matt Loughran at Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, Florida. The band played their first gig in 1990 at a club called the Spray. In 1992, the band released an 8-song EP called \\"Into Everything\\" and moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Three and a half years later in 1995, Grundig broke up and McCandless, Ward, Kelly Hayes, and Pat Lally formed the band Diablo. Diablo would only last about 3 months. =Cold= At the end of that three-month period, Grundig reformed under the name Cold and signed a 6-album record deal with A&M; Records. McCandless would remain with Cold until February 2006 when, after several line-up changes and battles with record labels, the band decided to break up. McCandless and Ward promptly began working on their new project The Witch, which McCandless has since left. The project has been renamed twice, When November Falls and now The Killer and the Star. In early 2009, Cold reformed for a reunion tour. Their album Superfiction was released on July 19, 2011.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right- handed pitcher from through . Sanford was notable for the meteoric start to his career when, he led the National League with 188 strikeouts as a 28-year- old rookie for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1957. He later became a 20-game- winner and made his only World Series appearance as a member of the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the California Angels and the Kansas City Athletics. Baseball career Sanford was born in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts. After playing in the minor leagues for seven seasons, he made his major league debut with the Phillies on September 16, 1956 at the age of 27. Sanford made an immediate impact the following season when, he began the year with a 10-2 win-loss record to earn a spot on the National League team in the 1957 All-Star Game on July 9, 1957. He ended the season with a 19-8 win- loss record and a 3.08 earned run average along with a league-leading 188 strikeouts. His 19 victories were second only to the 21 wins by Warren Spahn. He also had 15 complete games on the season, including three shutouts. For his impressive performance, he was named the National League Rookie of the Year in . His next seven years would be extremely solid, but never quite as impressive as his rookie season; or according to some, he never improved much after it. After being traded to the Giants for the season, Sanford went 15-12 with a 3.16 ERA in 222 innings pitched and completed 10 games. That year, he started 31 games and made 36 appearances, 5 out of the bullpen. Sanford led the Giants to the 1962 National League pennant with 24 victories, second only to the 25 victories by Don Drysdale. He won 16 consecutive decisions from mid-June to mid-September and was named Player of the Month in August for his second straight 6-0 month (he also posted a 3.55 ERA, and 31 SO). Only Rube Marquard, who won 19 straight games for the 1912 New York Giants, and Roy Face, who won 17 straight for the 1959 Pittsburgh Pirates have won more consecutive games in a single season during the modern era. Six pitchers have matched Sanford's 16-game streak. The Giants would face the New York Yankees in the World Series in the only post-season appearance of Sanford's career. Sanford made three starts for the club in the World Series. In Game 2, he pitched a three-hit shutout as the Giants beat the Yankees 2-0. He was supposed to start Game 5 October 9, but rain pushed it back a day, which bothered Sanford, who had psyched himself to pitch that day. Sanford gave up a three-run home run to Tom Tresh and a total of five runs (four earned) in innings as the Giants lost 5-3. He pitched better in Game 7, allowing just one run in seven innings against the Yankees when Bill Skowron scored as Tony Kubek hit into a double play in the fifth inning. That run was enough, though, for the Yankees to win 1-0, behind a Ralph Terry shutout. (The Giants lost the Series by inches: Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson caught Willie McCovey's line drive with Willie Mays on second and Matty Alou on third; a foot or two to either side and both runners would have scored and the Giants would have won the Series.) Sanford finished second to Don Drysdale in the voting for the 1962 Cy Young Award. After he left the Giants, his best seasons were behind him. He ended his playing career with the Kansas City Athletics on August 6, at the age of 38. However, Sanford remained in the major leagues for two more seasons as the pitching coach of the ‚Äì Cleveland Indians. Working on the staff of Alvin Dark, his manager with the 1962 Giants and 1967 Athletics, Sanford's first season saw the 1968 Indians compile a staff earned run average of 2.66. Throughout baseball, 1968 was known as \\"The Year of the Pitcher\\", and two of Cleveland's starters, Luis Tiant (1.60 in 258 innings pitched) and Sam McDowell (1.81 in 269 innings), finished first and second in ERA in the American League. Career statistics In a twelve-year major league career, Sanford played in 388 games, accumulating a 137-101 win-loss record along with a 3.69 earned run average in 2,049 innings pitched. He accumulated 1,182 strikeouts and gave up only 840 earned runs. He also finished in the Top 10 in MVP Award voting twice in his career (1957, 1962). He finished second in the league in wins twice, losing in 1957 to only Warren Spahn and in 1962 to Cy Young Award winner Don Drysdale. Later life After retiring from baseball, Sanford was a golf director at country clubs. Sanford died of a brain tumor at age 70 in Beckley, West Virginia.

Her career on stage, screen, and television has spanned over six decades. She is best known for the role of Truly Scrumptious in the 1968 musical film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical in 1963 for her performance in Brigadoon. Biography =Childhood and early film career= Howes was born in St John's Wood, London, the daughter of British comedian/actor/singer/variety star Bobby Howes (1895‚Äì1972) and actress/singer Patricia Malone (1899‚Äì1971). She is the granddaughter of Capt. J.A.E. Malone (died 1928), London theatrical director of musicals, and she had an older brother, Peter Howes, a professional musician and music professor. Her great- grandfather, Joseph Malone, was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1854 at the Charge of the Light Brigade. Her uncle, Pat Malone, was an actor on stage, films, and television. Howes moved to the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire, for the duration of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood, where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, inevitably became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and Sealing Wax (1945), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My Sister and I (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh. At the age of 18, the Rank Organisation put her under a seven-year contract, and she went on to make the films Stop Press Girl (1949), The History of Mr. Polly (1949) with John Mills, Fools Rush In (1949), and Honeymoon Deferred (1951). =Musical theatre in the West End and on Broadway= On a teacher friend's recommendation, Howes took singing lessons‚Äînot only to bring out her natural talents, but in an effort to lower her speaking voice, which was quite high. While still in her teens, she made her first musical-comedy stage appearance in Fancy Free. In late 1950, she starred in a BBC TV version of Cinderella. The same year, Howes accepted her first professional stage role in the Sandy Wilson musical Caprice. She terminated her contract with Rank, where she had been unhappy with the film roles she'd received, and with being \\"lent out\\" to other studios. She was finding gainful employment in television and radio, and looking to flex her singing talent, something Balcon and Rank had overlooked. Caprice was followed by Bet Your Life with Julie Wilson, Arthur Askey and Brian Reece, with whom Howes was also simultaneously on radio. In 1953, she starred in the West End in the musical Paint Your Wagon with her father, Bobby Howes, which ran for 18 months. It was followed by Summer Song, also in the West End, firmly establishing Howes as a leading musical comedy star. Then came her critically acclaimed performance in the stage drama A Hatful of Rain. In the early-to-mid-1950s, Howes's career expanded to include television appearances, modelling, commercials, and product endorsements. She became a popular celebrity in the UK. She appeared as a comics character in TV Fun serial comics and annuals, as a young, wholesome teacher in the wild American West (at a time when Western TV shows were very popular). She appeared on many magazine covers, most notably Life (3 March 1958), when she took over Julie Andrews's role in My Fair Lady on New York's Broadway. Howes was offered the part twice before: first, to join the musical's US touring company (which she declined); and second, to replace Andrews on Broadway‚Äîwhich, at the time, conflicted with Howes's commitment to film Admirable Crichton (1957). My Fair Lady creators Lerner and Loewe were persistent, though, and Howes accepted the third time‚Äîwith a year's contract, and at a higher salary than Andrews. Howes was an instant hit as a very fiery Eliza Doolittle. In January 1958, Howes married Tony-winning composer Richard Adler (The Pajama Game, Damn Yankees). The following December, she appeared in Adler's musical television adaptation of O. Henry's short story The Gift of the Magi, which Adler wrote expressly for her. Adler and Bob Merrill also collaborated on a musical version of W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage so Howes could play Mildred. She appeared on many TV shows, including those of Perry Como and Dinah Shore, and Jack Paar's The Tonight Show in 1962. She appeared on The Bell Telephone Hour, The Kraft Music Hall, and The United States Steel Hour, and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show four times. When her contract in My Fair Lady was over, she returned to Britain to tape six 1-hour installments of The Sally Ann Howes Show, a variety show for the British commercial television network. Howes was invited to sing for US presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. She became a frequent guest panellist on game shows and was known for her quick, spontaneous answers. She returned to Broadway in 1961 in the short run of Kwamina, another musical Adler wrote for her, where she starred opposite Terry Carter. Its theme of interracial romance proved controversial at a time when civil rights were hotly contested, and it has not been revived on Broadway since. Howes's father was also on Broadway that year, in a short revival of Finian's Rainbow.) In 1962, she starred in a short revival of the musical Brigadoon at the New York City Opera and received a Tony nomination, the first performer to be nominated for a revival performance. She recreated the role in a private White House performance at the invitation of President and Mrs. Kennedy. In 1964, she starred on Broadway opposite Robert Alda and Steve Lawrence in the energetic What Makes Sammy Run?, with over 500 performances. She returned to familiar territory on TV in 1966 with Brigadoon opposite Robert Goulet, Peter Falk, and some of her Broadway cast; it won six Emmy Awards. =Chitty Chitty Bang Bang= In 1967, Howes began the long shooting schedule for what would become a classic children's film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968). She starred as Truly Scrumptious, the beautiful aristocratic daughter of a confectionery magnate. For this leading role she was paid ¬£44,939, compared to her male co-star Dick Van Dyke's fee of ¬£615,425. (Source: UK National Archives) Chitty Chitty Bang Bang did not, however, restart Howes' film career or launch a career for her in episodic television despite several guest-starring roles in Mission: Impossible, Marcus Welby, M.D., Branigan, and The Men From Shiloh. Even the pilot Prudence and the Chief, which was a spoof on The King and I, did not get picked up as a TV series. In addition, musicals were now failing at the box office and that avenue was closed to her. As a result, she returned almost exclusively to the musical stage, appearing in only a few more films and TV productions. =Later theatrical career= In the 1970s, she toured Britain with The King and I and later the USA with The Sound of Music. After her debut with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1972 with The Sound of Music, she returned to Britain to star in the stage drama, Lover, which was written specifically for her. In the 1970s and 1980s, she began to cross over from standard musicals to operettas. She performed two summers with the Kenley Players in Blossom Time and The Great Waltz, and she later added Franz Leh√°r's The Merry Widow and then two seasons of Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music at the New York City Opera. She also added the role of Gertrude in Hamlet to her repertoire. In the 1980s, she twice appeared in BBC TV's long- running Edwardian Music Hall programme, The Good Old Days, to great acclaim. In 1990, she debuted her one-woman show, From This Moment On, at the Edinburgh Festival and at a benefit for the Long Island AIDS Association at the John Drew Theatre in East Hampton, New York. Her last film was the 1992 miniseries Judith Krantz's Secrets. That marked her 50th year in film. Recent projects include her narrations of Cubby Broccoli, The Man Behind Bond on 2000 year release of the DVD Diamonds Are Forever, The Making of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang The Musical (2002), and her appearance in the documentary, After They Were Famous ‚Äì Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (2004). Except for occasional lectures, charity functions, and some Broadway openings, she is semi-retired, although she still hosts events or performs two or three times per year. Over the period September 2007 to January 2008, she toured the USA in the Cameron Mackintosh production of My Fair Lady, appearing as Mrs. Higgins. When she is not performing, she is an artistic advisor for the Palm Beach Theatre Guild, a non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in Palm Beach, Florida. =Personal life= Howes adopted her second husband Richard Adler's two sons, Andrew and Christopher (a Broadway lyricist who died at age 30 of cancer in 1984). She has been married to Douglas Rae since the early 1970s.

His responsibilities include oversight of the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet. Early life A native of San Antonio, Texas, Godwin graduated from Tulane University with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 1973. He was directly commissioned as an Ensign into the United States Navy and subsequently received his Naval Aviator wings in July 1975. Military career Godwin's initial tours include numerous fleet assignments with VA-147, VA-122, Air Wing 9, VFA-125, and VFA-25. During those tours, he flew the A-7 Corsair II and the F/A-18 Hornet. From March 1991 until June 1992, he served as a Commanding Officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 192 (VFA-192) while embarked on the USS Midway (CV-41) and the USS Independence (CV-62). As a combat veteran during his command tour, Godwin amassed 34 Desert Storm missions. After detaching from VFA-192, he reported to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) where he began his career in Navy acquisition. This career path, as the Lead Systems Engineer, Deputy Program Manager and ultimately the F/A-18 Program Manager, led to the position of Program Executive Officer for Tactical Aircraft (PEO(T)), which included the procurement of all tactical aircraft and weapons systems on the Navy's aircraft carriers. In addition, Godwin co-led the NAVAIR Warfighter Focus Group, which was tasked with balancing near-term and future readiness of the aviation fleet. Godwin managed a network of aviation technology experts and program managers, tasked with delivering tactical aircraft and weapon systems to the fleet. These programs included delivering the cornerstone of Naval Aviation, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as the early operational fielding of the Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR), Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), the Shared Reconnaissance Pod (SHARP), Improved Capability III Airborne Electronic Attack (ICAP III) system, and latest version of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X. Systems under development included the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar for the Super Hornet, an Electronically Scanned Radar for the E-2 Advanced Hawkeye, and the U.S Navy's replacement for the EA-6B Prowler, the EA-18G Growler aircraft. Godwin assumed command as the Director of the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) in September 2004. In May 2005 under a reorganization, he was named Direct Reporting Program Manager (DRPM) for NMCI, and under another reorganization in February he became the Program Executive Officer Enterprise Information Systems. He was a direct report to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition and was responsible for delivering an enterprise-wide computer network for Navy and Marine Corps, one of the most transformational contracting initiatives ever undertaken by the Department of the Navy. With the goal of connecting approximately 400,000 \\"seats,\\" the NMCI network is the largest single integrated network in the world and represents the largest federal information technology contract ever awarded. Awards and Accolades His awards include the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (two awards), Air Medal with Strike/Flight (three awards), Air Medal, Navy Commendation Medal (three awards including one Combat \\"V\\"), Navy Achievement Medal, Navy Expert Pistol Medal, and several unit awards and citations.

The character originated in the 1946 novel Francis by former U.S. Army Captain David Stern III (1909‚Äì2003), son of newspaper publisher J. David Stern. After another studio turned down the property, Universal bought the rights for a film series, with Stern adapting his own script for the first entry, simply titled Francis. The beginning From the Francis book jacket:Farrar, Straus And Co.; 1st edition (1946) Stern wrote several short stories for Esquire under the name of Peter Stern about an Army 2nd lieutenant fighting the Japanese in the jungles of Burma. Following the war, he connected the stories \\"I Meet Francis\\", \\"Francis and the Golden\\", and \\"Francis Unmasked\\" into the 1946 novel Francis. In 1948, Stern published the sequel Francis Goes to Washington, with the former lieutenant (now named Peter Sterling) running for Congress with the help of Francis. Stern gave up fiction writing to become editor of the New Orleans Item, a newspaper that he purchased in 1949Erickson, Hal (2012).

Mickey Rooney was originally considered for a United Artists Francis feature filmp.199 Lertzman, Richard A. & Birnes, William J. The Life and Times of Mickey Rooney Simon and Schuster, 20 Oct 2015 before Universal-International acquired the rights. Rooney took the lead after Donald O'Connor left for the final film in the series Francis in the Haunted House. Themes The book and film series focused on the exploits of Francis, an experienced Army mule, and Peter Stirling (played by Donald O'Connor), the young soldier whom he befriends (and stays with through civilian life and then back into the military). In the original 1950 film the mule identifies himself to the commanding general as \\"Francis...123rd Mule Detachment...[serial number] M52519\\". With a plot device like the later series Mister Ed, Francis would usually only talk to Peter, thus causing problems for his nominal \\"master\\". The first six films were directed by Universal comedy veteran Arthur Lubin, previously known for helming Abbott and Costello vehicles, who would go on to produce and direct Mister Ed for television. As the titles indicated, each film had a different setting or gimmick, exposing the world-wise mule and the naive GI to race track excitement, the world of journalism, and many branches of the military, from West Point to the WACs to the Navy. The basic plots were fairly similar, however. Stirling, with the sage but sardonic advice of Francis (gleaned from overhearing generals plan strategy or from discussions with other equines), would triumph over his own incompetence. However, inevitably, he would be forced to reveal that his adviser was a mule, and be subject to mental analysis (sometimes more than once per film) until the grand reveal, when Francis displayed his talent (usually either to individuals, or to a large group). The astonishing existence of a talking mule, however, was conveniently forgotten by the next film. FilmsFrancis (1950) a.k.a. Francis the Talking Mule *Francis Goes to the Races (1951) *Francis Goes to West Point (1952) *Francis Covers the Big Town (1953) *Francis Joins the WACS (1954) *Francis in the Navy (1955) *Francis in the Haunted House (1956) Francis Goes to Washington, based on the 1948 novel by Stern, was meant to be the first Francis sequel, but filming was postponed as there were \\"too many complications\\" for it \\"to be made as things stand at the present\\". Film series actors The distinctive voice of Francis was provided by veteran character actor Chill Wills, who lent his deep, rough vocal texture and Western twang to the cynical and sardonic mule. As was customary at the time, Wills never received billing for his vocal work, though he was featured prominently on-screen as blustery General Ben Kaye in the fourth film, Francis Joins the WACS. The mule who appeared on-screen was a female named Molly, selected because she was easy to handle. She was purchased from Jake and Jenny Frazier in Drexel, Missouri. According to author Pauline Bartel, Universal paid $350 for the animal but made millions from the film series. Molly was trained by Les Hilton, an apprentice of Will Rogers; Hilton went on to train Bamboo Harvester, the horse that played Mister Ed. To create the impression that the mule was actually talking, Hilton used a thread fed into the animal's mouth which would cause Molly to try to remove it by moving her lips, the same technique used for Mister Ed. The final film in the series, Francis in the Haunted House, was made without any of the key creative personnel. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide states that O'Connor quit, and Mickey Rooney replaced him as a new character. Director Lubin and Chill Wills were also absent, replaced by Charles Lamont and voice actor Paul Frees, who did a close approximation of Wills's voice. Animated trailer Some of the Francis films had animated trailers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhM14dAmvGc Later appearances Francis also made a brief cameo, in animated form and voiced by Marvin Miller, in the UPA cartoon short How Now Boing Boing (1954), starring Gerald McBoing Boing. David Stern and Frank Thomas scripted a 1952‚Äì53 syndicated comic strip, Francis, the Famous Talking Mule, illustrated by Cliff Rogerson, who also drew the gag panel, Tee Vee Laffs (1957‚Äì85). Seventeen issues of \\"Francis the Famous Talking Mule\\" were published as part of Dell's \\"Four Color Comics\\" series from 1951 to 1960, illustrated, alternately, by David Gantz and Don Gunn. Francis is said to have provided the inspiration for the title of rock band The Mars Volta's second album, Frances the Mute. Many years later, offbeat director John Waters joked about making a film starring Francis and Divine. Video releases The original film, Francis (1950), was released in 1978 as one of the first-ever titles in the new LaserDisc format, DiscoVision Catalog #22-003.http://www.blamld.com/DiscoVision/Classic_Film/22-003.htm It was later reissued in May 1994 on LaserDisc by MCA/Universal Home Video (Catalog #: 42024) as part of an Encore Edition Double Feature with Francis Goes to the Races (1951). The first two Francis films were released again in 2004 by Universal Pictures on Region 1 and Region 4 DVD, along with the next two in the series, as The Adventures of Francis the Talking Mule Vol. 1. Several years later, Universal released all 7 Francis films as a set on three Region 1 and Region 4 DVDs, Francis The Talking Mule: The Complete Collection. Notes SourcesBartel, Pauline.

The second film in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, it stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Dana Hill, Jason Lively, Victor Lanoux, and Eric Idle. The film is the only installment in the series in which the family‚Äôs name is spelled \\"Griswald\\", instead of \\"Griswold\\". Plot The Griswald family competes in a game show called Pig in a Poke and wins an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe. In a whirlwind tour of western Europe, chaos of all sorts ensues. They stay in a fleabag London hotel with a sloppy, tattooed Cockney desk clerk. While in their English rental car, a yellow Austin Maxi, Clark's tendency to drive on the wrong side of the road causes frequent accidents, including knocking over a bicyclist, who reappears throughout the film. Later, Clark drives the family around the busy Lambeth Bridge roundabout for hours, unable to maneuver his way out of the chaotic traffic. At Stonehenge, Clark accidentally backs the car into an ancient stone monolith, toppling all the stones like dominoes, which they do not even notice as they happily leave the scene. In Paris, the family wears stenciled berets, causing Rusty to be teased by young women at the Eiffel Tower observation deck. Clark offers to get rid of the beret for Rusty, but when he throws it away, another visitor's dachshund mistakes it for a Frisbee and jumps off the tower after it, landing safely in a nearby pond. The family's video camera is stolen by a passerby whom Clark had asked to take a picture of the family. Clark is also mocked by a French waiter for his terrible French. Later, Clark and Ellen visit a bawdy Paris can-can dance show, finding Rusty already there with a prostitute. Next, in a West German village, the Griswalds burst in on a bewildered elderly couple, whom they mistakenly think are relatives but the couple ends up providing them dinner and lodging anyway, each family not being able to understand the other's language. Clark turns a lively Bavarian folk dance stage performance into an all-out street brawl, after which, while fleeing, he hastily knocks down several street vendors' stands and gets their Citro√´n DS stuck in a narrow medieval archway. In Rome, the Griswalds rent a car at a travel office, but unknown to them, the men in charge are thieves, holding the real manager captive. The lead thief gives them a car with the manager in the trunk, claiming he lost the trunk keys. The next day Ellen is shocked to discover that private, sexy videos of her from the family's stolen video camera have been used in a billboard advertising porn, leaving her completely humiliated. After screaming angrily at Clark (who had told her he had erased the video), Ellen storms off to their hotel, where she encounters the thief who rented them the car. She confesses her recent troubles, still unaware that he is a criminal. The man then tries to get the car keys, which are in her purse, but fails. When the police arrive at the hotel, he kidnaps Ellen, prompting Clark to rescue her. On the flight home, Clark falls into the pilot's room and accidentally causes the plane to knock the Statue of Liberty's torch upside down.

It is part of the Villeray‚ÄìSaint-Michel‚ÄìParc-Extension borough and is situated in the north- central part of the Island of Montreal. Origin of the name Church of Notre-Dame-du-Saint-Rosaire The village of Villeray took its name from Louis Rouer de Villeray (1628‚Äì1700), who held various positions in the French regime. It became a town in 1896, before which the area had been farmland. When it was annexed to Montreal in 1905, its population was 800. At the time, Villeray was surrounded by quarries that provided material for the construction of many of the buildings in the area, as well as for several of the city's major landmarks. For some years, its inhabitants were chiefly stone workers, farmers and owners of small businesses. Geography The territory of Villeray was well provided with streams and ponds and very amenable to cultivation. The original Jarry Farm covered 64 arpents (approximately 22 hectares, or 54 acres) and stretched as far north as the present-day Metropolitan (highway 40), south to Villeray St., east to St-Hubert and west to Foucher. The owner, one Stanislas Jarry, broke the land up into 680 lots at the beginning of the 20th century. Other members of his family owned land in what would eventually be called Villeray‚ÄìSaint-Michel‚ÄìParc-Extension. Presently the district of Villeray is enclosed between Avenue Casgrain in the west, Boulevard Jean-Talon in the south, Rue Garnier in the east and the Metropolitan (highway 40) to the north.Map Zoom sur Villeray‚ÄîSaint- Michel‚ÄîParc-Extension by the City of Montreal These borders were determined in the creation of the borough of Villeray‚ÄìSaint-Michel‚ÄìParc-Extension, which was created on January 1, 2002, following the municipal reorganization of Montreal. A burst of development at the beginning of the 20th century Originally Villeray's houses were wooden ones, typically owned by workers, with sheds and stables in back. From 1915 to 1930, Villeray saw a boom which brought with it the need for schools, churches, a public bath and a fire station, built at the corner of Jarry and St-Hubert in 1912. Construction of the first public bath The imposing Montreal Institute for the Deaf, with a fa√ßade made of Montreal stone, was built near Faillon and de Castelnau during World War I by the Clercs de Saint-Viateur. Post World War II After World War II the typical Montreal duplex and triplex became the standard domestic architecture in Villeray, and the town filled up with rows of these buildings, whose spiral front staircases, back alleys, clotheslines and sheds are well- known features of residential Montreal. Raoul Jarry Raoul Jarry, Montreal city councillor from 1921 and member of its executive committee from 1924, saw in Jarry Park a means of offering some open green space to fight the diseases that spread among children in summertime and to encourage them to participate in sports and families to picnic and relax together. It was due to his efforts that the city purchased this land, which had up till then been leased from the corporation of its original owner, Stanley Clark Bagg (memorialized by Bagg Street further south in Plateau Mont-Royal). Raoul Jarry died in 1930 and the park is named after him (whereas Jarry Street is named after Bernard Bleignier dit Jarry, an 18th-century landlord who Jarry was descended). Brother Henri (1893-1961) would become alderman for Villeray from 1934 to 1938.https://archivesdemontreal.ica-atom.org/fonds-henri-jarry-1893-1961 21st century The 21st century is seeing more and more people moving into Villeray. Attracting them to the area is its somewhat central location on the Island of Montreal, its access to Metro stations, its proximity to Jean Talon Market and Little Italy, and it is relatively close to shopping areas like Rockland Center and March√© Central. Along with the revitalization of Jarry Park, the area is increasingly more popular compared to the 1990s. This in turn, along with the new Universit√© de Montr√©al campus in the neighbouring Park Extension, has caused gentrification issues to affect the area gradually and steadily since around 2010.

Donohue Teaching and legal career Donohue is a former teacher and lawyer who was once an aide to State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. She graduated from The College of New Rochelle and received a Master's Degree in Education from Russell Sage College. In 1983, she received a law degree from Albany Law School. In addition to working for Bruno, Donohue served as an Assistant County Attorney in Rensselaer County. During her time in the county attorney's office, she worked on Family Court and juvenile justice issues. District Attorney and Justice of the Supreme Court Donohue served as the district attorney of Rensselaer County for several years in the 1990s. During her two terms as district attorney, she prosecuted over 5,000 cases a year. She handled several cases herself. In 1996, she was elected as a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court.Mary Donohue Introduces Herself and Her Job. New York Times Serving as a state judge, Donohue handled both civil and criminal cases. She resigned from her judgeship in 1998, when Pataki picked her as a running mate. Lieutenant Governor Donohue was selected as the running mate to Gov. George Pataki in his 1998 re-election bid. After she and Gov. Pataki won their 1998 election, Donohue was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of New York on January 1, 1999, replacing Betsy McCaughey Ross. Donohue was not known to be a powerful Lieutenant Governor, or to enjoy a close relationship with Gov. Pataki. =School violence= When Donohue became Lieutenant Governor, Gov. Pataki appointed her to head a special task force on school violence issues. Gov. Pataki said that he designated Donohue to head the task force because of her background as a teacher and district attorney. According to her state website, Donohue spent a year traveling the state meeting with teachers, parents, students, and law enforcement to discuss school violence issues. As a part of her work, Donohue formulated a series of recommendations, signed into law by Pataki in 2000. Since 1999, Donohue started to spend time traveling the state promoting school violence prevention and to implement the recommendations of her task force. In 2005, Donohue led a state program, comprising several agencies, to determine best practices in the area of school violence prevention. Part of the recommendations made by Donohue's task force included giving teacher authority to have disruptive students removed from classrooms, creating character education curricula in school districts, and making violence against a teacher in a classroom a felony. =Quality communities= In 2000, Pataki appointed Donohue to chair a task force on quality communities in New York. Donohue's task force met around the state to discuss land use policies, economic development, and growth issues. The panel issued 41 recommendations on preserving community character statewide. After the conclusion of the task force, Donohue served as Chairwoman of the Quality Communities Working Group, which oversaw implementation of the task force's recommendations and the awarding of quality communities grants to towns statewide. According to the website for the Quality Communities Clearinghouse, Donohue's panel made recommendations in the areas of neighborhood preservation, open space conservation, farmland preservation, economic development, land use planning, transportation, and technology. Donohue has traveled the state hosting roundtable discussion on quality communities issues since 2000. In that role, she worked with Secretaries of State Alexander Treadwell, Randy Daniels, and Christopher Jacobs on local government issues. =Small business, aging, homeland security, and criminal justice= In 2001, Donohue chaired a task force on small business issues in the state. In that role, she met with small business owners and developed policy recommendations for governor on these issues. During her second term, Donohue frequently traveled the state promoting homeland security issues, drunk driving prevention, and criminal justice. In 2005, Donohue was named by Pataki as the Chairwoman of the New York State Delegation to the White House Conference on Aging. Before the conference, Donohue held a series of community meetings around the state on aging issues. Statewide campaigns =1998= In 1997, Pataki announced that he was dropping Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross from his 1998 reelection ticket. Pataki and McCaughey Ross had feuded for much of his term. McCaughey Ross would later become a Democrat and run unsuccessfully for governor in 1998. Following Pataki's announcement regarding McCaughey Ross, Donohue was reported as a possible replacement running mate. In addition, State Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro, State Senator Mary Lou Rath and Erie County Comptroller Nancy Naples were reported as possible running mates. In the spring of 1998, Pataki announced his selection of Donohue. In the 1998 general election, the Pataki-Donohue ticket defeated the Democratic ticket of New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone for governor and Brighton Town Supervisor Sandra Frankel for lieutenant governor. =2002= In 2002, there were reports that Donohue was being pushed out by Pataki as his running mate. The reports said that either Secretary of State Randy Daniels or Erie County Executive Joel Giambra would replace her on the Pataki ticket. Donohue beat back the challenge. There were reports that she was offered the Republican nomination for state attorney general to challenge Eliot Spitzer in 2002 so that she would not seek re- election. She declined the nomination, which went to Judge Dora Irizarry instead. In September 2002 Donohue and Pataki fought to win the nomination of the New York State Independence Party. Donohue won her primary, but Pataki lost to Rochester businessman Tom Golisano. This made Donohue both the running mate of Pataki and Golisano in the November election and made her the officeholder who won the most votes in New York State in 2002. The Pataki/Donohue ticket defeated the Democratic ticket of State Comptroller Carl McCall for governor and businessman Dennis Mehiel for lieutenant governor. =2006= After Pataki announced in 2005 that he would not seek reelection, Donohue was seen as a possible candidate for governor. However, she later announced that she would not run for office in 2006 either. Federal judgeship nomination On March 3, 2006, Donohue informed reporters that her name had been submitted by Pataki to President George W. Bush for nomination to a United States District Court judgeship in Upstate New York. On June 27, 2006, the White House announced that Donohue has been nominated to the judgeship. Her nomination went to the US Senate for confirmation, where it was not brought up by the Senate Judiciary Committee before the 109th Congress adjourned on December 10, 2006. Senator Charles Schumer indicated that he did not see Donohue's nomination being able to be confirmed by the Senate in the 110th Congress, when the Democrats have the Senate majority. State Court of Claims On December 13, 2006, Pataki nominated her to a seat as a Judge of the New York Court of Claims. She was confirmed that day by the State Senate for term expiring in March 2015. Court of Claims Judges preside over lawsuits against the State of New York and various independent state agencies. She took office as a judge after her term as lieutenant governor expired at midnight on December 31, 2006. She retired from the Court of Claims in May, 2009.

He was raised in Bakersfield, California, has lived in New York City since 1978, and is the author of ten novels to date. His work combines experimental technique with a direct emotionality, often dealing with the anguish inherent in human communication. Excerpted in many print and online magazines, his work has won a Notable Stories in StorySouths Million Writers Award, and been nominated four times for the Pushcart Prize. Earlier books (to 2000) In his first novel, Our Plague (A Film from New York) (1993), the protagonist is an underground filmmaker alienated from his own body, disgusted by his own careerism, and awash in apocalyptic visions. Not a lucid book, rather a difficult one, though energetic and full of unexpected choices. The story in the brief The Walls Collide as You Expand, Dwarf Maple (1993) seems almost desiccated: a young woman grows up, meets a man on a train, and lives with him in a city. The writing, as such, is simple and spare, unlike that of his other books. Glass (Pray the Electrons Back to Sand) (1994), a \\"Television-War Novel\\" about the first Gulf War, blurs reality into its electronic media equivalent, to suggest a new, amoral, surrealistically detached technological level to the old horrors of war. The nearest to a conventional novel by this author. In Candyland It's Cool to Feed on Your Friends (1998), a strangely knotted and personal work, deals with an indigent photographer who loses his closest friends for the crime of having exploited them for his artwork. The frame provided for the narrative strongly implies that something like this took place in the author's own life. The visionary, messianic heroine of Daughter! I Forbid Your Recurring Dream! (2000) flings herself into all manner of self-expression, but willfully loses faith in each attempt at meaning, and each time ends up more broken, more solitary. Later books Stet (2006), Chapman's most ambitious book to date, takes the form of a bitter \\"Russian novel\\" about an ecstatic and weirdly oblivious Soviet filmmaker and painter, who ends up in prison camp as punishment for his private and antisocial tendencies. How is This Going to Continue? (2007), a shorter work in the form of an oratorio libretto, seems to carry the artist-figure, a composer this time, further into private grief and alienation. The subject of this \\"libretto\\" is the death of the composer's wife, followed by the composer's own death. The novel, if such it is, consists entirely of quotations from other sources (many of which are, however, invented). Degenerescence (2009) appears as a kind of endpoint of this alienated phase, where the author has finally turned away from the last of his own recognizable mannerisms, in favor of pseudo-ancient repetitive incantation about how the invention of narrative story causes the destruction of the hymn foundation of the world: what might be called a home-made Sumerian myth. The Rat Veda (2010), for all its dire setting (its \\"hero\\" is a rat in the subway), in fact marks a change for the brighter, in that as the rat waits to transcend his self-made imprisonment, he worships beauty in the form of an idealized love, a dancer who seems to exist just over his head. Qurratulain (2012) might be seen as the last in a \\"religious\\" trilogy (Degenerescence having drawn imagery from Sumerian myth, and The Rat Veda from devotional Hinduism). A Christian priest in the time of the monastic Desert Fathers falls in love with the title character, and together they go to the desert to pray and argue with God. As in Rat Veda, beauty and ecstatic love seem to outweigh all other aspects of existence.

Early life and career Sim Wong Hoo was born into a Zhao'an Hokkien family in Singapore and is an alumnus of Bukit Panjang Government High School. He graduated from the Electrical & Electronic Engineering faculty of Ngee Ann Polytechnic (then known as Ngee Ann Technical College) in 1975, after which he worked in the private engineering sector. On 1 July 1981, with a capital outlay of US$6,000, Sim (along with former schoolmate Ng Kai Wa) founded Creative Technology in the form of a computer repair shop in Pearl's Centre, in Chinatown. There he developed and sold an add-on memory board for the Apple II computer. Later, Creative began creating customized PCs adapted for the Chinese language, including enhanced audio capabilities that allowed the devices to produce speech and melodies. The success of this audio interface led to the development of the stand-alone sound card Sound Blaster. It was among the first dedicated audio processing cards widely available to general consumers. Creative dominated the PC audio market until the 2000s, when OEM PCs began to be built with integrated sound boards in the motherboard. Sound Blaster then found itself reduced to a niche product.

Khalil was best known for his integral role in the negotiations that led to the 1979 Camp David Accord peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Mustafa Khalil accompanied Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on his historic first visit to Jerusalem, Israel, in November 1977 to meet with the Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin.

Duties and functions Many elected deputy mayors are members of the city council who are given the title and serve as acting mayor in the mayor's absence. Appointive deputy mayors serve at the pleasure of the mayor and may function as chief operating officers. There may be within the same municipal government one or more deputy mayors appointed to oversee policy areas together with a popularly-elected vice mayor who serves as the mayor's successor in the event the office is vacated by death, resignation, disability, or impeachment. In other cities, the deputy mayor presides over the city council, and may not vote except to break ties. Like the deputy mayor in other systems, the popularly elected deputy mayor becomes an Acting Mayor in the original mayor's absence. As previously noted in some few cities, this office is elected separately and does not entail the elevation by the council of one of its members to be speaker. In some U.S. cities, the mayor and deputy mayor run together as a citywide ticket similar to how the president and vice president run at the national level. =New York City, New York, USA= In New York City, there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the First Deputy Mayor serves as the general deputy mayor for the Mayor of New York City. =St. Louis, Missouri, USA= In St. Louis, Missouri, there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the deputy Mayors serves as the general deputy's mayors for the Mayor of St. Louis. =Cincinnati, Ohio, USA= In Cincinnati, Ohio, the vice mayor is appointed by the mayor from amongst the elected city council members. As of January 2, 2018, Christopher Smitherman has served as the vice mayor of Cincinnati after being appointed by Mayor John Cranley to replace former Vice Mayor David S. Mann. =Israel= In Israel, according to the Local Authorities (Election and Term of Mayor and Deputy Mayors) Act, 5735-1975, a Mayor is usually elected in \\"personal, general, direct, equal and secret elections\\", with election by a local council being made only if no candidate runs for mayor, a candidate for mayor in a single-candidate election is rejected (in Israel, unlike in the UK, if only one candidate runs he is not automatically elected, and voters would vote either for that candidate or against him), or both candidates advancing to the runoff received an equal number of votes and the tie remains unbroken after adding the number of first-round votes cast for them with the number of second-round votes cast for them. However, deputy mayors are always elected by the local council, of which one is (or, in certain local authorities two are) the Designated Acting Mayor, elected after nomination by the Mayor. =France= The French term d√©put√©-maire does not mean \\"deputy mayor\\", but refers to a mayor who is also a deputy of the National Assembly of France. As of 31 March 2017, a mayor cannot hold both posts (article LO 141-1 of the electoral code).

The battalion was sent to Singapore in April 1961 from where it was deployed to Brunei in December 1962 in order to help suppress the Brunei Revolt at an early stage of the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. This included a successful air assault on the rebel‚Äìheld Shell oilfields at Seria, with the airfield quickly recaptured and 48 hostages released. Returning to Singapore in February 1962, the battalion went back to Borneo three months later for a further operational tour, mainly consisting of long patrols and manning outlying garrisons on the border with Indonesia. On return to Scotland in January 1964, the battalion was based at Milton Bridge Camp, a former facility for German Prisoners of War, located south east of Glencorse Barracks. In June 1964 the battalion moved to Mercer Barracks at Osnabr√ºck Garrison, part of British Army of the Rhine, remaining there until August 1966 when it moved to Wavell Barracks in Berlin. The battalion returned to Redford Barracks in September 1968 from where units were deployed to Sharjah on the Persian Gulf in May 1969, while in July 1970 it undertook ceremonial duties at that year's Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. =1971‚Äì1982= In April 1971 the battalion returned to Osnabr√ºck Garrison, from where they were deployed for a total of three separate four‚Äìmonth operational tours at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland: November 1971 ‚Äì March 1972 (East Belfast); July ‚Äì October 1972: (Dungannon) and December 1973 ‚Äì April 1974 (West Belfast). In June 1976 the battalion returned to Scotland, this time to Ritchie Camp, West Lothian, from where parts of the battalion were deployed to Belize, Gibraltar and twice to Northern Ireland, April ‚Äì August 1978 (North Armagh) and July ‚Äì December 1979 (South Armagh). During this tour, the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel David Blair, was killed by one of two roadside bombs that took the lives of a total of eighteen soldiers at Warrenpoint, County Down.Barzilay, David: British Army in Ulster, volume 4. p. 94. Century Books, 1981. . A total of seven Queen's Own Highlanders were killed in Northern Ireland between 1973 and 1990. Also Pte Mark Carnie, attached from the Black Watch, Highlander Regimental Journal, Summer 2003, p 21. In March 1980 the battalion was despatched for a tour at Stanley Fort in Hong Kong before moving to Tidworth in November 1981. In spite of it then being the Army's Spearhead battalion ‚Äì kept in readiness for rapid deployment worldwide ‚Äì it did not take part in the Falklands War that commenced in April 1982. It was, however, stationed in the Falklands Islands immediately after the war, from July ‚Äì December 1982, and led the operation to restore normality on the islands. This work resulted in the award to the regiment of the Wilkinson Sword of Peace, bestowed annually on the unit of the British Armed Forces that has made the greatest contribution to community relations. =1983‚Äì1994= In November 1983, the battalion moved to Alexander Barracks, Aldergrove, as the Northern Ireland resident battalion, and on to Fort George in November 1985. In March 1988 the battalion moved to Buller Barracks in M√ºnster, Germany, from where units were again deployed to Northern Ireland for five months from March 1990 (Belfast) and to Saudi Arabia in January 1991, where they took part in the Gulf War. In the Gulf, the battalion was split up to support other units, including attachments to the 1st Royal Scots and 3rd Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (3RRF) to bring these units up to strength. Three Queen's Own Highlanders serving with 3 RRF were among eleven soldiers killed in a friendly fire incident, when two US A-10 aircraft mistakenly bombed a UK armoured column. After the war, the battalion returned to M√ºnster with a further six month deployment to Northern Ireland (Belfast) from November 1992. The battalion returned to Scotland in October 1993 and moved into Dreghorn Barracks, near Edinburgh. Due to the Options for Change defence review the battalion was amalgamated with 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders on 17 September 1994 to form 1st Battalion, Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons). There was a high‚Äìprofile, although ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to stop the proposed amalgamation. Territorial Army and Cadet Force After the formation of the Queen's Own Highlanders in February 1961, the part‚Äìtime Territorial Army units of the pre-amalgamation regiments continued unchanged, with the 11th battalion, Seaforth Highlanders (TA) and the 4/5 battalion Cameron Highlanders (TA). In April 1967 both were disbanded on the formation of the 3rd (Territorial) battalion, Queen's Own Highlanders, which was itself disbanded in March 1969. From then on, the part‚Äìtime element of all Highland regiments were included within the 51st Highland Volunteers. The Army Cadet Force (ACF) units in the northern counties of Scotland retained the designation and cap badges of the Seaforth and Cameron Highlanders until 1968, when they became the North Highland ACF and adopted the Queen's Own Highlanders badge. In 1975 they became the 1st Cadet Battalion Queen's Own Highlanders ACF and, in April 1982, the Queen's Own Highlanders Battalion ACF. In September 1999 the battalion was re-badged under the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) and renamed to 1st Battalion The Highlanders, Army Cadet Force. Regimental museum The Highlanders' Museum (Queen's Own Highlanders Collection) is based at Fort George, near Inverness, Scotland. Tartans The regiment wore the Mackenzie tartan kilt (as worn by the former Seaforth Highlanders) and Cameron of Erracht tartan trews, with the reverse for pipers, drummers and band members.

Definition The velocity field of a flow can be split into a mean part and a fluctuating part using Reynolds decomposition. We write :u_i = \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i',\\\\, with \\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) being the flow velocity vector having components u_i in the x_i coordinate direction (with x_i denoting the components of the coordinate vector \\\\mathbf{x}). The mean velocities \\\\overline{u_i} are determined by either time averaging, spatial averaging or ensemble averaging, depending on the flow under study. Further u'_i denotes the fluctuating (turbulence) part of the velocity. We consider a homogeneous fluid, whose density œÅ is taken to be a constant. For such a fluid, the components œÑ'ij of the Reynolds stress tensor are defined as: :\\\\tau'_{ij} \\\\equiv \\\\rho\\\\,\\\\overline{ u'_i\\\\, u'_j},\\\\, Another ‚Äì often used ‚Äì definition, for constant density, of the Reynolds stress components is: :\\\\tau_{ij} \\\\equiv \\\\overline{u'_i\\\\, u'_j},\\\\, which has the dimensions of velocity squared, instead of stress. Averaging and the Reynolds stress To illustrate, Cartesian vector index notation is used. For simplicity, consider an incompressible fluid: Given the fluid velocity u_i as a function of position and time, write the average fluid velocity as \\\\overline{u_i}, and the velocity fluctuation is u'_i. Then u_i = \\\\overline{u_i} + u'_i. The conventional ensemble rules of averaging are that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\overline{\\\\bar a} &= \\\\bar a, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{a + b} &= \\\\bar a + \\\\bar b, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{a \\\\bar b} &= \\\\bar a \\\\bar b. \\\\end{align} One splits the Euler equations or the Navier-Stokes equations into an average and a fluctuating part. One finds that upon averaging the fluid equations, a stress on the right hand side appears of the form \\\\rho \\\\overline{ u'_i u'_j} . This is the Reynolds stress, conventionally written R_{ij} : : R_{ij} \\\\ \\\\equiv\\\\ \\\\rho \\\\overline{ u'_i u'_j} The divergence of this stress is the force density on the fluid due to the turbulent fluctuations. Reynolds averaging of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations For instance, for an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid, the continuity and momentum equations‚Äîthe incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations‚Äîcan be written (in a non-conservative form) as :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x_i}=0, and :\\\\rho \\\\frac{Du_i}{Dt} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\mu \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u_i}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_j} \\\\right), where D/Dt is the Lagrangian derivative or the substantial derivative, :\\\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + u_j \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_j}. Defining the flow variables above with a time- averaged component and a fluctuating component, the continuity and momentum equations become :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_i} = 0, and :\\\\rho \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_j} + u_j' \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right] = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\bar{p} + p' \\\\right) }{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\mu \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_j} \\\\right]. Examining one of the terms on the left hand side of the momentum equation, it is seen that :\\\\left( \\\\overline{u_j} + u_j' \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_j} + u_j' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j} - \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_j} + u_j' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j}, where the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the continuity equation. Accordingly, the momentum equation becomes :\\\\rho \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_j} + u_j' \\\\right) }{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right] = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left( \\\\bar{p} + p' \\\\right) }{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\mu \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i} + u_i' \\\\right)}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_j} \\\\right]. Now the continuity and momentum equations will be averaged. The ensemble rules of averaging need to be employed, keeping in mind that the average of products of fluctuating quantities will not in general vanish. After averaging, the continuity and momentum equations become :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial x_i} = 0, and :\\\\rho \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}\\\\, \\\\overline{u_j}}{\\\\partial x_j} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i' u_j'}}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right] = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{p}}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_j}. Using the product rule on one of the terms of the left hand side, it is revealed that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}\\\\, \\\\overline{u_j}}{\\\\partial x_j} = \\\\overline{u_j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial x_j} + \\\\overline{u_i} {\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_j}}{\\\\partial x_j}}, where the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the averaged continuity equation. The averaged momentum equation now becomes, after a rearrangement: :\\\\rho \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\overline{u_j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right] = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{p}}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\left( \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial x_j} - \\\\rho \\\\overline{u_i' u_j'} \\\\right), where the Reynolds stresses, \\\\rho \\\\overline{u_i' u_j'}, are collected with the viscous normal and shear stress terms, \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i}}{\\\\partial x_j}.  Discussion  The time evolution equation of Reynolds stress was firstly given by Eq.(1.6) in Zhou Peiyuan's paper . The equation in modern form is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime}}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\bar{u}_k \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime}}{\\\\partial x_k} = -\\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_k^\\\\prime}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u}_j}{\\\\partial x_k} -\\\\overline{u_j^\\\\prime u_k^\\\\prime}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u}_i}{\\\\partial x_k} +\\\\overline{ \\\\frac{p^\\\\prime}{\\\\rho}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i^\\\\prime}{\\\\partial x_j} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_j^\\\\prime}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\right) }  \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime u_k^\\\\prime} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\overline{p^\\\\prime u_i^\\\\prime } }{\\\\rho} \\\\delta_{jk} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\overline{p^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime } }{\\\\rho} \\\\delta_{ik}  u \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime}}{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\right) -2 u \\\\overline{\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i^\\\\prime}{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_j^\\\\prime}{\\\\partial x_k}} This equation is very complex. If \\\\overline{u_i^\\\\prime u_j^\\\\prime} is traced, turbulence kinetic energy is obtained. The last term u \\\\overline{\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i^\\\\prime}{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_j^\\\\prime}{\\\\partial x_k}} is turbulent dissipation rate. The question then is, what is the value of the Reynolds stress? This has been the subject of intense modeling and interest, for roughly the past century. The problem is recognized as a closure problem, akin to the problem of closure in the BBGKY hierarchy. A transport equation for the Reynolds stress may be found by taking the outer product of the fluid equations for the fluctuating velocity, with itself. One finds that the transport equation for the Reynolds stress includes terms with higher-order correlations (specifically, the triple correlation \\\\overline{v'_i v'_j v'_k} ) as well as correlations with pressure fluctuations (i.e. momentum carried by sound waves). A common solution is to model these terms by simple ad hoc prescriptions. The theory of the Reynolds stress is quite analogous to the kinetic theory of gases, and indeed the stress tensor in a fluid at a point may be seen to be the ensemble average of the stress due to the thermal velocities of molecules at a given point in a fluid. Thus, by analogy, the Reynolds stress is sometimes thought of as consisting of an isotropic pressure part, termed the turbulent pressure, and an off-diagonal part which may be thought of as an effective turbulent viscosity. In fact, while much effort has been expended in developing good models for the Reynolds stress in a fluid, as a practical matter, when solving the fluid equations using computational fluid dynamics, often the simplest turbulence models prove the most effective. One class of models, closely related to the concept of turbulent viscosity, are the k-epsilon turbulence models, based upon coupled transport equations for the turbulent energy density k (similar to the turbulent pressure, i.e. the trace of the Reynolds stress) and the turbulent dissipation rate \\\\epsilon . Typically, the average is formally defined as an ensemble average as in statistical ensemble theory. However, as a practical matter, the average may also be thought of as a spatial average over some length scale, or a temporal average. Note that, while formally the connection between such averages is justified in equilibrium statistical mechanics by the ergodic theorem, the statistical mechanics of hydrodynamic turbulence is currently far from understood. In fact, the Reynolds stress at any given point in a turbulent fluid is somewhat subject to interpretation, depending upon how one defines the average.

He is best remembered for his theme music to the TV series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. Biography Jupp was born in Brighton in 1922 and began to study piano at seven. He left school and started his musical career at fourteen, playing in nightclubs. He joined the R.A.F. at the outbreak of World War II. When the war ended, he went to London, where he soon became a prominent member of several leading big bands, working as a pianist, composer and arranger. Jupp worked as an arranger for both of Britain's top bandleaders of the period, Stanley Black and Ted Heath. Heath's all-star staff of arrangers included Jupp, John Dankworth, George Shearing and Wally Stott (later the musical director of The Goon Show). As pianist and arranger Jupp was also a long-serving member of the Oscar Rabin Band, one of Britain's most popular dance orchestras of that period. In 1951 Jupp formed his own orchestra at the request of the BBC and began making regular radio broadcasts and also appeared in the Hammer Films TV series Bands on Parade. He began writing music for films in Britain, beginning with the crime drama The Secret Place (1957). Jupp first visited Australia in 1960 under short-term contract to the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and during his visit he arranged the music for the single First Kiss / My Secret (July 1960) by pop duo the Allen Brothers, which included Peter Allen. Jupp returned to England later in the year but in 1961 he was invited to join the ABC as musical director of its light entertainment department, based in Sydney. Soon after taking up his new post he formed the Eric Jupp Orchestra and launched his popular and long-running weekly ABC-TV series The Magic of Music, which was seen in 29 countries and ran from 1961 to 1974. The series featured mainly \\"orchestral pops\\" and light classical music, but it also included regular jazz segments featuring notable Australian performers such as Don Burrows and George Golla. The success of the series led to a contract with EMI's Columbia label and a string of popular \\"Magic of Music\\" LPs that continued to the mid-1970s. The LPs (and the show) often featured vocalists Shirley McDonald (whom Jupp married in the 1960s) and Neil Williams. Jupp soon made a name for himself as a leading composer for film and TV in Australia. Undoubtedly his best-remembered composition is the theme for the hugely popular 1960s TV series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. The long version (the B-side on the record) has lyrics written by Ted Roberts. In early 1968 Jupp moved to Norfolk Island, commuting by air to the mainland for his TV, radio and film work. Credits Among his later film and television credits, Jupp was the music director for the 1971 Fauna Productions adventure series Barrier Reef. He composed music for the TV series Bailey's Bird (1977) and wrote the score for Michael Pate's 1979 film version of Colleen McCullough's first novel, Tim, starring the then unknown Mel Gibson. It was Jupp who persuaded McCullough to settle on Norfolk Island after she shot to fame with her second novel, The Thorn Birds. His last major TV credit was the score for the early 1990s remake of Skippy. In his retirement, Jupp and his family moved to Launceston in Tasmania. He died there in January 2003, after several months' illness, survived by his third wife Anita, his two daughters Linda and Catherine, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

Linear probing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving collisions in hash tables, data structures for maintaining a collection of key‚Äìvalue pairs and looking up the value associated with a given key. It was invented in 1954 by Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw, and Arthur Samuel and first analyzed in 1963 by Donald Knuth. Along with quadratic probing and double hashing, linear probing is a form of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key‚Äìvalue pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell. As write, \\"Hash tables are the most commonly used nontrivial data structures, and the most popular implementation on standard hardware uses linear probing, which is both fast and simple.\\" Linear probing can provide high performance because of its good locality of reference, but is more sensitive to the quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. Good results can also be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash. Operations Linear probing is a component of open addressing schemes for using a hash table to solve the dictionary problem. In the dictionary problem, a data structure should maintain a collection of key‚Äìvalue pairs subject to operations that insert or delete pairs from the collection or that search for the value associated with a given key. In open addressing solutions to this problem, the data structure is an array (the hash table) whose cells (when nonempty) each store a single key‚Äìvalue pair. A hash function is used to map each key into the cell of where that key should be stored, typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near each other in the table. A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a key into a cell that is already occupied by a different key. Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new key into the closest following empty cell.. =Search= To search for a given key , the cells of are examined, beginning with the cell at index (where is the hash function) and continuing to the adjacent cells , , ..., until finding either an empty cell or a cell whose stored key is . If a cell containing the key is found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot be in the table, because it would have been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the key is not present in the dictionary. =Insertion= To insert a key‚Äìvalue pair into the table (possibly replacing any existing pair with the same key), the insertion algorithm follows the same sequence of cells that would be followed for a search, until finding either an empty cell or a cell whose stored key is . The new key‚Äìvalue pair is then placed into that cell. If the insertion would cause the load factor of the table (its fraction of occupied cells) to grow above some preset threshold, the whole table may be replaced by a new table, larger by a constant factor, with a new hash function, as in a dynamic array. Setting this threshold close to zero and using a high growth rate for the table size leads to faster hash table operations but greater memory usage than threshold values close to one and low growth rates. A common choice would be to double the table size when the load factor would exceed 1/2, causing the load factor to stay between 1/4 and 1/2.. Sedgewick and Wayne also halve the table size when a deletion would cause the load factor to become too low, causing them to use a wider range [1/8,1/2] in the possible values of the load factor. =Deletion= When a key‚Äìvalue pair is deleted, it may be necessary to move another pair backwards into its cell, to prevent searches for the moved key from finding an empty cell. It is also possible to remove a key‚Äìvalue pair from the dictionary. However, it is not sufficient to do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present. Instead, when a cell is emptied, it is necessary to search forward through the following cells of the table until finding either another empty cell or a key that can be moved to cell (that is, a key whose hash value is equal to or earlier than ). When an empty cell is found, then emptying cell is safe and the deletion process terminates. But, when the search finds a key that can be moved to cell , it performs this move. This has the effect of speeding up later searches for the moved key, but it also empties out another cell, later in the same block of occupied cells. The search for a movable key continues for the new emptied cell, in the same way, until it terminates by reaching a cell that was already empty. In this process of moving keys to earlier cells, each key is examined only once. Therefore, the time to complete the whole process is proportional to the length of the block of occupied cells containing the deleted key, matching the running time of the other hash table operations. Alternatively, it is possible to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key‚Äìvalue pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key‚Äìvalue pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys. Properties Linear probing provides good locality of reference, which causes it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, it can provide very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.. Analysis Using linear probing, dictionary operations can be implemented in constant expected time. In other words, insert, remove and search operations can be implemented in O(1), as long as the load factor of the hash table is a constant strictly less than one. In more detail, the time for any particular operation (a search, insertion, or deletion) is proportional to the length of the contiguous block of occupied cells at which the operation starts. If all starting cells are equally likely, in a hash table with cells, then a maximal block of occupied cells will have probability of containing the starting location of a search, and will take time whenever it is the starting location. Therefore, the expected time for an operation can be calculated as the product of these two terms, , summed over all of the maximal blocks of contiguous cells in the table. A similar sum of squared block lengths gives the expected time bound for a random hash function (rather than for a random starting location into a specific state of the hash table), by summing over all the blocks that could exist (rather than the ones that actually exist in a given state of the table), and multiplying the term for each potential block by the probability that the block is actually occupied. That is, defining to be the event that there is a maximal contiguous block of occupied cells of length beginning at index , the expected time per operation is :E[T] = O(1) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{k=1}^n O(k^2/N) \\\\operatorname{Pr}[\\\\operatorname{Block}(i,k)]. This formula can be simplified by replacing by a simpler necessary condition , the event that at least elements have hash values that lie within a block of cells of length . After this replacement, the value within the sum no longer depends on , and the factor cancels the terms of the outer summation. These simplifications lead to the bound :E[T] \\\\le O(1) + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n O(k^2) \\\\operatorname{Pr}[\\\\operatorname{Full}(k)]. But by the multiplicative form of the Chernoff bound, when the load factor is bounded away from one, the probability that a block of length contains at least hashed values is exponentially small as a function of , causing this sum to be bounded by a constant independent of .. It is also possible to perform the same analysis using Stirling's approximation instead of the Chernoff bound to estimate the probability that a block contains exactly hashed values.. In terms of the load factor , the expected time for a successful search is , and the expected time for an unsuccessful search (or the insertion of a new key) is .. For constant load factors, with high probability, the longest probe sequence (among the probe sequences for all keys stored in the table) has logarithmic length.. Choice of hash function Because linear probing is especially sensitive to unevenly distributed hash values, it is important to combine it with a high- quality hash function that does not produce such irregularities. The analysis above assumes that each key's hash is a random number independent of the hashes of all the other keys. This assumption is unrealistic for most applications of hashing. However, random or pseudorandom hash values may be used when hashing objects by their identity rather than by their value. For instance, this is done using linear probing by the IdentityHashMap class of the Java collections framework.. The hash value that this class associates with each object, its identityHashCode, is guaranteed to remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary.. Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object, and is not required to be related to the object's address or value, its construction may involve slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator. For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.. For most applications of hashing, it is necessary to compute the hash function for each value every time that it is hashed, rather than once when its object is created. In such applications, random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values, because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes. And cryptographic hash functions (which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables.. Instead, other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised. These methods compute the hash function quickly, and can be proven to work well with linear probing. In particular, linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of -independent hashing, a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any -tuple of distinct keys to any -tuple of indexes. The parameter can be thought of as a measure of hash function quality: the larger is, the more time it will take to compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions. For linear probing, 5-independence is enough to guarantee constant expected time per operation, while some 4-independent hash functions perform badly, taking up to logarithmic time per operation. Another method of constructing hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key is computed by using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, it is possible to compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices... In an experimental comparison, Richter et al. found that the Multiply-Shift family of hash functions (defined as h_z(x) = (x \\\\cdot z \\\\bmod 2^w) \\\\div 2^{w-d}) was \\"the fastest hash function when integrated with all hashing schemes, i.e., producing the highest throughputs and also of good quality\\" whereas tabulation hashing produced \\"the lowest throughput\\".. They point out that each table look-up require several cycles, being more expensive than simple arithmetic operations. They also found MurmurHash to be superior than tabulation hashing: \\"By studying the results provided by Mult and Murmur, we think that the trade-off for by tabulation (...) is less attractive in practice\\". History The idea of an associative array that allows data to be accessed by its value rather than by its address dates back to the mid-1940s in the work of Konrad Zuse and Vannevar Bush,. but hash tables were not described until 1953, in an IBM memorandum by Hans Peter Luhn. Luhn used a different collision resolution method, chaining, rather than linear probing.. summarizes the early history of linear probing. It was the first open addressing method, and was originally synonymous with open addressing. According to Knuth, it was first used by Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw (n√©e Boehme), and Arthur Samuel in 1954, in an assembler program for the IBM 701 computer. The first published description of linear probing is by , who also credits Samuel, Amdahl, and Boehme but adds that \\"the system is so natural, that it very likely may have been conceived independently by others either before or since that time\\".. Another early publication of this method was by Soviet researcher Andrey Ershov, in 1958.. Translated from Doklady AN USSR 118 (3): 427‚Äì430, 1958, by Morris D. Friedman. Linear probing is described as algorithm A2. The first theoretical analysis of linear probing, showing that it takes constant expected time per operation with random hash functions, was given by Knuth. Sedgewick calls Knuth's work \\"a landmark in the analysis of algorithms\\". Significant later developments include a more detailed analysis of the probability distribution of the running time,.. and the proof that linear probing runs in constant time per operation with practically usable hash functions rather than with the idealized random functions assumed by earlier analysis.

Quadratic probing operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial until an open slot is found. An example sequence using quadratic probing is: H + 1^2 , H + 2^2 , H + 3^2 , H + 4^2 , ... , H + k^2 Quadratic probing can be a more efficient algorithm in an open addressing table, since it better avoids the clustering problem that can occur with linear probing, although it is not immune. It also provides good memory caching because it preserves some locality of reference; however, linear probing has greater locality and, thus, better cache performance. Quadratic function Let h(k) be a hash function that maps an element k to an integer in [0, m‚àí1], where m is the size of the table. Let the ith probe position for a value k be given by the function :h(k,i) = h(k) + c_1 i + c_2 i^2 \\\\pmod{m} where c2 ‚â† 0. (If c2 = 0, then h(k,i) degrades to a linear probe. For a given hash table, the values of c1 and c2 remain constant. Examples: *If h(k,i) = (h(k) + i + i^2) \\\\pmod{m}, then the probe sequence will be h(k), h(k)+2, h(k)+6, ... *For m = 2n, a good choice for the constants are c1 = c2 = 1/2, as the values of h(k,i) for i in [0, m‚àí1] are all distinct. This leads to a probe sequence of h(k), h(k)+1, h(k)+3, h(k)+6, ... (the triangular numbers) where the values increase by 1, 2, 3, ... *For prime m > 2, most choices of c1 and c2 will make h(k,i) distinct for i in [0, (m‚àí1)/2]. Such choices include c1 = c2 = 1/2, c1 = c2 = 1, and c1 = 0, c2 = 1. However, there are only m/2 distinct probes for a given element, requiring other techniques to guarantee that insertions will succeed when the load factor is exceeds 1/2. Limitations When using quadratic probing, however (with the exception of triangular number cases for a hash table of size 2^n), there is no guarantee of finding an empty cell once the table becomes more than half full, or even before this if the table size is composite, because collisions must be resolved using half of the table at most. The inverse of this can be proven as such: Suppose a hash table has size p (a prime greater than 3), with an initial location h(k) and two alternative locations h(k) + x^2 \\\\pmod{p} and h(k) + y^2 \\\\pmod{p} (where 0 \\\\leq x and y \\\\leq p / 2). If these two locations point to the same key space, but x eq y, then :h(k) + x^2 = h(k) + y^2 \\\\pmod{p} :x^2 = y^2 \\\\pmod{p} :x^2 - y^2 = 0 \\\\pmod{p} :(x - y)(x + y) = 0 \\\\pmod{p}. As p is a prime number, either (x - y) or (x + y) must be divisible by p. Since x and y are different (modulo p), (x - y) eq 0, and since both variables are greater than zero, (x + y) eq 0. Thus, by contradiction, the first p / 2 alternative locations after h(k) must be unique, and subsequently, an empty space can always be found so long as at most p / 2 locations are filled (i.e., the hash table is not more than half full). =Alternating signs= If the sign of the offset is alternated (e.g. +1, ‚àí4, +9, ‚àí16, etc.), and if the number of buckets is a prime number p congruent to 3 modulo 4 (e.g. 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, etc.), then the first p offsets will be unique (modulo p). In other words, a permutation of 0 through p-1 is obtained, and, consequently, a free bucket will always be found as long as at least one exists.

He has worked extensively with Guru and DJ Premier of Gang Starr, whom he has known since he was in high school. Early life Jeru the Damaja was born February 14, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York, and spent his early years in the borough's East New York neighborhood, where he began rhyming at block parties as a youth. Career Davis first showcased his unique style to audiences on \\"I'm the Man\\", a track from Gang Starr's 1992 album Daily Operation. The following year he released his first single \\"Come Clean\\" which was produced by DJ Premier and became an underground hit. Davis's first album, The Sun Rises in the East, was released in 1994 and produced entirely by DJ Premier. The album was well-received but was criticized by the Fugees for its lyrics, particularly for the song \\"Da Bichez\\". Fugees member Pras lightly mentioned Jeru on the track \\"Zealots\\", from the group's landmark 1996 album The Score, with the line \\"No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet\\", referencing Jeru's single \\"You Can't Stop the Prophet\\". Jeru responded lightly in the intro of the track \\"Me or the Papes\\" and also on the track \\"Black Cowboys\\". Davis followed up in 1996 with his second album, Wrath of the Math, again produced solely by DJ Premier. The album was also widely acclaimed, although not on the same level as his debut. As on his first album, Jeru was critical of commercial hip-hop artists and the record labels that produced them such as Death Row Records and Bad Boy Entertainment; the latter he criticized on the concept track \\"One Day\\". After the release of Math, Jeru reportedly had a falling-out with DJ Premier and Guru. Jeru, however, has dismissed this and claimed that they wanted to go in different directions. Davis appeared semi-retired until 1999, when he released his third album, Heroz4Hire, released together with Mizmarvel, which was his first album under his then-newly created Know Savage Records. It featured the single \\"99.9%\\". His next album, Divine Design, released in 2003, was the first album under his new record label, Ashenafi Records. The album received little attention and mixed reviews. On April 2, 2007, during a La Coka Nostra concert at the Gramercy Theatre in New York, Jeru the Damaja came out for a surprise appearance to perform his song \\"D. Original\\". His album Still Rising was released on October 16, 2007. In 2009, Jeru started to collaborate with drum and bass producers. In 2009, he is featured on Kabuki's track \\"Watch Your Step\\", produced by Mainframe and also on \\"Open Up Their Eyes\\" by Italian producer Fabio Musta. He also collaborated with Group Home in 2010 for a song, \\"Guru\\" dedicated to the late rapper Guru. The next year, Jeru announced that he would be releasing a new record with production from '90s legends JuJu from the Beatnuts, Pete Rock, Large Professor and old collaborator DJ Premier but the album was not released. The same year he featured in the song \\"Odda≈Çbym\\" on the album Reedukacja of Polish hip-hop group Slums Attack (Peja, Dj Decks). Polish rap star OSTR also featured on it, and the album was a great success in Poland, selling out in the first couple of days. In 2012 Jeru featured in the song \\"The Mourning Son\\" on the album Remix with the Sun of French trip hop group Chinese Man. In July 2013, Jeru promised to soon release a new EP with production from Large Professor, PF Cuttin, Junkyard Ju, and Sabor. On June 17, 2014, Jeru released an EP through Hedspinn Records entitled The Hammer for digital download. He has a home in Berlin.

While selling radio time in 1946, a customer called Frankford Unity Grocery Store wanted to sponsor a music show; He decided that he would host the show himself to pick up a few extra dollars, and adopted the name \\"Frank Ford\\" for the show, a name that stuck with him for the rest of his life. In a 1995 interview with the Philadelphia Daily News, he wondered \\"what my name would be if the sponsor was the Piggly Wiggly stores.\\" Together with partners Lee Guber and Shelly Gross, he opened the Valley Forge Music Fair in Devon, Pennsylvania in 1955, featuring such shows as its inaugural production of The King and I. Originally housed in a tent, a building was constructed on the site as a theater. Opened on an investment of $100,000, the business brought in a profit of about $50,000 their first summer, leading to the establishment of the Westbury Music Fair in Westbury, New York and other locations in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and near both Baltimore and Washington, D.C., employing 2,000 performers and musicians at their peak. He hosted a late-night talk show on WPEN, becoming one of the first shows to use equipment that would allow the host to interact directly with callers on the air, unlike previous shows that had the host repeat the caller's comments. In the early 1970s, he did multiple interviews with \\"Unicorn Killer\\" Ira Einhorn, who had murdered girlfriend Holly Maddux, later recalling that Einhorn \\"stank even then\\". He bought station WDVT in 1985, where his programming included a show hosted by publisher Mark Segal of the Philadelphia Gay News that was the city's first show on commercial radio with a gay focus. The station closed in 1988. He retired in 2000, after WWDB-FM switched to an all-music format. Guests on Ford's programs during his career included Lenny Bruce, Abbie Hoffman, Sugar Ray Robinson and Eleanor Roosevelt. He owned Auto Sport Importers, a business that made reproductions of a classic 1938 Jaguar called the Squire SS100, a model that sold several hundred cars but was never a viable business. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Ford into their Hall of Fame in 2004. Personal Ford first met his future wife, Lynne Abraham, 24 years his junior, when she helped watch his ill father while his mother ran errands. Ford helped her get a job when she was a teen at the Valley Forge Music Fair he opened in 1955. Years later, when Abraham was in college, she would babysit for his stepdaughter. Abraham had been thinking of medical school and becoming a physician, when Ford told her \\"You ought to be a lawyer. You're forthright. You've got a big mouth. You talk well. You're smart.\\" He married Abraham in June 1977, when he was 60 years old and hosting local radio talk shows, and she was a 36-year-old municipal court judge. She was an elected judge serving on the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas when she was considering a run for Philadelphia District Attorney. Ford tried to dissuade her, telling Abraham that she would be losing her judicial tenure and would be taking a reduction in pay. Despite his objections, Abraham ran for office and was elected in 1991. Ford was extremely supportive of his wife's post, and regularly attended her press conferences and had her on his radio show until he became ill in October 2008. Ford was interested in architecture, art, dance, opera and food, and he and Abraham traveled extensively around the world.

Originally started under the direction of the abolitionist Stephen Peet and the Congregational Church (now the United Church of Christ) by charter of the Illinois legislature,The Chicago Theological Seminary Register, Volumes 1‚Äì4, By Chicago Theological Seminary CTS has retained its forward-looking activist outlook throughout its history, graduating alumni who include civil rights activists Jesse Jackson Sr. and Howard Schomer, social reformer Graham Taylor, and anti-Apartheid activist John W. de Gruchy. It is one of six seminaries affiliated with the United Church of Christ and follows an ecumenical tradition that stresses cooperation between different Christian denominations as well as interfaith understanding. The seminary has counted many highly respected religious activists and theologians among its faculty and alumni, including G. Campbell Morgan, Anton Boisen, Stephen G. Ray Jr., Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, and Otis Moss III, among others. Chicago Theological enrolls a diverse student population representing more than 40 different faith traditions, perspectives and denominations, and houses the Center for the Study of Black Faith and Life (CSBFL) and the Interreligious Institute (IRI). CTS students hold academic reciprocity with member schools of the Association of Chicago Theological Schools consortium. Besides being a seminary of the United Church of Christ, CTS also offers students coursework necessary to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church denomination. The first in many fields, CTS remains the first theological school to introduce the field education experience into a seminary curriculum, the first to create a distinct Department of Christian Sociology in an American theological school, the first seminary to award a degree in divinity to a woman in the US (Florence Fensham, 1902), the first seminary in the US to award the Martin Luther King Jr. an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree for his activism in the civil rights movement, the first to elect an African American to lead a predominantly white theological school (C. Shelby Rooks, 1974‚Äì1984), and the first free-standing Protestant seminary to endow a chair in Jewish Studies. History The Chicago Theological Seminary at its new location in Hyde Park, Chicago Unintimidated by controversy, Chicago Theological Seminary has enjoyed a distinguished record of setting trends in American faith life and leadership for more than a century. In the 1850s and 1860s, CTS founder Stephen Peet was a leader in a new generation of 19th Century American abolitionists no longer content to wait patiently for the end of slavery nor to tolerate those who defended it. Under his leadership, the seminary was active in the Underground Railroad and was a leading voice in the Christian Abolitionism movement. The very first CTS curriculum in 1855 was provided for a scattering of students among congregations and missions across the Midwest. Students were encouraged to learn by direct experience the facts of community life and church needs in a restless, experimental culture. Although such a practice was unknown at that time, this curriculum was the beginning of the first field education component ever introduced into seminary education. Field education is now a part of every accredited professional theological degree program. =Twentieth century= Because of a deeply held conviction that training for ministry needed to combine the study of Christian faith and the world of secular knowledge and action, during President Ozora Davis' tenure in 1900s, CTS moved to the vicinity of the University of Chicago. Under Ozora Davis' leadership the magnificent buildings of the seminary were financed and constructed, and the relationship with the University of Chicago firmly established. After recognizing Florence Fensham with the first American seminary degree awarded to a woman, Chicago Theological Seminary founded the Congregational Training School for Women in 1909 to provide Congregational women with advanced educational training. The school continued its mission until it was subsumed into the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1926. Florence Fensham was the school's first dean, succeeded by Agnes M. Taylor and Margaret M. Taylor after Dean Fensham died unexpectedly in 1912. The Chicago Theological Seminary decided to allow full acceptance of women to its programs in 1926, thereby eliminating the need for a separate institution for women. In 1892, CTS invited Graham Taylor, a professor of theology at Hartford Theological Seminary in Connecticut who had shown success in working with the poor, to establish the United States‚Äô first Department of Christian Sociology at CTS. Taylor soon began working closely with leading Chicago activist Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, one of America‚Äôs most famous settlement houses. Taylor established the Chicago Commons Settlement house in Chicago‚Äôs Fulton Market neighborhood, where with the help of CTS students he brought recreational clubs, classes, a day nursery, and a kindergarten to the working poor. The house had 25 residents and was open to all ethnic groups and religious denominations. Pressed for space, the Chicago Commons moved a few blocks north to the building formerly occupied by the Chicago Congregational Tabernacle, where Taylor expanded the courses offered into the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, which later became the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration. In the 1920s, Anton Boisen, a pioneer in the hospital chaplaincy movement and founder of the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students, began lecturing every fall quarter in the social ethics department of CTS. In 1932, he took over the chaplaincy of Elgin State Hospital (now Elgin Mental Health Center) and founded a Chicago arm of the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students. His work to help theological students better understand and minister to physically, mentally, and emotionally ill people ultimately led to the founding of the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education. Boisen's ashes are interred in the CTS cloisters. In 1957, as the American civil rights movement escalated, CTS became the first seminary in the United States to award Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King an Honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in recognition of his activism. Two years later CTS alumnus Howard Schomer, who had received his doctorate of divinity from CTS in 1954, became president of the seminary. Schomer was a conscientious objector and former aide to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights who had assisted in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. A close associate of King, Schomer in March, 1965 led a contingent of CTS students that included scholarship recipient Jesse Jackson, Sr. down to Selma, Alabama, to march with local residents against segregation. Jackson ended up dropping out of the Master of Divinity program just three courses short of degree completion in order to work on the civil rights movement full time. He went on to found Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity), a Chicago counterpart to the southern civil rights movement that focused on the economic empowerment of African- Americans and poor people of all races, and the Rainbow Coalition, which worked to unite various disenfranchised American groups, from racial minorities to small farmers, in order to exercise political power. CTS ultimately awarded Jackson the Master of Divinity in 2000 in recognition of his life‚Äôs work. Also during the 1960s, John W. de Gruchy, a white South African theologian who later became known for his work resisting Apartheid, attended CTS. Additionally in 1965, CTS launched a Doctorate of Religion program, one of the first professional doctorates in ministry. As standards for the professional doctorate were established by the Association of Theological Schools, the seminary became one of the initial group of six schools to have fully accredited programs of study for the Doctor of Ministry degree. In the 1980s, CTS engaged in the anti-Apartheid movement advocating for the divestment of resources from South Africa. In 1986, the seminary awarded Archbishop Desmond Tutu an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree for his transformational activism to liberate black South Africans. =Twenty-first century= In 2006, CTS launched the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ) Religious Studies Center (Queer Center), a grant-funded research program and resource for activists seeking to move toward greater justice and to encourage new conversations. CTS is also home to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Religious Archives Network, and the seminary‚Äôs Heyward Boswell Society for LGBTQ people and allies engages students across campus in social activities. CTS also offers an annual Gilberto Castaneda scholarship award for outstanding GLBT students. CTS has graduated some of the nation‚Äôs first transgender ministers and has many openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students, staff, and faculty. Several of the seminary‚Äôs faculty members have published books and articles regarding religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The United Church of Christ Coalition for GLBT Concerns lists Chicago Theological Seminary as an officially \\"Open and Affirming\\" institution that is especially welcoming to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex concerns. In 2007, CTS established the Center for the Study of Black Faith and Life (CSBFL), becoming the first denominational seminary to have a center devoted to engaging the larger Black Faith community through inclusivity of a variety of religions. CSBFL sponsors the annual C. Shelby Rooks lecture, which brings outstanding black theologians, ministers, activists, and non-profit leaders to campus. In 2009, CTS became the first free-standing Protestant seminary to endow a faculty chair in Jewish studies, with the hope of advancing interfaith engagement and multi-faith education. The next year, CTS founded the Center for Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Studies (JCIS), the first American program of its kind based in a free- standing theological seminary. This center offers resources to students who concentrate in theology, ethics, and human sciences that enable scholars to experientially and theoretically integrate Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theology with these topics. In 2017, CTS established the InterReligious Institute (IRI), which stands counter to the idea that Christianity is the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù religious position for Americans and seeks to create space in the public square for people of other religions and for people with no religion at all. IRI does this by providing ongoing events, resources, and training materials for the public. In 2019, CTS began a partnership with Bayan Claremont to provide both a graduate certificate and an accredited Master of Divinity in Islamic Chaplaincy at the seminary‚Äôs Hyde Park campus.

Campus The original buildings were designed by Herbert Riddle and built between 1923 and 1928. Riddle was the architect for Mather Tower in the Loop, as well as many buildings in New York. The original CTS building complex included stained glass windows, medieval style groin vaulting, furniture, lighting fixtures, ceramic ornament and tile work, and architectural relics‚Äîall of the highest quality of the day. =New building= The seminary, which was for decades located at 5757 South University Avenue in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, adjacent to the University of Chicago, during the 2011/2012 academic year moved to 1407 East 60th Street, also in Hyde Park. The building designed by Riddle that had served as a seminary for decades became home to the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago and the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics. Construction of the new $30 million CTS facility was a partnership between the University of Chicago and the Chicago Theological Seminary. In May 2008, the University of Chicago Board of Trustees Executive Committee authorized the purchase of two CTS buildings and an adjacent parking lot. Additionally, the University of Chicago agreed to construct a new seminary building at 60th Street and Dorchester Avenue. The seminary's new building, designed by Nagle Hartray Architecture with staunch commitments to environmental sustainability, is located at 1407 E. 60th Street and is LEED Gold-certified and fully ADA accessible. As of 2013, the building project has acquired numerous private and public funds. Aerial view of new CTS building on University of Chicago campus =Lapp Learning Commons Library= The Robinson & Janet Lapp Learning Commons, centrally located on the third floor of CTS's new building, is a working theological collection of more than 45,000 volumes. The library also subscribes to more than 700 periodicals and runs multiple research database platforms. Special holdings include the Boisen Collection in psychology and personality science, and the Campbell Morgan Collection named for G. Campbell Morgan, containing his sermons, writings, books, newspaper clips, lecture notes, photographs, and other archival materials. The Commons is also home to a number of rare books, including a 1670 first quarto edition of Thomas Hobbes‚Äô Leviathan published in London by Johannem Tomsoni. The collection is strong in the theological subject areas of Bible, Church history, and theology. Particular fields of note also include African American religion and spirituality, women's studies, LGBT/queer studies, and Jewish and Christian studies. Besides the Lapp Learning Commons, CTS students also have access to the University of Chicago Library system, the 11th largest library collection in the United States. Through special arrangement, CTS students and faculty can utilize this resource in person. Academics =Accreditation and ordination= The seminary is fully accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and by the North Central Association. Further it is one of the 11 seminaries that form the Association of Chicago Theological Schools consortium. In addition to being a seminary of the United Church of Christ, it offers students coursework necessary to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church. =Degree programs= Master of Divinity (M.Div.) * Masters of Arts in Religious Studies (M.A.) * Masters of Arts in Religious Leadership (M.A.R.L.) * Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.) * Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) * Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Notable people =Presidents=Franklin Fisk (1888-1901), one of the most widely known theologians and educators of the West, according to The New York Times, Yale University alumni and valedictorian, and first president of Chicago Theological Seminary. *Joseph H.

Westminster Choir College educates students at the undergraduate and graduate levels for musical careers in music education, voice performance, piano performance, organ performance, pedagogy, music theory and composition, conducting, sacred music, and arts management; professional training in musical skills with an emphasis on performance is complemented by studies in the liberal arts. All students study with Westminster's voice faculty, the largest voice faculty in the world. The school's proximity to New York City and Philadelphia provides students with easy access to the musical resources of both cities. It is currently a part of Rider University, however, ongoing lawsuits seek to end Westminster's affiliation. History =1920‚Äì1932: Presbyterian beginnings to the creation of a college= In 1920 John Finley Williamson founded the Westminster Choir at the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Dayton, Ohio. In 1926, he established the Westminster Choir School. The school started with a faculty of ten, and sixty students. The graduates came to be known as Ministers of Music, a term coined by Williamson and still used today by many church music programs. Dayton Westminster Choir at Berliner Philharmonie in 1929 In 1922, the choir, then known as the Dayton Westminster Choir, began touring the United States annually, singing in Carnegie Hall (New York City), nearby Cincinnati Music Hall (Cincinnati), Symphony Hall (Boston), the Academy of Music (Philadelphia), Orchestra Hall (Chicago) and the White House for President Calvin Coolidge. Years later the Choir also sang for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Choir made its first commercial recording with RCA Victor in 1926; recordings with other major conductors and orchestras followed. In 1928, the Choir and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski made the nation's first coast-to-coast broadcast on Cincinnati radio station WLW. By a few years later, it made a total of 60 half-hour broadcasts from NBC's New York facilities. On March 9, 1929, the Choir performed at the White House for newly inaugurated Herbert Hoover.Ruth Fesler Lipman papers, Hoover Presidential Library The first European tour took place in 1929 and was sponsored by Dayton philanthropist Katharine Houk Talbott and endorsed by Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra. The tour included 26 concerts in major cities of Europe. Originally a three-year program, the Choir School moved to Ithaca College in New York State in 1929 and enlarged its curriculum to a four-year program culminating in a Bachelor of Music degree. A major reason for the move involved the need to be able to reach the major cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York by rail. All three were cities that sought the choir under Williamson. = 1932‚Äì1991: Independent music school in Princeton = In 1932, the choir school relocated to Princeton, New Jersey, which became its permanent home. Classes were held in the First Presbyterian Church and the Princeton Seminary until 1934 when the school moved to its present campus. This was made possible by a large gift from the philanthropist Sophia Strong Taylor. The dedication of the new campus was marked by a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B minor at the Princeton University Chapel with the Westminster Choir, soloists, and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The services of the soloists, orchestra, and conductor were a gift from Stokowski. Williamson Hall, Westminster Choir College There was a second European choir tour in 1934 lasting nine weeks and highlighted by a live radio broadcast from Russia to the United States. In the 14 years since its founding in 1920, the choir already had two European tours which earned it international acclaim and a campus of its own. The State of New Jersey in 1939 granted the choir school accreditation and the name Westminster Choir College was adopted. In years to come, under Williamson's leadership, the choir would begin having regular concerts with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Westminster Choir sang with the New York Philharmonic for the first time in 1939 conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. Since that time the choir has sung over three hundred performances with the Philharmonic, a record number for a single choir to perform with an orchestra. Later that year the choir sang with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. That same year the choir, directed by Williamson, sang at the dedication of the New York World's Fair which was broadcast to 53 countries. In 1957, under the auspices of the U.S. State Department Cultural Exchange Program, the choir undertook a five- month world tour, concertizing in 22 countries, covering and appearing before approximately a quarter of a million people. Williamson retired as President of Westminster Choir College in 1958. Williamson's retirement consisted of conducting choral clinics and vocal festivals throughout the United States, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. A South American choir tour was being planned by the State Department but was cancelled because of Williamson's sudden death in 1964. In accordance with his request, Williamson's ashes were scattered on his beloved campus on July 3, 1964. This was said to have taken place during the performance of the Verdi Requiem with the Westminster Festival Choir, soloists, and the Festival Orchestra conducted by maestro Eugene Ormandy. This performance on the Westminster campus was part of the Tercentennial Celebration of the State of New Jersey. The following day a memorial service for Williamson was held in the College Chapel. In 1976, the choir college celebrated its 50th anniversary, highlighted by a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw, alumni soloists, and the Westminster Alumni Choir on the Princeton University campus. Despite a promising future at the 50th anniversary, Westminster soon began to see its future and prospects for continued existence threatened. Facilities on the campus were in disrepair, and Erdman Hall was ultimately condemned as unfit for use. Recognizing that the college could not continue in this path Westminster was faced with two options, either find a larger university to merge with or close. = 1991‚Äìpresent: Merger with Rider University = Several schools, including nearby Princeton University as well as Drew University, Yale University, The Curtis Institute of Music, and The Juilliard School, all had an interest in purchasing Westminster Choir College. The desire of Westminster to remain in its historic campus resulted in an arrangement with the nearby Rider College. In 1992, following a year of affiliation, Rider College merged with Westminster Choir College and the music school became a part of the newly created Rider University. Despite promises that Rider would maintain the Westminster Choir College campus in Princeton, two years later, Rider President J. Barton Luedeke began exploring a move which would relocate the choir college campus to Lawrenceville, New Jersey, to be with the rest of Rider University. By 1996, the choir college appeared to have a vibrant fiscal future in Princeton, operating in the black, thanks to increased enrollment and donations. One year later Erdman Hall was renovated, restored, and reopened as the Presser Music Center at Erdman Hall, featuring teaching studios, a keyboard laboratory, voice library and resource center, and new classroom space. Despite the optimistic future in the 1990s, by the early 2000s Rider University determined Westminster Choir College either must create an even stronger fiscal future or face closure. Looking for a way to control costs and more effectively create synergies between the two campuses of Rider University (Westminster's and the main campus), in November 2007, Rider University President Rozanski announced the creation of the Westminster College of the Arts. Westminster College of the Arts was envisioned to integrate Rider and Westminster more successfully, and create a new culture and environment of artistic excellence on both campuses. Westminster Choir College continues to educate Westminster College of the Arts students in the fields of piano, composition, voice, organ, choral conducting, sacred music, and music education. The newly formed School of Fine and Performing Arts serves as the gateway to receiving a degree in musical theatre, arts administration, and music, as well as a non-professional degree (B.A. in Fine Arts) in music, dance, and theater. The creation of Westminster College of the Arts sparked heated debate among administrators, students, alumni and faculty that highlighted the divide between Rider's Princeton and Lawrenceville campuses. Westminster recently formed the Princeton University Program with nearby Princeton University. By reciprocal arrangement, Westminster students, except freshmen, may petition to take courses at Princeton. Generally, no cost is involved beyond tuition charges at Westminster. Students are limited to one course per term, to fall or spring enrollment and to courses not offered by Westminster. The program is limited to 10 students per semester, selection and approval being made by academic deans at both institutions. In return, ten select students of Princeton University study and take courses at Westminster each semester. In 2005 the school unveiled an ambitious master plan calling for a new building and other upgrades, the first to be created on the campus since the college was placed under Rider University's stewardship. The choir college also entered a cooperative agreement with the Princeton Regional Schools which allows for up to 40 Westminster performances a year to occur in their newly created Regional Performing Arts Center, alleviating Westminster's struggle from having no dedicated, large performance space on the campus. The lack of a large concert venue was solved in 2013 when the State of New Jersey allotted $4.6 million to Rider University to be spent on new academic facilities for Westminster's campus. Combined with donations from various friends, alumni, and admirers of the conservatory, the funds spent on this project far exceeded $5 million. Opened in 2014, the complex is named the Marion Buckelew Cullen Center in honor of the philanthropist who died in July and made a $5 million bequest to Westminster Choir College. The new building contains a 3,000-square-foot performance and rehearsal hall named the Hillman Performance Hall, in recognition of the Henry L. Hillman Foundation, which provided a $3 million grant to support the project. In addition to the performance/rehearsal hall, the Cullen Center includes a large lobby, a green room and three flexibly configured classrooms that accommodate a wide range of academic and choral uses. The Cullen Center also includes an integrated connection to The Playhouse that provides improved audience access and amenities. To maximize the opportunities the project offers for enhancing The Playhouse itself, the college secured $1.5 million to upgrade this building that has played such an important role in Westminster's history. Ground was broken for the project in the summer of 2013 and the Cullen Center was completed by spring 2015. On March 28, 2017, after months of speculation following an announcement by Rider that they were considering moving the Westminster students to the Lawrenceville campus and selling the Princeton campus due to purported financial problems, it was decided by the Board of Trustees that Rider would, instead, attempt to sell WCC to a new affiliate partner. A timeline of 12 months was established with hopes that a buyer would be found in the upcoming year. Fearing that Westminster could be made to shutter its doors and cease its mission, a large ensemble of students, alumni, faculty, community members, and others gathered at the Lawrenceville campus for a silent protest on the morning of the vote. They sang the school's \\"alma mater\\" ‚Äì \\"The Lord Bless You and Keep You\\" by Peter Lutkin ‚Äì numerous times, hoping to convince the trustees not to silence the college, which has made an international impact on the choral world. On February 26, 2018, Rider announced its intention to sell Westminster to a former steel and bridge manufacturing firm. This created widespread speculation that it was Gregory G. Dell'Omo's intention to scuttle the college from the beginning. This was also reported in a March 2018 Bloomberg Business News article which said that Beijing Kaiwen Education Technology Co. (formerly called Jiangsu Zhongtai Bridge Steel Structure Co.) had agreed to pay $40 million for the college. The sale subsequently faced opposition from state politicians on grounds of national security and lawsuits from Westminster alumni and donors and the Princeton Theological Seminary alleging, among other things, violation of IRS regulations. Other concerns addressed the sale of an American institution of higher learning to a for-profit and non-American company with poor financial ratings and extensive ties to the communist Chinese government. On July 1, 2019, it was announced that Beijing Kaiwen was withdrawing from the proposed purchase. This was followed by news that Rider would relocate Westminster's programs to the Rider campus in September 2020 and monetize the sale of Westminster's Princeton campus for the benefit of Rider's debt. At Rider University's convocation exercises on August 29, 2019, Dell'Omo announced that the relocation of Westminster and the sale of Westminster's Princeton campus would directly benefit Rider University's ongoing campus investments.

The title, Il Mare, means \\"The Sea\\" in Italian, and is the name of the seaside house which is the setting of the story. The two protagonists both live there two years apart in time, but are able to communicate through a mysterious mailbox. The film was remade by Warner Brothers in 2006 as The Lake House starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. The plot of the movie was also used in the 2015 Kannada movie Minchagi Nee Baralu.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movie- reviews/Minchagi-Nee-Baralu/movie-review/50072497.cms  Plot  There are two distinct time-lines intertwined throughout most of the film. The story begins with Eun-joo moving out of a house by the sea called \\"Il Mare\\". As she is leaving, she leaves a Christmas card in the mailbox, asking the next resident to please forward her mail to her. Sung-hyun, an architectural student, receives her card, but is puzzled, since he is the first resident at \\"Il Mare\\" and the card is dated 2 years in the future. After a series of back and forth correspondences, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun realize they are living 2 years apart, Eun-joo in the year 1999 and Sung-hyun in the year 1997. After some testing, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun discover that the mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" is enabling their communication and they can pass objects and living creatures through. Utilizing the mailbox, Eun-joo asks Sung-hyun to retrieve a tape player she lost two years ago, which he gets for her. After his estranged father, a noted architect, falls ill, Sung-hyun asks Eun-joo to obtain a book about his father, which she does. However, she succumbs to a minor traffic accident and while hospitalized, the book fails to reach Sung-hyun in time before his father's death. After reading the book, he finally accepts his father's love for him and takes up his architectural work once more. As both Eun-joo and Sung-hyun continue their correspondence, they decide to try a date together, with each person participating in his or her own time. Eun-joo \\"takes\\" Sung- hyun to an amusement park, where he follows her instructions on how to have a good time at the park. Sung-hyun \\"takes\\" her to a restaurant where she drinks a bottle of wine he left for her two years prior. Despite having a lot of fun on these solo \\"dates\\", they decide that they should try to meet in person. Eun-joo and Sung-hyun plan on meeting in person at a beach two years in Sung- hyun's future. However, when Eun-joo goes to the beach, Sung-hyun doesn't show. She does see a house being built on the beach for an unknown architect's lover. When Eun-joo tells Sung-hyun that he didn't come, he is baffled about why he didn't show up; he doesn't think he would have forgotten such an important date. Although Sung-Hyun doesn‚Äôt meet Eun-joo at the agreed upon date, he still makes a trip out to the beach they agreed to meet. He is moved by the beauty of the beach and decides to design a house for her on the very beach. Sung-hyun may have wanted to show Eun-Joo his love for her, and even though somehow not being able to meet her on the future date, the designed house will show her that he is there at the beach. At Eun-joo's workplace, she runs into her ex-fiance. They were going to get married, but he moved abroad for work, while she stayed in Korea. Due to the separation, they eventually broke up and he married another person; Eun-joo however still loves him. This meeting was a shock to Eun-joo and in an act of desperation, she asks Sung- hyun to intervene and stop her fiance from leaving two years in the past. Sung-Hyun after receiving the letter to intervene between Eun-joo and her fianc√© from separating, is heart-broken. Sung-Hyun is torn between his love for Eun-joo, and Eun-Joo‚Äôs request to help her not to lose her previous lover. After some long hard contemplation, Sung-Hyun against his own hearts desires, agrees to help her. Helping Eun-joo‚Äôs request would be like tearing out his own heart, very similar to this quote from Javan, \\"When you truly know the meaning of the word love, you will also know the meaning of the word pain.\\" Sung-hyun writes back wishing Eun-joo good luck to her and her fianc√© in the future. After receiving the heart-felt reply from Sung-hyun to help, Eun-joo decides to visit his architectural school. Eun-joo may have hoped to meet him in person and thank him somehow. She finds the architectural department and is greeted by a friend of Sung-Hyun. Eun-joo asked for Sung-Hyun, but was told of a tragic accident. Sung-Hyun was to meet a friend of his, but was involved in a fatal traffic accident 2 years ago. Eun-joo suddenly realizes, on the day, she last met her fianc√© before they separated, she also witnessed a car striking a pedestrian and killing him. Sung-hyun was that very pedestrian and the house being built at the beach was designed by Sung-hyun for her. She immediately rushes to the mailbox and sends a letter begging him not to go, also in hope that the message is received in time. The final scene returns to the beginning of the movie, where Eun-joo is about to place her Christmas card into the mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\". A stranger approaches her with a letter in his hand, the letter that Eun-joo sent warning Sung-hyun not to go to the meeting. Sung-hyun did receive her warning letter and never went to intervene that day and was never hit by the car. Eun-joo and Sung-hyun finally meet. Cast Jun Ji-hyun as Eun-joo, a young woman who has aspirations of becoming a voice actress. Throughout the film, we see that although she has obtained her dream, there is something missing in her life. Living in 1999, Eun-joo becomes the second tenant of the house and is only moving out as the film begins. * Lee Jung-jae as Sung-hyun, a young man who was the first tenant of the house. Living two years in the past of 1997, he begins as a construction worker for a large project. Although a talented architect, Sung-hyun has become critical of his talents, claiming he could not stand becoming a hypocrite. *Kim Mu-saeng *Jo Seung-yeon *Min Yun-jae *Kim Ji-mu *Choi Yoon-yeong *Lee In-chul *Kwon Yeon-gyeong Location The setting for the movie was shot on Ganghwa Island's Sukmodo, and Jeju Island's Udo. Reception This time-travel romance was not a popular success in 2000, selling less than a quarter million tickets in Seoul (upstaged by not only the similar-themed Ditto, but also the controversial Lies), but since then it has developed a loyal fan base a la Somewhere in Time and attained the status of a minor classic among Korean cinema fans. Remake  Warner Brothers acquired the rights for an American remake, titled The Lake House, starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. It was released on June 16, 2006 and was co-produced by Sonny Mallhi, Amit Walia, and Chris Krapek. To reference the original movie, \\"Il Mare\\" was used as the restaurant's name where Kate and Alex are supposed to meet.

The film was adapted from the 1997 television series Bayside Shakedown. Plot The film continues a few months after the end of the TV series. The main character Detective Sergeant Shunsaku Aoshima has worked his way back up into the investigative division of the Wangan Precinct of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, after being demoted back to patrol duty for insubordination. Shortly after the movie begins, a body is found floating in a river near the edge of the precinct's jurisdiction. However, in the spirit of the series, the main concern of the officers on the scene is getting to the body before their counterparts from the other precinct on the other side of the river get to it. The scene eventually degenerates into a cross-river shouting match over bullhorns between the officers from the two precincts. The brass at Wangan Station turn out to be less than happy when their officers manage to recover the body (which has had a teddy bear crudely stuffed into its stomach) as it would require a special investigation, which would drain more from the station's already tight budget. At the same time, the station is in an uproar as officers find that someone has been stealing the receipts for on the job expenses that they had originally intended to file for reimbursement. Things are further complicated when the Assistant Commissioner is kidnapped and the investigative team from Metropolitan Police headquarters moves into Wangan Station. The investigation is led by Superintendent Shinji Muroi, whom Aoshima befriended in the TV series. Having promised Aoshima that he would try to reform the bureaucratic mess within the police department and force the local and headquarters officers to work together as equals, Muroi finds that his promise increasingly hard to keep as his decisions are continuously overruled from above by superiors who insist on playing everything by the book. It becomes apparent that Muroi's superiors are setting him up to take the fall in the event the investigation fails. The stratification in the department becomes apparent when the investigators from headquarters immediately delegate the most menial of tasks to the local officers, while receiving special treatment enjoying gourmet bentos while the locals are forced to dine on instant ramen. The locals are forced to work multiple cases at the same time, and find themselves berated by their superiors when mistakes are inevitably made. The film goes on to take on issues such as disaffected youth unable to differentiate between reality and video games, overprotective parents, strange internet subcultures; and on more lighthearted notes, the lack of sidearms, otaku obsessed with cosplay, media frenzies, and even overtly melodramatic movie scenes, as Aoshima and his fellow officers continue to press on through the absurdity.
