(10 May 1760 ‚Äì 26 June 1836),Chisholm, 1911 was a French army officer of the French Revolutionary Wars. He is known for writing the words and music of the Chant de guerre pour l'arm√©e du Rhin in 1792, which would later be known as La Marseillaise and become the French national anthem. Early life Rouget de Lisle was born at Lons-le-Saunier, reputedly on a market day. His parents lived in the neighbouring village of Montaigu.Lons, une \\"petite\\" ville en lettres capitales at La Terre de chez nous (in French) 10 April 2004. Retrieved 7 August 2013 A plaque was placed at the precise spot of his birth and a statue erected in the town's center in 1882. He was the eldest son of Claude Ignace Rouget (5 April 1735 - 6 August 1792) at Orgelet and Jeanne Madeleine Gaillande (2 July 1734 - 20 March 1811).Family Tree Rouget  Career  Rouget de Lisle in 1792. He enlisted into the army as an engineer and attained the rank of captain. A royalist, like his father, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new constitution.Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Richard Stockton, Nathan Haskell Dole, Julian Hawthorne, Caroline Ticknor, The World's Great Masterpieces. American literary society, 1901, p. 9577. Rouget de Lisle was cashiered and thrown into prison in 1793, narrowly escaping the guillotine. He was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and retired to Montague. =La Marseillaise= The song that has immortalized him, \\"La Marseillaise\\", was composed at Strasbourg, where Rouget de Lisle was garrisoned in April 1792. France had just declared war on Austria, and the mayor of Strasbourg, baron Philippe-Fr√©d√©ric de Dietrich, held a dinner for the officers of the garrison, at which he lamented that France had no national anthem. Rouget de Lisle returned to his quarters and wrote the words in a fit of patriotic excitement. The piece was at first called Chant de guerre pour l'arm√©e du Rhin (\\"War Song for the Army of the Rhine\\") and only received its name of Marseillaise from its adoption by the Proven√ßal volunteers whom Barbaroux introduced into Paris and who were prominent in the storming of the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792.The New York Times Current History: The European War, Volume 16, 1918. p. 200. After the war, Rouget de Lisle wrote a few other songs of the same kind as the \\"Marseillaise\\" and in 1825 he published Chants fran√ßais (French Songs) in which he set to music fifty songs by various authors. His Essais en vers et en prose (Essays in Verse and Prose, 1797) contains the Marseillaise; a prose tale Adelaide et Monville of the sentimental kind; and some occasional poems. He returned to public life after the July Revolution; Louis Philippe awarded him the Legion of Honour. Death Rouget de Lisle died in poverty in Choisy- le-Roi, Val de Marne.Norman Davies, Europe: A history p. 718 His ashes were transferred from Choisy-le-Roi cemetery to the Invalides on 14 July 1915, during World War I.The Marsellaise.

The population was 3,460 at the 2010 census. It is located on the Vermilion Iron Range, and is historically home to several iron ore mines. Today the city of Ely is best known as a popular entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness; the International Wolf Center, and the North American Bear Center. The main street of Ely is lined with outfitters, outdoor clothing stores, and restaurants. State Highway 1 (MN 1), State Highway 169 (MN 169) and County Road 21 (Central Avenue) are the main routes in Ely. History Pioneer Mine The first Europeans to explore the area were fur traders who made their way into the wilderness in search of furs. But it was the Lake Vermillion gold rush that brought the first large numbers of pioneers to the area in 1865. Although hardly any gold was ever found, it was discovered that the area did contain large deposits of iron ore. Thousands of new immigrants were arriving in America at that time, and many of them came to the area later to be known as the Minnesota Iron Range, looking for work. When the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway laid tracks extending the rails from Tower to Ely in 1888, Ely began mining operations with the opening of the Chandler Mine. Ore was shipped by rail to docks on Lake Superior in Two Harbors and Duluth. From there it was shipped by lake freighter for processing in Ashtabula and other points in Ohio. That year the miners incorporated the town of Florence, population 177, near the east side of Shagawa Lake on a site now known as Spaulding. The miners named their settlement Florence after the daughter of the Chandler mine's Captain Jack Pengilly (also the town's first mayor). After ore was discovered farther west, the town relocated, changing its name as well. Since it was discovered that the name ‚ÄúFlorence‚Äù was already used by another village in Minnesota, \\"Ely‚Äù was chosen in honor of mining executive Samuel B. Ely, a big promoter of Vermilion Range ore who lived in Michigan. (He was never known to visit the namesake town.) In 2020, The Ely Echo writes: :The name Ely stems from the ‚ÄúIsle of Eels,‚Äù a wetlands near Cambridge, England. In historic times,those lakes swarmed with the slithery fish (similar to eelpout) that provided sustenance for ancestors of Samuel B. Ely. His clan arrived in the states (from Ely, England) in the1600s (one ancestor was a close associate of George Washington). Samuel, a mining executive, financed the railroad to Ely in 1888 which launched our town. He embraced Ojibwe culture and applied native names to some of his mining projects, including Ontonagon (hunting river) & Ishpeming (heaven), Michigan. Samuel‚Äôs great grandson, Courtland Ely III, was Grand Marshal at Ely‚Äôs 1988 Centennial Parade, stayed with Schurkes at Wintergreen & was given keys to the city by Gov. Rudy Perpich (an Iron Ranger from Hibbing). The original town site consisted of forty acres. The first grocery store was opened in a small log building by a man named McCormick. A. J. Fenske built the first frame building in the fall of 1887; he also opened a hardware and furniture store. The Pioneer Hotel was also built that year at the corner of Sheridan Street and Fourth Avenue. The first school was opened in 1889 in a small frame building on Second Avenue; the school attendance was 112 during the first season. According to a history written in 1910, \\"The first religious service was conducted by Father Buh, who came from Tower for that purpose, and the Catholic congregation erected the first church. The first Protestant minister was Rev. Mr. Freeman, who arrived in time to hold an Easter service in 1889, and located here permanently, organizing the Presbyterian church. There are now six churches, representing as many different faiths. The first white child born in the place was Samuel Ely Polkinghorn.\\" Soon other mines were opened in Ely: The Pioneer Mine(1889), the Zenith (1892), the Savoy (1899), and the Sibley (1899). The Pioneer was by far the most productive, producing 41 million tons or 40 percent of the Vermilion Range's entire output. Eventually eleven mines opened near Ely. In 1967, the Pioneer mine closed. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and its offices now house the Ely Arts & Heritage Center. Originally the mining was an open pit operation, but when the abundant ore was mined out, deep shafts were made to start mining underground. With the need for wooden support beams to keep the tunnels from collapsing, along with the need for lumber to meet the needs of the ever-expanding growth in the area, the logging and milling industry grew. Logging continues in the region, though on a limited scale and only for paper pulp‚Äîthe major operations virtually disappeared by 1920 when the area's tree reserves were depleted. \\"A Brief History of Ely\\" , Zenith City Online Community Sheridan Street, Ely, MN Ely is served by two community‚Äìoriented newspapers, the Ely Echo and the North Country Angler, and a radio station WELY. Ely is host to many community events located in Whiteside Park such as the Blueberry Arts Festival in July,Berry good time set at Ely Blueberry Fest - Mesabi Daily News: Local the Harvest Moon Festival in September, and the Winter Festival in February. There is also an Ely-only artist gallery, Art & Soul Gallery. In May 2012, Ely was threatened by a fast-moving wildfire started by a downed power line on Highway 1. Due to the rapid fire fighting response, including the use of airtankers, the fire was limited to just outside town. The post office In Ely contains two tempera on plaster murals, Iron-Ore Mines and Wildernesss, painted by Elsa Jemne in 1941. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

Copper mining controversy Since the 1960s as Iron Range iron mines began closing leaving only a few in operation, Ely, like many northern Minnesota communities, including Duluth, faced economic decline. Duluth, on the shores of Lake Superior, has successfully built a tourist trade which has helped to sustain their city's economy. Ely, seen as the gateway to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, has also developed a lively tourist trade. However, due to environmental concerns the area has recently seen controversy regarding a proposal to build a mining operation for copper just outside of the BWCAW. The company involved, Twin Metals Minnesota, is operated by a Chilean company, Antofagasta PLC. They say that they \\"plan to build modern mines that must go through a rigorous regulatory process before they can move forward.\\" However, environmentalists are concerned that runoff from the mining operation could damage the BWCA wilderness area. The copper deposits that lie underneath the forests and lakes of northeastern Minnesota are encased in sulfide ore and when that is exposed it produces sulfuric acid which has resulted in severe water pollution in copper mines in several western U.S. areas. June 23, 2010. Recreation Loon at Eagles Nest Lake, Ely, Minnesota There are many Minnesota wilderness hiking trails in the Ely area. Echo Trail (Saint Louis County Road 116), considered one of the most scenic trails in Minnesota, is a former logging road that runs north and west out of Ely and provides the primary access to the lakes of the western Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW). The trail is a road on asphalt and gravel through the wilderness of the Superior National Forest and Kabetogama State Forest. Numerous trailheads and canoe portages along the trail provide access to the BWCAW. A side trip passes north to the resort village of Crane Lake, a gateway to Voyageurs National Park. Special attractions include views of sharply rolling forest, lakes, wetlands, rivers, and granite crags in one of the most remote areas in the contiguous United States. Recreation opportunities include canoeing, fishing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, and primitive camping in the Superior National Forest and Boundary Waters. Wildlife includes bald eagles, ospreys, moose, bears, wolves, and beavers. The area also offers blueberry and other wild berry picking and wildflower viewing.The Echo Trail: Ely to Orr via St. Louis County Road 116  Crane Lake Minnesota Scenic Byways  Trails.com Trezona Trail offers historic views of the old iron ore mining operations that first brought new immigrants to the area. The trail passes through the Pioneer mining pit with views of the old mine shaft headframe and historic buildings. Hidden Valley trail, one mile east of Ely, passes through paper birch and white pine stands. Kawishiwi Falls Trail offers views of Kawishiwi Falls, a 70 ft. drop. The name Kawishiwi in Ojibwe language means ‚Äúriver full of beaver or muskrat houses‚Äù. Native Americans, explorers and voyageurs portaged around the falls. The watershed drains from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and flows 2,000 miles north to Hudson Bay. Bass Lake Trail, a 5.6 mile trail six miles north of Ely, has an interesting history. In 1925 a sluiceway created by logging operations washed out leaving a gorge over 250 feet wide and Bass Lake was lowered 55 feet in 10 hours, reducing it to 1/2 its original size. The trail hosts backpacking campsites. Hiking in Minnesota: Wilderness Hiking in Ely, Minnesota MN In 2015, the Ely Marathon kicked off, sending runners from the north side of Burntside Lake down the Echo Trail and into the city. It has become an annual event and grown to include several races. The marathon is known for being the only marathon in the world with a \\"canoe portage\\" category and holds the world record time for a marathon-length canoe portage. Attractions Burntside Lake, Ely, Minnesota Ely is the largest \\"jumping off\\" town for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The BWCAW is renowned as a destination for both canoeing and fishing on its many lakes, and is the most visited wilderness in the United States. With extensive outfitting and other services, Ely can credibly be claimed to do the most wilderness canoe outfitting of any town or city in the world. Long-time Ely resident Sigurd F. Olson was instrumental in creating the BWCAW. Author, environmentalist, and advocate for the protection of wilderness, for more than thirty years he served as a wilderness guide in the lakes and forests of the Quetico-Superior country of northern Minnesota and southwestern Ontario. He worked for the protection of the Boundary Waters, helped draft the Wilderness Act of 1964, and helped establish Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. He was known honorifically as the Bourgeois ‚Äî a term the voyageurs of old used for their trusted leaders. =North American Bear Center= The North American Bear Center Ely is home to the North American Bear Center which opened in May 2007. It is an interactive museum and educational facility featuring American black bears. The North American Bear Center, the only science/nature museum of its kind, is dedicated to helping people learn from the bears themselves about bear behavior, ecology, and their relations with humans. A wall of windows overlooks a 2.5 acre naturally forested enclosure with a pond and waterfalls, which is home to four resident bears. The center also features exhibits, a theater, children's activities, and interpretive nature trails.North American Bear Center ¬´ Ely Minnesota =International Wolf Center= International Wolf Center The International Wolf Center is one of the world's leading organizations dedicated to educating people about wolves.

Known as the \\"Root Beer Lady\\", Molter lived for 56 years on Knife Lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. She had gradually gained national prominence and extensive coverage in media, books and documentaries, and over the years tens of thousands of canoeists stopped by to visit and drink her homemade root beer. Molter first visited her future home (The Isle of Pines Resort) on Knife Lake in 1930 and it became her home starting in 1934. Up until the mid/late 1940s, the Isle of Pines resort was typical of many north woods resorts. It was reachable by seaplanes and motorboats, and later by snowmobiles as they came into use. But when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness was designated, eventually nearly all motorized transportation was eliminated, and residences, buildings, business and the few roads from the wilderness were removed, leaving Molter as the only full-time resident in a wilderness area three times the size of Rhode Island. After Molter's death, her cabin was dismantled and moved to Ely. Her residence and a second cabin of hers were reconstructed at this site, and the Dorothy Molter Museum was established to preserve her legacy. =Camp Widjiwagan= Joe Seliga in his Ely, Minnesota, workshop Camp Widjiwagan is a wilderness camp for girls and boys located on Burntside Lake. The camp is nationally recognized for its canoeing and backpacking programs; it also has an environmental education program, the Widjiwagan Outdoor Learning Program. During the summer months they run canoe and backpacking programs offered at several degrees of experience, with more advanced trips for experienced campers. Environmental education programs are held during the fall, winter and spring seasons, with students studying wilderness survival, plant and tree identification, basic hiking skills, animal tracking, the night sky, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. Master builder of wood-and-canvas canoes Joe Seliga lived in Ely and was an instructor at the camp. When Seliga died in 2005, Camp Widjiwagan received his canoe form. =Hegman Lake pictographs= Pictographs on Hegman Lake The Hegman Lake Pictographs, located within the BWCAW about 15 miles north of Ely, have been described as \\"perhaps the most visited and photogenic pictograph within the State of Minnesota.\\" Located on a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake, this ancient rock art is believed to have been created by the Ojibwe Indians. The meaning of the painting is uncertain. It appears to represent the Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening. While some anthropologists believe that the pictographs may have served as a guide for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season, others see it as a visual representation of the connection between the spiritual and temporal worlds. In the summer the site can be reached only by canoe. In the winter when the lakes are frozen, travelers can reach it by foot, or with snowshoes if the snows are deep. =Ely-Winton History Museum= Ely-Winton History Museum The Ely-Winton History Museum is located within the Vermilion Community College Campus. The museum depicts local history through the use of displays, photographs, and oral histories. Logging and mining histories are told using geological samples and old logging and mining tools. Examples of past businesses are demonstrated as well as the importance of women on the frontier. In 2018 the museum opened an art exhibit which features paintings representative of Ely mining history featuring the works of artist Albin Zaverl. They also feature a collection of the work done by Ojibwe artist Carl Gawboy, who grew up in Ely.The museum offers programs about the history of the area twice a month during the summer months. Information from the museum mission statement states: :The mission depicts local history through artifacts, photographs, oral histories, numerous videos/DVDs; displays include Ojibwe, fur trade, mining, logging, immigration, voyageurs, and Footprints Across The Wilderness, the history of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness with a new exhibit each summer. They cover the history of the area from prehistoric times through mining, immigration and logging. Arts displays include Carl Gawboy and Albin Zaverl. Historically significant structures in and around Ely Listening Point cabin Ely State Theater Tanner's Hospital -1907 The U.S. National Register of Historic Places deems certain structures to be worthy of preservation for their historical significance. Several sites in and around Ely have been placed on the Register's list: Bull-of-the-Woods Logging Scow, Ely State Theater, Listening Point, Tanner's Hospital and Burntside Lodge Historic District. Listening Point was the private retreat of conservationist Sigurd Olson on Burntside Lake. Olson acquired the property in 1956, then purchased a log cabin and a log sauna elsewhere that he had dismantled, moved to Listening Point, and reassembled. In 1998 the Listening Point Foundation was organized to preserve the property as an open-air museum to Olson. The Ely State Theater is a 1936 Streamline Moderne design, epitomizing the small-town commissions of leading regional theater designers, Minneapolis architects Liebenberg & Kaplan. Tanner's Hospital Tanner's Hospital is a former hospital building. It was built in 1901 as a moneymaking enterprise due to the high disease rate in the area. This was a consequence of low investment in sanitation infrastructure in the mining boomtowns of the Iron Range, where the long-term existence of any given community was unpredictable. Burntside Lodge is a resort on the southern shore of Burntside Lake. It has been in operation for over a century. The registry lists Burntside Lodge District as \\"Northern St. Louis County's first full-scale commercial resort and finest collection of log resort buildings, with 19 contributing properties built from 1914 to the mid-1930s.\\" The Bull-of-the- Woods Logging Scow is a small paddle steamer wrecked in Burntside Lake. It was built around 1893 for one of the lumber companies operating in the area. There were at least a few of these vessels in operation in northeastern Minnesota in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where they were locally known as \\"alligators\\" or \\"gators\\". They could tow timber rafts, hoist logs, navigate shallow waters, and even pull themselves across dry land. It is the only known surviving example of its type. Famous hoaxes People from Ely, with the support (and often assistance) of the city council, have created various hoaxes as a way of garnering free publicity for the city. One hoax was that of a fictional family that \\"paints the leaves\\" of trees every fall. The fictional family was retiring from the business, and wanted people to send in a \\"color application\\" if they wanted to help carry out the tradition.Leaf Coloring in Ely, Minnesota - YouTube Previously, a story was released about Ely seceding from the United States to be part of Canada. Both hoaxes were featured on Ely's Chamber Of Commerce website, www.ely.org. In 2009, Ely made a tongue-in- cheek international bid for hosting the 2016 Olympics, with a man allegedly already employed with a bucket to drain Miner's Lake to the south of town, in order to provide stadium seating in time for the Olympics. This hoax became widely known throughout the entire state of Minnesota, and was often reported on radio stations. Shirts, bumper stickers, signs, and even interstate billboards bearing the slogan \\"Ely in 2016\\" became commonplace throughout the state.

The city briefly entered the national news in October 2002 when U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, along with seven others, died in a plane crash, two miles away from the airport of Eveleth. It was also the site of the conflict that resulted in the court case Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., and the film North Country, which was based on it. Eveleth is home of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Eveleth also is home to the Eveleth-Gilbert Senior High School, a school in the Rock Ridge Public Schools. Eveleth is part of the Quad Cities of Virginia, Gilbert, and Mountain Iron. History The Village of Eveleth was platted on April 22, 1893, originally located approximately southwest of the present location, on land then included in the Adams-Spruce Mine (Douglas Avenue between Jones and Monroe Streets). The community was named after Erwin Eveleth, a prominent employee of a timber company in the area. In 1895, iron ore was discovered beneath the village site and a post office was established. In 1900, the village was moved to its present location. The village was incorporated as a city in 1902. When the city expanded, it annexed portions of Fayal Township, including the former unincorporated communities of Alice Mine Station (in the Alice Location south of downtown) and Fayal. With further expansion, Eveleth annexed the unincorporated community of Genoa to its east. Eveleth first established its post office on February 9, 1895, with P. Ellard Dowling to act as commander-in-chief. Eveleth would also have its first paper, called The Eveleth Star, the same year.

Economy Eveleth is located on the Mesabi Range, one of sub-regions within Minnesota's Iron Range. The town's economy has always been tied to the iron ore mining and processing which occurs in the area. This economic activity peaked during World War II and declined through the second half of the twentieth century. A resurgence of demand for iron ore occurred in the 2005-7 timeframe. However, the local economies experienced only mild improvement due to improved mining productivity, which allowed demand to be met with only a modest increase in staffing levels. Located within the city limits is the Thunderbird Mine, an iron ore mine producing crude ore processed into 5.5 million tons of iron ore \\"taconite\\" pellets per year. Opened in 1965 by Eveleth Taconite Company, a subsidiary of the Oglebay-Norton and Ford Motor Companies. The mine is now (2010) operated by United Taconite LLC, a subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources. The ore is magnetite-bearing iron formation of the Paleoproterozoic Biwabik Iron Formation. Ore is crushed at the mine site, and shipped by railroad to the Fairlane Plant in Forbes, MN,United Taconite Llc - Fairlane Plant - Forbes, MN - EPA Regulated Facility for concentrating and pelletizing. Arts and culture Eveleth at one time was one of a handful of U.S. cities with side-by-side water towers labeled \\"HOT\\" and \\"COLD\\". Eveleth no longer has two such water towers.Hot and Cold Water Towers An airplane carrying U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone and members of his family crashed into a dense forest about two miles from the Eveleth Airport on October 25, 2002. Senator Wellstone and seven others died in the airplane crash. The crash occurred less than two weeks before Sen. Wellstone was to face re-election to the U.S. Senate.https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/25/politics/25CND-CRASH.html =Hockey= World's largest authentic hockey stick in Eveleth The United States Hockey Hall of Fame is located here (not to be confused with the Hockey Hall of Fame, in Toronto). The city has long been noted as a powerhouse of hockey talent. They have won several state championships the latest being in 1998.

Frank Brimsek was born here in 1913. He was a Hockey Hall of Fame goalie. Also born here were John Mariucci (in 1916) and John Mayasich (in 1933). More recently, Eveleth produced Mark Pavelich, who played on the 1980 U.S. Olympic team that memorably defeated the Soviet Union (depicted in the movie Miracle about the Miracle on Ice) and Finland en route to a gold medal.

The population was 9,414 at the 2010 census. A suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, it has lately been the only city in the county to grow in population, as much of the area's residential and commercial expansion occurs there. Hermantown is near the tip of Lake Superior. The eastern part of Hermantown has an appearance typical of a lower-density bedroom community, with large, leafy lots and occasional subdivisions. The car-oriented \\"Miller Hill area\\", or Miller Trunk Corridor of Duluth, has sprawled well past the city boundary line into this part of Hermantown. The western part of Hermantown is dominated by a more rural landscape, reminiscent of the past agricultural focus of the city. Hermantown's motto is \\"The City of Quality Living\\". Hermantown's mayor is Wayne Boucher, who won a 2008 election against Susie Stockinger. Boucher ran unopposed for a second term in 2012 and received 4,111 votes; there were 79 write-ins. History Lambert \\"Pat\\" Acker and his wife, Emelie Louisa Wilke The first inhabitants of the area were Native Americans. They lived in the area often called in early Duluth references \\"the land up over the hill.\\" In 1867, August Kohlts and his friend Lambert \\"Pat\\" Acker filed for homesteads in Section 18, Township 50 North, Range 15 West. Both families had emigrated from Prussia. Acker arrived about age five with his parents and siblings around 1835 and settled in Erie County, New York. He married Emelie Louisa Wilke on January 12, 1850. Kohlts and his wife, Emilie, immigrated in the spring of 1860. The Kohltses and Ackers resided in the town of Tonawanda on the Niagara River for some years with many other Germans who settled in the area. Citizenship was granted to Kohlts on March 20, 1868. Soon afterward, the Kohlts and Acker families set out from Buffalo, New York, heading west via the Great Lakes for the Hancock, Michigan area of the Keweenaw Peninsula and its copper mines. Perhaps lured by the availability of free land under the Homestead Act, the Kohlts family left for Minnesota. The federal census of June 1, 1870, records their presence in the Second Ward of the newly formed city of Duluth, while the Ackers arrived in Duluth in 1871. By January 1872 August Kohlts had established an 82-acre site in the wilderness outside Duluth. He and Acker were the first settlers in the area now known as Hermantown. In the years that followed, Kohlts and Acker alternated between working in Duluth and clearing land at their rural homesteads on what is now Five Corners Road in Hermantown. They traveled between Duluth and their homesteads on a Native American trail that later became Piedmont Avenue and the Hermantown Road. Hermantown's population got a boost from a new wave of homesteaders just before World War II. During the Great Depression, the federal government built nearly a hundred \\"subsistence homestead\\" projects designed to move people trapped in poverty in the cities to new homes in rural or suburban locations. One of the two Minnesota projects was assigned to Hermantown. The Jackson Project was completed in 1937. It is one of Hermantown's more interesting features, with a proliferation of \\"Jackson Homes\\" on certain roadways. These single-family dwellings were built during the Depression as subsistence homesteads. Many retain their original brick appearance, albeit with additions. Each of the 84 homesteads had a brick veneer farmhouse; half also had a garage-barn combination. Each had five or of land, and the family also received a pig, a cow, and 35 chickens. The idea was that the family would be able to raise its own food and use the profits from selling any surplus to work off its debt to the government. The units were sold to homesteaders on very liberal terms: the average price for the home and property was $2,687.40 plus interest. The Jackson Project was one of the later projects built, which was a benefit because the quality of housing improved. Plumbing and electricity were now required in all homes. The homesteaders gave a new profile to what was then Herman Township. Now with 84 homes and families concentrated in one part of the community, the Project marked the start of Hermantown's transition from rural to suburban. Hermantown was incorporated as a city on December 31, 1975. The community of Adolph is within the southwest corner of Hermantown.

History The town was founded in 1893 by Frank Hibbing,City of Hibbing. Hibbing.mn.us. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. born in Hannover, Germany on December 1, 1856, and christened Franz Dietrich von Ahlen. His mother died when he was still in infancy and it was her name, Hibbing, which he assumed when he set out to seek his fortune in the New World. He first settled in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, where he worked on a farm and in a shingle mill. Injured in a mill accident, he considered becoming a lawyer, but after deciding he was not familiar enough with the English language to make a legal career possible, he turned to timber cruising. In 1887, Hibbing settled in Duluth where he established a real estate business and began explorations on the Vermilion Range. In 1892, he headed a party of thirty men at Mountain Iron and cut a road through the wilderness to Section 22, 58‚Äì20. An expert iron ore prospector, he soon discovered the surface indication which led him to believe in the existence of extensive ore deposits. In July 1893, the townsite of Hibbing was laid out and named in honor of him. Feeling personally responsible, he took the deepest pride in its development and, by his generous aid, made its progress possible. He used his personal means to provide a water plant, electric light plant, the first roads, hotel, sawmill, and bank building. For the last ten years of his life, Hibbing made his home in Duluth, where many of his business interests were centered. He retained close contact with the community which bore his name, until he died of appendicitis on July 30, 1897, at age forty. In 1914, two men, Carl Wickman and Andrew \\"Bus Andy\\" Anderson, started a bus line between Hibbing and Alice, Minnesota, which would eventually become Greyhound Lines, the world's largest bus transportation company. Hibbing Heights was platted in 1908 and annexed by Alice in 1910, when Alice incorporated as a city. Between 1919 and 1921, the Village of Hibbing was moved immediately south of Alice and then annexed Alice in 1920. Hibbing remained a village until 1979 when the Town of Stuntz was annexed. An Article of Incorporation was filed in July 1979 with the state and Hibbing became a city from that action in January 1980. Hibbing is home to the world's largest iron ore mine, which was discovered by Leonidas Merritt. Hibbing grew rapidly in its early years as the huge iron ore mines such as the Mahoning, Hull, Rust, Sellers, and Burt provided the raw material for America's industrial revolution. In fact, the mines encroached on the village from the east, north, and west and it was determined that some of the ore body actually went under the town whose population had hit 20,000 by 1915. Negotiations between the Oliver Mining Company and the village finally brought about a plan whereby the entire village would relocate to a site two miles south near Alice. The company, for its part, agreed to develop the downtown buildings with low interest loans that could be paid off over the years by the retailers. New civic structures such as Hibbing High School, the Androy Hotel, the Village Hall, and the Rood Hospital were also constructed with mining company money. In all, about 200 structures were moved down the First Avenue Highway, as it was called, to the new city. These included a store and even a couple of large hotels. Only one structure didn't make it: the Sellers Hotel tumbled off some rollers and crashed to the ground leaving, as one witness said, \\"an enormous pile of kindling\\". The move started in 1919 and the first phase was completed in 1921. Known today as \\"North Hibbing\\", this area remained as a business and residential center through the 1940s when the mining companies bought the remaining structures. The last house was moved in 1968.Hibbing: The Town That Moved, Retrieved March 16, 2011. On July 25, 1979, Hibbing annexed the Town of Stuntz which comprised five townships.

History =Republic of Kinney= By 1977, the City of Kinney, with a population of 325 according to the 1970 census, suffered from a failing water system, and was faced with a staggering replacement cost of $186,000. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to secure funding from state and federal agencies due to bureaucratic red tape, agencies such as: Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), and the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Commission (IRRRC), the city council was led to believe that it would be easier to receive foreign aid if Kinney seceded from the union, declared war, and lost immediately. Mayor Mary Anderson and a supportive Kinney City Council sent the following July 13, 1977, 'tongue-in-cheek' secession letter to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance: The secession was never officially acknowledged by Vance or the U.S. The news story broke locally in the Mesabi Daily News on February 5, 1978, in an article by Ginny Wennen entitled \\"Move over Monaco, here comes Kinney.\\" The story garnered national and international attention beginning on February 7, 1978, when the story was featured on the NBC Nightly News with David Brinkley. Jeno Paulucci, a businessman based in Duluth, Minnesota, was the first to acknowledge the new republic and offer 'foreign aid' in the form of a dark brown 1974 Ford LTD police squad car and 10 cases of Jenos Sausage Pizza Mix on February 13, 1978. The squad car was painted with a Republic of Kinney shield on the driver's side that read \\"Commander in Chief, Republic of Kinney,\\" and \\"Chief of Police, Kinney, Mn.\\" on the passenger side. In November 1978, the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) approved $198,000 grant, allocated in three payments of $66,000 per year from the Taconite Area Environmental Protection Fund, to repair the existing water system, construct cement runoff basins, and install additional fire hydrants. The Republic of Kinney would go on to create and sell over 1,600 passports alone between March and April 1978 at $1.00 apiece. Later the republic created buttons, T-shirts, and even a summer festival called 'Secession Days', which was first held during the weekend of August 1 & 2, 1987. The City of Kinney celebrated the 30th anniversary of its \\"independence\\" as the Republic of Kinney during the weekend of July 13‚Äì15, 2007. In conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the Kinney secession, the City of Kinney published the book Republic of Kinney. =Other sources= * (First Edition). * http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/62/v62i01p018-028.pdf.

Feedback to the DNR was overwhelmingly in favor of \\"closed unless posted open\\", but the DNR has chosen to take the most liberal interpretation of the law and push the \\"open unless posted closed\\" rule. The DNR's plan can be found here and contains reference on page Additionally, a destination trail was opposed by some local residents and the Duluth-based organization Minnesotans for Responsible Recreation. The plan for the destination trail was revealed by the Duluth News Tribune, and some local residents were alarmed by the prospect of unfettered access in much of the forest coupled with intense advertising that would accompany the trail.

The population was 1,422 at the 2010 census. Richmond is part of the St. Cloud, Minnesota metropolitan area. History Richmond was platted in 1856 by Reuben Richardson, a farmer from Sauk Rapids who later served in Minnesota Legislature. The name \\"Richmond\\" may come from the surname of an early settler, the surname of Richardson's wife, or an early surveyor. The original plat was a seven block by seven block square piece of land. Two years later, land owned by G.H. Brauning (also spelled Bruening), on the eastern side of the town, was added to Richmond's plat. The town was incorporated in 1890, but went by the name Torah, because there was another town in southeastern Minnesota named Richmond. The same year of its incorporation, a Great Northern Railway station was built. The town's post office and railroad station was named Torah until 1909, when the other Richmond's post office closed. Following this, the name changed to Richmond, a name that locals identified with. The pontoon boat was invented in Richmond in the 1950s by Ambrose Weeres, who was involved in the milling business, and Edwin Torborg, a farmer who manufactured feed mixers.

The town's nickname, \\"On the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes\\", is a nod to a geographical feature of the town. The town is home to a group of over a dozen lakes along the Sauk River, with the largest being Horseshoe Lake, hence the name \\"Horseshoe Chain of Lakes\\". Richmond is located in an area with many outcrops of granite.

Morris, a railroad official. A post office has been in operation at Morris since 1871. Morris was incorporated as a city in 1902. The federal government and state in the 19th century had programs to try to assimilate Native Americans to the majority culture. The Sisters of Mercy Roman Catholic order, led by Sister Mary Joseph Lynch, established a boarding school for Indians in Morris, operating it from 1887 until 1896 under contract to the federal government. Initially most students came from Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, which had many Catholic converts. The Morris Industrial School for Indians was to prepare students for jobs in the industrializing culture. The federal government then appointed staff to manage the school into the early 20th century, before transferring it to the state. After the state took over the school in the early 20th century for general education, it taught agricultural topics. Agriculture has continued to be a major part of the economy. In 1909 the University of Minnesota established the West Central School of Agriculture (WCSA), and Morris closed. When the state announced a phase-out plan for Morris and similar agricultural schools, a grassroots citizens movement convinced the state to establish a public college on the Morris campus. In the fall of 1960, the University of Minnesota, Morris opened its doors to students seeking a liberal arts education. It has been ranked as a \\"Top 10 Public Liberal Arts College\\" by U.S. News and World Report and one of \\"America's Top Colleges\\" by Forbes. The city contains five properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1881 Lewis H. Stanton House, the 1899 Morris Industrial School for Indians Dormitory, the 1905 Morris Carnegie Library, and the early-20th-century West Central School of Agriculture and Experiment Station Historic District.

The population was 3,471 at the 2010 census. Bayport is located along the St. Croix River, one mile south of Stillwater, Minnesota. History The City of Bayport began as three small settlements along the St. Croix River. In 1873, the St. Croix Railway Improvement Company combined the three settlements into South Stillwater, which was incorporated as a village in 1881. Because many people confused South Stillwater with the city of Stillwater, the city changed its name to Bayport in 1922. Like its northern neighbor Stillwater, the early economy of Bayport centered around the lumber industry. From 1852 to 1916, several sawmills operated within the City. The Andersen Corporation is the successor to Bayport's early lumbering firms. The Andersen Corporation (then the Andersen Lumber Company) moved to Bayport in 1913, among other reasons, to take advantage of the city's rail lines first built in 1872. The Andersen Corporation prospered in Bayport, becoming the largest window and patio door manufacturer in the world. In 1914, the Minnesota Correctional Facility - Stillwater moved from Stillwater to Bayport. Experts at the time considered the prison to be one of the most modern penal institutions in the world. As of 2010, the prison housed about 1600 inmates, who are counted as Bayport residents for census purposes. The maximum security Minnesota Correctional Facility - Oak Park Heights opened just beyond Bayport's western boundary in 1982. Due to its location on the St. Croix River, Bayport has long been associated with boating. The Bayport Boat Yard, located just south of the Andersen Corporation, built several well-known steamboats. Barge construction and repairs continued at the boatyard through World War Two. Today, the city is home to the Bayport Marina, and many boaters gain access to the St. Croix River at one of Bayport's public boat launches.

The village is on the south and east shore of White Bear Lake. History Birchwood first developed as a community of summer recreation cottages built by residents of the Saint Paul area in early 20th-century. Initial subdivisions were along the lakeshore, and this area is now characterized by a potpourri of old homes that have been extensively remodeled, and new homes where the original structure has been demolished. The newer subdivisions away from the lake have larger lots and are more homogeneous in appearance but have retained the flavor of the village by preserving the natural features of the area. The community was at one time served by the Twin City Lines street car which passed through the village on its way from Saint Paul to White Bear Lake and Mahtomedi. The significant difference in lot sizes between the older and newer areas of the community reflect the influence of changes in transportation modes. First incorporated as a village in the year 1921, a subsequent act of the State Legislature converted the \\"village\\" to a \\"City of the Fourth Class.\\" Residents felt, however, that the term \\"village\\" was so much a part of the community that it was amended to \\"Birchwood Village, a City of the Fourth Class.\\" Demographics =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 870 people, 351 households, and 262 families living in the city.

Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water. State Highways 36, 95, and 96 are three of the community's main routes. Stillwater receives an average annual snowfall of . Average annual rainfall is . Each year has an average of 14 days above .  Name  The name \\"Stillwater\\" was proposed in 1843 by John McKusick, who built its first sawmill and was later a state senator. The name derives from the calmness of the St. Croix River near the town center. It is also believed that McKusick had fond memories of Stillwater, Maine. History Stillwater c. 1860s On July 29 and September 29, 1837, treaties were signed between the US government and the local Ojibwa and Dakota nations that allowed settlement in the St. Croix Valley. The town was founded by settlers drawn by the area's then-abundant lumber and river traffic, making it one of Minnesota's oldest towns, preceding Minneapolis by several years. Stillwater was officially incorporated as a city on March 4, 1854 (the same day as St. Paul). Stillwater is often referred to as the birthplace of Minnesota. In 1848, a territorial convention that began the process of establishing Minnesota as a state was held in Stillwater, at the corner of Myrtle and Main Streets. Minnesota officially became a territory in 1849 and a state in 1858. As more evidence of Stillwater's importance at the time, the convention selected three leading Minnesota cities as locations for three important public institutions: Minneapolis got the University of Minnesota, Saint Paul became the capital, and Stillwater the site of the territory's first prison. The Minnesota Territorial Prison (later Minnesota State Prison) was opened in 1853. The prison held Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger, three of the Younger brothers of the James‚ÄìYounger Gang Lumbering was the predominant industry in the St. Croix River Valley in the second half of the 19th century, and for many years logs were sent down the St. Croix, collected at the St. Croix Boom Site two miles upstream of Stillwater, and processed in Stillwater's many sawmills. Steamboats were used most widely from 1860 to 1890, and a few are still used for entertainment today. David Swain operated a shipyard and engine works in Stillwater. Excursion steamboats, such as the Verne Swain and the Capitol, appeared at the docks in the early 20th century. Stillwater sent men of the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Company B and the 8th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment Company C to fight during the American Civil War.From the Journal of Sgt. Sam Bloomer 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Part IHistorians seek Stillwater Civil War unit's flag On October 18, 1921, Charles Strite invented the automatic pop-up bread toaster in Stillwater. By 1926, the Toastmaster Company began to market the first household toaster using a redesigned version of Strite's. In 1931, construction of the Stillwater lift bridge over the St. Croix River was completed at a final cost of $460,174, which was split equally between Minnesota and Wisconsin. The lift bridge is one of the city's most iconic and visible local monuments. It was part of Minnesota State Highway 36 until 2017, when it closed. In 2020 it became part of a five-mile trail loop running through Stillwater and Houlton, Wisconsin. In 1996 the city of Stillwater entered into an agreement with Stillwater Township to annex land. In 2015 the Stillwater city council approved the annexing the last of the land covered by the agreement. The city's western border is now Manning Avenue (County Road 15). The northern border is now mostly, but not entirely, Minnesota Highway 96.

A post office was established there in 1887, and Tenney was incorporated as a city on November 30, 1901.Tenney, Minnesota Place Names. Minnesota Historical Society. The population was 5 at the 2010 census, tying Tenney with Funkley as Minnesota's least populous community. It is part of the Wahpeton, ND‚ÄìMN Micropolitan Statistical Area. Tenney's main economic feature is a grain elevator near its southern border. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Tenney is located in the flat basin of prehistoric Lake Agassiz, a glacial lake that existed at the end of the last Ice Age. The area's remarkably flat land is sometimes described as the upper valley of the Red River of the North, though it is not technically in the Red River valley, but is near the Bois de Sioux River. History The city of Tenney was named for the owner of its site, lumberman John P. Tenney,Upham, Warren (2001) Minnesota Place Names, A Geographical Encyclopedia, Third Edition, p629; MHS Press; because of his willingness to give land to the railroad, which came through in 1885. The first house was built by his son-in-law, Fred Maechler. The post office was established in 1887, the plat was filed for record with the office of the Register of Deeds in Wilkin County on August 4, 1887, and the city was incorporated on November 30, 1901. The city originally encompassed four square miles, but never grew enough to meet its boundaries, so in 1916 the farmers petitioned their land from the city, and their request was granted. According to an unpublished town history written in the mid-1980s, the city's population peaked at about 200 in 1910. Before 1910 the city boasted a church, three grain elevators, a hardware store, two mercantile stores, a butcher shop, bank, machine shop, implement shop, blacksmith shop, pool hall, lumberyard, and a hotel, which also housed the barber shop, saloon, and post office.unpublished town history compiled by the city for its 1985 centennial, author uncredited In 1909 a small post office building was erected and used until 1952, when Leonard Hardie became postmaster and moved the post office to the general store. Electricity arrived in Tenney in 1914, through a franchise granted to Otter Tail Power Company. After 1910 steady population decline was driven by the lack of significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. The hardware store closed in 1928 and the bank, like thousands of other undercapitalized small- town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney's population at 19. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the main drag is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A. Klugman general store, which also housed the post office until its closing in 1980. The building was vacant for several years, but was recently purchased and is being rehabilitated. The population reached its lowest point of 2 sometime after the 2000 census, but had risen to 5 by the 2010 census. In late June 2011, residents of Tenney voted 2 to 1 to dissolve the town and have it become part of Campbell Township. Description The community encompasses two and a half blocks, including one vacant commercial building (the old general store and post office - now gone), a church building (previously the city hall - now gone), a community center, three inhabited homes, and one vacant dwelling. The ruins of the Tenney School, a two-room brick schoolhouse which was built in 1907 and operated until the 1950s, are visible at the northwest corner of town, and the Wheaton-Dumont Elevator runs the length of town on the south side along Minnesota Highway 55. The old Tenney Fire Hall is on the east side of Corcord Avenue. Location Tenney is on Minnesota Highway 55 in far western Minnesota. It is about east of the junction of Minnesota Highway 55 and US Route 75. It is six miles (10 km) east of Fairmount, ND; south of Moorhead, MN; and northwest of Minneapolis, MN. It is at roughly the same longitude as Tulsa, OK and Dallas, TX, and approximately the same latitude as Walla Walla, WA and Montreal, Quebec. Major highways *20px U.S. Highway 75 *20px Minnesota State Highway 55 Points of interest Tenney Fire Hall =Tenney Fire Hall= The Tenney Fire Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was a small wood-frame building with a bell tower and flag mast, built in 1904. It housed the town's two hand-pulled chemical fire engines. The rearmost part of the building also contained the town jail. This building is now privately owned, but the city is hopeful of reacquiring it and performing important repairs. According to the National Register's Inventory-Nomination Form, the Fire Hall is significant for the following reasons: #\\"Government functions were often centered in towns, [including] places as small as Tenney with its Fire Hall...\\" #\\"Though of simple metal-sided, frame construction, the diminutive Tenney Fire Hall...is a visual landmark in the small town.\\" =City Hall= The City Hall was at 295 Concord Avenue (Concord is the town's main north-south street). It is open to the public 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Visitors are invited to come inside and sign the town's guestbook. City Hall was built in the early 1900s as a community church. Later it was a Baptist church. From 1914 to 1946 it was the Evangelical church, from 1946 to 1968 the Evangelical United Brethren church, and from 1968 until closing in 1997 it was the Tenney United Methodist Church. The building was purchased by the city for $11 in 1999, and in 2006-07 underwent significant renovation and expansion. =The Wheaton-Dumont Cooperative Elevator= The Co-op had its primary rail terminal in Tenney. In 2003, 20 million bushels of grain were trucked into Tenney from other elevators and shipped out by rail. At that time it was estimated that in 2004 this figure would rise to 32 million bushels. The elevator is served by the Soo Line Railroad, which is the United States arm of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The population was 1,357 at the 2010 census. History The framework for the City of Waverly began in 1855, when the territorial legislature passed an act organizing Wright County. A survey team was sent out shortly after by the government to plot the new county's divisions. These surveyors were greeted by established homesteaders who had already begun clearing the land and planting crops. Prior to European settlement, Waverly was predominantly Big Woods which included a mixture of oak, maple, basswood and hickory. Small portions of wet prairie existed on the eastern edge of Waverly Lake and along the western edge of present-day CSAH 8. Impressed with the two lakes (Waverly and Little Waverly), available water power and the proximity of the Crow River one mile north, an entrepreneurial surveyor and his partners constructed a dam, saw mill and grist mill in 1856 at the outlet of Little Waverly Lake. The settlement known as Waverly Mills was beginning to take shape, as approximately three hundred acres were surveyed and platted. Waverly Mills was given its name after a community in Tioga County, New York, the former home of one of the partners. After a rough start with a bank panic, financial crash and subsequent grasshopper infestations, Waverly Mills managed to survive. Its saw and grist milling industry help to establish a store, post office and log church with a cemetery at this location. The village was formerly called Waverly Station to distinguish it from Old Waverly, a pioneer village which in the early days flourished about a mile away. Waverly Station was laid out by the railroad company on their land in the southwest quarter of section 33, at about the time that regular trains commenced operating in this locality in 1868. A railroad station was erected that year, and a grain house the next. The first store was opened by T. R. Barrett, who operated it for a few years, and then changed it to a hotel under the name of the Keystone House. Among the lodges in the early 1900s include the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Order of Foresters, the Modern Woodmen of America, the Modern Brotherhood of America, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Royal Neighbors of America, and others. The school which once stood where the current Humphrey Elementary School was built in 1905 and was composed of a brick structure, two stories high, with a basement; and ran by four teachers. In addition to a complete course, the school taught manual training and music. Waverly Station was incorporated as a village in 1881. And the village was reincorporated as Waverly in 1885. The following notation appears in the county records: \\"March 16, 1885. A special election called by the trustees of the village of Waverly for the purpose of ascertaining by ballot whether the village of Waverly should continue as the incorporated under a special act of the legislature or become reincorporated under the General Statute of Minnesota, was held on Monday, March 16, 1885. Due notice of said election having been given and the object of said election having been fully set forth in notices, polls opened at 10 a. m. and closed at 4 p. m. Number of votes polled, 41 ; for reincorporation, 41 ; against, none. The village of Waverly was therefore declared reincorporated under the General Statutes of Minnesota and same recorded in the village records. The prosperity of Waverly in those early days was aided by both railroad traffic and by patronage of the surrounding settlers in Woodland and Marysville Townships. Many of these early farmers hailed from various parts of the United States, French Canada and European countries specifically from Sweden, Ireland, Germany, Prussia, Austria and Switzerland. These pioneers supported Waverly's many institutions which included a post office, bank, newspapers, city hall, churches, creamery, school, grain elevators, flouring mills, saw mill, insurance agencies, hotels, livery stables, general stores, hardware dealers, furniture shops, lumber companies, bakery, meat markets, millinery shops, saloons and a drugstore to name just a few. Waverly moved faster and progressed farther in 30 years than some its rival communities. Some claim that Waverly‚Äôs businesses and buildings were some of the largest and finest in Wright County at their height of development. One historical account stated that Waverly, ‚Äúis a pleasant, prosperous village, located on one of the very pleasant lakes; it is quite a summer resort for pleasure seekers‚Ä¶.‚Äù Records indicate that by 1909, the population of Waverly had expanded to over 1,000 residents. Since its incorporation in 1869, Waverly has changed both physically and demographically. Like many similar rural communities of greater Minnesota, Waverly has felt the documented socio-economic effects of industrialized agriculture, rural exodus of young residents to regional urban cores and aging population. Waverly hosted some small development in the 1930s and 40s and a small subdivision in the early 1960s. But by 1980, Waverly's population had decreased to 470 persons. Direct results of this rural trend were merging, consolidating or vanishing institutions and businesses. Academic researchers have indicated that small communities like Waverly are entering a period of transition and metamorphosis. The grain elevators that once identified Waverly are gone, and new residential housing developments have appeared. The Twin Cities Metropolitan Area that once seemed distant is now only a 40-minute car drive away. From 2000 to 2007, Waverly attracted the attention of residential developers in a flurry. The large influx of new residents during this short time beckoned back to Waverly's historical boom period prior to 1900. This time however, the growth was primarily housing. Several developments were platted including; Summerfields, Woodland Shores, Spring Meadows, Carrigan Meadows, Carrigan Estates and Windgate at Carrigan Lake. The population has increased by over 60 percent since 2000 to nearly 1,300 on 2010 after many decades of static to no growth. Waverly is now poised for future growth while continuing to maintain its small town appeal. The Waverly Village Hall, built in 1939, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 1,795 at the 2010 census. History John Swenson, who secured a homestead on section 4 of Norman Township where now stands the City of Canby, was one of the early European settlers in the area. After erecting a claim shanty, for the convenience of his neighbors, he opened a little store in his cabin. In November 1874, he secured the establishment of a post office in that store. At Swenson's suggestion, the post office was named Canby, in honor of Civil War and career officer General Edward Canby of the United States Army. (General Canby had been assassinated the prior year during peace negotiations with the Modoc Indians of Northern California.) However, in 1876 the surrounding country was receiving new settlers and the railway company deemed it time to begin the operation of train service over the western part of the line. Canby Station was established and on August 24, 1876, and the city platted by the Winona & St. Peter Railroad Company soon after the railroad was extended to that point. Because of its location on the rail line, Canby grew quickly and was incorporated as a village in 1879 and as a city in 1905. Lots were sold by the railroad with the provision that they must be built upon within six months. Swenson was the first to buy, and he selected the corner of Front and Main for his first store building. Grasshoppers, Indians and prairie fires were a big concern for Canby residents at this time. 1875 was the summer of the first bad grasshopper plague. The settlers tried everything they could think of to make them go away but the grasshoppers devoured every blade of grass, the leaves on the trees and even clustered on buildings. Indians were on everyone's mind because of General Custer's campaign in Wyoming. On June 25, 1876, 3,000 braves circled and killed Custer and his 277 troops. Not long after the battle, a band of about 100 Indians camped along the railroad track in Canby to trade furs for merchandise. Luckily, after doing their business, the Indians left. Firebreaks were plowed around the town and each farmstead because settlers were ever alert to prairie fires. In 1893 it wasn't a prairie fire but a common daily task that started a fire in town. It began with filling a kerosene lamp from a tin measure. Fate and the wind were against Canby that night. After the flames had demolished every Main street store between the Swenson building and the bank, the wind switched and blew the heat and sparks across Main street to Block 3 where every structure went except for one. A loss of $150,000 was reported but Canby built right up again and the structures were replaced with brick or stone construction. Because of the uniquely preserved architecture of these buildings the downtown area has been designated as a nationally registered historic district. The corner piece of this district as well as the oldest building, which was not destroyed in the fire, is located on the corner of Highway 75 and 2nd Street. The first sermon was preached in Canby in 1876, however, in 1879 the first regular religious service in the English language was held. The first school was started in 1877 and located on the second floor of a home. The Canby News was founded in September 1878; it was the westernmost newspaper on the railroad. The cost of Canby's government in 1888-1889 was $5,898.12. The new century saw a lot of change in Canby and all over the world. Businesses changed hands and many new ones were established. It was a time of amazing growth in Canby. In 1915, 50 new homes were built. It was a pre-war boom. Post-war also saw a lot of changes. In 1930 motorized power and electrical power were taking place. A count of businesses in 1940 found 157 business places in Canby. In 1946, after World War II, there was again a shortage of housing in Canby. In 1947, 55 building permits were issued. The following years were all ‚Äúbuilding years‚Äù and showed a lot of growth for Canby. The population of Canby showed its largest growth in the 1930s and reached its peak in 1950. Farmers have cultivated the area around Canby since the first settlers arrived in the middle of the 19th century.

The fundraiser has been an annual event for over 70 years. Porter celebrates its annual Market Day Sale in April. The annual auction draws thousands to the town and shuts down streets for auction rings. The auction is a pre-World War II tradition that carries on to this day. As has been tradition for the over 90 years of the auction, homemade pies and sandwiches are still served in the Porter Community Hall by the Bethel Lutheran Church and food stands are operated by the Deb's Caf√© and various Porter organizations throughout the auction grounds. In August the community celebrates the bountiful harvests of the community with our Harvest Festival. The event has been held on the 3rd weekend in August for nearly 50 years now.

History  Work crew repaving Taylor Street, 1930 \\"Crossroads of the Confederacy\\" Corinth was founded in 1853 as Cross City, so-called because it served as a junction for the Mobile & Ohio and Memphis & Charleston railroads. It was the town's early newspaper editor, W. E. Gibson, who suggested its current name for the city of Corinth in Greece that also served as a crossroads. Corinth's location at the junction of two railroads made it strategically important to the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated to Corinth after the Battle of Shiloh (April 1862), pursued by Union Major General Henry W. Halleck. General Beauregard abandoned the town on May 29 when General Halleck approached, letting it fall into the Union's hands. Since Halleck had approached so cautiously, digging entrenchments at every stop for over a month, this action has been known as the Siege of Corinth. The Union sent Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans to Corinth as well and concentrated its forces in the city. The Second Battle of Corinth took place on October 3‚àí4, 1862, when Confederate Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn attempted to retake the city.

Liberty was incorporated on February 24, 1809. The Amite County Courthouse in Liberty is the oldest in Mississippi. Erected in 1839, the courthouse was enlarged and modernized in 1936. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Amite Female Seminary (also known as the 'Little Red Schoolhouse'), built in 1853, was a girls finishing school located in Liberty. During the American Civil War, in the spring of 1863, Federal troops under the command of Colonel Benjamin Grierson, a former music teacher, burned the school, but spared the school's music building. The Federal commander permitted musical instruments to be removed, and was prepared to give the order to torch the building, when he recognized the music school's director, Rev. Milton Shirk, as a former classmate from New York. The two- story, two-room music building survives to this day on Mississippi Highway 569, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the Civil Rights Movement, in September 1961, Herbert Lee, an African-American dairy farmer and member of NAACP, was murdered in Liberty at the Westbrook Cotton Gin by E.H. Hurst, a white state legislator. Lee had attended voter registration classes and volunteered to try to register to vote, Witnesses to the killing were intimidated by armed white men in the courtroom to support Hurst's claim of self-defense, and he was released without charges. Louis Allen, a married African-American landowner with a logging business, reported the truth about the crime to federal officials while seeking protection for testimony. He did not get protection. He suffered economic blackmail, arrests and harassment, and was killed in January 1964. Since 1994, three investigations have suggested that the county sheriff was the perpetrator, but no prosecution was undertaken. Since that period, Amite County has continued to lose population because of its poverty and limited opportunities. It now has a white majority, although the margin is less than in Liberty.

The population was 319 at the 2010 census. Geography Snow Lake Shores is located at (34.823963, -89.241555) along Mississippi Highway 4 in west-central Benton County, approximately west of Ashland and northeast of Holly Springs. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24.13%, is water. The town consists of homes built around Snow Lake, an impoundment on Big Snow Creek, a tributary of the Tippah River and ultimately the Tallahatchie River. History The first Anglo settlers in the area were John M. Ferrell and his wife, who moved from Tennessee to a site west of present-day Snow Lake Shores in 1839. One of their ten children, Emaline, married an Englishman ‚Äì Joe Shone. They built a house two miles east of the Ferrell homestead that became known as Shone's Pond. The area around Shone's Pond consisted mostly of marsh and cypress swamps. The names Shone's Mill and Shone's Mill Pond were sometimes applied to the area in its early years. In 1947, New Yorker Walter Utley moved to neighboring Marshall County with plans to build a resort-style development in the area. Big Snow Creek with its three forks looked to be a good prospect. Around 1956, a partnership of three men ‚Äì including Utley ‚Äì organized to develop a residential subdivision that became known as Snow Lake Shores. In 1957, Big Snow Lake was created by building a dam on a local stream. Snow Lake Shores was established in 1958 as a private, restricted resort community. It was marketed as a safe, family-friendly place for people to both vacation and live year-round. A volunteer fire department was created in 1974. After 38 years of existence, Snow Lake Shores was incorporated as a town in 1996. Incorporation meant that the town would be eligible to receive grants for paving roads and installing a new water system. Eddie Koen was appointed as the first mayor of Snow Lake Shores along with five aldermen who served as the new town's governing body until municipal elections were held in October 1996. Although the permanent resident population of Snow Lake Shores stands at around 300, that figure can grow to over 900 during the summer months as seasonal residents and vacationers come to the community.

The population was 348 at the 2010 census, down from 473 in 2000\\\\. Beulah is served by Mississippi Highway 1. Lake Beulah, an oxbow lake formerly connected to the Mississippi River, is west of the town. The Illinois Central Railroad had a station in Beulah, but the line is now abandoned. Beulah is named after the Christian hymn Beulah Land, a favorite of Frank A. Montgomery, an early settler to western Bolivar County. History The land southwest of Beulah was owned by a Choctaw family in the 1830s. A series of lawsuits caused them to lose their land, and Charles Clark took ownership. Clark established the Doro Plantation during the late 1840s and early 1850s, which grew to over and became the most prosperous slave-owning plantation in the region. It continued to operate after the end of slavery until 1913. During that time, the Mississippi River flowed next to Beulah along \\"Beulah Bend\\" (now Lake Beulah), and Clark was often visited by Mark Twain while writing Life on the Mississippi. In 1858, Frank A. Montgomery purchased a tract of land along the river north of the Doro Plantation and established a plantation. Beulah was one of its villages. Mississippi River boats landed at points in the community, and there was a noted river trade. Freshwater clam harvesting - \\"clammin\\" - enabled a thriving pearl button industry. In 1863, Union soldiers altered the course of the river by constructing a channel to avoid Beulah Bend, and the town became shut off from river commerce. The pearl button industry declined, as freshwater clams tend to concentrate in the bends of rivers, though many families still participate in clam harvesting at places they can access the river. Altering the river's course also destroyed the nearby towns of Prentiss and Napoleon. In 1866, Montgomery donated the village of Beulah to the county, and gave $1,600 to build a courthouse. A two-room log jail was also built. Beulah became the first county seat, and had a Masonic Lodge, church, school, bank, stores, and post office. The Bolivar Times newspaper was also edited there. In 1872, the county seat was moved to Floreyville (now called Rosedale). After the Civil War, numerous freedmen bought and cleared land in the bottomlands away from the river. By 1910, declining financial and social conditions had caused most to lose their land, forcing them to work as sharecroppers and laborers.John C. Willis, Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000 Beginning in the early 1900s, thousands of blacks left Mississippi as part of the Great Migration north by railroad to Chicago and other northern industrial cities, but others remained, with strong local ties. Blues musician W. C. Handy once invited Charley Patton to watch his band perform in Beulah. Patton got in free, and when he observed that Handy's musicians were all strict score-reading performers, he gave up all ambition of playing with their band. Beulah was mentioned in Eudora Welty's Death of a Traveling Salesman: > Bowman had wanted to reach Beulah by dark, to go to bed and sleep off his > fatigue. As he remembered, Beulah was fifty miles away from the last town, > on a graveled road. This was only a cow trail. How had he ever come to such > a place? One hand wiped the sweat from his face, and he drove on. In 1970, Beulah was chosen as the site for a large event by the Southern Female Rights Union.

The population was 1,533 at the 2010 census, down from 2,102 in 2000. It is notable for having been founded as an independent black community in 1887 by former slaves led by Isaiah Montgomery. Mound Bayou has a 98.6 percent African-American majority population, one of the largest of any community in the United States. The current mayor of Mound Bayou is Eulah Peterson. History Mound Bayou traces its origin to freed African Americans from the community of Davis Bend, Mississippi. Davis Bend was started in the 1820s by planter Joseph E. Davis (elder brother of former Confederate president Jefferson Davis), who intended to create a model slave community on his plantation. Davis was influenced by the utopian ideas of Robert Owen. He encouraged self-leadership in the slave community, provided a higher standard of nutrition and health and dental care, and allowed slaves to become merchants. In the aftermath of the Civil War, Davis Bend became an autonomous free community when Davis sold his property to former slave Benjamin Montgomery, who had run a store and been a prominent leader at Davis Bend. The prolonged agricultural depression, falling cotton prices, flooding by the Mississippi River, and white hostility in the region contributed to the economic failure of Davis Bend. National Register of Historic Places. Isaiah T. Montgomery led the founding of Mound Bayou in 1887 in wilderness in northwest Mississippi. The bottomlands of the Delta were a relatively undeveloped frontier, and blacks had a chance to make money by clearing land and use the profits to buy lands in such frontier areas. By 1900 two-thirds of the owners of land in the bottomlands were black farmers. With the loss of political power due to state disenfranchisement, high debt and continuing agricultural problems, most of them lost their land and by 1920 were landless sharecroppers. As cotton prices fell, the town suffered a severe economic decline in the 1920s and 1930s. Shortly after a fire destroyed much of the business district, Mound Bayou began to revive in 1942 after the opening of the Taborian Hospital by the International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor, a fraternal organization. For more than two decades, under its Chief Grand Mentor Perry M. Smith, the hospital provided low-cost health care to thousands of blacks in the Mississippi Delta. The chief surgeon was Dr. T.R.M. Howard, who eventually became one of the wealthiest black men in the state. Howard owned a plantation of more than , a home-construction firm, a small zoo, and built the first swimming pool for blacks in Mississippi. In 1952, Medgar Evers moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Howard introduced Evers to civil rights activism through the Regional Council of Negro Leadership which organized a boycott against service stations that refused to provide restrooms for blacks. The RCNL's annual rallies in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 drew crowds of ten thousand or more. During the trial of Emmett Till's killers, black reporters and witnesses stayed in Howard's Mound Bayou home, and Howard gave them an armed escort to the courthouse in Sumner.

The population was 1,873 at the 2010 census, down from 2,414 in 2000. Located in an agricultural area, the city had a stop on the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad, which carried many migrants north out of the area in the first half of the 20th century. History This area in the nineteenth century was developed by European American planters for extensive cotton plantations, dependent on enslaved laborers. After the Civil War and emancipation, some freedmen managed to clear and buy land in the bottomlands, with many becoming landowners before the end of the nineteenth century. By 1910, a lengthy recession and declining economic and political conditions resulted in most blacks in the state losing their land. They could not compete with the financing gained by railroads, which were constructed in the area beginning in 1882John C. Willis, Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000 Many stayed in the area to work as sharecroppers and laborers. The railroad brought new business to Rosedale, which had a depot and shipped cotton to northern and other markets. The A. Y. Scott Residence in Rosedale, 1920. Scott was a director of the Rosedale Oil Mill. Beginning in the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of blacks left the state of Mississippi as part of the Great Migration, north by railroad to Chicago and other Midwestern industrial cities. During and after World War II, others went to California to work in the defense industry. Others remained where their families had lived for generations, with strong local ties. In 2007, the Mississippi Blues Commission placed a historic marker at Rosedale's former Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad depot site, designating it as a site on the Mississippi Blues Trail. The marker commemorates the sites in the original lyrics of legendary blues artist Robert Johnson's song \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\". He traced the railway route which ran south from Friars Point to Rosedale among other stops, including Vicksburg and north to Memphis. The marker emphasizes that a common theme of blues songs was riding on the railroad, which was seen as a metaphor for travel and escape from poverty and Jim Crow in the Delta. It also commemorates another common blues theme, life on the banks of a moody river bank, a theme heard in Charlie Patton's \\"High Water Everywhere\\". Locals claim that Johnson sold his soul to the Devil at the intersection of Mississippi state highways 1 and 8, on the south end of town, and that he tells this story metaphorically in \\"Cross Road Blues.\\" Other artists have referred to his songs.Tributes to these songs have been recorded by many artists, notably a live performance titled \\"Crossroads\\" by Cream in 1968, and one of \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" by Led Zeppelin in 1997 on their BBC Sessions album. Johnson's deal with the Devil is mentioned as occurring in Rosedale in 1930 in an episode of the TV series Supernatural. However, a number of other Delta municipalities claim that the transaction took place in or near their boundaries. Geography Rosedale is located northwest of Cleveland.

The population was 190 at the 2010 census, down from 408 in 2000. Centrally located in the county, the town is part of the Greenwood, Mississippi micropolitan area. The first county seat, Vaiden, Mississippi, was founded in the eastern part of the county during its early settlement. As of July 23, 2016, Carrollton still flies the Confederate Battle Flag, along with the United States flag, at the memorial to the Confederate dead at the county courthouse. History The town was developed as the county seat and trading center for rural Carroll County, which was devoted to cotton agriculture and plantations in the antebellum era. After the Civil War, there was considerable violence against the newly emancipated freedmen, as whites worked to establish dominance. In the period following Reconstruction, from 1877 to 1950, Carrollton County had 29 documented lynchings of African Americans, the second-highest number in the state after a total of 48 in nearby LeFlore County.Lynching in America, 3rd edition , Supplement by County, p. 6 Twenty- five of these killings were committed in little more than a one-month period in the county seat of Carrollton from February through March 1886. In general, lynchings were a means of white terrorist control of the African-American population. In October 1885, Will McKinney, an African-American man, was convicted by an all-white jury of manslaughter in the death of white man Charlie Broadway. In early 1886, he was serving a one-year sentence in the county jail. On February 18, 1886, a crowd of armed, masked men forced the sheriff to give them the keys, and took McKinney from his cell. They shot and hanged him in the courthouse square.Susie James, \\"Carrollton Courthouse 'Riot' of 1886\\", Commonwealth (Greenwood, Mississippi), 12 March 1996; accessed 31 March 2018 A couple of altercations occurred in that period between James Liddell, a white man from Greenwood, and some associates, and the mixed-race Indian/African-American brothers Ed and Charley Brown from Carrollton. Shots were exchanged in the second encounter, and Liddell was wounded. The Brown brothers were arraigned for assault in March. But they filed their own complaint against Liddell and friends, charging them with assault with intent to kill. This trial of the Brown brothers was scheduled for March 17, 1886, and attracted black friends and witnesses. That day a large group of about 60 masked and armed men, some allegedly from LeFlore County and allegedly led by Houston Whitworth, a white man, rode into town, breaking into four groups to cover the four entrances of the courthouse. They entered the courtroom, fatally shooting both of the Brown brothers and another 18 black men; three more black men died of shooting wounds in the next few days. Some shooting survivors were critically wounded and still jumped out the second-floor windows; Jake Cain, Sr. was shot in the back, jumped out and was crippled for life. His brother Simon was among those killed.Susie James, ‚ÄúThey Didn‚Äôt Want Us To Hate‚Äù, Clarion-Ledger, March 1996; accessed 31 March 2018 The grand jury found that Ed Brown had fired first, causing the \\"riot\\", and blamed the Browns for the events, describing them as \\"turbulent and desperate half breeds\\". But African Americans have different accounts. T.E. Norwood described the events at the courthouse to a WPA historian in the 1930s as a well-planned massacre of blacks. The WPA history of Carrollton also said that some time later, the father of the Brown brothers was fatally shot by T.H. Oury, the coroner, after the father had called Oury out from his church services. Brown senior's was the 24th death associated with what has been called, more accurately, the \\"Carrollton Courthouse Massacre.\\" In 1901, Betsie McCray, her son Belfield McCray, and daughter Ida McCray were accused of murder. A deputy turned them over to a mob, who hung them and then their bodies riddled with bullets. Governor Longino came by special train to discourage the mob, but arrived after the lynching.

The population was 734 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Greenwood, Mississippi micropolitan area. History Vaiden was founded about 1857 and named after Dr. Cowles Mead Vaiden (04/21/1812 - 02/06/1880), a local doctor, planter, and philanthropist. In the late 1850s, Dr. Vaiden gave the right-of-way through his land for construction of the last span of the Central Railroad, in order to connect the state capital, Jackson, Mississippi, with Memphis, Tennessee. Around the railroad's completion in 1857, the population that had settled at the former Choctaw Indian town of Shongalo was moved to the east, to allow for better access to the railroad. The new town was named in honor of Dr. Vaiden, and was made a regular stop on the railroad line. For that reason, it was designated as the county seat of Carroll County. Vaiden was incorporated on February 10, 1860. With additional development of population in the county, residents wanted to have access to a town closer to the Mississippi River.

The population was 3,623 at the 2010 census. History Native American groups had long used the future Chickasaw County for millennia before the coming of European adventurers. Eventually the natives were essentially forced out of the area. An 1832 treaty finally made the area secure for settlement, and emigrants rapidly moved in. The formation of Chickasaw County was authorized on February 9, 1836, and a few days later a committee was authorized to determine the location of the county seat. Judge Joel Pinson offered to donate land for development of this seat, and on July 8, 1836 his offer was accepted. Judge Pinson named the settlement 'Houston' in memory of Sam Houston, a childhood friend. Construction began that year on a brick courthouse on the village square, and a jail one block north. The city of Houston was incorporated on May 9, 1837, and its first Post Office was authorized on December 5 of that same year. In the northeast end of Chickasaw County, a settlement named Rose Hill was established in 1845. When it applied for state recognition, it was discovered that another Mississippi settlement had that name and already had an operating post office, so the Chickasaw settlement changed its name to Okolona. That settlement also flourished in the next 2 decades. The Civil War brought widespread ruin and loss to the county, including an incident when Union troops burned nearly all the county's records as workers tried to move them out for safekeeping. During the following decade, the nearly-moribund economy slowly recovered, but poor roads across the area continued to hamper commerce and daily life. To address this shortcoming, in 1866 the state authorized a second judicial district to be based in Okolona, while allowing the existing facilities in Houston to continue. Thus the county became one of the few in the nation to host two bases for its court system.History of Chickasaw County (accessed 21 August 2018) In 1909, Houston became home to the first Carnegie library in the state after.

It was founded in 1904 to take advantage of a railway line of the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad. Residents moved their buildings over from the original settlement, now referred to as \\"Old Houlka\\", located to the west. The population was 626 at the 2010 census. Started around a fur trading post prior to 1794, Old Houlka is the oldest surviving settlement in north Mississippi. In the 19th century, much of the land was developed for cotton plantations and the market town did good business. History This area was a well-established center of Chickasaw culture by the 1500s. Settlers arrived in the late 1700s and established a Chickasaw Agency House at Houlka for trading with the natives. Agency representatives called the settlement \\"Holkey\\" in their earliest correspondence, which dates from 1794 after the United States gained independence from Great Britain. Houlka was located at the crossroads of the ancient Native American pathways known as the Natchez Trace and the Gaines Trace. In 1805, Silas Dinsmoor hosted a ball at the Agency House. Attending were future U.S. Representative John McKee and former U.S. Vice-President Aaron Burr. A post office was established in 1826. The cultivation and processing of cotton became the basis of the economy, and African slaves were brought to the region through the domestic slave trade to serve as laborers. The production of cotton brought some wealth to white planters. During the Civil War, Confederate forces led by General Samuel J. Gholson clashed with Federal troops at a swamp-crossing near Houlka. Houlka was incorporated in 1884. Houlka High School was founded in 1890 \\"to establish a permanent and high grade institution for the education of white students of both sexes\\". The Legislature also prohibited sales of \\"intoxicating liquors\\" within of the school. That year the Mississippi legislature, dominated by white Democrats, passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised most blacks, a status that the state maintained well into the 1960s to exclude them from the state's political system. In 1904, the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad built a line from New Albany to Pontotoc, passing east of Houlka. Soon after, residents began moving to \\"New Houlka\\", located near the railway line, which had become critical to commerce. Buildings were rolled on logs from Old Houlka to New Houlka, and pulled by teams of oxen. By 1906, New Houlka had a bank, three churches, a saw mill, an academy, a plow factory, and a population of about 500. The town was incorporated that same year. During the mid to late 20th century, railroads restructured and closed many lines, even for freight, because of competition from trucking. In 2004, the railway running through New Houlka, by then owned by the Mississippi Tennessee Railroad, was abandoned between New Albany and Houston, a distance of . Under the federal 'Rails to Trails' program overseen by the ICC, the track was removed and a rail trail called the \\"Tanglefoot Trail\\" was built on the right-of-way, creating a new recreational and public health resource. Name The etymology of Houlka is unclear. Some hold it is derived from a Native American name meaning \\"low land\\" or \\"low water,\\" while others believe it means \\"turkey\\".

It is located near the eastern border of the county. The population was 2,692 at the 2010 census.  History  Okolona was named as Rose Hill in 1845 early in its settlement, but residents later discovered that another location had this name. When a US post office was established here in 1850, a new name was needed to avoid confusion in mail delivery. According to the Okolona Area Chamber of Commerce, Colonel Josiah N. Walton, postmaster of nearby Aberdeen, remembered an encounter with a Chickasaw warrior years earlier. The man's name was Oka-laua, meaning peaceful, yellow, or blue water. Walton renamed Rose Hill as Okolona in his honor. Due to the destruction brought to the area by the Civil War, few structures from the antebellum period remain. The Elliott- Donaldson House, constructed in 1850, survives and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. A few other homes have also survived. In the mid nineteenth century, Okolona and the surrounding Black Prairie, sometimes called the Black Belt or Prairie Belt, became what has been called the \\"Bread Basket of the Confederacy\\". The area was part of the original Cotton Belt of Mississippi well before the more famous Delta region gained fame for major cotton production. The Mobile and Ohio Railroad completed its tracks though Okolona in 1859, making the town a center for the ginning of cotton and its shipment to markets. The town grew along Main Street as a result of the railroad. Most commercial buildings from this period, including the depot, were burned during the Civil War. =Civil War era= Five skirmishes or battles between Union and Confederate forces occurred in and around Okolona. The eponymous Battle of Okolona occurred in February 1864. In a running cavalry clash between Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Union General William Sooy Smith, the Federals were defeated just north and west of town. General Forrest's brother, Jeffery, was killed in the engagement. =Okolona College= Okolona College served African Americans. Today it is central to the Okolona College Historic District.

The population was 1,567 at the 2010 census. Port Gibson is the county seat of Claiborne County, which is bordered on the west by the Mississippi River. It is the site of the Claiborne County Courthouse. The first European settlers in Port Gibson were French colonists in 1729; it was part of La Louisiane. It was chartered as a town in 1803 after the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase from France. To develop cotton plantations in the area after Indian Removal of the 1830s, planters in the state imported thousands of African-American slaves from the Upper South. The county had a black majority established well before the Civil War; they were overwhelmingly enslaved. Several notable people are natives of Port Gibson. The town saw action during the American Civil War. Port Gibson has several historical sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (National Register of Historic Places listings in Claiborne County, Mississippi). In the 20th century, Port Gibson was home to The Rabbit's Foot Company. It had a substantial role in the development of blues in Mississippi, including taverns and juke joints now included on the Mississippi Blues Trail. With the decline in agriculture and lack of other jobs, the city and rural county have suffered from reduced population and poverty. The peak of population in the city was in 1950. A report in the New York Times in 2002 characterized Port Gibson as 80 percent black and poor, with 20 percent of families living on incomes of less than $10,000 a year, according to the 2000 Census. It also has an \\"entrenched population of whites, many of whom are related and have some historical connection to cotton.\\"PETER T. KILBORN, \\"A Vestige of King Cotton Fades Out in Mississippi\\"], New York Times, October 18, 2002. History Market Street- Suburb Ste. Mary Historic District Chartered as a town on March 12, 1803, Port Gibson is Mississippi's third-oldest European-American settlement. It was developed beginning in 1729 by French colonists, and was then within French- claimed territory known as La Louisiane. More Americans entered the area following the US acquisition and Indian Removal in the 1830s. Planters developed cotton plantations of the fertile river lowlands of the Mississippi Delta. As the planter population increased, they founded the Port Gibson Female College here in 1843. The college closed, and one of its buildings now serves as the city hall. Port Gibson was the site of several clashes during the American Civil War and figured in Ulysses S. Grant's Vicksburg Campaign. The Battle of Port Gibson occurred on May 1, 1863, and resulted in the deaths of over 200 Union and Confederate soldiers. The battle was a turning point in the Confederates' ability to hold Mississippi and defend against an amphibious attack. Port Gibson is the site of the Port Gibson Oil Works, a cottonseed oil plant. Many of the town's historic buildings survived the Civil War because Grant reportedly proclaimed the city to be \\"too beautiful to burn\\". These words appear on the town's city limits signs. Historic buildings near the city include the Windsor Ruins, which have been shown in several motion pictures. Gemiluth Chessed synagogue, built in 1892, had an active congregation when the town was thriving as the parish seat. It is the oldest synagogue and the only Moorish Revival building in the state. The Jewish population gradually moved to larger cities and areas offering more opportunity as the economy changed, and none remain in Port Gibson. The Rabbit's Foot Company was established in 1900 by Pat Chappelle, an African-American theatre owner in Tampa, Florida. This was the leading traveling vaudeville show in the southern states, with an all-black cast of singers, musicians, comedians and entertainers. After Chappelle's death in 1911, the company was taken over by Fred Swift Wolcott, a white farmer. He based the touring company in Port Gibson after 1918, and continued to manage it until 1950. The Rabbit's Foot Company remained popular, but was no longer considered \\"authentic.\\"Lynn Abbott, Doug Seroff, Ragged But Right: Black Traveling Shows, Coon Songs, and the Dark Pathway to Blues and Jazz, Univ.

The population was 441 as of the 2010 census, down from 651 at the 2000 census. Developed around an early 19th- century trading post on the Chickasawhay River, it was built near a Choctaw town. Shubuta is a Choctaw word meaning \\"smokey water\\". East of the town is a bridge over the river; it is known as the \\"Hanging Bridge\\". It was the site of the 20th-century lynch murders of four young blacks in 1918, two of whom were pregnant women, and two male youths in 1942. National newspapers covered the lynchings, and the NAACP conducted investigations in both cases. No one was prosecuted for the murders. In addition to recognition of historic houses in town, the Shubuta Bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance in state and national history. A total of 10 blacks were lynched in Clarke County from 1877 to 1950. History Shubuta railway depot, on the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. Located along the Chickasawhay River, the small town of Shubuta was incorporated in 1865. It had started in the 1830s as a trading post community, located near the Choctaw village of Yowani. During the period of Indian Removal, under the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the Choctaw people ceded most of their lands to the United States. Under the Indian Removal Act, they were given land in exchange in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), and most of the people were forced to relocate west of the Mississippi River. Their traditional homelands in the Southeast were sold or made available by lotteries to European Americans for settlement. The first record of the word \\"Shubuta\\" appears on Bernard Roman's \\"Map of 1772\\", a copy of which appears in Riley's History of Mississippi. The name was spelled as \\"Chobuta\\", which means \\"smoky water\\" in the Choctaw language. It became a market town for an area developed for cotton plantations, which depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Cotton was shipped downriver from Shubata to Mobile, Alabama, and then to other major ports. The town started growing more rapidly in the 1850s after being connected to other communities by the railroad. At one time the largest town between Meridian, Mississippi, and Mobile, Shubuta attracted people from around to shop at its many mercantile businesses. The first newspaper in the area was the Mississippi Messenger, established in 1879 by Judge Charles A. Stovall. Six houses within Shubuta are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These are listed in National Register of Historic Places listings in Clarke County, Mississippi, which provides a map link locating them all. =20th-century lynchings= The county had 10 documented lynchings in the period from 1877 to 1950; most took place in the 20th century.Lynching in America, 2nd edition, Supplement by County, p. 4 1918 lynchings In late December 1918, five weeks after the armistice was signed in the Great War, four black farmworkers were lynched and hanged from a railroad bridge in Shubuta. They were brothers, Major (age 20) and Andrew (age 16) Clark, along with two black sisters, Alma (age 16) and Maggie House (age 20) (their surname was sometimes spelled as \\"Howze\\"), allegedly for the murder of Dr. H. L. Johnston, a married white dentist who was living at his father's farm, where the four younger people all worked. Both sisters were pregnant: Maggie was six months pregnant and Alma was due in two weeks. When the NAACP asked for a state investigation, their representative was told by Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo to \\"go to hell\\". The NAACP contracted with Robert Church, a white detective from Memphis, Tennessee, to investigate the four lynchings. He learned that Johnston was fatally shot while milking on December 10, 1918. Major Clark had found him and carried him into the house. Johnston was said to have sexually assaulted and impregnated each of the House sisters. After the Clark brothers started working on the farm, Major Clark and Maggie House developed a romantic relationship. Johnston the son had jealously threatened Clark, saying he would kill the young black man unless he ended his relationship with House. Johnston apparently had affairs with white women, too, and his father believed he had been shot by a white man, as did others in town. The lynching was documented as premeditated and coordinated, as many such events were. It was a year of white on black violence: in 1918 there had been 62 lynchings in the United States since January 1, seven of them in Mississippi.\\"Lynching an American Pastime\\", Washington Bee, 04 January 1919; posted at State Sanctioned website; accessed 8 March 2018 Deputy County Sheriff Crane colluded with the mob to provide access to the victims at the jail, claiming that he had been overpowered by the mob. In addition, men cut off power to the town from the main station, perhaps to support witnesses' later claims of being unable to identify members of the mob. The four young people were brutally treated. Maggie was smashed in the face with a wrench. All four were thrown from the bridge, but Maggie caught on to the bridge and survived the initial attempt on her life., Chronicling America, Library of Congress When she was thrown from the bridge a second time, she again grabbed a railing. The mob hauled her up a third time, and were finally successful in throwing her over and hanging her. When the victims were buried the next day, witnesses reported seeing Alma House's unborn baby moving in the womb. 1942 lynchings In 1942 during World War II, Ernest Green, a fourteen-year-old black boy, along with Charlie Lang, aged fifteen, were seen speaking to Dorothy Martin, a thirteen-year-old white girl whom they knew from the area. Accounts vary as to what took place. One or more whites who saw the three youths together while driving by reported the incident to Martin's father. Another account said that the incident was \\"attempted rape\\" after Dorothy told her parents about it. The boys were arrested by Clarke County Sheriff LLoyd McNeal, and appeared before justice of the peace W.E. Eddins, perhaps in a hearing at his residence, where they allegedly confessed to attempted rape. By October 10 the boys were held in the jail at the county seat of Quitman. On October 12, Quitman Town Marshall G.F. Dabbs handed the boys over to several white men, who took the boys away. The men took the boys to the Shubuta railroad bridge, where they mutilated them by cutting off their genitals, and hanged the youths from the bridge. The sheriff told the Pittsburgh Courier that the local people respected law and order, but that \\"Them niggers is gettin‚Äô uppity, you know.‚Äù Walter Atkins, a black journalist, asserted in 1942 that the ‚Äúrickety old span is a symbol of the South as much as magnolia blossoms or mint julep colonels.‚Äù Sherriff McLean was said to have expressed remorse on his deathbed for the murders of Green and Lang. Governor Paul Johnson declared that the lynchings were murders, there was nothing he could do about it, and criticized first lady Eleanor Roosevelt for discussing the matter in the national media. Because of its own history and connection to the white lynchings of thousands of blacks in the South, the bridge was added to the National List of Historic Places in 1988. As of 2016, the abandoned bridge still stands at the end of East Street but is blocked off from access by a barricade. =Voter suppression and Great Migration= At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Mississippi disenfranchised most black voters through passing a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. In Shubuta whites had also suppressed black voting by destroying ballots, imposing poll tests such as correctly guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, and intimidation by the Ku Klux Klan. Following the 1918 lynchings, many black workers left Clarke County, leaving cotton to rot in the fields. The town's population dropped by 21% (See table below) and the county population dropped 17% from 1910 to 1920. (See Demographics, Clarke County, Mississippi) The first wave of the Great Migration from the rural South continued to the Second World War. In the 1930s, a number of African-American residents from the Shubata area followed Reverend Louis W. Parson to Albany, New York to escape the violence and in a search for industrial jobs and better opportunities.Jennifer A. Lemak, Southern Life, Northern City, The History of Albany's Rapp Road Community, Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 2008 They created a community to the west of the city, building houses along Rapp Road within what was one land parcel purchased by Parson.

It is located along the Sunflower River. Clarksdale is named after John Clark, a settler who founded the city in the mid-19th century when he established a timber mill and business. The western boundary of the county is formed by the Mississippi River. In the Mississippi Delta region, Clarksdale is an agricultural and trading center. Many African-American musicians developed the blues here, and took this original American music with them to Chicago and other northern cities during the Great Migration. History The Sunflower River Bridge in Clarksdale, 1890 =Early history= The Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians had occupied the Delta region for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settlers, and had each developed complex cultures that took full advantage of their environment. European Americans built on this past, developing Clarksdale at the intersection of two former Indian routes: the Lower Creek Trade Path, which extended westward from present-day Augusta, Georgia, to New Mexico; and the Chakchiuma Trade Trail, which ran northeastward to the former village at present-day Pontotoc, Mississippi. They later improved these trails for roadways wide enough for wagons. The first removal treaty carried out under the Indian Removal Act was the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, by which the Choctaw people were forced to cede 15 million acres of their homelands to the United States and to move to Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma), west of the Mississippi River. A similar forced removal of the Chickasaw Nation began in 1837; when they reached Indian Territory, the federal government assigned them to what had been the westernmost part of the Choctaw Nation. =Development of cotton plantations= Following the removal of the Indians, European-American settlers migrated to the Delta region, where the fertile lowlands soil proved to be excellent for growing cotton after the land was cleared. They brought or purchased thousands of enslaved African Americans to work the several extensive cotton plantations developed in the county. The first ones were always developed with riverfront access, as the waterways were the chief forms of transportation. John Clark founded the town of Clarksdale in 1848, when he bought land in the area and started a timber business. It became a trading center. Clark married the sister of James Lusk Alcorn, a major planter who owned a nearby plantation. Alcorn became a politician, and was elected by the state legislature as US Senator. Later he was elected by voters as governor of the state. Thriving from the cotton trade and associated business, Clarksdale soon earned the title \\"The Golden Buckle on the Cotton Belt\\". African-American slaves cultivated and processed cotton, worked as artisans, and cultivated and processed produce and livestock on the plantations. They built the wealth of \\"King Cotton\\" in the state. U.S. Census data shows Coahoma County, Mississippi's 1860 population was 1,521 whites and 5,085 slaves. James Alcorn was a major planter, owning 77 slaves according to the 1860 Slave Schedule. Cedar Mound Plantation, located 5 miles south of Clarksdale, was purchased and named in 1834 by Alex Kerr Boyce. He died childless and it was inherited by his niece Mrs. Catherine (Kate) (nƒóe Henderson) Adams of South Carolina. She divided it among her unmarried children: Jennie, Will, and Lucia Adams. The sisters' correspondence (1845-1944) is held in a collection in their name at the University of Mississippi.Jennie and Lucia Adams Collection, Mississippi Delta Manuscripts, University of Mississippi Libraries Post-Civil War and Reconstruction era After slavery was abolished, many black families labored as sharecroppers or tenant farmers. They gained some independence, no longer working in gangs of laborers, but were often at a disadvantage in negotiations with white planters, as they were generally illiterate. Planters advanced them supplies and seed at the beginning of the season, allowed them to buy other goods on credit, and settled with them at the end of harvest for a major portion of the crop. Historian Nicholas Lemann writes \\"segregation strengthened the grip of the sharecropper system by ensuring that most blacks would have no arena of opportunity in life except for the cotton fields\\" (p. 6). During the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War, Mississippi's blacks and poor whites both benefited from the State's new constitution of 1868, which adopted universal suffrage; repealed property qualifications for suffrage or for office; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.W.E.B. DuBois, Black Reconstruction in America, 1860‚Äì1880. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p. 437 Those gains were short-lived, as insurgent white paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts worked to suppress black voting from 1868 on. By 1875 conservative white Democrats regained control of the state legislature in Mississippi. They later passed Jim Crow laws, including legal segregation of public facilities. A freedman named Bill Peace, who had served in the Union Army and returned to Clarksdale after the war, persuaded his former owner to allow him to form a security force to prevent theft from the plantation. On October 9, 1875, whites in Clarksdale began hearing rumors that \\"General Peace\\" was preparing his troops to plunder the town; rumors spread that he was planning to murder the whites. A white militia was formed, and they suppressed Peace's \\"revolt\\". Across Mississippi, white militias frequently formed in response to similar fears of armed black revolt. Twentieth-century historian Nicholas Lemann writes: > Like the establishment of sharecropping, the restoration to power of the > all-white Democratic Party in the South was a development of such magnitude > to whites that it became encrusted in legend; many towns have their own > mythic stories of the redemption of the white South. In Clarksdale it is the > story of the \\"race riot\\" of October 9, 1875. After the Reconstruction era and construction in 1879 of the Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railway through the town, Clarksdale was incorporated in 1882. In 1886, the town's streets were laid out; it was not until 1913 that any were paved. =20th century to present= Former Yazoo & Mississippi Valley/Illinois Central Passenger Depot in Clarksdale, early 1900s. The building is now used for the Delta Blues Museum. African Americans composed most of the farm labor in the county into the 1940s, when increasing mechanization reduced the need for field workers. Thousands of blacks left Mississippi in the Great Migration to Chicago, St. Louis, and later, West Coast cities to work in the defense industry. They developed a rich musical tradition drawing from many strands of music, and influencing jazz and the blues in Chicago. In the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe began to settle in Mississippi, often working as merchants. From the 1930s to the 1970s, Clarksdale had one of the largest Jewish populations of any city in Mississippi. In the 1930s they founded Beth Israel Cemetery. They moved away as the city declined in population, with rural areas losing residents. =The Great Migration= The movement of large numbers of people both to and from Clarksdale is prominent in the city's history. Prior to 1920, Delta plantations were in constant need of laborers, and many black families moved to the area to work as sharecroppers. After World War I, plantation owners even encouraged blacks to move from the other parts of Mississippi to the Delta region for work. By this time, Clarksdale had also become home to a multi-cultural mixture of Lebanese, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrant merchants. By 1920, the price of cotton had fallen, and many blacks living in the Delta began to leave. The Illinois Central Railroad operated a large depot in Clarksdale and provided a Chicago-bound route for those seeking greater economic opportunities in the north; it soon became the primary departure point for many. During the 1940s, three events occurred which increased the exodus of African-Americans from Clarksdale. First, it became possible to commercially produce a cotton crop entirely by machine, which lessened the need for a large, low-paid workforce. (Coincidentally, it was on 28 acres of the nearby Hopson Plantation where the International Harvester Company perfected the single-row mechanical cotton picking machine in 1946; soil was prepared, seeded, picked and bailed entirely by machines, while weeds were eradicated by flame.) Second, many African-American GIs (soldiers) returned from World War II to find slim opportunities for employment in the Delta region. Finally, there appeared an accelerated climate of racial hatred, as evidenced by the violence against such figures as NAACP representative Aaron Henry. \\"The Great Migration\\" north became the largest movement of Americans in U.S. history, and was recounted with Clarksdale triangulated with Chicago and Washington D.C. in Nicholas Lemann's award-winning book The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How it Changed America. The History Channel later produced a documentary based on the book, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman, who is also a co-owner of Ground Zero Blues Club. =Civil rights in Clarksdale= On September 10, 1919, Black veteran L.B. Reed was lynched as part of the Red Summer of 1919. Clarksdale played a very important role in the civil rights movement in Mississippi. The starting point for a civil rights movement in Clarksdale was the rape at gunpoint of two African-American women, Leola Tates and Erline Mills, in August 1951. The two white teenagers they said assaulted them, who admitted the event but said it was consensual, were arrested, but \\"despite the overwhelming evidence against them, the justice of peace court judge freed the accused perpetrators\\". This was followed by the nearby () lynching of Emmett Till in 1955. =Recent history= Bill Luckett, former mayor of Clarksdale Delta Avenue Clarksdale's citizens are famous for their civil rights activism and Clarksdale's police department is equally famous for its efforts to limit these rights. On May 29, 1958, Martin Luther King Jr. visited Clarksdale for the first major meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). In 1960, Aaron Henry, a local pharmacist, was named state president of the NAACP, and went on to organize a two-year-long boycott of Clarksdale businesses. In 1962, King again visited Clarksdale on the first stop on a region-wide tour, where he urged a crowd of 1,000 to \\"stand in, sit in, and walk by the thousands\\". National headlines in February 2013 covered the discovery of mayoral candidate Marco McMillian, who was found murdered near the town of Sherard, to the west of his home town of Clarksdale. Because McMillian was openly gay and was badly beaten before his death, there was speculation that his murder qualified to be classified as a hate crime. Lawrence Reed, an acquaintance of McMillian, was charged, tried, and found guilty of the murder in April 2015. =Music history= A crossroads tribute in Clarksdale, where blues guitarist Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul to the devil Clarksdale has been historically significant in the history of the blues. The Mississippi Blues Trail places interpretative markers for historic sites such as Clarksdale's Riverside Hotel, where Bessie Smith died following an auto accident on Highway 61. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. Early supporters of the effort to preserve Clarksdale's musical legacy included the award-winning photographer and journalist Panny Mayfield, Living Blues magazine founder Jim O'Neal, and attorney Walter Thompson, father of sports journalist Wright Thompson. In 1995, Mt. Zion Memorial Fund founder Skip Henderson, a vintage guitar dealer from New Brunswick, New Jersey and friend of Delta Blues Museum founder Sid Graves, purchased the Illinois Central Railroad passenger depot to save it from planned demolition. With the help of local businessman Jon Levingston, as well as the Delta Council, Henderson received a US$1.279 million grant from the federal government to restore the passenger depot. These redevelopment funds were then transferred on the advice of Clarksdale's City attorney, Hunter Twiford, to Coahoma County, in order to establish a tourism locale termed \\"Blues Alley\\", after a phrase coined by then Mayor, Henry Espy. The popularity of the Delta Blues Museum and the growth of the Sunflower River Blues & Gospel Festival and Juke Joint Festivals have provided an economic boost to the city. Geography Clarksdale is located on the banks of the Sunflower River in the Mississippi Delta. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.07% is water. U.S. Routes 49, 61, and 278 go through Clarksdale.

Arts and culture =Delta Blues Museum= Delta Blues Museum Juke Joint Festival at Delta Cinema in Clarksdale In late 1979 Carnegie Public Library Director Sid Graves began a nascent display series which later became the nucleus of the Delta Blues Museum. Graves single-handedly nurtured the beginnings of the museum in the face of an indifferent community and an often recalcitrant Library Board, at times resorting to storing displays in the trunk of his car when denied space in the library. When the fledgling museum was accidentally discovered by Billy Gibbons of the rock band ZZ Top through contact with Howard Stovall Jr., the Delta Blues Museum became the subject of national attention as a pet project of the band, and the Museum began to enjoy national recognition. In 1995 the museum, at that time Clarksdale's only attraction, grew to include a large section of the newly renovated library building, but remained under the tight control of the Carnegie Library Board, who subsequently fired Sid Graves, at the time seriously ill. Graves died in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in January 2005. In an interim move from the renovated Library building, the Museum spent most of 1996 in a converted retail storefront on Delta Avenue under the direction of a politically connected former Wisconsin native, the late Ron Gorsegner. In 1997‚Äì1998 Coahoma County would finally provide funds to form a separate Museum Board of Directors composed mainly of socially prominent, local white blues fans, and to renovate the adjoining Illinois Central Railroad freight depot, providing a permanent home for the Delta Blues Museum. =Mississippi Blues Trail markers= WROX building in Clarksdale. The site is also list on the National Register of Historic Places. Several Mississippi Blues Trail markers are located in Clarksdale. One is located on Stovall Road at a cabin believed to have been lived in by famed bluesman McKinley Morganfield, also known as Muddy Waters. Morganfield supposedly lived there from 1915 until 1943 while he worked on the large Stovall cotton plantation before moving to Chicago after mistreatment at the hands of a Stovall overseer. Another Blues Trail marker is located at the Riverside Hotel, which provided lodging to blues entertainers passing through the delta. In 2009, a marker devoted to Clarksdale native Sam Cooke was unveiled in front of the New Roxy Theater. = Clarksdale Walk of Fame = Established in 2008, the Clarksdale Walk of Fame are plaques located in downtown which honor notable people from Clarksdale.

Situated on the Mississippi River, Friars Point was once a busy port town, and remains the only place in Coahoma County with public access to the river's shore.

The town was founded in 1836 and originally called \\"Farrar's Point\\". When the town incorporated in 1852, its name was changed to \\"Friar's Point\\" to honor Robert Friar, an early settler, legislator, and businessman who sold fuel to passing steamboats. In 1850, the county seat was moved from the nearby town of Delta to Friars Point. Strategically situated at a bend in the Mississippi River, Friars Point flourished before the Civil War as the largest shipping center for cotton south of Memphis. During the Civil War, Union troops occupied and burned portions of the town. The Robinson- Slack-Marinelli House (now the Minie Ball House), which still stands and bears the mark of shelling from gunboats, was used as a headquarters by Union General Napoleon Bonaparte Buford. General William Tecumseh Sherman and Admiral David Dixon Porter used Friars Point as a rendezvous for 45 transport ships in December 1862, prior to attacking Vicksburg. Friars Point was also home to Confederate Brigadier General James L. Alcorn, whose grave and former plantation, Eagles Nest, are located a short distance east of the town. Alcorn turned from Whig to Republican after the war, and went on to become governor with the support of the large number of carpetbaggers who had settled in Friars Point. In 1875, when Reconstruction was fighting for its life against a campaign of violence from the Democrats, Alcorn led a white force against black Republicans at Friar's Point. The battle led to a number of people being killed, and served to suppress the black vote, allowing conservative Democrats to regain political power.George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstructiony, 2007 The famous gunman and train robber Jesse James came to Friars Point one evening during the 1880s. He visited with the Methodist minister, then played poker and had some drinks at the local saloon. The next morning he was gone. The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad was completed to Friars Point in 1887. In 1888, the county jail at Friars Point was completely destroyed by fire, killing five prisoners. Charles Lindbergh ran out of gas while flying his plane over Friars Point in 1924, and landed at a place he later called \\"The Haunted House\\". As nearby Clarksdale grew in population and influence, it challenged Friars Point's hold on the county government. In 1892, Coahoma County was divided into two jurisdictions, one going to Friars Point and the other to Clarksdale. In 1930, the county seat was given exclusively to Clarksdale. Historian Lawrence J. Nelson wrote that by that point, \\"Friars Point had receded into a sleepy river community.\\" In the 1930s there was ferry service between Friars Point and Helena, Arkansas. The cost was one dollar for a car and driver and 25 cents per passenger. On April 26, 2011, a tornadopart of the 2011 Super Outbreak hit Friars Point.

The population was 1,925 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The town of Wesson was founded in 1864, during the Civil War, by Col. James Madison Wesson. Having lost his mills at Bankston, Wesson relocated to the town that now bears his name. There he built the Mississippi Manufacturing Company which produced a fine quality cotton fabric. In 1871 he sold the mill to William Oliver and John T. Hardy who renamed it the Mississippi Mills. The mills became famous for the quality of cotton fabric produced which was dubbed \\"Mississippi silk\\" at the Centennial celebration of 1876. A product of the Industrial Revolution, the mills in Wesson began to utilize the new technology of the rapidly changing age. One year after Thomas Edison perfected the light bulb, the Mississippi Mills put them to use. It was said that passengers on the evening train would rush to the windows when passing through Wesson in order to see the marvelous lights. This prosperity, however, came to an end after the death of Captain Oliver in 1891. Financial difficulties followed by the economic Panic of 1893, family conflict, and labor disputes caused the mills to fall into receivership in the early 1900s. Eventually, the mills were dismantled and sold for scrap during the First World War. The first public school in Wesson was built in 1875, and the community college was added in 1928. Geography Wesson is located in southernmost Copiah County. Small portions of the town extend south and east into Lincoln County. U.S. Route 51 passes through the town, leading north to Hazlehurst, the Copiah county seat, and south to Brookhaven. Exit 48 on Interstate 55 is located west of town on Mount Zion Road.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.83% of the population. There were 430 households, out of which 36.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.7% were married couples living together, 14.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.6% were non-families. 23.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Education Copiah-Lincoln Community College provides academic courses equivalent to the first two years of college or university work that can apply to a baccalaureate or professional degree. Co-Lin also offers programs to prepare students for employment and community service, as well as programs for workers to update their skills or learn new ones. The main campus is located in Wesson, while another campus is located in Natchez, and a facility is located in Magee. Copiah-Lincoln Agricultural High School, through the joint efforts of Copiah and Lincoln counties, was established in the fall of 1915 at Wesson, on the edge of Copiah County. During its early years, the high school was a boarding school, serving the rural districts of those counties. However, as consolidation of local schools progressed within the counties, practically every family in each county had access to an accredited high school. This availability of local schools created a new role for the agricultural school. Educators in the agricultural high school and in the county public schools became aware that the youth of Copiah and Lincoln counties needed educational opportunities beyond 12th grade. To meet this need, Copiah-Lincoln Community College was organized during the summer of 1928 under the authority of Section 308, Chapter 283, of the General Laws of the State of Mississippi of 1924. Although an enrollment of about 50 students was anticipated that first year, the actual enrollment was more than 90. Since its establishment in 1928, Copiah-Lincoln has continued to grow and now occupies a prominent position in the state's educational system with an enrollment of over 2,000 and a physical plant valued at more than $35 million. In 1934, the officials of Simpson County requested an opportunity to join in the rights and benefits of the public junior college. Accordingly, the Copiah-Lincoln Board of Trustees accepted Simpson as a cooperating county. Since that time four additional counties have joined in the support of Copiah-Lincoln: Franklin County in 1948; Lawrence County in 1965; Jefferson County in 1967; and Adams County in 1971. In the fall of 1978, the Copiah County superintendent of education assumed responsibility for the high school. It was renamed Wesson High School.

The population was 2,586 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Covington County. History =From Williamsburg Depot to Collins= Collins was originally incorporated as Williamsburg Depot in 1899. The Gulf and Ship Island Railroad had completed construction, and bypassed Williamsburg, the county seat at that time. The sawmills moved to the new town of Williamsburg Depot in order to be closer to the railroad. As lumber was an important industry during the time, the town moved with them. Not long after, Williamsburg Depot grew to a town of 6,000 - 7,000 people. Eventually, the difficulties of having such a long town name, Williamsburg Depot, became clear. The length caused many people to write it over their stamps, voiding the postage. In order to correct this issue, the postmaster asked to have the town name changed in 1905, and the postal service came up with a short and easy name \\"Bad\\". For reasons that may be clear, the residents rejected this name, and eventually came up with Collins, in honor of Fred W. Collins, leader of the state's Republican party and U. S. Marshal for the Southern District of Mississippi. The town's name was officially changed on November 24, 1906. =Becoming the county seat= In 1906, a portion of the west side of Covington County became Jefferson Davis County. As a result, Williamsburg lost its position at the center of the county, and a new county seat was needed. Collins eventually emerged over Seminary and Ora, Mississippi, and a new county courthouse was built. The first court place was held in 1908. =Decline and resurgence= Eventually, the lumber industry in Collins exhausted the timber resources and moved. The town population dwindled from 7,000 to 700. However, industry began to return to the town in 1936 when U.S. 49 and U.S. 84 were built, putting the town at the crossroads of these two major highways. In addition, the Plantation Pipeline was run from Baton Rouge to the east coast. It passed through the community of Kola, which was soon annexed by Collins. =Hurricane Katrina and Duryea Adopt-A-Town= In September 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck Collins. As most aid agencies were concentrating on major metropolitan areas such as New Orleans, small towns like Collins were seemingly overlooked. Duryea, Pennsylvania, which had experienced similar flooding as the result of Hurricane Agnes in 1972, sought a town similar in size and demographics to \\"adopt\\" and help rebuild after the devastation wrought by the largest natural disaster in the history of the town. By hosting a bazaar and through other various fundraising efforts, Duryea helped rebuild. Collins Mayor V.O. Smith and his wife, Ada, flew to Duryea to thank their mayor Keith Moss, organizer Trina Moss and the townspeople of Duryea. This led to a bond between the two towns and has included several visits to both towns.

On October 19, 2015, the Freedom from Religion Foundation sent a letter to the City of Collins, on behalf of a local citizen, asking for displays of a religious nature to be removed from the Bettie D. Robertson City Park. The letter stated that, among other things, permanent displays of 3 Latin crosses, a statue of Jesus carrying a cross, and a globe with City of Collins displayed above Matthew 8:12 \\"I am the Light of the World\\" are unconstitutional and \\"tremendously un-welcoming to non-Christians\\".

The population was 314 at the 2010 census. Okatoma Creek, part of the Pascagoula River watershed, runs through Seminary, and is popular for canoeing and kayaking. History =1846-1890= The area was sparsely populated prior to the Civil War. In the same location as where the town sits today, Covington County resident and Presbyterian pastor A. R. Graves opened Zion Seminary, a boarding school for men and women, in 1845. The seminary offered courses in law, medicine, and religious studies. At its largest, the seminary had more than 500 students. Dormitories and cottages housed them. During the Civil War, all but one building of Zion Seminary burned. Local legend has it that the buildings were burned by Union sympathizers, but it is not clear if this is true. The seminary was in operation until it burned again in 1890. The site of the Zion Seminary was then used to build Seminary Attendance Center; the school still sits today upon this location in the center of town. =1899: The town is born= In the late 1800s, across the Piney Woods region of South Mississippi, lumber companies cut the virgin timber from these areas. Towns began springing up along railroads, then the main means of transportation. The population of Seminary began to boom in the late 1800s, but when the timber had been cut, the boom continued on to the next community. In the late 1800s, the residents petitioned the state of Mississippi to incorporate into a municipality, and the charter was granted in 1899. The newborn town's citizens chose the name \\"Seminary\\" to keep alive the memory of the Zion Seminary. =Modern-day Seminary= Seminary is still a very small town, with only a handful of businesses, including Ramey's, Dollar General, two banks, two doctor's offices, a pharmacy, an art studio, a hardware store, a barber shop, and one restaurant, The Dixie Grill. The rural area around Seminary, however, is growing significantly. The population of the area, including the town of Seminary and the rural, unincorporated communities of Okahay, Eminence, Sanford, Lux, Foxtrot, Ora, Lone Star, and Richmond, grew by more than 10% between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. This significant growth is likely a result of a good school system and the area's proximity to Hattiesburg, which lies 10‚Äì20 minutes south of the Seminary area. New businesses are springing up on Highway 49 just outside the town's corporate limits. Geography Seminary is located in south-central Covington County.

The county courthouse is located within Hernando's historic downtown square. It is located at the intersection of Commerce Street and present-day U.S. 51. History At the time of encounters by French and Spanish colonists, the Chickasaw people had long inhabited this area. France had developed colonial settlements along the Gulf Coast, to the north on the middle Mississippi River in what was called the Illinois Country, and in New France (present-day Quebec in Canada). An 18th-century French colonial log house (see first photo in gallery below) in Hernando is a reminder of typical dwellings built in their settlements in the Illinois country, such as in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. The French and French Canadians had a wide trading network with various American Indian tribes along this river, for instance in Natchez. Following the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and under pressure from the United States, the Chickasaw finally signed a treaty to cede most of their lands in this area to the US. Most of the tribe were removed to west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. This town was first called Jefferson by its new European American settlers. It was renamed as Hernando in 1832, after the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. He was the first European to discover the Mississippi River. This county was developed by European Americans during the antebellum years for cotton plantations, dependent on the enslaved labor of African Americans. During the early 20th century, many blues musicians developed in Hernando. African Americans had developed a strong musical tradition in areas along the Mississippi River, where many had grown up in families working as sharecroppers on cotton plantations. During the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century, many blues musicians migrated north, taking their music to Chicago and helping create the culture of that city.

The population was 33,484 at the 2010 census, up from 21,054 in 2000. Olive Branch is part of the Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region that consists of three counties in southwest Tennessee, five counties in northwest Mississippi, and two counties in eastern Arkansas. From 1990 to 2010 Olive Branch was the fastest growing city in the United States, with a growth rate of 838%. Along with other rapidly growing suburbs in DeSoto County, Olive Branch attributes most of its growth and development to the exodus of large numbers of middle-class families from central Memphis. History Historic downtown Olive Branch The first permanent Anglo settlers in the area were Stephen Flinn and his wife's brother-in-law, Milton Blocker. On April 13, 1836, they purchased of land ‚Äì known as Sections 34 and 35 ‚Äì in newly created DeSoto County from Chickasaw chief Lush-Pun-Tubby for $1,600. Flinn conveyed the land to Blocker for $6,400 in 1840. A small community initially known as \\"Cowpens\\" sprang up in the early 1840s. The name was changed to \\"Watson's Crossroads\\" in 1842. In 1846, when a post office was established, the name was changed again to \\"Olive Branch\\". Frances Wilson Blocker, a descendant of one of the community's founders, suggested the name as a way to symbolize the biblical story of a dove bringing a branch to Noah. With the exception of a few skirmishes occurring in an area southwest of the community, Olive Branch escaped much of the destruction and violence during the Civil War. Olive Branch was incorporated as a town on May 1, 1874. Ben Wesson was elected as the first mayor. At the first census conducted after incorporation in 1880, the population was 73. A railroad line was built through Olive Branch in 1885, connecting the town to Memphis and Birmingham. The town was officially designated a village on March 6, 1888. At the turn of the 20th century, nearly 200 people lived in Olive Branch. In the ensuing years, several modern amenities were introduced in the village, including the first cotton gin (1910), a public water system (1922), and electrical service (1927). T.H.

The population was 13,092 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Grenada County. History South Main Street, Grenada Grenada Depot, c. 1910 Grenada Depot, 2010 Grenada was formed in 1836, after federal removal of the Choctaw people who had long occupied this territory. It was the result of the union of the two adjacent towns (separated by the present-day Line Street) of Pittsburg and Tulahoma (or Tullahoma), founded, respectively, by Franklin Plummer and Hiram Runnels. Development included stores and businesses that supported the county court and market days. Plantations were first developed along the Yazoo River for transportation and access to water. Cotton was the major commodity crop, dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. In 1851, Grenada townspeople founded the Yalobusha Baptist Female Institute for education of their young white women. In 1882, the school was taken over by the Methodists and renamed as Grenada College. Classified in the 20th century as a junior college, it encountered financial troubles during the Great Depression. The church closed the college in 1936 and transferred its assets to Millsaps College. In December 1862, Confederate general Earl Van Dorn, whose troops had been encamped in Grenada, led the three brigades under his command in an attempt to destroy the Union supply depot at Holly Springs, Mississippi. =Lynching of four men= In 1885 two white men, Perry McChristian and Felix Williams, were accused of murdering two white peddlers and were lynched. During the lynching, they implicated two Black men, Bartley James and John Campbell, who were then also lynched by a mob of white men.Daily Alta California 9 July 1885 =Civil rights era= In the civil rights era, African Americans throughout Mississippi were active in seeking their constitutional rights. Congress passed legislation in 1964 and 1965 that ended segregation of public facilities and protected voting rights, authorizing federal oversight and enforcement. In 1966, James Meredith started a solo March Against Fear to challenge oppression in Mississippi and encourage voter registration by African Americans. His planned route from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi, passed through Grenada. After Meredith was shot and wounded on the second day, and had to be hospitalized, other prominent activists and many marchers joined the effort, taking up his cause. The marchers, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Dick Gregory, spent about a week demonstrating in Grenada against discrimination and for voters rights. During that time, the town officials appeared cooperative, protecting the marchers with local police. Six black voter registrars were hired, and registered 1,000 black residents during that week. But after the march passed through, the county fired the registrars. It was reported later that summer that the town never entered the 1,000 new black voters on official rolls. They had to start all over again to gain official voter registration., reprinted in As the civil rights movement continued to press in 1966 and 1967 for voter registration and opportunities in employment, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) ran a civil rights organizing project in Grenada which lasted at least 11 months. They worked to register voters and gain concessions for hiring African Americans in local businesses and restaurants. These were still segregated, despite the Federal anti-segregation and voting rights laws. Geography Grenada is situated on the south bank of the Yalobusha River.
