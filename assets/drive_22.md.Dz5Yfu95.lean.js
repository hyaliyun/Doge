He is best known for establishing The Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy at University of the Pacific Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. The library consists of collection of 1,400 human skulls collected over past 40 years. Atkinson is also known for developing the Universal Appliance in the 1960s which led to eventual formation of the Unitek Division of 3M Company. Life He was born in 1886 in Brunswick, Georgia His father was a dentist. He then attended Marist College and Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. He earned his dental degree from Emory University. He then taught the subjects of anatomy and Orthodontics at Emory from 1917 to 1924. It was during this time that Atkinson wanted to study the anatomical changes in a skull of a child. His efforts to obtain a skull to study changes were thwarted many time due to rarity of finding a skull of a child. He then decided to personally start collecting skulls to increase his knowledge about anatomy of a child. In 1919 he purchased five juvenile human skulls from a company in Germany which aged from 3‚Äì14 years old. These were the beginnings of what became the collection that is now held at University of Pacific School of Dentistry. Dr. Edward Angle impressed by Atkinson's knowledge of anatomy invited him to study orthodontics at the school in Pasadena. Atkinson joined the school in 1920 and four years later, he moved to Pasadena and began teaching as a faculty at Angle School of Orthodontia in 1924. Atkinson became the Director of the Orthodontic Program established at University of Southern California in 1934 and stayed at that position until 1954. Career During his six years of teaching, he taught students the technique and etiology of malocclusion. During his teaching, Dr. Atkinson was perplexed with the amount of heavy forces used to move human teeth in practice of Orthodontia. At the same time another Orthodontist, Dr. Albin Oppenheim who was an Orthodontic Professor at University of Southern California, was practicing orthodontics with use of light pressure which allowed natural bone turnover. Influenced by Dr. Oppenheim's research, Dr. Atkinson decided to improve the orthodontic appliance and patented a design for Universal Appliance on October 28, 1929. The appliance incorporated Angle's ribbon arch and edgewise arch appliances but introduced a rectangular double-channel bracket that could hold multiple arch wires. The components of this appliance allowed light forces to be used when moving teeth. Mr. Ret Alter, working with Dr. Atkinson. produced the appliance for working Orthodontists around the Pasadena area. The patent at that time was owned by Caltech and eventually after Ret Alter's death, Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation purchased the business. The business at that time flourished until company eventually decided to open a new division called Unitek which was abbreviation for - The Universal Technique Appliance. The Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy After starting his collection in 1919, Dr. Atkinson kept his collection at his home in Pasadena, California in an 8-room, fireproof, air-conditioned building. Dr. Atkinson kept the collection of skulls with him for nearly 40 years. During these 40 years, he would study the facial growth patterns and dental characteristics of the different skulls and many of his publications resulted after his research on these skulls. In 1964, University of Pacific School of Dentistry acquired the skull collection. The people responsible for these negotiations were Dr. George Hollenback, Dr. John Tocchini, Dr. Robert Burns and Dr. Spencer Atkinson. The collection was initially stored in a temporary storage. After the opening of the dental school in new building in 1967, Dr. Frederick T. West became the curator of the Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy. The decision to add the words \\"applied anatomy\\" was taken by Dr. Atkinson due to the contributions made by the skulls to the understanding of anatomical changes during a human life. In 1993, Spencer R. Atkinson Library was brought under an umbrella title The Institute of Dental History and Craniofacial Study. This titled housed five collections which included Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, A. W. Ward Museum of Dentistry, The James Campbell, Jr. Dental Radiology Collection, The College of Physicians and Surgeons Historical Society Collection and P & S Comparative Anatomy Collection. Currently a committee consisting of 17 members decides the policy and future planning of this Institute. The library itself consists of 1,400 skulls. The specimens come from many different countries and range from fetal to early adulthood. The skulls are only accessible to postgraduate students, faculty and any visiting professionals in different specialties of dentistry.

He spent most of his career at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. John Alexander Pope Pope was born in Detroit, Michigan, and as a young adult, he attended Yale College where he attained his bachelor's degree in English literature. Before graduation, however, he was active in the China International Famine Relief Commission. While serving in the Commission, he was sent to the Yellow River valley where he surveyed famine conditions. This allowed him to see China firsthand and also meet Alan Priest who later became the curator of Far Eastern Ceramics at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Pope later attributed meeting Priest in Beijing as the most influential factor in determining his eventual, life-long field of study of blue-and-white Asian porcelains. Pope pursued graduate studies at Harvard where he studied the history, archaeology, and languages of China and Japan. He was awarded his master's degree in 1940 and his Ph. D. in 1955. Pope took a leave from his studies in 1945 through 1946 to serve in the Marine Corps Reserve. With the rank of Captain, he worked in the Corps in China as a Chinese language translator. Pope joined the Freer in 1943 and worked as an Associate in Research. From 1946 he was hired as the Assistant Director and served in that position until 1962 when he became the museum's director. Pope's deep interest in the Asian porcelains ceramics prompted him to establish criteria and a methodology for stylistic and dating analysis of 14th and 15th blue-and-white porcelains. Beginning in the 1960s, Pope took many trips to Japan which resulted in his research slowly shifting to the study of Japanese ceramics. Pope retired in 1971 while simultaneously continuing at the Freer as the Director Emeritus of Research Coordinator for Far Eastern Ceramics.

The center was established to provide specialised patient transfer, rescue services, and air ambulance operations. It was created specifically to ease the transportation of wounded people from remote areas in Jordan to medical centers, though it can also serve people in neighbouring countries. King Abdullah II donated two fully equipped helicopters to the center and funds to maintain them for two years. In addition to the helicopters, the center has an operational headquarters and staff. History The Jordanian center has two AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters. A board was created in 2014, which sought to work towards establishing the center. Several meetings were held, of which some were chaired by the King himself. The fact that the establishment of this center would boost the competitiveness of Jordan's health sector was stressed and so this encouraged the government to work faster in order to get the center operational before the end of 2015. The center has also set standards for helipad construction and has sent them to hospitals. Its logo was designed by Ahmad Nazih Shaqour. In October 4, 2015, the center successfully completed its first evacuation.

Overview IBAC's jurisdiction includes: * public sector agencies and bodies * local councils * members of Parliament, electorate officers and ministerial advisors * the judiciary * Victoria Police personnel, including sworn and unsworn staff and Protective Services Officers. IBAC is one of three key independent authorities in the Victorian integrity system. The other agencies are the Victorian Ombudsman and the Victorian Auditor-General's Office. Under the IBAC Act, IBAC is accountable to the people of Victoria and reports to the State Parliament. It is also subject to scrutiny through: * the Victorian Inspectorate * the IBAC Parliamentary Committee. History The IBAC Act was passed on 29 November 2011, establishing: * the role of the Commissioner * the Parliamentary Committee to oversee IBAC * IBAC's prevention and education functions. In 2012, the IBAC Act was amended to grant IBAC certain investigative powers as well as define its main areas of jurisdiction. Further legislation was subsequently introduced to replace the former Whistleblowers Protection Act 2001 with the Protected Disclosure Act 2012 (Protected Disclosure Act). IBAC was formally established on 1 July 2012 and became fully operational in February 2013. Powers IBAC has powers to effectively investigate allegations of serious corrupt conduct. These include the power to: * compel the production of documents and objects * enter and search premises * seize documents and objects * use surveillance devices * intercept telecommunications * hold private and public hearings * require people to give evidence at a hearing. IBAC must apply to the Supreme Court or other courts and tribunals before exercising some powers. The Public Interest Monitor reviews and makes submissions on IBAC's applications for surveillance device warrants and telecommunications interception warrants. Prior to its establishment, the powers granted under the IBAC Act were publicly criticised. Following establishment, former Court of Appeal judge and Chair of the Accountability Round Table, Stephen Charles QC, said the IBAC legislation was \\"seriously flawed\\" and that IBAC required investigatory powers similar to those of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. IBAC's Commissioner Stephen O‚ÄôBryan QC stated: \\"As with any new and complex legislation, it is not until it is applied in practice over time that areas for improvement are best identified. I am confident that the IBAC Act provides a solid initial framework for Victoria's new integrity regime and that, as with any such legislation, it will transform over time. Certainly, if elements of the Act fall short of what is needed to carry out most effectively its objectives and purposes, I have publicly stated that I will seek appropriate amendment.\\" After a year of full operation, the Commissioner determined some areas of the IBAC Act would benefit from amendment. Detailed in the April 2014 Special report following IBAC's first year of being fully operational, these included: * the extent to which IBAC must reasonably be satisfied before investigation complaints or allegations of corrupt conduct * the absence of the common law offence of misconduct in public office as something IBAC can investigate * the desirability of mandatory reporting of possible corrupt conduct to IBAC by public sector body heads and council CEOs. In September 2014, the Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 (Bill) was introduced to Parliament. The Bill proposed amendments to: * the threshold for conducting investigations * the inclusion of misconduct in public office * the ability to conduct preliminary investigations * the introduction of mandatory reporting for principal officers of public bodies. The Bill was not passed during the final session of Parliament before the November 2014 Victorian State election. On 1 February 2015, the newly sworn in Labor Government announced it was undertaking a review of the Victorian integrity system, including changes to IBAC's powers. A string of investigations in 2015 renewed public support to bring forward changes to the IBAC Act, with the government confirming its commitment to introduce a Bill to State Parliament in 2015. Investigations Operation Dunham Operation Dunham examined allegations of serious corruption at the Department of Education and Training (DET) focusing on: * how contracts around the online learning portal (Ultranet) were tendered for and awarded * the personal and business connections between department employees and businesses involved in the Ultranet project * whether current or former department employees released confidential information, or used their position to influence procurement processes * whether department employees received payments, gifts, travel, employment opportunities or other benefits because they were involved in the Ultranet tender or procurement processes * department procurement and conflict of interest processes, and organisational culture. Operation Ord Operation Ord examined allegations of serious corruption at the DET focusing on the: * involvement of current and former DET staff in the establishment of ‚Äòbanker schools‚Äô * allocation of funds to schools for goods and services that were not always provided * misuse of department funds. Operation Sandon In late 2019 and early 2020, IBAC conducted public hearings for Operation Sandon, which examined allegations of serious corrupt conduct in relation to planning and property development decisions at the outer suburban City of Casey council. focusing on: * the transparency and integrity of planning and property development decision making within Victoria * the improper influence of gifts, hospitality or benefits on public officers involved in planning and property development decision-making * whether the use of professional lobbyists or planning consultants to lobby State and local government has resulted in undue influence over planning and property development decision making within Victoria.

Chesbro Music was founded in 1911 and is based in Idaho Falls, Idaho.The Music Trades, \\"Integrity Has Built Chesbro Music Co.\\", March 1974 issue, page 64. https://42663fc993d37656913b-1a6c2ae57a0373e6e645c2f3050e64a8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2016/02/MusicTrades_March1974.jpg Chesbro owns Teton Guitars, and has been run by female CEOs since 1953. Early history Horace Chesbro, an 1897 violin studies graduate of the Northern Indiana Normal School in Valparaiso, Indiana, and his brother, Harry, began Chesbro Music Company in a storefront in Idaho Falls, Idaho in 1911. Having manufactured upright pianos in Seattle, Washington, they continued selling pianos and delivered them via horse-drawn wagon to rural Idaho communities. In 1925, Horace Chesbro started school band programs before public schools began funding and staffing their own music programs. A year later, Chesbro Music was the first to introduce the rural Northwest to recorded music with the wind-up Edison Chippendale Console Disc Phonograph. From the success of selling phonographs, the Chesbro Music Co. began building a three-story addition onto their storefront in Idaho Falls in June 1927. Through the Great Depression, Chesbro Music continued operation by honoring debt or credit with trade and housing employees in-store. By the late 1930s, Chesbro Music began offering jobbing (wholesale) franchises. Billboard reported that Chesbro Music was among the top 20 sheet music jobbers in 1944. Horace's son, Henry Chesbro, took over Chesbro Music Company as president in 1945 and began nationally wholesaling newly introduced LP records.  Female CEOs and Wholesale Expansion  In 1953, 70-year-old Ella Chesbro, Henry's mother, assumed management of the company due to the death of Henry Chesbro in a plane accident. Ella expanded jobbing franchises to include independent dealers who sold displays of stock music and folios. Five years later, to accommodate wholesale growth, Chesbro Music expanded their original 1911 store front to a 60,000 square foot warehouse and added a modern facade. Music industry executives and civic officials attended a ribbon-cutting in 1961 in the new building\\"Chesbro Observes 50th Anniversary in Newly-modernized Headquarters.\\" The Music Trades, July 1961 marking the company's 50-year anniversary. Then, with a Stanford degree in economics, 37-year-old Joan Chesbro Griggs, the company's second female CEO, took the reins from her grandmother in 1969. That year, Chesbro Music began attending the NAMM Show in Anaheim, California with a display of their wholesale business and print music library. Having met Junpei Hoshino, president of Hoshino Gakki, at the 1972 NAMM Show, Joan entered Chesbro Music into a Western United States distributorship of Tama Drums and Ibanez Guitars with Hoshino USA in 1973. She and Gary Bennett, a top tenured employee, then helped Tama and Ibanez gain domestic popularity over the next four decades. By the mid-1980s, Chesbro had enlisted membership in the Music Distributors Association (MDA) and was labeled the second largest distributor of sheet music in the United States. In 1999, daughters Vanetta Chesbro Wilson and Tana Jane Stahn, took on co- ownership of Chesbro Music. Distributing the Ibanez brand during the next decade contributed to Chesbro's growth through the 2000s. In 2007, Chesbro Music Wholesale was recognized in the industry as one of the 36 \\"dealer friendly\\" companies. In 2008, Gary Bennett was recognized for his nearly 35-year contribution to the music industry with a nomination by The Music & Sound Retailer as Representative of the Year. The partnership between Chesbro Music and Hoshino Gakki ended in 2009. During the transition, the sisters targeted their wholesale business to independent music dealers. In 2010, Chesbro Music Co. introduced Teton Guitars, a brand of acoustic guitars manufactured in China and named after a prominent mountain range near Chesbro Music Company headquarters. That same year Chesbro Music remained on The Music Trades magazine's list of largest companies in the music industry, ranked by sales, in the U.S. The 2010 NAMM Show History Program also noted that Chesbro had \\"become one of the largest music wholesalers in the country\\". In 2011, Chesbro Music Company marked its 100-year anniversary with an open house for local community, civic leaders, and employees. This anniversary was noted by industry trade magazines and Chesbro was given a citation of distinction at the 2011 NAMM Show. Vanetta died November 2013, leaving her sister, Tana, to run the \\"Top 100\\" company. In 2015 and 2017, industry trade magazines listed Chesbro Music as one of the top 100 leading suppliers in the music industry. 2018 marked the 65th anniversary of a woman CEO running Chesbro Music.

Host selection The games were originally scheduled to be held in 2012 in Kathmandu, but were postponed to Delhi for 2013 but again, were postponed to late 2015 because of the suspension of the Indian Olympic Association.

Controversy =IOA ban and delay= Initially, the Games were expected to be held in October, 2012. However, during the General Body meeting of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on 16 December 2011, it was decided to postpone the Games to February, 2013. The primary concern highlighted was that the original plan meant that the Games would be held only two months after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a fact which made athletes uncomfortable. In addition, the Delhi Government had stated that \\"accommodation would be a problem during October-November\\". In April 2012, the IOA sent letters to all the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of South Asia, announcing that the Games will be held for eight days beginning from 13 February 2013; further discussions would take place at an all-NOC meeting in Moscow. President of the Nepal Olympic Committee Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan also reported about the proposed additions of fencing, equestrian, gymnastics and the triathlon to the Games schedule. As of January 2013, host city and dates of the games were not yet confirmed. The International Olympic Committee banned the Indian Committee in March for political interference (the national government played a role in Olympic officials' selection). This delayed the event further as the ban was only lifted in May and the possibility of a low-cost edition of the games was raised among ongoing hosting discussions and poor relations with neighboring Pakistan due to the 2013 India‚ÄìPakistan border incidents.Athletics: South Asian Games in danger . Sunday Times (Sri Lanka). Retrieved on 2013-06-19. 2 years later, on 11 February 2014, the International Olympic Committee decided to lift the ban. Up until now, the Indian side competed in Olympic events such as the Winter Olympic Games as independent participants. A year later, on 5 June 2015, the uncertainty over the venue to host the 12th South Asian Games ended with the Sports Ministry and Indian Olympic Association deciding to hold the regional multi-sporting event in Guwahati and Shillong in November- December 2015. However, this was postponed even further to a tentative date of February 2016. ULFA anti-talks faction also pledged support to South Asian Games, which is opposite to its stand on 2007 National Games of India held in Guwahati. On 3 February 2016, International Basketball Federation (FIBA) stated that it will not recognise the competition because of \\"unacceptable interference by Indian Olympic Association in affairs of the Basketball Federation of India\\".

India granted special concession to Pakistani athletes taking part in the 12th South Asian Games by declaring Guwahati and Kolkata as designated entry points for them. =Further political interference= Initially, the Basketball event was scheduled to take place in 11 February, however FIBA, Basketball's world governing body, decided to de- recognise the tournament on the grounds of political interference from the Indian Government and the Indian Olympic Association. This resulted in the entire event being cancelled, so rather having 228 events in 23 sports, the competition change to 226 events in 22 sports causing further scrutiny over the organization of the games.

He is the lead writer for MRN.com and has worked for the radio network since 2009 after they purchased RacingOne.com. Since 2009, Pistone has been a co-host of the nationally syndicated Sirius XM show The Morning Drive on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Early years Born in Chicago, Pistone became \\"exposed to racing from day one because my family was in the sport (being his uncle Tom Pistone was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver and winner in the 1950s). I spent one summer with Tiger when he was running the old late model sportsman division and I remember riding in the race car with my cousins on a hauler going to track after track after track on a nightly basis. When I got old enough to get my license the Chicago and Midwest short track world was my oyster and places like Grundy County Speedway, Illiana Speedway, Slinger Speedway were regular trips as well as following the old ARTGO Series and ASA. I landed the track announcer job at Rockford Speedway thanks to the Deery family and would drive there twice a week from our northwest suburban Chicago home to announce as well as at special races.\\" Journalistic career After graduating from Northern Illinois University, Pistone spent 10 years hosting a weekly motorsports show called \\"Victory Lane\\" on Chicagoland Television. In 1997, he was hired by the Chicago Sun-Times and spent six years as the motorsports reporter/columnist for the paper where he covered NASCAR and other forms of racing. In 2003, he was hired at the same position by CBSSports.com where he spent the next six years. In 2001, he along with fellow Chicago native Jeff Wackerlin created RacingOne.com which he described as \\"one of the first of its kind during the blossoming era of the Internet. It was a new experience writing and reporting in the online world and not in the more traditional manner of print or broadcast and to say there were some growing pains is an understatement. We had to prove to sanctioning bodies like NASCAR and IndyCar that we were legitimate media in order receive access and there were a number of tracks that wouldn't grant us credentials because they didn't recognize the scope or depth of digital reporting back then. In fact (David) Poole was a help in getting some tracks to allow us access. Long story short the original group ran out of money, which wasn't unique in the relatively early Internet days, and we went through a number of different ownership groups to keep going. Finally International Speedway Corporation (ISC) bought us and in time the site changed over to be aligned with MRN and amplify the radio network as a digital property. Since I had broadcasting experience as well as my writing and reporting background, our network president David Hyatt gave me a shot at working on air as a pit reporter in addition to creating content for the site. So over my years I've become a hybrid reporter for the network and company and get to work in the best of both worlds for me in both on-air and digital roles.\\" =Motor Racing Network= After MRN took over RacingOne.com in 2009, Pistone joined the network as a writer and pit reporter. His first race for the radio network was a Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway. He says of the event that he \\"didn't sleep the night before and had memorized every driver, team, sponsor and piece of data I could get my hands on, even though I was working P3 and in reality had about 11 trucks to cover. I had Rick Crawford as my pre-race interview target because he was making an historic start in his career and let me tell you when Barney Hall gave the wind-up and said 'Rick's standing by with our Pete Pistone of Chicago, Illinois' I nearly lost it. Thankfully the words formed for my question and Rick, the nicest guy in the world, started his answer by welcoming me to the MRN family. The rest of the broadcast went well and I will always remember being on pit road with Alex Hayden and Steve Post plus working with Barney, Joe Moore and Dave Moody that day as a highlight in my life.\\" Sirius XM Since July 6, 2009, Pistone has been the co-host of The Morning Drive on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio with Mike Bagley. He took over as co-host following the death of David Poole. Even before joining the Sirius XM lineup, he had been a weekly guest on Sirius XM Speedway with Dave Moody since 2004. On Saturday mornings during the season, he co-hosts a show that helps callers set a lineup for fantasy NASCAR events. In addition to Sirius XM NASCAR, Pistone is a regular guest/host on Sirius XM Bleacher Report Radio where he discusses NASCAR and stick and ball sports. Unlike his co-host Bagley, Pistone is known for being snarky and having a low tolerance for nonsense like his other MRN colleague Moody. Personal life Pistone resides in a suburb near the city of Chicago with his wife Michelle and daughter Mia. Being a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs, he also works as a Cubs beat reporter for MLB.com.

Design  Azopardo was as part of a program to build four mine warfare ships during the Second World War, of which two (Murature and King) were completed as patrol boats and the others (Piedrabuena and Azopardo) as antisubmarine frigates.  History  Azopardo was ordered in 1940, however significant delays caused its keel to be laid only in 1950; it was launched in 1953 and completed two years later. Azopardo did not take part of the rising against Juan Domingo Per√≥n's government known as Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, as she was still being completed at R√≠o Santiago. Between 1956 and 1967 it belonged to the Destroyers and Frigates Squadron of the Seas Fleet based in Puerto Belgrano Naval Base, and participated in various exercises.

It is an erect, spreading shrub with short, thick leaves and small lilac to mauve flowers. It is only known from a population of about 100 plants. Description Eremophila ciliata is an upright, spreading shrub usually growing to high and wide. The stems are lumpy with furrows below the leaf bases. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are thick, smooth above and lumpy on the underside. They are linear to narrow egg- shaped, mostly long and about wide, and curved near the end. The flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 3 in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 egg-shaped, green to purple sepals, long. The sepals are glabrous except for the margins which have long, soft hairs. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is mauve to lilac-coloured on the outside and white with purple spots inside. The petal tube is glabrous on the outside except for the petal lobes which are densely covered with hairs. The inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. Flowering occurs mostly in September and is followed by fruits which are dry, wrinkled, about long and have prominent wings. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by William Archer near the base of Mount Newmont in the Cape Arid National Park. The specific epithet is a Latin word meaning \\"having , or fringed with fine hairs\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila ciliata is only known from the type location in the Mallee biogeographic region where it grows in a narrow strip of sandy loam over granite. Conservation status Only about 100-200 plants of Eremophila ciliata are known in a single area about . The population is threatened because of its small size, grazing by rabbits, inappropriate burning regimes and by mineral exploration. It has been classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) and an Interim Recovery Plan has been prepared.

A gun shop (also known by various other names such as firearm store and gun store) is a business establishment that sells small arms, such as handguns and shotguns, to individuals in an open shopping format. It may also provide repairs for firearms and their parts. Other items such as ammunition and accessories for hunting are frequently sold on the premises as well, even including souvenir t-shirts. Often having designs reminiscent of other establishments such as department stores displaying various items of clothing on racks and grocery stores displaying various foodstuffs on shelves, these firms operate under widely different gun control laws depending on the specific nation-state and locality involved. Some locations may only employ a single gunsmith in a small space while others might have many individuals working in a large space. Although the advent of online shopping has changed the business of gun stores, the ability for customers to interact face to face with store dealers often is seen as having advantages, examples being personally guiding individuals buying firearms through the regulated purchase processes set up by local and national laws. Employees may also offer specific advice about firearm specifications. Various firearm-related websites exist that partner, either directly or indirectly, with physical stores. In the United States, gun shops are required to have a permitting notice known as a Federal Firearms License. These licenses exist in order to administer federally mandated regulations such as bans on straw purchasing. Services and trends =Europe= This firearm shop is located in the city of in Mons, Belgium. In most of Europe, people may own firearms only for sport and hunting purposes and not for personal defense. This business is in Prague, Czech Republic. Most Czech gun owners own their firearms for self defense, with high rates of concealed carry. Gun laws in Europe vary dramatically from nation to nation, with some areas having what amounts to a near total ban on civilian access to firearms while others have systems of moderate regulation. Nearly all nations contain stricter laws than that of the United States, particularly in terms of measures to require firearms training, mandate background checks, and impose confiscation of weapons upon the committing of felony crimes. Gun legislation in Germany provides as a contrast. Individuals who desire to acquire a firearm have to meet stringent standards to receive an ownership license (German: Waffenbesitzkarte or WBK). Personal characteristics such as mental fitness and ability to physically handle the weapons well are evaluated. Germans under the age of 21, unable to prove their citizenship status, possessing a documented history of mental illness, or otherwise failing to meet the guidelines will not receive the license. =Mexico= Retail gun shops are not legal in Mexico. The Directorate of Commercialization of Arms and Munitions (Direcci√≥n de Comercializaci√≥n de Armamento y Municiones - DCAM) is the only outlet authorized to sell firearms and ammunition in the country. The business is located in Mexico City near the headquarters of the Secretariat of National Defense. No other legitimate sales may take place in the country. Examples of specific companies with items sold in Mexico City include Beretta and Colt; rifles used in hunting are particularly available. The privately owned firearms are registered with the Mexican military and may be transported outside of the home only with a specific permit, which must be renewed annually. Prospective customers go through a system of strict regulations. Factors such as the amount of ammunition that an individual can buy each month are controlled. =United States= T & T Guns & Ammo in Rozet, Wyoming As of early 2019, there were approximately sixty-three thousand licensed gun dealers in the U.S. Akin to other general-interest shopping stores, sales at firearm shops tend to increase during the holiday season, with the month of December providing stores with the best margins. In the United States, prices for many firearms decreased in the aftermath of the Great Recession, even as general sales remained relatively high. Gun store customers in places such as the southern United States often report various reasons for purchasing guns. One motivation is the fear of future gun control. Another is personal protection. Some individuals express interest using their gun purchase as a store of value because, according to one shop owner, \\"Game boxes break. Firearms don't.\\" Although it is commonly thought that most gun purchases take place in the context of a firearm-specific independent business, data from the U.S. shows that many purchases actually take place in large chain stores. Walmart in particular is the best-selling small arms retailer in the U.S. Unlike pharmacies, explosives dealerships, and banks, there is no nationally-set minimum physical security level for gun dealerships in the U.S. See alsoArms industry *Gun shows in the United States *Gunsmith *List of firearms References Category:Firearm commerce Category:Retailers by type of merchandise sold ","title":"Gun shop"},{"id":"48946763","text":"The House of Three Girls (German:Das Dreim√§derlhaus) is a 1918 German silent film directed by Richard Oswald and starring Julius Spielmann, Wilhelm Diegelmann and Sybille Binder.Soister p.43 It is based on the operetta Das Dreim√§derlhaus.

The first of these was \`getentropy\`, introduced to the OpenBSD operating system in release 5.6 (November 2014), as a refactoring of the sysctl(3) KERN_ARND approach used since 1997. Linux offers a very similar system call, \`getrandom\`, which was based on \`getentropy\`. It was first available in Linux 3.17, released in October 2014. In July 2015, Solaris introduced slightly modified versions of \`getentropy\` and \`getrandom\`. In August 2015, FreeBSD introduced the \`read_random\` system call for obtaining random data from the kernel. These system calls allow processes to access quality random data without opening and reading from randomness pseudo-devices. Microsoft Windows' \`CryptGenRandom\` and Apple iOS's \`SecRandom\` API are very similar. However, they are not implemented as system calls. Motivation Traditionally, Unix- like operating systems supply random data through two pseudo-devices: \`/dev/random\` and \`/dev/urandom\`. However, safely and reliably reading random data from these devices can be difficult and complicated. For example, an attacker could interfere with a process's access to the pseudo-devices by opening all available file descriptors, or through a similar form of resource exhaustion attack. The use of these devices also interferes with privilege revocation. Unprivileged processes are often denied the ability to open and read files and devices, and the randomness devices are not even visible to chrooted processes. The difficulty of using randomness pseudo-devices often leads developers to use standard library functions instead. Some of these, such as the C programming language's \`rand()\`, \`random()\`, and \`drand48()\`, are very unsafe when used for cryptography or similar applications, because these algorithms are actually deterministic having been intentionally crippled to satisfy seed-reuse requirements through the interfaces \`srand()\`, \`srandom()\`, and \`srand48()\`. A significant difference exists between these calls: \`getentropy()\` guarantees that random numbers will be returned immediately, without any blocking. It requires operating support which guarantees random data stream initialization at the earliest opportunity. To encourage other operating systems follow this model, getentropy() cannot indicate errors to the application. Other calls described here may return errors instead, or block indeterminately. Such blocking semantics have been implicated in significant problems. As security becomes a more widespread priority in software development, quality randomness is used more often and in more contexts. Because of this, providing quality randomness is increasingly considered a core responsibility of the kernel. System calls are the traditional interface through which a process uses core kernel services, and kernels are therefore supporting accessing randomness through system calls. Usage Because it is faster and adds another layer of entropy mixing, it is usually suggested that processes use these syscalls' data through a userspace cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) rather than assigning the retrieved data directly to variables. For this purpose, OpenBSD's C standard library includes the function \`arc4random\`, which programs are expected to call when they need random data. Like \`getentropy\`, \`arc4random\` also may not block nor return an error. This approach allows a program to fetch less entropy from the kernel without reducing the strength of its random data. The \`getentropy\` system call is designed based on this assumption, supplying no more than 256 bytes per call.

It was released on January 26, 2010 via Rubber Room Records. It incorporates elements of contemporary pop and folk pop music, both of which are more distant from Ochs' commercial success as a country artist. The album's lyrical content was influenced by a trip taken to Nepal where she was inspired to write a series of songs. Background and composition Heartforward was based on a series of experiences from Ochs' foreign trip to Nepal. She embarked on a three-month trip to the nation to volunteer with her now ex-boyfriend. The album's title was derived from a Nepalese religious theme called the seven chakras. The fourth \\"chakra\\" was the heart, where she ultimately developed the term \\"heartforward\\". Ochs detailed her reasoning in a 2010 interview: \\"It‚Äôs about putting yourself out there, not just in a romantic sense, but in a life-sense.\\" Heartforward saw Ochs experimenting with different types of pop music such as folk pop and contemporary pop. The album's tracks focused on themes associated with \\"exploring relationships\\" and \\"lessons learned\\". Its lyrics were also influenced from Ochs' visits to various international settings. Musically, the album draws inspiration from the indie groups including The Weepies. Amber Schadewald of the San Francisco Bay Guardian found that Heartforward also has a \\"country tone\\" that seems to be \\"like that of her other favorite artist, Patsy Cline.\\" Critical reception Online music store CD Baby gave Heartforward a positive review, calling Ochs a \\"bombshell\\". The website also commented on the album's lyrics and her vocals: \\"Titled after a philosophy she hopes to live by, \\"Heartforward\\" is layered with her breathtaking vocals and powerful lyrics as she takes you from solo acoustic to full rock band and back.\\" Furthermore, CD Baby compared the album's musical style to that of Fiona Apple, Natalie Merchant, and Norah Jones. For the Country Record spoke of the album when reviewing her 2015 country single, \\"My Mistake\\". The site commented, \\"I find Cam particularly fascinating because she did not start in country, and yet to all intents and purposes her official launch is there. Her album ‚ÄòHeartforward‚Äô was pop, albeit a rootsy kind of alt.pop, and it appears that she only considered going country after A&R; folks expressed interest in her writing (although, I can only speak from what I know at this point).\\" Amber Schadewald of the San Francisco Bay Guardian gave Heartforward positive reception as well. Schadewald highlighted the album's guitar strumming, calling the sound \\"bright\\". She further discussed Ochs' musical persona and it how it affects the album: \\"There‚Äôs an audible optimistic bliss in her music and an honest indication that the woman behind the strings is a solid, well- rounded being.\\" Track listing Credits extracted from liner notes at Allmusic.

Rutenfest in Ravensburg, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany, celebrating the story. Rutenfest in Ravensburg, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany, celebrating the story. The Seven Swabians (Die Sieben Schwaben) is a German fairy tale, collected by The Brothers Grimm in the second volume edition of their Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen (1857) under the number KHM119. The term Swabians refers to people from the German region Swabia, though in Switzerland it refers to Germans in general. Plot Once upon a time there were Seven Swabians who travelled through the world. To be safe from danger they carried one long spear with them. One day in July they walk through a meadow just by nightfall and notice a hornet buzzing by. Unaware what they just heard the men start to panic, thinking it was a war drum. One of them tries to flee, jumps over a fence and then walks right on the teeth of a rake, whereupon the handle hits him in the face. He quickly begs for mercy and tells the invisible attacker that he'll surrender, whereupon his six friends do the same. Later, when they finally understand they were fooled they decide to keep this embarrassing anecdote a secret. To prevent the story from getting out they swear to not say anything about it until one of them should accidentally open his mouth. Later they encounter a hare sleeping in the sun. They take the animal for a monster and decide to attack it. After bracing themselves with all the courage they can get they strike out and the hare runs away, whereupon they realize they've once again been fooled. The septet travels onward until they reach the river Moselle. Unaware how to cross it they ask a man on the opposite side of the river for help. Due to the distance and their language the man doesn't understand what they were saying and he asked them in the dialect of Trier: \\"Wat, Wat?\\" This causes the men to think that they have to wade through the water. As the first Swabian gets into the river he starts to sink into the mud. His hat is blown away to the opposite shore, next to a frog who croaks noises that sound like \\"wat, wat, wat\\". The six surviving Swabians think it's their friend telling them to wade across; they rush in the water and all drown. Publication history Hans Wilhelm Kirchhof was the first to write it down in his book Wendemut (1563). Eucharius Eyring wrote it down as a poem in \\"Proverbiorum Copia\\" (1601-1604). Ludwig Aurbacher also wrote down a well known version in \\"Ein Volksb√ºchlein\\" (1827-1829) and gave the seven protagonists names: Allg√§uer, Seehas, Nestelschwaub, Blitzschwaub, Spiegelschwaub, Gelbf√ºssler and Kn√∂pfleschwaub. In 1756 German preacher Sebastian Sailer wrote the tale down as a comedy. Both Ferdinand Fellner and Georg M√ºhlberg are well known German artists who made illustrations to the story. In popular culture In 1545 the story was adapted into song by Hans Sachs. In 1887 Karl Mill√∂cker adapted the story into an operette.Lamb, Andrew (1992), \\"Mill√∂cker, Carl\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed. Stanley Sadie (London) During World War I the Fokker D.VII (OAW-built 4649/18) of the Luftstreitkr√§fte's Jasta 65 fighter squadron, flown by Gefreiter (corporal) Wilhelm Scheutzel TheAerodrome.com reference post on Gefreiter Wilhelm Scheutzel was resplendent in a scheme depicting a scene from an ancient German fable brought back to popularity by the Brothers Grimm in 1857. There is no other aircraft that possesses a livery depicting an ancient German fable. But his Fokker D.VII has the 'Sieben Schwaben' (Seven Swabians) depicted in battle with a hare, using their one shared, pike-like spear. According to the tale, the men had mistaken the animal for a Dragon. The story is really an olden day 'blonde joke' about the people of Swabia and is thought to have been told by those in neighbouring areas of Germany as a tongue-in- cheek insult to the region. Scheutzel joined Jasta 65 from Jasta-Schule II on 12 July 1918 and lasted until the end of the war. He scored his one and only kill when he downed a DH4 on 13 August 1918. Why Scheutzel had this scene depicted on his aircraft is not entirely clear. Was the art an ironic comment on the folly of war, an insult to the Allies that they would flee like rabbits or perhaps Scheutzel liked the war cry given by the leader of the Seven Schwaben in his attack on the rabbit: \\"then let us boldly advance to the fight, and thus we shall show our valour and might\\"?

The host and producers initially had difficulty selecting women panelists for Fighting Words but eventually featured guests such as Solange Chaput-Rolland and aired a few episodes with an all-female panel.Rutherford, p. 235 Former Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton also appeared in several episodes. In the earliest episodes, J. B. McGeachy and Ted Allan served as regular panelists who were joined by two guests. Later, there were no designated regular panel members. The series drew on personalities who were intellectual and opinionated such as William E. Blatz, Morley Callaghan, Irving Layton and G√©rard Pelletier. As of 1959, viewers who submitted quotations that were presented on Fighting Words would receive a book and two LP records. Viewers would also win an encyclopedia if the panel was unable to determine the quotation's author.Rutherford, p. 552 The series concept was developed by Cohen and Harvey Hart and the series title was conceived by Mavor Moore. Scheduling Fighting Words consisted of half- hour episodes, broadcast on various dates and times throughout its run. Its debut was broadcast on 30 December 1952, initially in a 9pm Tuesday time slot. The program was seen at either 8 or 8:30pm on Tuesdays until 6 May 1953 when it was moved to a 7:30 pm Wednesday time slot. By late 1953, the series appeared on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm. The series was frequently rescheduled to various dates and times throughout its run. After a season ended in September 1954, the series did not resume until mid-1955 in a Sunday evening time slot. During this break, the CBC attempted to reduce Cohen's role by proposing that he be one of two alternating hosts. The network also conducted a test episode without Cohen as host. Fighting Words was cancelled by CBC as of its 26 October 1955 episode where Cohen's concluding remarks were, \\"Goodnight, until a later date\\". Just prior to that episode, CBC management restored the series after receiving a substantial number of letters from viewers demanding that Fighting Words be returned. The series resumed on 4 December 1955. During its run, Fighting Words survived cancellation on several other occasions largely due to support from its viewers.Blackburn, p. 230 In early 1958, the series aired in a Sunday afternoon time slot following Lassie. Cohen noted that CBC's significant audience of children at that time constrained the types of subject matter that Fighting Words could address. Two episodes in 1958 were recorded in England, one of these aired on 15 June 1958 with guest panelists Julian Huxley, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Violet Bonham-Carter and Stephen King-Hall. The final episode of the original series aired 22 July 1962 with guest panelists Arnold Edinborough, Robert Fulford, Marcus Long and Charles Templeton. After CBC cancelled the series, Cohen stated \\"I find the decision a great relief. I have never believed... that TV or radio programs should continue indefinitely.\\". Reception An episode featuring Albert Ellis, author of Sex Without Guilt, drew criticism from Charles Jennings, Canada's controller of broadcasting. Jennings issued a memo in 1958 expressing concerns that the program portrayed an unbalanced presentation of views and lacked good taste, charging that other members of the panel did not have the sufficient background to provide contrary arguments to Ellis.Rutherford, p. 168 In November 1957, New Brunswick member of Parliament Henry Murphy objected to the content of Fighting Words in the House of Commons, concerned that the program's content concerning \\"prostitution, homosexuals, and other allied subjects\\" was detrimental to \\"family life and Christian ideals\\". Cohen addressed concerns that the series was derivative of What's My Line? by countering that Fighting Words \\"has a much higher opinion of audience intelligence\\" than the American series. Bob Blackburn of the Ottawa Citizen described Fighting Words as \\"the most outspoken program on Canadian television\\", noting that it \\"violates practically all of the taboos\\". By 1960, topics such as freedom, pornography and rape were discussed on the program. Author Paul Rutherford noted the series addressed \\"weighty issues of ethics and morality, politics, or the arts\\" while crediting Cohen's moderation skills.Rutherford, p. 234 Revivals and imitators Rival station CFTO-TV produced QED in 1961 as an attempt to copy the Fighting Words concept, but that series failed after several months.Rutherford, p231 In 1970, Cohen hosted a brief return of the series. Peter Gzowski hosted another revival of the series in 1982 with guest panelists such as Bella Abzug, Barbara Amiel, Claire Hoy, Irving Layton, Bob Rae, Morton Shulman, Gordon Sinclair and Larry Solway.

It was built in 1870s by George Irlam. It is also known as Oaky (Oakey) Farm. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 August 2008.  History  The ant bed building at Oaky (Oakey) Creek was associated with a farmhouse-cum- wayside inn established by George Irlam on the Clermont- Alpha Road, along the route to Aramac. At the inn, travellers could break their journey and sample the farm's home-grown produce. The Clermont district was opened to European settlement after Ludwig Leichhardt, who had explored the area in 1844, reported on its potential for pastoralists, agriculturists and miners. In the early 1850s the Archer brothers were the first pastoralists to take up land in the area and they were soon followed by other squatters and by fossickers in search of gold, coal and other minerals. The discovery of gold near Hood's Lagoon (soon known as Diggings Lagoon) in the early 1860s paved the way for a rush to the district. A nearby settlement was surveyed in 1863 as the town of Clermont. Homesteads and townships west of Clermont were established rapidly and the bush tracks blazed by the carriers, teamsters, farmers, graziers and miners who needed a comprehensive network of roads for transporting wool, gold, copper and other produce to coastal ports, became well travelled routes. The Clermont to Aramac route via Oaky Creek was established in 1863 and following the 1866 opening of a post office at Clermont, weekly mail services to settlers in outlying areas commenced along this track. The disruption to Aboriginal life was not welcomed by the traditional owners of the area ‚Äì the Kairis (Khararyas), Wangans and Jagalingus (Jangga). Violent frontier conflict had commenced by 1861 and continued through the 1860s and into the early 1870s. As the frontier conflict subsided, Cobb & Co Coaches established a network of coach routes from Rockhampton to the western districts in the early 1870s. From 1878 to 1884 the firm ran a regular weekly coach between Copperfield (Clermont) and Aramac. George Irlam had acquired various interests in the district west of Clermont by the late 1860s. He held a license for the Lord Nelson Hotel at Oaky Creek from 1869 to 1876 and by January 1871 had purchased all the Red Rock Valley cattle. In 1872 Irlam selected (portion 44, now known as Oaky Farm) at Oaky Creek, about west of Clermont along the Alpha road. An 1873 survey plan of Irlam's selection shows an established house, stockyard, garden and cultivation area on the flat of Oaky Creek. A later survey plan of the area, dated July 1879, identifies an inn in the approximate location of the farm house identified on the 1873 plan. In 1876‚Äì1877 there was no license issued for Irlam's Lord Nelson Hotel at Oaky Creek, but he did take out a license for the Oaky Creek Hotel. Given that Oaky Creek is a small district, and that an inn in this area would need to be located on the main Clermont to Aramac route to be viable, it is highly likely that the Oakey Creek Hotel was the inn identified on the 1879 plan. Whether it was earlier known as the Lord Nelson Hotel, established in the late 1860s, has not been confirmed. When Irlam made application in July 1877 for a deed of grant for his selection, he claimed to have been residing continuously on the property since 22 February 1872 (the time of official selection). The improvements comprised a dwelling house, stock yards, and under cultivation. Irlam made no mention of conducting an inn or hotel on the property. However, it appears that the dwelling on Irlam's selection fulfilled the dual function of farmhouse and inn, serving as a refreshment stop for travellers along the Clermont to Aramac route. Being comparatively close to Clermont ( distant), the demand for overnight accommodation was limited and Cobb & Co coaches did not change horses at Oaky Creek. As soon as Irlam's conditions of selection for portion 44 had been fulfilled in 1877, he transferred the license to the Oakey Creek Hotel to James Nicholls, who in turn transferred it to J Williams in 1879. There is no license recorded for the period 1881 to 1883, but Charles Cook held the license briefly in 1884. According to local historian Dan O'Donnell, by 1878 Irlam's hotel was well-known to travellers along the Clermont to Aramac route, for the fresh fruit grown in the adjacent orchard, which contained both tropical and temperate fruit trees including lemons, apples, peaches and bananas. A dairy (likely the surviving ant bed building on Oaky Farm) was located near to the road and to the hotel. Australian architectural historian Dr Miles Lewis has recorded the nineteenth century use of crushed anthill clay, (known locally as ant bed), for adobe, cob, pise de terre, earthen flooring and later the surfacing of tennis courts. Ant bed appears to have been used mainly in rural areas either due to an absence of other materials, or for its adhesive and/or insulating properties. Few ant bed structures are known to survive in Queensland. In 1884 a branch line was opened from the Central Western railway line to Clermont, but coaches, carriers and travellers continued to use the Clermont to Aramac route because the rail service beyond Clermont continued north to Blair Athol, leaving western districts dependent upon traditional coach services and independent carriers. Despite this sustained use, no license for a hotel at Oaky Creek was issued after 1884. In 1891 title to portion 44 was transferred to John Gustav Finger, who worked the property as a grazing farm until his death in 1915. In 1918 his sons August Henry and Louis Rudolph gained title to the farm, which still comprised . The brothers expanded the yards for working cattle, which included construction of a loading ramp and dip. Louis Finger bought his brother's share in the property . Thomas and Albert James purchased the property in 1957 and continued to work it as a grazing farm. They moved another house to the site around this time, and the early dwelling house (a timber slab structure) was used by Tom James as a work shed for his saddle and leather making business. The ant bed building was used for storage. Tom resided at the property until his death in 1996.  Description  Irlam's former farmhouse/inn is located at Oaky Creek along the Clermont-Alpha Road. The place contains an 1870s building constructed of rammed earth (pise de terre) mixed with ant bed. This building is located within a fenced house yard long and approximately wide, abutting the south-east side of the road. = Ant Bed Building = The ant bed building is situated in the north-east corner of the house yard, approximately from the fence line, and has a northerly aspect. It is a single-storeyed, one-roomed structure, approximately , with walls approximately thick of rammed earth mixed with ant bed, resting on a base of brick coursing. The building has a shallow-pitched, hipped roof of corrugated iron, which extends beyond the exterior walls as a wide overhang to verandahs on all sides. This is supported on timber posts. Adjoining the southern verandah is a wire and timber-framed enclosure, with grape vines growing through it, measuring approximately . It appears that each of the rammed earth walls originally had a base of coursed bricks, laid brick-on-edge. Much of this brick work either has fallen out or has been removed. (Some loose bricks are scattered around the building, likely sourced from the missing wall coursing.) The rammed earth walls have been undermined by the actions of animals and insects, with some erosion possibly being advanced by ground moisture. The western wall has suffered the least degradation. Some cracking of the walls has occurred on all sides due to subsidence and expansion/contraction. All the external walls have been lime-washed at some period. Both the northern (front) and southern walls of the building have a centrally positioned timber doorframe and door of timber boards. There is a small, centrally positioned, timber-framed window opening (unglazed) in the eastern wall, but no opening in the western wall. Internally, sawn timber boards line the upper walls. The timber roof structure probably dates to the 1930s, when the shingles were replaced by corrugated iron. The floor of the building is earth on shale. There is no indication of a below-ground cellar. = The house yard = Apart from the ant bed building, the attached timber and wire trellis, and the brick scatter surrounding the ant bed building, the remaining structures within the house yard do not form part of the heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Irlam's Ant Bed Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 August 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The ant bed building at George Irlam's former farmhouse/inn, established in the 1870s at Oaky Creek about west of Clermont, is important in demonstrating the pattern of early non-indigenous settlement in the central highlands of Queensland. During the 1870s the building was associated with the functioning of the place as both a wayside inn and a selection farmhouse. The combination of commercial, residential and agricultural functions was illustrative of the frontier nature of early non- indigenous settlement in rural Queensland. The ant bed building is significant for its contribution to our understanding of the role of wayside inns in supporting early transportation and communication networks in isolated and remote areas of Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The ant bed building is important in demonstrating building techniques and materials no longer common or practiced in Queensland. Constructed of rammed earth (pise de terre) mixed with ant bed, the building is a rare surviving example of the use of ant bed as a building material and of this construction technique. If ant bed was chosen for its insulation value, then the place is even rarer. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. With further analysis of the fabric, the ant bed building has the potential to contribute further to our understanding of early construction techniques and materials in Queensland, especially in remote areas. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As the main surviving element of the former farmhouse/inn at Oaky Creek, the ant bed building is important in demonstrating some of the principal characteristics of a small, isolated, 1870s wayside inn-cum-farmhouse. These include the location of the structure close to the Alpha Road; its function as a large, separate store or dairy; and the use of locally available materials in its construction.

Library-book or -materials vandalism, sometimes termed intentional destruction of books or materials or book or material mutilation is the act of damaging or defacing library books or other library holdings. It is a considerable loss of resources for libraries with high rates of vandalism. As with book theft at libraries, vandalism of books has been studied by a number of library professionals. Librarians consider book vandalism and mutilation a \\"threat to intellectual property\\" and have seen it as a \\"tremendous challenge to the library profession worldwide.\\" Handwriting or marks in and tearing or removal of pages from books can all be forms of vandalism or mutilation. Arson is another form of library book vandalism. The hiding of books within libraries is sometimes considered to be a form of materials vandalism.  Incidents  Book or material vandalism occurs at many different scales and with many different degrees of damage. A three-year study conducting in the early part of the 1980s showed that 64% of American public libraries reported having at least one incident of book vandalism. A later study in Great Britain found that, on average, libraries experienced 9.8 book vandalism events a year. Sometimes these book-vandalism events reach epidemic levels. The Metro Toronto Library reported in 1975 that within one month over 200 reference books were \\"torn beyond repair.\\" In 1995, twenty California libraries were plagued by a serial \\"book slicer\\", removing pages from modern poetry collections causing over $10,000 in damage to over 200 books. In Decatur, Alabama, 500 children's books were damaged by book slicing, with an estimated cost of $15,000. Other books vandalized by razoring pages in Decatur, included books for adults on coaching children and also on books about sex. Sometimes a specific book or topic is targeted, in the case of a Tokyo man who tore pages only out of books about Anne Frank in several area libraries. The issue is by no means just a contemporary one: Book mutilation consisting of removal of maps and pages from encyclopedias was reported by Green County Library in 1918. Even small, volunteer libraries, like Little Free Library posts have been subject to book mutilation, with one small library in Texas having one book partially burned and the cover torn off another book.  Efforts to curb library book vandalism  = Electronic systems = As electronic book-detection systems became available beginning in the 1970s, libraries began to examine the potential for such systems to prevent library book vandalism and theft. A survey conducted in 1973 of 255 public libraries in the United States found that most libraries had \\"neither guards nor alarm systems.\\" Public and academic libraries both regularly spend \\"tens of thousands of dollars\\" on electronic systems designed to prevent vandalism and theft. = Education = The State University College at Buffalo launched an effort to stem book vandalism in 1983. The campaign was called a \\"cold war on vandalism\\" and involved displays of vandalized books and encouragement of early reporting of all types of book destruction. Students and faculty at the University of Cape Coast advocated for a similar form of education. They suggested displaying mutilated books and for the library to run \\"educational programmes on the use of the library.\\" = Observation = The American Library Association (ALA) reports that recent acts of vandalism can help libraries identify the targets of future vandalism. The ALA has recommended additional security measures or relocation of library materials relating to past vandalism. The University of Memphis Library had problems with common reference books missing pages or indexes and therefore chose to move these items behind information desks and implementing a gatekeeper system for use. However, restricting access to books is considered by the library profession as a \\"limitation of access to information which poses a threat to knowledge pursuit and exchange.\\" Examining books immediately after use inside the library can help reduce acts of book vandalism. = Providing copies = Providing access to inexpensive or free copies of materials that are often vandalized has been suggested in order to minimize book mutilations. Some libraries have reduced the amount it costs to make a copy in order to help prevent people from taking the information by removing pages or images from books. = Legislation and enforcement of policies = ALA has recommended drafting potential legislation relating to vandalism. Staff members in libraries should be trained to enforce laws against vandalism, calling the police if an act of library book vandalism is taking place. Outside of law enforcement, libraries should charge patrons the replacement cost of a damaged (or lost) item, if the identity of the perpetrator is known. Restricting what patrons are allowed to bring into the library can help curb vandalism or theft.  Explanations for vandalism  The population responsible for vandalism varies considerably by library and type of vandalism. A study conducted in Memphis University Libraries revealed that perpetrators of library book vandalism were a diverse group including the general public, students, researchers, academics and library staff themselves. Mutilation of books at university libraries in Ghana were reported to have been significantly carried out (90%) by students. Sometimes children are responsible for vandalism, whether it is intentional or not. Lack of staff training and support for maintaining books is often tied to high rates of book vandalism. Metro Toronto Library staff felt that their experience in losing over 200 reference books in 1975 to book vandalism was due to the library being understaffed. The Memphis study mentioned above also found that staff could be part of the problem by being \\"innocent, ignorant or complacent.\\" In addition, the same study found that students using the library felt that security in the library was seen as poor and that students did not know the cost of materials damaged and felt that punishment for being caught would be lenient. = Access to information = Some libraries describe book vandalism as genuine information seeking behavior. Stanford University's Medical library blamed book vandalism on student's need for information. The director of the library, Peter Stangl, said that the most students often wanted the same books, so were stealing the information they needed for classes. In the Memphis study, one of the most relevant reasons for library vandalism was that the books mutilated could not be checked out of the library. A study done at the University of Cape Coast showed that reference books which could not be checked out were the most vandalized books. Economic reasons can drive library users to mutilation of books. In some African countries, library researchers found that economic depression which may cause libraries to lack multiple copies of popular materials and lack photocopying facilities contributed to mutilation. On the other side of the issue are those who wish to restrict access to information. In these situations, books have been damaged or destroyed in order to silence an idea or viewpoint an individual or group does not want to see expressed. During times of social crisis, books can become a casualty of those who do not value what is expressed within or by those who are illiterate. = Social issues and commentary = Other types of vandalism are more closely linked to social or political issues and commentary. Librarian Dennis Hinrichs of Mount Pleasant High School library in Iowa believed that students vandalized books due to a form of self-expression. Portions of magazines and books in the library were marked out so as to be unreadable. The practice was increasing and Hinrichs believed that students were using the \\"library as a focal point for their frustrations.\\" Joe Moran, wrote an article for The Guardian about his own \\"impulse\\" for writing in the margins of library books. His argument for the practice is historical since he writes that \\"until the 19th century books were often used as scrap paper, and few people had qualms about scrawling on a pristine copy.\\" Moran traces his book writing (usually in pencil) as part of the tradition of marginalia. Vandalism can frequently mirror larger social issues: a survey of libraries which subscribed to Playboy magazine found that more than two thirds of the libraries had vandalism issues with that set of materials alone. Some library patrons have a political or religious motivation for book vandalism. In 2002, a San Francisco man was banned from all of the city's public libraries, ordered to undergo counseling and to pay $9,600 to the library due to his vandalism. The man had destroyed hundreds of books relating to LGBT topics by slashing the covers and insides of the books and then reshelving the books \\"stuffed with Christian pamphlets.\\" In other cases, library materials are destroyed when they represent aspects of a \\"particular despised group.\\" = State-sponsored destruction = One of the most destructive groups of people have been communist regimes, which have destroyed library books that do not serve the current power structure. In Soviet Russia, as Joseph Stalin \\"purged\\" individuals, all of their writing and research was also destroyed. During the Invasion of Tibet, Chinese communists forced Tibetans to destroy their own books or manuscripts by burning, shredding, mixing with manure or by walking on them. Other totalitarian governments have destroyed various library books because these governments see \\"reading and research as political acts\\" which can lead individuals to thoughts that run counter to the government.  Effects of library-materials vandalism  Materials vandalism requires considerable staff time and resources to overcome. Library staff at the University of Cape Coast reported that library material vandalism made it difficult for them to effectively do their job and assist library patrons with information requests. Costs of book vandalism can include replacement costs for general collection items. In some cases, years of potentially irreplaceable work have been destroyed. In 1969, five thousand library catalog cards were destroyed at the University of Illinois. The cards were found in various states throughout the building and in a residence hall on campus. The destruction was considered by the director of the library as worth over $55,000 and that it would be \\"almost impossible to reconstruct them.\\" Cultural heritage can be destroyed through vandalism. A fire set at the Siege of Peking during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 in China caused the destruction of the Yong Le Da Dian and other irreplaceable books. Not only were many of the books housed in the Hanlin Library destroyed by fire, but many of the books not ruined were collected by British soldiers as souvenirs. Because the Yong Le Da Dian was written out by hand and had no copies, much of the cultural heritage it recorded is lost forever.  In popular culture  Book vandalism or mutilation is often depicted in film. The character of Jake, the private detective in Chinatown (1974), tears the page out of a book because it has information he needs. The Breakfast Club (1985), depicts the character John Bender destroying a book and tossing the pages around the library.

Life She was born to the judge Albrecht Friedrich Richardson, mayor of Halmstad. Richardy never married and remained a mamsell. While unmarried women, in accordance with the Civil Code of 1734, were legal minors under the guardianship of their closest male relative for life, they had the right to petition for legal majority to the monarch, which was a common procedure for unmarried businesswomen. Richardy had herself declared of legal majority by a petition to Gustav III of Sweden in 1786 and, being now free to manage her own affairs, engaged in business. =Fish trade= Halmstad was at the time a major Staple right city. Richardy engaged in the fish trade and had fresh Salmonidae bought, smoked and sold, a lucrative trade which put her in conflict with the Halmstad city guild. Because of her verbal defense in court, the guild were unable to have her business closed down. Instead, she applied to be a member of the guild in accordance with the law of 1720 √•rs skr√•ordning. After the guild refused to admit her as a member, she protested by petition to the monarch. The King refused to meddle in the affair, but Richardy eventually won the conflict and managed to win membership in the Halmstad city guild. As she often traveled alone around the Halland country side in business, she carried a pistol with her for self-protection, which was well known. =Textile industry= In 1800, Charlotta Richardy became the first female member of the Royal Patriotic Society, where she participated actively in the effort of the society to promote agriculture and industry. She was elected in part because of her effort as a provider of boots and stockings to the army. Richardy took over the old contract of the Vallen Castle manufacture to provide woolen stockings and boots for the Swedish Army, which had belonged to the family of Birgitta Durell for over a century prior. From 1805 until 1822, she managed her own factory on her farm Tolarp in Sn√∂storp just outside the city of Halmstad. To fulfill her contract, she was given permission to import and sell wool from Copenhagen. Outside of those employed in her factory, she distributed wool for the manufacture of socks at home among the peasantry of the area, and she sidestepped the shoemaker guild in Halmstad by engaging the shoemakers in the surrounding country side to make her boots. She also bought the cloth produced by at home by the surrounding peasantry and sold to the army. Richardy and her factory enjoyed great success as the provider of foot wear for the army during the wars of the time, such as the Finnish war. In 1810, she was granted funds from the manufacture state fund to expand in recognition of her great contribution to the employment of the workforce in the region. She is regarded a pioneer in the region, were following textile factory owners continued to hire peasantry to work from home after her example. Carl Christoffer Gj√∂rwell Sr. described her as a: :\\"... manly lady of imposing height and strong powers and the attitude of a man. She is a woman of about fifty, lives in Halmstad, manage trade and commerce and often travels up [to the capital] to control her business with His Majesty and the Crown.

She founded the famous perfume company Antoinette W Nording, for a time the biggest perfume company in Sweden, in 1847. She can be regarded as the first female perfumer in Sweden, and as a female pioneer. Life Antoinette Nording was born to spice merchant Anders Fahlcrantz (1757-1823) and Brita Christina B√§ckmanin Stockholm and in 1838 married the spice merchant Johan Christian Nording (1807-1883). In 1846, the monopoly of the guilds were abolished in Sweden, and the following year, Antoinette Nording applied for a permit to manufacture and sell Eau de Cologne. Nording was granted her permit to manufacture and sell perfume in 1847. While a married woman was legally a minor under the guardianship of her spouse, she could engage in business with the permit of her spouse in accordance with the Handelsordningen. Until the Fabriks och Handtwerksordning reform of 1846, perfume manufacture in Sweden had officially been the privilege of the Apothecary guild, which made Nording a pioneer as the perhaps first perfumer in the modern sense in Sweden. Female apothecaries (normally widows of apothecaries who inherited the privilege of their husbands) had with all certainty manufactured perfumes before, but there are no woman confirmed to have manufactured cosmetics in Sweden before Eva Ekeblad, and no woman confirmed to have done so for commercial purposes until Nording, making her a pioneer also as the first female perfumer in Sweden, though she was quickly given competition: already in 1858, there were five perfumers only in Stockholm, only counting the female ones. Antoinette Nording became a successful business person. She manufactured as well as imported four kinds of Eau de Cologne, French liquor, French and English soap, pomades, powders, theater make up and a number of cosmetic products for \\"the sophisticated toilette\\", and imported essences from England and Provence.Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entrepren√∂rskap: under 400 √•r, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013 She had an exclusive clientele, and her products were popular as Christmas gifts.

She sold her company to Christina Charlotta Pettersson (1850-1932), her employee since a decade, in exchange for a pension from the company. She also made Pettersson her heir. Her heir Christina Charlotta Pettersson and her spouse (who took the name Nording) managed to company with continuing success and left it to their daughter Ida Maria \\"Maja\\" Charlotta Nording (1885-1979).

Parker Jr. initially published July 14, 2015. It is the prequel to Parker's 1978 New York Times Bestseller Once a Runner and is part of the Once a Runner Trilogy. Racing the Rain is a coming of age story that tells of how Quenton Cassidy, a legit savage who just so happens to be the main character of Once a Runner, discovers his exceptional running ability and develops the work ethic to become a great athlete. Quenton is a teenager in southeast Florida during the 1960s, and though living through tumultuous world events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Quenton is more preoccupied with making the basketball team, facing obstinate coaches, and fishing with his mentor Trapper Nelson. Parker gives a compelling narrative of a boy reconciling his dreams with his capabilities and discovering the tainted reality of his southern paradise. Plot Shirtless and barefoot for most of his youth, Quenton Cassidy grew up exploring the natural environment surrounding his neighborhood nestled between the Loxahatchee River and the Atlantic Ocean. Racing the Rain introduces the reader to Quenton in elementary school where he plays games, runs foot races, and feeds his curiosity with his best friends Stiggs and Randleman. Breaks of ice-cold Kool-Aid and frothy A&W; root beer divide the hot Florida days. Quenton's small stature, big mouth, and affinity for practical jokes often gets him into trouble with teachers and other students. That is, until he becomes friends with Trapper. Trapper Nelson is both man and legend. He is the real-life swamp man who ‚Äúwrestled alligators for fun, [and] laughed at poisonous snakes.‚Äù When Trapper becomes friends with Quenton, the two strike a business deal when Trapper recognizes Quenton's extraordinary ability to hold his breath and dive deep into the water. He teaches Quenton about life on the Loxahatchee fishing, trapping, and entertaining influential men with wildlife shows, poker, and beer. Taking Quenton under his wing, Trapper becomes a pivotal influence in Quenton's life. Though Quenton's first love is basketball, Trapper convinces Quneton to try out long distant running on the side. Quenton is a natural runner due to his efficiency in using oxygen. He can't bring himself to give up basketball, but Quenton begins to recognize his own talents. As Quenton grows older and draws nearer to high school, he begins to play basketball with his friends at the local military base Fort Murphy. Some of the soldiers there humor the youth with pick-up games of basketball, helping Quenton and his friends quickly improve their skills. This was not enough to help Quenton, still short and scrawny, be a starter on the junior high basketball team. Frustrated with himself and his coach, Quenton is motivated to do everything he could to not only make the high school basketball team, but be a key player. His friends at Fort Murphy and Trapper Nelson, who wasn't just a wilderness man but a talented athlete himself, teach Quenton different shooting and dribbling drills. Every afternoon between the two basketball seasons, Quenton goes to the military base to practice on the basketball courts. When he joins the high school basketball team, he starts every game on the JV and leads the squad in points. The next season, Quenton, Stiggs, and Randleman all start on Varsity. They have a winning season and go to the state semi-finals. They looked forward to the next season and the prospects of winning state, but their success would be short lived. Because of his new found success, Quenton's basketball coach Jim Cinnamon decides to sign a contract with the prestigious Miami Senior High School. Replacing Cinnamon is the track coach Bob Bickerstaff. Inexperienced in coaching basketball and hard headed, Bickerstaff forced the team to play a rigid style of basketball that was highly inefficient and ineffective. After losing several games in a row, Quenton gets frustrated one game and decides to lead the team in rebellion on the court against Coach Bickerstaff's gameplan. Though the team immediately begins to have success with Quenton's leadership, the prideful coach sets Quenton on the bench. His team loses the game, and Bickerstaff cuts Quenton from the team for subordination. Quenton can't believe it, but because of this trial, he invests himself in running and finally realizes where his true strengths are. Quenton puts all his heart and soul into preparing for the track season if only to spite Coach Bickerstaff. Though he had been successful in cross country in the past, Quenton had never dedicated himself to running like he had basketball. That all changed with his being kicked off the team. He eventually runs fast enough to qualify for the state meet in the mile, but the week before the race, tragedy strikes: Trapper Nelson is arrested for the murder of a moonshiner named Lew Gene Harvey. The preliminary hearing for his case is going to be the day of the State meet. Though Trapper tells him he should run the meet, Quenton finds himself in a personal dilemma because he wants to be there in the courthouse to support his friend and mentor. Trapper doesn't want to Quenton to miss his race and is able to cut a deal with the police to help find the true murderers of the moonshiner. Without the case distracting him, Quenton is able to focus on preparing for the state meet. In the state race, Quenton comes from behind to beat the runner seated favorite to win the race and becomes the state champion in the mile. After the race is over, Quenton is introduced to Ben Cornwall, the head track coach at Southeastern University. Quenton is given a scholarship to Southeastern University, packs his things, and moves into Doobey Hall, where the events of Once a Runner begin.

It was designed by Alfred Mowbray Hutton and built in 1898 by Newman Brothers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000.  History  The Christ Church Anglican Church, St Lawrence was constructed in 1898 to a design by Alfred Mowbray Hutton and constructed by Newman Brothers of Rockhampton. European settlement began in the St Lawrence area by 1860, when John Arthur Macartney formed Waverley Station. The St Lawrence area had a strong connection with the pastoral industry in the 19th century. McCartney took up land at the head of Broadsound and Waverley in 1860 and used the banks of the St Lawrence Creek to land his supplies. Later that year a boiling down works for tallow was established. In 1861 the Rockhampton Port Master recommended the site for a port, and government buildings were soon constructed. These included a Telegraph Office, Police Station and Court House. Prior to the establishment of an Anglican church at St Lawrence, quarterly Catholic and Anglican services, were held at the Courthouse. The development of the meatworks in 1893 meant a steady growth in population and by the end of the 1890s, a permanent church building became a necessity. In March 1898, Vicar AH Julius visited St Lawrence to make arrangements for the immediate construction of a building. Five acres of land \\"in a good position\\" was purchased and it was reported that \\"the Church will be a conspicuous object in the main street of the town\\". Rockhampton architect, Alfred Mowbray Hutton, designed a simple building with seating for around 100 people, a side section with a large classroom and a small bedroom and verandah for visiting clergymen. Tenders were called for submission of quotes by 18 April 1898. Newman Brothers of Rockhampton were awarded the contract. Alfred Mowbray Hutton (-1911) was in partnership with George C Lavater as Lavater and Hutton, architects in Mildura before coming to Queensland. He took over the Rockhampton practice of James Flint in mid-1894. Hutton became an associate of the Queensland Institute of Architects in 1897. From 1898 to 1904 he was in partnership in Rockhampton with Edwin Morton Hockings and in 1911 with FE Boddington. On Saturday 21 May 1898, the foundation stone of the church was laid by the Premier of Queensland, Thomas Byrnes, MLA for Warwick. With a classroom for a Sunday School and a bedroom for visiting clergy, the church played an important role in the local community. At one time, the vestry served as the residence for a local school teacher. Apart from a period of about two months, there has never been a resident priest at the church. Currently located in the Parish of North Rockhampton, the Christ Church Anglican church, has also been part of the Parishes of Rockhampton and Park Avenue. Repairs to the church became a necessity, and in 1985 local people organised a restoration committee to raise sufficient funds to replace the roof, paint the vestry and to have the stained glass windows restored. A 1988 bi-centennial grant paid for the lining of the church's north and south walls as well as the reflooring, relining and painting of the vestry. Occasional services are still held in the church each year.  Description  The Christ Church, Anglican Church, is a single storey, timber building clad with weatherboards with a gable roof clad with corrugated iron, prominently located at the eastern end of Macartney Street. A small front porch with a separated gable roof is located at the western end of the building. The gables of the main roof and the porch are surmounted by timber crucifixes. The rooms on the southern side of the church have a skillion roof clad with corrugated iron. A set of timber stairs is located in the porch leading to the front door. The paired, cedar doors have a pointed arch design and open to the main part of the church. A group of three pointed arch, stained glass windows are located high in the eastern elevation. A similar, single window is located above the main door. A circular ventilator is located high in the western facade. Five pointed arch, cedar windows are located along the northern elevation. Three pointed arch, cedar windows are located along the southern elevation. The side rooms, associated with the skillion roofed extension, have multi-paned sash, casement windows surmounted by metal sunhoods. Internally, timber pews are located on either side of a central aisle leading to the raised sanctuary at the eastern end of the church. The eastern wall of the sanctuary and adjoining southern wall are lined with painted horizontal tongue and groove timber. The remainder of the church is clad internally with chamferboards. This sanctuary is raised about a metre higher than the church floor and includes a cedar altar and communion rails. The timber ceiling is braced with arched metal rods. At the rear of the church is a sandstone font with decorative mouldings and designs. The timber dedication plaque on the porch incorporates a brass centenary plaque attached to the original timber plaque. The timber plaque reads: \\"Laid by Hon T.J. Byrnes; May 21, 1898; A.H. Julius Vicar; W Armstrong Warden\\". The skillion roofed extension is accessed via paired cedar doors in the southern wall. The area is timber floored and clad with chamferboards. A partition divides the room at the western end and a timber trunk and metal bed with mosquito net are located in the room. A timber organ, built by WH Paling & Co, is located in room on the southern side of the church. The church is surrounded by mature trees and garden beds.

It dealt with the challenges that the Albanian language and schools faced at the time within the context of the empire, and the platform to overcome them. Background The First Congress of Manastir of 14‚Äì22 November 1908, known as the congress of the Albanian alphabet, established a Latin script based alphabet to be used as a standard for Albanian writings, marking an important moment in the history of the Albanians. It was accepted with enthusiasm by the Albanian patriotic circles, but was not welcomed by the Ottoman authorities, the Greek Orthodox Church (there was no Albanian Orthodox church back then), and the pro-Turkish Muslim leaders. The Ottomans organized a joint Ottoman-Albanian congress in July 1909, known as the Congress of Dibra. It was seen as an attempt to convince the Muslim Albanian population to demand an alphabet based on the Arabic script, since the Latin script was \\"not conform the teaching of the Quran\\". Nevertheless, this attempt was not successful due a strong stance of a fraction of the Albanian delegates. Moreover, the Albanian schools continued to spread. During 2‚Äì9 September 1909, another congress was held in Elbasan. It dealt primary with the approach on spreading the Albanian education, considering the standard Alphabet a closed chapter. The Normal School of Elbasan was established, a milestone of the Albanian education marking the first high-education institution. The normal school prepared teachers who would be placed in newly established schools within the Albanian communities. The opposition from the pro-Turkish fractions would continue, encouraged by the authorities. An open meeting was organized in Monastir on 6 February 1910 by Rexhep Voka from Tetovo and Arif Hikmet of Kumanovo, where it was demanded the introduction of an Arabic-scripts based alphabet for the Muslim population. Similar meetings were organized in Elbasan and Ohrid (where around 3,000 people attended) soon after. As a countermeasure, the Albanian nationalists organized on 27 February another meeting at Sh√´n Ilia near Kor√ß√´ in support of the Latin-script alphabet, such meeting would be known later in the Albanian historiography as the \\"Albanian alphabet meeting\\". At the point, it was decided that another follow up congress should be held in order to bring a final end to the oppositions affirming the decisions of the first congress. Event The congress was organized by the \\"Bashkimi\\" (The union) society branch of Monastir, which was itself represented by 5 members. The sessions were held in \\"Bashkimi\\"'s premises as well. A strong support came from the Albanian activist Salih Gjuka, recently appointed as Inspector of Education for the Vilayet of Monastir. Other \\"Bashkimi\\" branches which sent delegates were from Ohrid (2 delegates, one of each was Xheladin bey Ohri), Istanbul branch represented by Dervish Hima, Kor√ß√´ branch represented by Shefki Efendi, Negovan branch by Petro Nini Luarasi, Elbasan by Gani Bey Gungu, Struga by Abdullah Rushiti, Starov√´ by Hajdar Blloshmi, and Koƒçani had 1 representative. A significant fact is that for the first time in an Albanian education congress, the representation from the Vilayet of Kosovo was substantial. Kosovar participants were Bedri Pejani, Rexhep Mitrovica, Qamil Bala, Bejtullah Bey Gjilani, Shyqyri Ramadan Begu of Prishtina, Salih Gjuka, Hysni Curri, and Sabit Bey of Vushtrria. Supporting telegrams arrived from the branches which could not send delegates, from Smirna, Salonika, Kolonja, Lerini, Bilisht, Durr√´s, Shkod√´r, Vlora, Berat, Tepelena, Delvina, Leskovik, Preveza, and Tirana. Other sources mention Ibrahim Jegeni as representative of the \\"Bashkimi\\" branch of Upper Dibra region, Fehim Zavalani, Rifat Zavalani, Qazim Iljaz Pasha Dibra for Monastir, Tefik Efendi Panariti representing the \\"Dituria\\" (Knowledge) society of Kor√ß√´, Xhafer Ypi representing Konitsa, and Ali Efendi Zaimi representing Yenice. According to the local correspondent of the Serbian language Vardar newspaper, \\"out of 24 in total, beside two Protestant Christians, the rest were Muslims, affirming the level of the national-political conscience between the Muslim population\\". The congress operated with open sessions. On 4 April, the participants had t√™te-√†-t√™te discussions in privacy. Bedri Pejani, former professor of the Albanian language in the high school of Uskub was elected chairman, and Petro Nini Luarasi with Ferid Ypi (a lawyer from Monastir) as secretaries. The congress decisions were mostly accepted unanimously. Some of the important decisions as published by Vardar, no. 20, of 10 April 1910 in Skopje: *A pan- Albanian congress would follow up in Yanina on 3 July 1910, which would establish a political platform and close once and for all the topics of the Albanian alphabet and schools. *The Latin-script alphabet was accepted for the Albanian language. *A request would be sent to the Wali and the Ottoman Albania representatives in the Ottoman parliament, demanding protection for the Albanian Orthodox Church, and halting the Greek propaganda. (This request was initiated by Petro Luarasi). *An Albanian language newspaper to be opened in Uskub (Skopje), and the Albanians schools should continue to spread. *An interpretation would be required by the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm, explaining if the Latin script created any contradiction with what was written in the Quran. *An Albanian delegation would meet with the Sultan during his pronounced visit in the Monastir and Kosovo Vilayets. The delegation would require a general amnesty for all Albanian rebels, accepting on the other side that they fulfilled their military service duty in the Ottoman army. Other less important decisions dealt with the organization and operation of the Albanian language societies and clubs. The final declaration stated that: Afterwards The congress was successful in the prism of its goals. A clear respond was sent to the Ottomans that the Latin-script would be the only one, \\"the alphabet of the Albanian people\\", and confirmed continuity of the decision that came out of the first congress of 1909. Despite the difficulties, the Albanian language education continued to spread. The Young Turk government suppressed all schools, patriotic societies and clubs (even the \\"Bashkimi\\" one) after the Albanian Revolt of 1910. With the revolt of 1911 and 1912, the status will be regained. The First Balkan War would start the series of events which reshaped the configuration within the Balkans and brought an end to the Ottoman rule, ending as well the endeavors of the Albanian language status within the Ottoman Empire.

The spit separates the salt-water Baltic Sea (on the west) from the freshwater Curonian Lagoon to the east. The southern portion of the spit lies within Zelenogradsky District in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia; the northern portion lies within southwestern Lithuania. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site shared by the two countries. Topography The foundations of the spit were created about 15,000 BCE as the receding glaciers left the Baltic Sea behind, and the sand dunes of the Curonian built on the glacial moraine. The actions of sea and wind build large dunes, which average 35 meters on the spit. The area is one of high biodiversity due to the many different ecological communities in close proximity to each other: beach, dune ridge, wetlands of various types, meadows and forests. The Curonian Spit is the second longest spit in the world, after the 110-km long Arabat Spit in the Sea of Azov. The park follows the spit from the Sambian Peninsula in the south to the border with Lithuania about 40 km north; its width varies from 0.4 to 4 km. The water in the lagoon averages 3.7 meters in depth, and the water level of the lagoon is about 12 cm above that of the Baltic.

Son of Eddie Foy Sr., he was one of the famous \\"The Seven Little Foys\\", the seven children of the senior Foy, who joined him on stage in vaudeville. After beginning his career in Vaudeville, he had a film career which spanned 40 years, although he was only truly active for seven of them, from 1936 through 1943. Early life Foy's grandparents immigrated to the United States in 1855, settling in New York City. As a child, his father moved to Chicago with his widowed grandmother after the grandfather had died from syphilis-induced dementia. After a career that took him around the country, Eddie Foy settled back in the town he was born in, New York. There he met and married Madeline Morando. The two had 11 children, 7 of whom survived childhood. Of those, Charley was the 2nd oldest. His six surviving siblings were: Bryan Foy (1896 - 1977), Mary Foy (1901 - 1987), Eddie Fitzgerald Foy (1905‚Äì1983), Richard Foy (1905 - 1947), Madeline Foy (1906 - 1988), and Irving Foy (1909 - 2003). Career =The Seven Little Foys= Publicity photograph of Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Foys, 1915 (Charley is on the far left) As a youth, Foy wanted to be a professional ball player. Foy's entry into show business came when his father created \\"Eddie and the Seven Little Foys\\" in 1912, which became one of the most sought after acts on the Vaudeville stage. The act consisted of skits, songs, and dance, featuring the senior Eddie and his seven children. Occasionally, their mother would also appear with them on-stage up until her death in 1918. They debuted at the New Brighton Theater on Long Island, New York on August 19, 1912, before moving to the Union Square Theatre in New York City the following week. Over the next six years, the act appeared in New York theaters and on tours throughout the country. In 1913, after opening in New York at the Union Square, the group toured 13 cities in 17 weeks. Charley Foy made his film debut this year, in a Majestic Motion Picture film short, \\"The Other Side of the Fence\\", as a precocious youth who has many adventures. The following year they worked all 52 weeks. They opened the year on New Year's Day, covering 21 cities before having a three-week stint at the Palace Theatre, followed by a two-week engagement back at the Brighton Theater. They closed the year with another 19-week, 9 city tour. In 1914 they would again set a torrid pace, performing 50 weeks, including two tours of 26 and 19 weeks. They again toured twice in 1915, but this time only for 17 weeks from January through April, and then for the final 6 weeks of the year. In between, Foy appeared in another film in the Mack Sennett short, A Favorite Fool, this time along with the rest of his family. It would be another 13 years before the act again appeared on film, minus their father, in the Vitaphone short, \\"Chips of the Old Block\\". This short, in the UCLA archive, is the only surviving film of the performances of the family act. They remained busy during 1916‚Äì17, going out on four more tours. 1918 saw them once again on road, touring four cities in seven weeks, starting on New Year's Day. After this tour, the oldest son, Bryan, went to serve in the U.S. Army in World War I. The act would continue without Bryan, as \\"Eddie Foy and the Younger Foys\\", through 1923, when their father retired. The Younger Foys continued on the vaudeville stage through the 1920s, eventually disbanding when Eddie Foy Jr. went out on his own as a single act in 1929. Foy, along with three of his younger siblings, Madeline, Mary, and Irving, continued to perform as an act in Vaudeville through the mid-1930s, billed as \\"The Foy Family: Real Chips Off the Old Block\\", in which Charley Foy was given top billing. At one point in the mid-1920s, Foy attempted to give Ginger Rogers, then an unknown dancer by the name of Ginger McMath, an opportunity on stage during a performance in Fort Worth, Texas. However the venue manager refused to allow her to take the stage. =Films= In 1936 Foy realized that Vaudeville was waning quickly and decided to attempt a return to film, so he left New York and relocated to Hollywood. 21 years after his last foray into film as one of the Seven Little Foys, Charley Foy returned to film in 1936, with the small role of Ratto in the comedy, Hot Money From 1936 to 1943, Foy appeared in over 20 pictures, cast either as Charley or Charles Foy. In 1937 he appeared in several films, including Saratoga, which stars Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, in her last screen appearance. Foy had been attempting to utilize his dance expertise since his return to film, with little success. That changed with his being cast as 'Scoop' Trotter in the 1937 musical, Melody for Two, for which his dancing received positive notices. He also had a featured role, again utilizing his dance skills, in Dance Charlie Dance, a comedy directed by Frank McDonald. In 1939 he appeared in several notable films. In Lew Landers's espionage drama, Conspiracy, he had one of the starring roles, Studs, which also stars Allan Lane, Linda Hayes, and Robert Barrat. He had a small role in the drama, Hell's Kitchen, which stars the Dead End Kids and Ronald Reagan. Foy also had the featured role of Slick in the Humphrey Bogart gangster film, King of the Underworld, which marked Bogart's first starring role. Foy had a starring role in the William C. McGann comedy, Sweepstakes Winner, which also stars Marie Wilson, Johnnie Davis and Allen Jenkins. In 1940, Foy had a small part in the John Garfield crime drama, East of the River, which also stars Brenda Marshall and Marjorie Rambeau. Foy would again have a featured role in another Bogart film in 1941, the drama The Wagons Roll at Night, which was directed by Ray Enright, and also stars Sylvia Sidney and Eddie Albert. Foy's final on-screen performance came in the 1943 western, The Woman of the Town, starring Claire Trevor and Albert Dekker, and directed by George Archainbaud, in which Foy played his father, Eddie Foy Sr. Foy's final film credit came twelve years later, when he provided the narration for the biopic about his father, The Seven Little Foys in 1955, which stars Bob Hope as the senior Foy. Later years and death Matchbook cover from Charley Foy's Supper Club, ca. 1942 Foy, along with his younger sister, Mary, operated a supper club during the 1940s and 50s, called the \\"Charley Foy Supper Club\\". It was originally located on Ventura Boulevard at Coldwater Canyon in northern Los Angeles, and was one of the first supper clubs in southern California. The club was opened by January 1941, and became a hangout for Hollywood celebrities. It was known for giving opportunities to aspiring young comedians, including Jackie Gleason, Dan Rowan and Dick Martin (who appeared in 1953), Peter Marshall, and Phil Silvers. During World War II Foy worked at Hal Roach Studios where he made films for the Army Signal Corps, working with Ronald Reagan. After the war, in addition to running his supper club, he also worked as a talent agent; he also moved his club to Sherman Oaks in 1946. He was a long-time friend of fellow vaudevillian and comedian, Joe Frisco, with whom he occasionally appeared with at the supper club. The club featured old vaudeville performers as waiters, such as Cully Richards and Sammy Wolfe. The club also featured former vaudevillian Frankie Hyers behind the bar. Hyers is credited by some as creating the expression \\"And away we go!\\", which would become popularized later by Jackie Gleason. Born Charles Richard Fitzgerald, he legally changed his name to his stage name, Charley Foy, in 1956.

It was built from 1870s to 1890s. It is also known as Broadsound Meat Company, Broadsound Packing Co Ltd, and Newport Meatworks Company. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001.  History  The former meatworks and wharf site is thought to be established in the 1860s as a boiling down works. By 1893, the meatworks had been established and remained in operation until around 1911. The St Lawrence area was settled by 1860, when Macartney formed Waverley Station. Around the same time, John Mackay was travelling in the area. The meatworks was one of the largest projects undertaken in the history of St Lawrence. It has been suggested that the meatworks owed its origin to the fact that a boiling down works had been established about four miles from the town near the wharf on Waverley Creek. The purpose of the boiling down process was to recover the fat or tallow from cattle which were usually considered below standard for putting through the butcher shop. The demand for tallow would have been much greater in that period of Australian history, for tallow was very much in demand for use in candles and for preserving harnesses. Boiling down works have been an important industry throughout Queensland during a number of periods. The establishment of such works usually coincided with drought and low prices for wool and beef. Boiling-down factories were started in Brisbane in 1843 by John \\"Tinker\\" Campbell and in Ipswich in 1847. By 1851, two works were located in Ipswich. Other boiling down works being established on the Darling Downs during the 1860s, included Campbell's operation on Westbrook Homestead, the depression of the time being the predominant reason behind the establishment of such industries. Consequently, reasons behind the establishment of the boiling down works at St Lawrence may also have been due to the effects of the depression. By 1865 the Queensland Government was in the process of extending the telegraph line between St Lawrence and Bowen, and to the Gulf of Carpentaria. In 1866, the Government proposed an impost on wool, tallow and hides. The Queensland Legislative Council considered the resolution to present the Governor with a Bill to be introduced to the Legislative Council to impose an export duty on one halfpenny per pound on wool, one pound per ton on tallow, three pence each on hides and one halfpenny each of sheepskins. The Council was divided and the motion was not passed. In 1866, Septimus Nash Spong designed a wharf at St Lawrence. Spong received a Queensland Government post in 1861, as clerk of works in the Colonial Architect's Office where he replaced Joseph Sherwin. Spong later moved to Rockhampton where he practiced as an architect, building and land surveyor from 1865 until 1874. As with its Canadian namesake, which has the fastest tide in the world, the basin at St Lawrence has a rapid and deep tidal surge and so was dangerous as a port. In 1873, as a cyclone and the storage of copper ore damaged the old wharf, a new wharf was established at Waverley Creek, which had better access by land and sea. Even so, the extension of the Central Western railway line to the port in Rockhampton reduced trade via St Lawrence and St Lawrence effectively ceased to be a port after 1879. PR Gordon, the Chief Inspector of Sheep observed in 1871, that the preservation of meat had become an established industry in the Colony. WB Tooth of Clifton reported boiling down 32000 sheep. Boiling down works were situated at Burke, Baffle Creek, Dalby, Gladstone, Mackay, Redbank, Rockhampton, Townsville, Westbrook and Yengarie. The Inspector stated that the Dalby and Westbrook Boiling Establishments reported having been obliged to discontinue operations on account of the excessive railway charges absorbing too large a share of the profits as the margin had become so small. The Inspector further reported that the during the present year, the Westbrook and Rockhampton curing establishments would be in active operation. While there is no clear evidence as to who initially established the boiling down works by August 1893, the Chairman of the Broadsound Divisional Board, on behalf of the residents of the district wired a protest to Sir Thomas McIlwraith regarding the closing of the Customs and other government offices. The community considered that the closing of such offices would mean stagnation for the area instead of progress. It was suggested at the time that, as companies for boiling down and exporting meat and for coal mining were being initiated, the works would mean increased revenue for the district. Two men involved with the works were TS Beatty and George Fox, who led the move to establish the factory. By September 1900, Beatty was described as one of the most enterprising men of the district, keeping the welfare of the town and district foremost in his thoughts. The meatworks was a prominent industry in the area at the time, particularly as copper mines in the area had failed, sheep were being moved west and the railway from Emerald to Clermont cut off traffic to St Lawrence. Despite difficulties such as devaluation and having little market for stock, which meant that it was almost impossible to fix a minimum price, the works were built and a price was established which had a fixed value to cattle proprietors, providing some stability in the industry. The works were described as being situated on Waverley Creek, about \\"three and a half miles\\" from St Lawrence, connected to the wharf by a tramline and with every convenience to hand for the efficient handling of stock and carcasses. The company had a strong propriety, both in London and the Colonies. By means of their steamer Tarshaw the works kept in direct communication with Rockhampton and the southern Colonies. Upwards of 120 men were employed and the company had a view to further extending the works through the construction of machinery for treating offal. FHT Walton, late of PD Armour and Company of Chicago, was the General Manager in 1900. Their principal product line of the meatworks was tinned meats and extracts, with other general by-products. Stockowners received equal to 12s. 6d (1.25) per hundred (refers to weight) for the same class of stock they had previously had to accept six and six (65c) and seven and six (75c) per hundred, and save, besides droving and loss condition, when immediate neighbourhood, who supply the residents with fruit, vegetables, maize, butter, etc. and the qualities of these products generally being exceptionally good. The meatworks also had freezing and chilling facilities on the spot, consequently, it was suggested that pig farming might be added to the product production. American Clem Allcut had control of the works by the late 1890s. It appears that Allcut had taken over the preserving works at Broadsound after leaving the government service. James Pattison was in partners for some time with Clem Allcut, but eventually sold his share to Allcut. Allcut, however, faced financial troubles later and was forced to give up the works to his creditors. Soon after, he returned to the United States. The works certainly did not continue for any great length of time after Allcut left, and its closure is generally attributed to the shortage of cattle caused by the great drought of 1902. The meatworks had some of the most modern equipment available at the time, for canned tongues and corned meat were loaded onto ships at the wharf and exported to southern markets. Local knowledge suggests that the water supply for the meatworks was pumped over a distance of more than two miles from a big lagoon on the lower portion of Waverley Plain. The pump was powered by a steam engine using an upright boiler known as a \\"Donkey boiler\\", which is still extant. The lagoon was located so close to the coast that the tidal waters eventually forced a breach into the bank which separated the lagoon from the sea, and ruined the supply of fresh water. Later an artificial bank or levee was built to keep the salt water out. This activity may be reflected in the name of the creek in the area, which is Bund Creek - a bund being defined as an embankment or an embanked quay. It is thought this occurred after the meatworks closed down, as it is considered unlikely that during the operation of the works, the owners would not have taken steps to stop the sea breaking through into the lagoon, unless this was caused by an unusually high tide. The meatworks preserved large quantities of meat by drying and salting brisket meat, packing it in wooden casks and then canning the rest of the meat. The preserved meat in casks was bought and used to a great extent by ships, many of which might be out of port for extended periods. The tallow and hides were also marketed. Clem Allcut during his term of ownership also manufactured beef extract. When the low prices of cattle prevailed, stock could sometimes be bought for as low as per head. All the waste meat and scraps were run into a gully close by, which is thought to have filled and emptied with the rise and fall of the tide so that all this waste was carried into the nearby stream and out to sea. By 1897-1899, the company was listed as the Broadsound Packing Co. Ltd. The Managing Director was CH Allcutt and the Secretary was WA Forth. By 1900, the company was listed as the Broadsound Meat Company with WD Preston as the Manager and WHA Britton the company accountant. In 1905, the Broadsound Meat Co had as its Manager, J Vickers, who continued in that position until 1911. From 1912, there are no further listings for the Broadsound Meat Company. Besides drought, further competition from other meatworks such as Lakes Creek, near Rockhampton, the Rockhampton Boiling Down and Meat Works Ltd, Nerimbera, who advertised that they were prepared to treat stock on \\"liberal terms\\", added to the difficulties faces by the meatworks at St Lawrence. With the Connors Range forming a formidable barrier to drovers with mobs of cattle, and the lack of a railway, the meatworks at St Lawrence was at a serious disadvantage. Following its closure, machinery and any other equipment was dismantled and taken away by sea, apparently being sold, possibly to owners of other meatworks requiring the equipment. Today the former meatworks site is predominantly archaeological.  Description  The remains of the former St Lawrence Meatworks and Wharf site is located on several properties off Settlement Road, approximately eight kilometres south-east of the town of St Lawrence. Despite vegetation growth, considerable evidence for site is still visible above ground. The main site includes three boilers, two of which are located to the west of the property and a third boiler located approximately ten metres to the east of the first two boilers. Situated around two of the boilers is brick rubble remains, providing evidence for the fireboxes which once surrounded the boilers. The third boiler, to the east, does not have any brick rubble remains surrounding it, indicating that it may have been moved from its original position. Directly to the west of the boilers is a brick lined, sunken area with remnant concrete flooring. It is approximately nine metres square. The remains of a wall rendered brick wall are located in sections around the area and rise to a height of approximately one metre. An opening is located in the remnant wall in the north-west corner of the area. Also in this section is located a metal grill. It is not clear if this grill is associated with some sort of heating element in the meatworks production line or if its purpose was more closely related to a cattle grill, and was to keep the animals within the area. Approximately ten metres north of the brick wall and concrete floor area is the remains of another facebrick structure. This structure has three walls extant [north, south and west] and may have had at least two rooms, as the remains of what appear to be the brick base of an internal wall and a timber framed doorway, are evident. To the north of the facebrick building is located the remains of another structure with a brick base and a concrete floor area. The site has other brick, metal and timber remains scattered throughout. It is also likely that further evidence of the meatworks exist underground. On another area of land, to the north-east of the main site, the remains of a donkey boiler and a mine shaft are extant. During the time of the meatworks, a tram ran from the site across to the main meatworks site. While no physical evidence of the tramline remains, what is apparent is an earthed, built-up area, indicating the position of the line. This is located to the west of the shaft and boiler and curves around, running south-west, disappearing before it reaches Settlement Road. The former wharf site, incorporating timber posts, and much of the tramway, which joins the meatworks, are situated on tidal flats, forming part of the Newport Conservation Park. Other remains include further evidence of the tram line such as timber sleeper and metal remains. Also extant in the Newport Conservation Park is evidence of timber fording of Bund Creek and remains of what appears to be a corduroy road.  Heritage listing  The former Meatworks and Wharf Site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Former Meatworks & Wharf Site, St Lawrence is thought to be associated with the tallow works established in the area in the 1860s, the earliest establishment of the town of St Lawrence and later with the extension of the site to include meatworks and boiling down works, from to . The site survives as an important illustration of early industrial development of Queensland and of the settlement of the Broadsound area in particular. The former meatworks and wharf site is significant in demonstrating early methods of addressing problems caused by the remoteness of areas used for stock raising and great distances between supplier and market in Queensland. It is further significant as the site survives as a legacy to the canning industry which lingered in the St Lawrence area when freezing was the dominant form of processing. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The surviving Donkey boiler is one of few of this type known to survive in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. With further archaeological and historical research and analysis, the place has the potential to reveal important information about Queensland's history and early industrial technology. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former meatworks and wharf site is significant as a well known tourist site and continues to attract public interest, with groups of visitors being shown the area by members of the local community.

In 2010, at the age of 17, he was arrested for stealing and leaking classified information about Icelandic financial companies. After his arrest he was introduced to Julian Assange, the editor and founder of WikiLeaks, and worked as a volunteer for the organization for almost a year and a half. In 2011, Sigurdur became an informant for the FBI and turned over internal WikiLeaks documents. WikiLeaks accused him of having embezzled $50,000 from the WikiLeaks online store to which he pled guilty along with other economic crimes. He was also accused of impersonating Julian Assange. In 2015 he was sentenced for sexual offences, by promising multiple individuals from 15-20 years of age, cars and money in exchange for sexual favors. Information leaks Sigurdur began leaking information about the Icelandic banking system to the media in late 2009. He leaked information about a number of individuals in the Icelandic banking system, information that showed that individuals were committing illegal acts in relation to banking. One of the leaks Sigurdur leaked was regarding a case called \\"Vafningsm√°li√∞.\\" That case involved powerful political persons such as Bjarni Benediktsson during his time as an MP. Bjarni reported that the case was only a political smear campaign. The information published by local news media obtained from Sigurdur also showed that one of Iceland's biggest football stars, Ei√∞ur Gu√∞johnsen, was in deep debt and almost bankrupt. After the information was published, Ei√∞ur sued the local newspaper DV for publishing this information. DV lost the case in a lower court, but won an appeal to the Supreme Court of Iceland, stating that the information was a matter for the public. Amongst other information that Sigurdur admitted to have leaked in an interview with the Rolling Stone magazine was information about local business men Karl Wernersson. He was the owner of the Milestone ehf that was the investment company Sigurdur stole most of the information from. Other names in the documents leaked by Sigurdur included information about Birkir Kristinsson, who was recently convicted of economic crimes while working for Glitnir bank. Some speculate that information from Sigurdur was used as evidence in that case, Sigurdur also leaked a classified report about one of the bigger aluminum plants in Iceland. The report stated that the plant was paying 1/4 of what other aluminum plants in the world are paying for electricity. Other information leaked by Sigurdur contained information about other local business men such as Gunnar Gunnarsson, who also has been reported to assist football star Cristiano Ronaldo in tax affairs. In 2013, Sigurdur got in an argument with Birgitta J√≥nsd√≥ttir on Twitter over the release of the loanbooks of the Glitnir Bank. Sigurdur argued that she had no involvement, but he later stated that he had given her the files years ago. In 2009, Sigurdur arrived at the offices of the Special Prosecutor, who investigated the bank collapse in Iceland in 2008. Sigurdur reportedly gave them all the information he had on Milestone and other local business men, however instead of using some of the information obtained from Sigurdur in investigation the investigators decided to sell the information. The case against the two police officers was later dismissed, and it has been reported that the investigators made roughly 30 Million ISK ($250.000) from the documents. In January 2010 Sigurdur was arrested on suspicion of stealing classified information, that case never made it to the court system and Sigurdur always denied his involvement until the Rolling Stone interview. Sigurdur was only seventeen years old when he was arrested for leaking the information. WikiLeaks connection Kristinn Hrafnsson, spokesman for WikiLeaks, claims Sigurdur was a volunteer for the WikiLeaks organization only for a few months between 2010 and 2011 where Sigurdur took part in moderating a chat room. Sigurdur also oversaw a project selling T-shirts on the WikiLeaks online store, from which he embezzled $50,000. Kristinn claims Sigurdur's claim of having been a board member or chief of staff at WikiLeaks are false and that he is a pathological liar. However in the Rolling Stone interview as well as Domscheitsberg book, and the court documents from the WikiLeaks embezzlement case it's shown that Sigurdur began working for WikiLeaks as early as March 2010 and was fired in November 2011, making it a year and half he was with WikiLeaks. Tangerine Bolen, the founder of Revolution Truth, says Sigurdur's involvement with the organization is being understated as damage control. Eelco Bosch Van Rosenthal a journalist for NOS at the time stated in the Rolling Stone article that Kristinn Hrafnsson said that he should talk to Sigurdur regarding media partnership about the diplomatic cables and other files, NOS later published the information. According to David Kushner, the reporter who took the Rolling Stone interview with Sigurdur, Sigurdur provided Rolling Stone with over 1 terabyte of data (1000 gigabytes ) to the paper about WikiLeaks, and said that either Sigurdur was the real deal or this was the biggest and most elaborate lie in the digital age. = Media portrayals = In 2013, the movie The Fifth Estate was released featuring a character based on Sigurdur, he was played by Jamie Blackley, Sigurdur is also mentioned in Domsheitberg's book, during his time with WikiLeaks he reportedly used the handles PenguinX, Singi201 and \\"Q\\". FBI connection In August 2011, Sigurdur contacted the United States Embassy in Reykjavik and claimed he had information about an ongoing criminal investigation in the United States, and requested a meeting. The day after Sigurdur was summoned to the embassy, where he gave diplomatic staff official documents showing that Sigurdur was who he claimed he was. The day after the meeting with the embassy official the FBI sent a private jet with eight federal agents and a prosecutor to question Sigurdur. The FBI gave Icelandic authorities notice that they were questioning Sigurdur in relation to an co- investigation that Anonymous and LulzSec were about to infiltrate Icelandic government systems. After the authorities found out Sigurdur was being questioned about WikiLeaks, the FBI was asked to leave Iceland. The FBI left the country a few days later but took Sigurdur with them to Denmark where questioning continued. Sigurdur was subsequently allowed to return to Iceland. In 2012, Sigurdur met with the federal agents on a number of occasions, and was flown to Copenhagen where Sigurdur was provided a room in a luxury hotel. Sigurdur was allowed to return to Iceland after every meeting. Sigurdur met with the FBI again in Washington D.C. and spent a couple of days with them there. The final meeting that Sigurdur said took place with the FBI was during a course Sigurdur was enrolled in at Aarhus in Denmark, teaching IT Security. Sigurdur met with the agents there and handed over several hard drives. it is reported that Sigurdur got $5,000 for his assistance and that he was on the FBI's payroll. In 2013, Sigurdur was also summoned to the General Committee of the Icelandic Parliament after days of being discussed in the Parliament. There Sigurdur was questioned about his involvement in the FBI case. The then- Minister of the Interior √ñgmundur J√≥nasson said in Parliament that Sigurdur was young and the FBI meant him to be a \\"spy\\" within the WikiLeaks organization. At the parliament hearing Sigurdur arrived with two bodyguards. \\"Spy Computer\\" In January 2011, it was revealed in Icelandic media that a computer had been found within closed sections of the Parliament. According to reports it was alleged that WikiLeaks was suspected of placing the computer inside the Parliament. Bjarni Benediktsson the MP Sigurdur leaked information about comments found on the computer Sigurdur was questioned about his involvement in this case, but has always denied any involvement in it. Morgunbla√∞i√∞, Iceland's largest newspaper published on the front page on 31 January 2011 that a local reporter for the paper DV was suspected of obtaining the information from Sigurdur. The reporter was said to be under investigation for receiving the information from Sigurdur and manipulating Sigurdur into leaking the information and placing the computer inside Parliament. The reporter sued the newspaper for libel and won the case. Morgunbla√∞i√∞ withdrew the report and issued an apology to the reporter on 7 December. There was a report in the Icelandic media that stated that specialists were now checking whether parliament phones were spied on by WikiLeaks. Wired published chat logs that indicated such. This is believed to support the claim that Sigurdur is involved with the spy computer somehow. Birgitta J√≥nsd√≥ttir issued a statement stating that she had never heard of any recordings. The case is still under investigation with no official suspects. Anonymous and LulzSec During his time at WikiLeaks it has also been reported that Sigurdur ordered attacks on Icelandic governmental infrastructures such as the servers hosting the Ministry's websites www.stjornarradid.is and www.landsnet.is. Those DDoS attacks were successful for a few hours. This was all done after an Icelandic business man that owns an Icelandic data center asked Sigurdur to do so. It has also been reported that Sigurdur ordered Hector Monsegur (Sabu) and his team to attack Icelandic State Police servers. This all happened during Sabu's time as an FBI informant. It is reported that Sigurdur obtained the unpublished version of a report about the surveillance unit at the U.S Embassy in Reykjavik. It has also been reported that Sigurdur Thordarson was WikiLeaks's connection to the hacker world. Many reports have indicated that persons part of Anonymous and LulzSec reported to Sigurdur. That was covered partially in the book We are Anonymous. Reports state that Sigurdur obtained many leaks through this method that WikiLeaks later published, such as The Kissinger cables and The Syria Files. It is unknown how WikiLeaks or Sigurdur obtained the information, though chat logs between Sigurdur and Hector Monsegur a.k.a. Sabu have surfaced. Some people also speculate whether the attack on the website of the Central Intelligence Agency was ordered by Sigurdur as a test to see whether \\"Sabu\\" had really as good skills and people as he claimed, it is believed that communications between \\"Sabu\\" and Sigurdur escalated after the CIA attack.https://www.rt.com/news/cia-site-claims- attack-807/ Public appearance In November 2013, Sigurdur went to Norway to speak about his journey for the organization YATA. Convictions In 2012, Sigurdur was questioned about sexual misconduct, accused of deceiving a seventeen year old teenage boy. At the time Sigurdur was 18 years old. Sigurdur denied the charges but was found guilty in late 2013 and received 8 months in prison. In 2012, WikiLeaks filed criminal charges against Sigurdur for embezzlement. Sigurdur denied the charges and the case was later dismissed. He was later arrested in the summer of 2013 on charges of financial fraud. At that time the WikiLeaks case was brought back up, and Sigurdur was indicted on charges of embezzlement and financial fraud. In 2014, Sigurdur was ordered to pay WikiLeaks 7 million ISK (roughly $55,000) as well as being sentenced to prison for 2 years for embezzlement and financial fraud. Sigurdur pled guilty to all counts. In those cases Sigurdur was ordered to pay the victims 15 million ISK (roughly $115.000), Sigurdur received a two-year prison sentence in those cases. In 2012, Sigurdur was arrested for allegedly having tried to blackmail a large Icelandic candy factory, it then turned out that Sigurdur had no involvement in that scheme at all and the case was later dismissed. In January 2014, Sigurdur was again arrested on charges of sex crimes. He was believed to be a flight risk and possibly sabotaging the investigation and therefore placed in solitary confinement. Sigurdur had said he would offer them flight tickets, Land Rovers, and up to a million dollars in exchange for sexual favors. The victims ranged from the age of 15-20, all male, during which Sigurdur was 18-21. A psychiatric evaluation ruled that Sigurdur was of sound mind, but that he was psychopathic. Sigurdur pled guilty to all counts and received 3 years for that. Sigurdur negotiated the damages to his victims and paid 8.6 million ISK (roughly $66,000). In 2014 he was sentenced to pay roughly $236,000 in damages for various economic crimes and frauds, including having swindled fast-food companies, car rentals, electronics shops, and having tricked someone into giving him all his shares in a book publishing company.

Toefuataina Samoa) traces its beginnings to the Congregational Christian Church in Samoa (EFKS). Because of minor disagreements with doctrine the church had, this drove the Rev. Tepa Faleto'ese to form a newer and more modern church, The Reformed Congregational LMS Samoan Church. A Malua Theological College graduate and an Elder in the EFKS Church, Rev. Tepa Faleto'ese founded the church in Balmain, Sydney, Australia in 1992, after he retired as church minister for the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa in Aoloau, American Samoa. The Reformed Congregational Church share the same doctrines, rules and rituals as the mother church EFKS, however, do not hold the annual Fa'amati, Faiga Me or any other monetary events aside from the Aso Sa o le Talalelei taulaga. Also, its head office is based in Australia, not in Samoa. The Motto for the Church is \\"Fa'afaigofie, Fa'ataugofie, Fa'asa'oloto\\" which translates to \\"Simple, Humble, Free Worship\\".  History  Rt. Rev. Tepa Faleto‚Äôese was an Elder in the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa (EFKS). He served as an elder minister for many years in both Samoa and American Samoa, and was the first minister to establish the first Congregational Christian Church of Samoa in Australia. The Reformed LMS Samoan Church's philosophy has been promoted by Reverend Faletoese for several years. As an Elder, he campaigned in the Committee of Elders to effect reforms within the church, to be in line with developing the spiritual rather than the physical side of the church members. As the most influential body that decides on the future of the church, Reverend Faletoese said his views were not acceptable to the majority of the Elders..He pushed the main EFKS church to establish itself in Australia, something which materialised in 1985 with himself in the lead. A year later, he took a different twist in the forever quest for a reformed church. He left the church that he himself pushed to be established in Australia when he accepted a call to be a minister at Aoloau in American Samoa. The church comes under the breakaway faction of the EFKS.After five years, Reverend Faletoese resigned to return to Australia. On 2 February 1992, he founded the Reformed Congregational L.M.S. Samoan Church. When established, the church was known as ‚ÄòE.F.K.S. Tuto‚Äôatasi‚Äô or ‚ÄòEkalesia Samoa Tuto‚Äôatasi‚Äô. However, during the annual church conference of 1996, the church unanimously voted for the church to be renamed, ‚ÄòThe Reformed Congregational L.M.S. Samoan Church, or Ekalesia L.M.S. Toefuata‚Äôina Samoa. The name ‚ÄòL.M.S.‚Äô is referred to the ‚ÄòLondon Missionary Society‚Äô, the missionaries who brought the gospel to Samoa. ‚ÄòToefuata‚Äôina‚Äô meaning ‚Äòreformed‚Äô was merged with L.M.S., because it is believed that this church is a reformed version of the original L.M.S. Church (EFKS). The Rt. Rev. Tepa Faleto'ese died in 2004.  Church's Focus  The Samoan church during the missionary period engaged itself in the \\"social redemption of humanity\\". This vision was based on the church's understanding of God's sovereignty. It saw the divine purpose of redemption not in individual terms only but also in corporate, social and political terms. The newly acquired faith had its focus on the transformation of life and society. That legacy remains a motivating force in the nation's idealism as well as in the church's commitment to active social efforts. The church emphasises the idea of \\"Fa'afaigofie, Fa'ataugofie, Fa'asa'oloto\\" or \\"Simple, Humble, Free Worship\\"  Membership  There are over 10,000 worshippers of the church itself, which include all the churches belonging to the Reformed LMS Samoan Church.  Churches  The Reformed Congregational LMS Samoan Church is a world-wide church which is based in Samoa, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America, however, there have been major incidents which have divided the church. The founding churches and ministers (churches established between 1992‚Äì1998) of the church were: * Rt. Rev. Tepa Faleto'ese (Sydney, Australia) * Rt. Rev. Litaea So'oa'emalelagi (Glen Eden, Auckland, New Zealand) * Rt. Rev. Alapati Tu'uga (Brisbane, Australia) * Rt. Rev. Tuiataga Siataga (Christchurch, New Zealand) * Rt. Rev. Solomona Iosefa (Glen Innes, New Zealand) However, due to differences the, Rev. Litaea and Rev. Tuiataga became independent and no longer were associated with the church. Up until 2007, these were the churches which remained and formed the LMS Reformed Church. AUSTRALIA: Rt. Rev.

It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, low white blood cells, rash, feeling tired, fever, and muscle pains. Other serious side effects include inflammation of the lungs and infections. It is a dual inhibitor of PI3KŒ¥ and PI3KŒ≥. Duvelisib is manufactured by Verastem Oncology. Medical uses It is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and follicular lymphoma after other treatments have failed. Further trials are ongoing to confirm benefits as of 2019. Mechanism of action Duvelisib is a Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, specifically of the delta and gamma isoforms of PI3K. This class of compounds works by preventing PI3K from playing its role in transducing signals from outside of cells into various intracellular pathways involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, senescence, angiogenesis and cell metabolism, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. History Duvelisib, also known as IPI-145, was discovered by Intellikine, a company founded in September 2007 based on biochemistry research from the lab of Kevan Shokat at the University of California San Francisco. In mid-June 2016, Infinity announced results of Phase II clinical trial of duvelisib. In November 2016, Infinity exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to duvelisib to Verastem Oncology for little money compared to earlier deals; the deal included no upfront payment, a $6 million milestone for success in a Phase 3 trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a $22 million payment for an FDA approval, and royalties. Duvelisib has received orphan drug designation in the United States for treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in 2019.  Society and culture  = Legal status = In April 2018, Verastem filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for duvelisib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and accelerated approval for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). The FDA approved the application in September 2018. Duvelisib is intended to be used in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and carries a black box warning due to the risk of fatal/serious toxicities: infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions and pneumonitis.

As the submarine-launched ballistic missile became the primary Navy strategic deterrent, the Navy concluded that it no longer needed carrier-based strategic bombers and that Naval Aviation's strike arm would remain strictly a tactical force. Having been designed as a supersonic nuclear strike bomber, aircraft such as the A-5A and A-5B no longer had a mission, and in 1963, the Navy decided to halt any further procurement of the A-5A and the follow-on A-5B. However, in lieu of prematurely retiring the Vigilante, it was deemed that it would be reconfigured as a dedicated reconnaissance platform under the designation RA-5C. VAH-9's transition to the RA-5C Vigilante began in April 1964. The unit's designation was changed to RVAH-9 in June of that year and the last A-3B was transferred out on 4 August 1964. =RVAH-9 / Vietnam / Cold War=On 14 November 1964, RA-5C BuNo 149308 assigned to RVAH-9 crashed at Naval Air Station Sanford.

The pilot, Lieutenant Commander Charles Schoonover,http://www.virtualwall.org/ds/SchoonoverCD01a.htm applied power, but the starboard engine subsequently exploded and the aircraft crashed into the sea. Both Lieutenant Commander Schoonover and his reconnaissance attack navigator, Ensign Hal Hollingsworth,http://www.virtualwall.org/dh/HollingsworthHT01a.htm were listed as killed in action, bodies not recovered. *2 May 1967 - 6 December 1967, RVAH-9 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. Budgetary pressures of the Vietnam War forces the Department of Defense to close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Sanford. Following their return from their 1967 deployment and prior to departure on their 1968-1969 deployment, RVAH-9 shifts home stations from Naval Air Station Sanford to the former Turner Air Force Base, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia. *26 October 1968 ‚Äì 17 May 1969, RVAH-9 embarked aboard USS Ranger for a Western Pacific and Vietnam deployment. *17 June 1970 - 11 November 1970, RVAH-9 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *7 June 1971 - 31 October 1971, RVAH-9 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *22 September 1972 - 6 July 1973, RVAH-9 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. =RVAH-9 / Cold War= 19 July 1974 - 21 January 1975, RVAH-9 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment.  Budgetary pressures following the end of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to again close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Albany. In January 1974, RVAH-9 shifts its home station from NAS Albany to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida.http://www.gonavy.jp/navy/sqn/VAH01.html * 16 July 1975 - 24 Sep 1975, following less than five months turnaround time at their home station of Naval Air Station Key West, RVAH-9 embarked aboard the newly commissioned nuclear- powered aircraft carrier for a two-month Northern Atlantic deployment as part of the carrier's post-shakedown availability. * 7 July 1976 - 7 February 1977, RVAH-9 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. Carrier-based reconnaissance was concurrently conducted by the active duty VFP community at Naval Air Station Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community at Andrews Air Force Base / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader until 29 March 1987, when the last RF-8G was retired and the mission was fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve VF community at Naval Air Station Miramar, Naval Air Station Oceana, Naval Air Station Dallas and NAS JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with the F-14 Tomcat equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS). Following its return from its final Mediterranean deployment in early 1977, RVAH-9 was inactivated at Naval Air Station Key West on 30 September 1977 following over 24 1/2 years of active service.http://www.rvahnavy.com/5history.html Home station assignments The squadron was assigned to these home stations: *Naval Air Auxiliary Station Sanford / Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida *Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia *Naval Air Station Key West, Florida Aircraft AssignmentAJ-2 Savage *A3D-2 / A-3B Skywarrior *RA-5C Vigilante See alsoReconnaissance aircraft *List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons *History of the United States Navy References External links Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Category:Fleet air reconnaissance squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"RVAH-9"},{"id":"48948017","title":"Liberal‚ÄìLabour (New Zealand)"},{"id":"48948019","text":"H√©l√®ne Desputeaux (; born July 10, 1959) is a French-Canadian educator, writer and illustrator from Quebec.

It was built from 1878 to 1934. It is also known as former St Lawrence Courthouse and Cell Block. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 November 2000.  History  Sketch of the first St Lawrence Courthouse and Post Office, 1866 The St Lawrence police station and courthouse, constructed in 1878, the second to be built on the site and the cell block, constructed by 1880, are situated in a prominent position overlooking the St Lawrence Creek, located on the site of a government reserve which has served the community as part of the justice system since 1863. Additions to the police station and former courthouse in 1934 included the enclosing of verandah in the north-west corner to build a bathroom. Other additions included the construction of earth closets and a cell block in the grounds. The buildings have had numerous repairs, including painting and restumping and minor renovations over the years. European settlement began in the St Lawrence area by 1860, when John Arthur Macartney formed Waverley Station. Macartney, an Irish solicitor, had made his fortune on the Victorian gold fields. The St Lawrence area had a strong connection with the pastoral industry in the 19th century. McCartney took up land at the head of Broadsound and Waverley in 1860 and used the banks of the St Lawrence Creek to land his supplies. Later that year a boiling down works for tallow was established. In 1861 the Rockhampton Port Master recommended the site for a port, and government buildings were soon constructed. These included a Telegraph Office, Police Station and Courthouse. Macartney was the first magistrate at the courthouse. During the first years of settlement in what was later to become the State of Queensland, the police system was executed through the duties of a Police Magistrate. However, this proved to be inadequate and following the appointment of the first Governor of Queensland, Governor Bowen, in 1859, an organised force was established by appointing an Inspector General to be in charge of both ordinary and Native Police. In 1863 and 1864, the police system again changed form, following the appointment of the first Commissioner of Police, David Thompson Seymour. He introduced a new system based on the Victorian model comprising Inspectors, Sub-Inspectors, Sergeants, Constables and a Detective Force. In ensuing years, the structure of the Force underwent a number of additional modifications and by 1924 Queensland had the highest state ratio of policemen to residents in Australia, with one officer to every 725 persons. By 1863 a government reserve of four acres had been set aside in St Lawrence in the north-west corner of the surveyed area, to the south of the St Lawrence Creek. This reserve was titled \\"Custom House\\". The first courthouse in St Lawrence, a single storey slab building with a shingle roof was constructed by 1866. In 1869 there were two government buildings in the town, a \\"public house\\", a store and \\"8 or 9 huts\\". This courthouse was repaired following cyclones in 1875 and 1877. By 1878, a new, timber building with a shingle roof was commenced by contractor Thomas Watson. It was completed by the end of 1878 for a cost of ¬£520/18. The design, prepared by the Office of the Government Architect, was similar to the Port Douglas courthouse, constructed in 1879. By June 1880, the Police Inspector reported that the \\"...Barracks consist of the old Court House and the original Barracks and Cells...\\". The former portion was occupied by the Sergeant and the latter by the Constable. At this time, there were two new cells under construction. The Inspector of Police reported that the Barracks were in an unsatisfactory state, the result of \\"...keeping a number of pigs, goats and poultry on the premises\\". By October 1881, in compliance with the Inspector's instructions, William Tagg's premises at St Lawrence were rented to serve as a police barracks for twelve months at a cost of ¬£25 per annum. By September 1882, the Constable at St Lawrence requested instructions regarding a renewal of rental terms. In October 1882, Tagg offered to sell the premises to the police, however, following an inspection, it was decided to erect a new police barracks on the site of the reserve, which were occupied by the courthouse, post and telegraph office and sergeants quarters. The Constable in Charge proposed that the slabs from the buildings to be pulled down to make way for the new police barracks, not be sold off, but reused to erect stables, a saddle room, a cart shed and other out offices. In January 1914, Herbert Payne was awarded the tender to remove eight decayed stumps from under the courthouse and replace them with solid blocks. The decayed floor boards at the \\"bottom front verandah\\" were also to be replaced and the building painted. The cost totalled ¬£45. In January 1919, the Commissioner of Railways informed the Police Department that a camp was to be established at St Lawrence for the construction of the North Coast Railway. The Commissioner thought that the town did not have a police presence; however, he was informed that there were two constables stationed at St Lawrence. In 1921, it was proposed to build new accommodation for the single constable, as the old slab quarters, constructed , were considered uninhabitable. Funding was not granted for this, and so the following year, the constable was directed to use one of the rooms at the rear of the courthouse. The Constable in Charge, who was also Acting Clerk of Petty Sessions, was already using the building for clerical work and \\"indoor\\" police work. A toilet for prisoners was added to the rear verandah in 1935 when new stables and forage room was also built. The single constable's quarters was pulled down in 1923 and the slabs used to construct a harness room. The arrival of the North Coast railway line in 1921 provided an important economic boost to the area, as well as a transport link. St Lawrence was a meal stop for rail passengers and the refreshments rooms at one time employed 22 women. Drivers and staff also changed at St Lawrence. The town itself reached its peak in the late 1940s with a population of 3000. The police barracks was demolished in the late 1980s and a new building was constructed. The railway station closed in 1992 and the last court was held in St Lawrence in that year. The police station and former courthouse and the cell block continue to be used by the police department.  Description  Located in the south-west corner of the site, the St Lawrence Police Station and former Courthouse is a single story, \\"T-shaped\\" timber building, with an exterior cross-braced frame supported on low stumps. The gable roof is clad with corrugated iron. The building is surrounded on the south, west and east by a verandah with timber posts, under a separate roof, clad with corrugated iron. The verandah to the north (rear) of the building, has been partially enclosed on the north-western side, to accommodate toilet facilities. This section of the building has a skillion roof clad with corrugated iron. This enclosure is part of the 1934 additions. The verandah has also been partially enclosed, with vertically jointed timber, on the north-eastern side to accommodate toilet facilities. This enclosure is later in date, and the framework is clad with chamferboards. A set of timber stairs lead to the paired, panelled, timber doors. The entrance is centrally located under a gabled roof with a decorative timber finial. A circular ventilator is located high in the southern facade. Narrow windows operating on pivots are located on either side of the entrance door and along the western and eastern sides of the building. Forming part of the transverse section of the building, on the eastern side, is located a set of long, rectangular casement windows, protected by a sunhood with timber brackets, clad with corrugated iron. A timber door at the northern end of the verandah on the eastern side, leads to the office. Internally, the entrance doors lead to the former courtroom. The room is horizontally lined with timber on the western, eastern and southern side of the room. The northern side is vertically lined with timber. The central section of the timber ceiling is flat and the sides and ends are angled. A vent with decorative fretwork is located in the ceiling. The Magistrate's bench is located at the northern end of the room. Timber doors are located on either side of the bench. These lead into two rooms forming the transverse section of the \\"T\\". One leads to the office and the second to the interview room. Court records and the original straitjacket, issued for the restraint of violent prisoners, are located in storage in the former courtroom. The office, located at the northern end of the building, is lined with timber on the western and eastern and southern sides and with chamferboards on the northern side. A door in the northern wall leads to a small office which forms part of the enclosed rear (northern) verandah. A second door leads to the open verandah. A timber door at the western end of the rear verandah leads to a small office, forming part of the original section of the building, which is used as an interview room. This room is lined with timber and there is a breezeway located in the eastern wall. A timber, panelled door in the southern wall opens to the former courtroom. The cell block, a single storey timber building, set on low timber stumps, with a hipped roof clad with corrugated galvanised iron, is located almost in the centre of the property, to the north-east of the police station and former courthouse. On the eastern side of the cell, timber stairs lead to the verandah and cell doors. Part of the verandah, at the northern end, has been enclosed to accommodate shower facilities. Apart from a doorway, the verandah is surrounded by a metal grill. Rectangular openings with metal grills and mesh wire are located high in each elevation. Two cells are located within the block, at the north and south ends of the building, each measuring a few metres square. In both blocks, to one corner, is located a porcelain toilet set in concrete. The cells are accessed via a heavy, timber door with iron hinges and bolts, and a square opening with an iron opening and door latch. An incinerator with the words \\"CP ENG MK1\\" embossed on the body is located to the north of the police station and former courthouse building. Two mango trees are located in the north-west corner of the property. A number of other mature trees and plantings are located around the site. The property is surrounded by a modern chain wire fence.  Heritage listing  Police Station and former Courthouse and Cell Block was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 November 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Forming part of the old town of St Lawrence, the site of the St Lawrence police station and former courthouse (1878) and cell block, constructed by 1880, is significant as it reflects the history and development of St Lawrence and the surrounding area and its role as a regional judicial precinct in the early years following Separation. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Few early timber police station and courthouse buildings survive and the St Lawrence police station and courthouse building is significant for its rarity as one of the earliest, intact, extant examples of this type of building. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As a single-storey, timber, government building, with drawings prepared by the Office of the Colonial Architect, the St Lawrence police station and former courthouse is significant as an example of a typical type of design and construction. The cell block is significant as an extant example of the typical timber cell blocks constructed by the Department of Public Works in the late 19th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The St Lawrence police station and former courthouse has aesthetic significance due to the simplicity and symmetry of design of the building, and for its contribution to the MaCartney Street streetscape and the St Lawrence townscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The site of a police reserve since 1863, the St Lawrence police station and former courthouse is significant for its long association with law and order and the dispensing of justice in the area. The building was the focus for a wide range of community services and this, together with the tradition of constables-in-charge, ensured that the St Lawrence police station and former courthouse provided an important community focus in the town.

He is the founder of DoNotPay, the first chatbot that allows motorists to appeal their parking tickets automatically. In 2018, Browder launched a new version of DoNotPay that allowed users to \\"swipe\\" on court settlements and sue.  Early life and education Born in London in 1997, Joshua Browder is the son of Bill Browder and Melanie Browder. His grandfather is the mathematician Felix Browder, and his great-grandfather is the political activist Earl Browder. Browder graduated from Stanford University, his father's Business School alma mater. His father attended the University of Chicago and studied Economics. DoNotPay chatbot = Beginnings = Browder grew up in Hendon, London. At the age of 18, he began to drive and to incur numerous parking tickets. Having formed the perception that these tickets were disproportionately targeting the elderly and disabled, and noticing the \\"formulaic nature\\" of the process by which they could be appealed, Browder created a chatbot called DoNotPay. Since its launch, the site has attracted over 175,000 successful users. According to Browder, it has saved UK and New York motorists an estimated $5 million. According to Forbes, Browder programmed the entirety of the website between the hours of 12am and 3am. He taught himself to code at age 12. In an article on DoNotPay, Roland Vogl, executive director at CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics in the United States, said that \\"chatbots are fairly limited in what they can accomplish and, in this early stage, are more effective at handling narrow tasks.\\" = Expansion = According to Browder, \\"lawyers all over the world should be very scared of this technology\\". Outside of fighting parking tickets, DoNotPay has also launched a service to help people save money on flight and hotel reservations. The service scans your email inbox for travel reservations and compares the price, helping users capitalize on price drops. Browder deliberately moved into the house which Facebook founder and entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg used to rent. Browder started sustaining his long hours of coding through a diet consisting primarily of Diet Coke and the \\"vile\\" food replacement liquid Soylent. Browder's goal for his new program, plus a busy work schedule, led Legal Cheek to describe him as either \\"ambitious\\" or \\"ridiculous\\". Browder's technology has received mixed reviews. For example, a writer at The Guardian noted that it \\"just drafted an impressive notice under the Data Protection Act 1998 not to use my personal information for direct marketing.\\" Similarly, a woman writer with The American Lawyer noted that, \\"one of DoNotPay's chatbots helped me draft a strong, well- cited and appropriately toned letter requesting extended maternity leave.\\" However, in 2016, the Legal Cheek tested Browder's chatbot with \\"fairly basic legal questions\\" and noted that it failed to answer most of them. He contributes to a blog at the Washington, D.C political newspaper The Hill, where he writes about civil rights and the death penalty. Awards and recognition  On 16 January 2017, Browder became the youngest member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in the Law and Policy category. * 2015 Huffington Post Entrepreneur Of The Week * 2015 Times of London 15 Smartest Kids On The Planet * UNESCO European Youth Award Finalist References External links Category:Living people Category:Stanford University alumni Category:1996 births Category:English inventors Category:Businesspeople from London Category:Businesspeople in computing Category:English chief executives Category:English computer programmers Category:People educated at University College School Category:English people of American descent Category:English people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:English people of Austrian-Jewish descent Joshua Category:21st-century inventors ","title":"Joshua Browder"},{"id":"48948089","text":"Lyman Tower Sargent (born 9 February 1940) is an American academic, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

The squadron was disestablished on 30 June 1976. Operational history A-3B Skywarrior on c.1962 RA-5C Vigilante lands on USS Kitty Hawk in 1966 =VAH-13= VAH-13 was established on 3 January at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, with twelve A3D-2 Skywarrior aircraft assigned. Upon completion of initial training, the squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Group 11 (later Carrier Air Wing 11) and deployed aboard the newly commissioned for her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, VAH-13 transferred to the Pacific Fleet, the squadron's Detachment A embarking aboard Kitty Hawk for her 11 August - 1 November 1961 transit from the Western and Southern Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific en route to her new homeport of Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California, while the remainder of the squadron relocated to its new home station of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. In September 1962, in accordance with a new DoD aircraft designation systems, the squadron's A3D-2 aircraft were redesignated as the A-3B Skywarrior. For the next three years, VAH-13 maintained readiness requirements and served with the U.S. Seventh Fleet, deploying as follows: * 13 September 1962 - 2 April 1963, VAH-13 embarked aboard for its first Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment.http://www.gonavy.jp/navy/sqn/VAH13.html * 17 October 1963 - 20 July 1964, VAH-13 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC deployment. In anticipation of its transition to the RA-5C Vigilante, VAH-13 moved back to Naval Air Station Sanford in August 1964. The squadron received its first RA-5C on 5 October 1964, followed by its redesignation as RVAH-13 on 1 November 1964.Grove, M. & Miller, J; Aerofax Minigraph 9, North American Rockwell A3J/A-5A Vigilante; Aerofax, Inc., Arlington, Texas c1989, p15; =RVAH-13 / Cold War and Vietnam= With the increasing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam after 1964, RVAH-13 was added to the mix of RVAH squadrons participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia. In conducting pre- and post-strike reconnaissance, the RA-5C would incur the highest loss rate of any U.S. Navy combat aircraft during the Vietnam War, and RVAH-13's experience would more than reflect this. RVAH-13's Cold War / Vietnam-era deployments were as follows: *19 October 1965 ‚Äì 13 June 1966, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. On 20 December 1965, RA-5C BuNo 151624 was hit by antiaircraft fire and lost in combat over North Vietnam. Both crewmen were initially listed as Missing in Action (MIA) until 1977 when the Vietnamese government confirmed that the pilot, LCDR Guy D.

Their remains were returned to the United States in March 1974. *10 April - 16 December 1968, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. Budgetary pressures of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Sanford. Upon return from their 1968 deployment, RVAH-13 shifts home stations from Naval Air Station Sanford to the former Turner Air Force Base, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, effective December 1968. *2 December 1969 - 8 July 1970, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *6 July 1971 - 17 December 1971, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *12 September 1972 ‚Äì 12 June 1973, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment.

Budgetary pressures and force reductions following the end of the Vietnam War forced the Department of Defense to once again close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, as an economy move. In April 1974, RVAH-13 executed a shift of home station from NAS Albany to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida.http://www.gonavy.jp/navy/sqn/VAH01.html Subsequent deployments for RVAH-13 were as follows: * 7 May 1974 - 18 October 1974, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC deployment. * 15 October 1975 - 24 April 1976, RVAH-13 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. Carrier-based reconnaissance was concurrently conducted by the active duty VFP community at Naval Air Station Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community at Andrews AFB / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader until 29 March 1987, when the last RF-8G was retired and the mission was fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve VF community at NAS Miramar, Naval Air Station Oceana, Naval Air Station Dallas and NAS JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with the F-14 Tomcat equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS). Following its return from its final Mediterranean deployment in 1976, RVAH-13 was disestablished at Naval Air Station Key West on 30 June 1976 following over 15 1/2 years of active naval service.http://www.rvahnavy.com/5history.html Home stations During its existence, VAH-13 / RVAH-13 was assigned to the following home stations: *Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida (1961-1961) *Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington (1961-1964) *Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida (1964-1968) *Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia (1968-1974) *Naval Air Station Key West, Florida (1974-1976) Aircraft AssignedA3D-2 / A-3B Skywarrior *RA-5C Vigilante See alsoReconnaissance aircraft *List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons *History of the United States Navy References External links Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Category:Fleet air reconnaissance squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"RVAH-13"},{"id":"48948292","text":"Ole Hjellemo (March 22, 1873 ‚Äì September 18, 1938) was a Norwegian musician and composer.

It is named for Henry Strangways who was premier and attorney-general when the legislation was passed, and had previously been the Minister for Crown Lands. Land had been surveyed and sold for farming in the more temperate climate areas of the province, and nearer to Adelaide, with the much larger expanses retained as crown land. Squatters had established pastoral runs in this crown land. A system of crown leases was established to provide some level of tenure to the pastoralists and income to the government from these lands. The parliament gained responsibility for these crown lands in 1857. Several attempts had been made for land legislation after 1857. A Select Committee on the Sale of Crown Lands was chaired by C. H. Goode in 1865, however its report was of marginal value. Strangways introduced a bill in 1868 which was eventually passed in January 1869, despite conflict with pastoralists. There was an increasing demand for more land to be available for farmers to clear of scrub for the purpose of more intensive agriculture such as growing grain crops and mixed farming. The legislation provided for the creation of agricultural areas and sale of crown land on credit. The Act allowed a person to purchase up to , with a payment of 20 per cent at the fall of the hammer at auction, regarded as payment in advance of the interest on the purchase money, the whole amount to be paid four years later. Accessed 30 December 2015. There were regulations to ensure that purchasers farmed the land themselves. An amendment in January 1871 reduced the required initial payment from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, with a further 10 per cent to be paid three years later. Accessed 1 April 2020. In August 1872 another act changed the time for payment of the purchase money to three years after the payment of the second 10 per cent (six years after the purchase), and by paying only half the purchase money at this time the purchaser could obtain an extension of up to four more years.

It is a dense, rounded shrub with yellow new growth, crowded leaves and lilac-coloured to light purple flowers. Description Eremophila citrina is an erect, densely foliaged, upright shrub usually growing to a height of and almost as wide. Its new leaves and stems are covered with lemon-coloured glandular hairs which gradually fade to grey. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are thick and clustered, and usually have a distinct mid-vein visible on the lower surface. They are linear to narrow egg-shaped, mostly long and about wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a straight stalk long. There are 5 lance-shaped, green to purple-brown sepals which are mostly long and covered with a layer of yellowish hairs, at least at first. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is light purple to lilac-coloured on the outside and white with light purple spots inside. It is also glabrous on the outside except for the petal lobes which are covered with hairs. The inside surfaces of the lobes are glabrous while the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. Flowering occurs mostly from June to October following rain and is followed by fruits which are oval-shaped to almost spherical, have a papery covering and are about long.E. citrina leaves and flowers Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock north-west of Minga Bore. The specific epithet (citrina) is a Latin word meaning \\"from a lemon tree\\" referring to the colour of the new growth of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila citrina occurs in a broad band between Newman and Laverton where it grows in stony soil derived from laterite. Conservation status Eremophila citrina is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is not widely known in horticulture although it is growing well on a property in western Victoria. Its golden new growth and purple or lilac flowers are attractive features. Plants have been grown by grafting onto Myoporum. It grows best in well-drained soil in a sunny location but is sensitive to frost.

Taxonomy  Within Durioneae, Kostermansia and Coelostegia form a clade that is sister to the clade comprising Durio s.s. and Boschia, which are some consider to comprise a single genus, and Cullenia. Both of these clades form a clade that is sister to the remaining genus of the tribe, Neesia. Camptostemon and Papuodendron are often included in this tribe as well. However, certain characters (pollen morphology, androecial vasculature, and wood anatomy, for example) support a closer relationship to the Malvoideae than to the Helicteroideae for these two genera. Durioneae has traditionally been placed within the Bombacaceae because of the combination of monothecate anthers, smooth pollen, and tree habit. However, recent molecular evidence indicates that this tribe is most closely related to the tribe Helictereae of the traditional Stericuliaceae. In certain recent circumscriptions of the mallow family, the Bombacaceae and Stericuliaceae form an expanded family Malvaceae that also includes traditional Malvaceae and Tiliaceae.

Since forming in 2007, the band has released three full-length records and two EPs. The band has performed across the United States including appearances at South by Southwest, Electric Forest, Wakarusa, and Gathering of the Vibes. History The band was originally formed in 2007 by Tom Hamilton as a recording project to explore different styles of music from his then current band, Brothers Past. Having grown up listening to Americana musicians like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard, Hamilton wrote a batch of songs that fell into this genre. Enlisting drummer Joe Russo, keyboardist Aron Magner, and a few other friends, these songs turned into American Babies' self-titled release that came out in 2008 on SCI Fidelity Records. Touring behind this record was sparse but featured showcases at Newport Folk Festival, Langerado Music Festival, and music industry events CMJ and SxSW. By 2010 Hamilton's creative focus switched from Brothers Past to American Babies. He moved back to his home town of Philadelphia, PA and started to write new material. With the help of producer Bill Moriarty, American Babies' second LP, \\"Flawed Logic\\" was made. This album had a much broader range of topics, lyrically. Hamilton cites the Great Recession of 2008 and the congruent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as large influences on the record. Upon the album's release on April 1, 2011 via Engine Room Recordings, Hamilton put together a steady backing band and started to tour regularly. In December 2012 Hamilton started work on American Babies' third full-length LP. After a couple of months of writing and demoing songs in his house, Hamilton linked up with childhood friend/producer/engineer Peter Tramo and went into his Philadelphia-based Lorelei Studios to start recording. The resulting album saw a wider range of sounds and musical leanings, and a continuation of exploring broader lyrical themes. Described by Hamilton as a \\"forty-minute existential meltdown,\\" the album \\"Knives and Teeth\\" tackles weighty subject matter including sin, redemption, politics, and mortality. It was released October 15, 2013 via The Royal Potato Family. It was announced in December 2015 that American Babies will release their fourth studio album on March 18, 2016. entitled \\"An Epic Battle Between Light and Dark\\" via The Royal Potato Family.

Geography Lough O'Flynn measures about long and wide. It is located about east of Ballyhaunis, just north of the village of Ballinlough and is the source of the River Suck. There is an artificial island known as a crannog in the lake; this is believed to date back to the Medieval period, when it would have been used as a place of safety to retreat to when under attack. There are marked trails along bog tracks leading around the lake, with views of the lake and river as well as surrounding areas of bog scrub, coniferous woodland and open peatland.

Beside the lake is a raised bog, the Carrowbehy/Caher Bog, a Special Area of Conservation. Active raised bogs have a high percentage of sphagnum moss and new peat is being formed; in this case, there are hummocks and extensive quaking areas and many large steep-sided pools intersecting with each other.

Plot Fern is a high school student with a problem: her ex-boyfriend Robert returned from the grave as a ghost. Their relationship wasn't entirely a happy one, since Robert was clingy and smothered her, which led to their breakup. Initially, Fren tried to make things work, but quickly determines that a relationship between a ghost and a living person would not be successful, especially as she has begun to spend time with Harlan, a football player. After Robert subjects her and others to a series of supernatural attacks, Fern turns to her track coach Valeria, who doubles as a ghost hunter. Valeria gives her a series of tools that could help her get rid of Robert's ghost, which includes pills that give her the ability to see ghosts. Fern is finally forced to tell Robert that she doesn't think that the two of them can be together since she's of the living, only for Robert to then change his tactics. Instead of trying to romance her, Robert has decided that the only way they can be together is to kill Fern so that their ghosts can be together. He enlists several other ghosts to help in his efforts, making it necessary for Fern to bring her family and Valeria into the fight. Eventually, Fern and Robert have a face off, during which she manages to convince him to let her go, causing him and the other ghosts to vanish.

It was created to limit the operation of Section 92 of the Constitution of Australia (which ensures free trade among the States) by granting States complete legislative power to regulate alcohol regardless of where the alcohol was originally produced. It is similar in effect to the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution. History =Temperance movement= After its defeat at the Adelaide Constitutional Convention, the Local Option League of New South Wales requested that the Minister for Lands reintroduce the proposal allowing States to regulate imported alcohol. He said that he would not introduce the proposal due to his position but would support it if it was proposed by someone else. The inclusion of section 113 was in the Constitution was advocated for by those in the Australian temperance movement. The Women's Christian Temperance Union, as well as other Australian temperance organisations, sent many petitions to the Constitutional Convention in support of section 113, leading proponent Alfred Deakin to remark that regardless of the merits of the section, it was important that it be included to obtain the support of \\"a very large section of the population who are amongst the most active politically\\". In contrast to the American temperance movement's support of national prohibition, the Australian movement's support of regulation on an individual State basis may seem curious. Professor Helen Irving of the University of Sydney suggests that this was because it was recognised that \\"the likelihood of national prohibition was small\\", and reflects that \\"Had such women been involved directly in drafting the Constitution, they might well have argued for national prohibition\\". =Earlier proposals= Initially, at the Adelaide Constitutional Convention, Alfred Deakin proposed a resolution which would have allowed States to prohibit the importation of anything which they had first prohibited the sale of. After other delegates found problems with this amendment, Deakin amended it such that the States would only be able to restrict the importation of alcohol and opium, and such that the States would be able to regulate, not just prohibit, the sale of these items, provided that the regulation did not discriminate against imports. This proposal also failed in a 15‚Äì14 vote, largely due to Richard O'Connor's opposition. Finally, at the Sydney session (which occurred about five months later), a new variant of the resolution was proposed and accepted. After several drafting amendments, Section 113 took its present form: =O'Connor's concerns= Though most of the Constitution's framers supported the right of individual States to regulate alcohol, some ‚Äì such as Richard O'Connor ‚Äì believed Section 113 to be unnecessary because the States would already have this power despite Section 92. Furthermore, O'Connor was concerned that by the specific inclusion of Section 113 (and Section 112), the police power of the States would be limited to the powers which were specifically enumerated. Because of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Leisy v. Hardin (which found that the Commerce Clause prevented Iowa from restricting the sale of liquor imported from Illinois), the delegates decided that Section 113 would be included as a cautionary measure. The question of whether the Constitution gave States a police power was unresolved at the time the Constitution was ratified. However, it was later resolved by the High Court that the American concept of police power had no application in relation to the Australian Constitution.

The major historic sects of Sikhism, states Harjot Oberoi, have included Udasi, Nirmala, Nanakpanthi, Khalsa, Sahajdhari, Namdhari Kuka, Nirankari and Sarvaria. The early Sikh sects were Udasis founded by Sri Chand ‚Äì the elder son of Guru Nanak, and the Minas Prithi Chand ‚Äì the elder son of Guru Ram Das respectively, in parallel to the official succession of the Sikh Gurus. Later on Ram Rai ‚Äì son of Guru Har Rai formed his own sect at Dehradun and his followers are called Ram Raiyass. Many splintered Sikh communities formed during the period between the death of Guru Har Krishan and the coronation of Guru Tegh Bahadur. These sects have had considerable differences. Various other Sikh sects emerged over the Sikh history. Some of these sects were financially and administratively supported by the Mughal Empire in the hopes of gaining a more favorable and compliant citizenry. In the 19th century, Sanatan Sikhs, Namdharis and Nirankaris sects were formed in Sikhism, seeking to reform and return to what each believed was the pure form of Sikhism. They also accepted the concept of living Gurus such as Guru Baba Dyal Singh. The Nirankari sect though unorthodox was influential in shaping the views of Tat Khalsa and the contemporary era Sikh beliefs and practices.Sects in Sikhism, Encyclopedia BritannicaPage 141, The Culture of India, Kathleen Kuiper, The Rosen Publishing Group Another significant Sikh sect of the 19th century was the Radhasoami movement in Punjab led by Baba Shiv Dyal. Other contemporary era Sikhs sects include the 3HO Sikhism, also referred to as Sikh Dharma Brotherhood formed in 1971. See also Dera (organization), non-Sikh Deras, for more examples of Sikh sects. Early Sikh sects =Udasi= Udasi is an early sect based on the teachings of Sri Chand (1494‚Äì1643), the son of Guru Nanak ‚Äì the founder of Sikhism. The Udasis do not reject the Sikh Gurus, but attach greater importance to the line of succession from Guru Nanak through Sri Chand. Another Sikh tradition links the Udasis to Baba Gurditta, the eldest son of Guru Hargobind. Early Sikh literature suggests that Udasis were already prominent in the 17th-century. They interpret the message of Guru Granth Sahib in Vedantic terms. They do not abide by the Khalsa's Rehat Maryada and dress codes. According to 18th-century descriptions, they either cut or mat their hair, and some smeared ash on their body. Udasis protected many Sikh Gurdwaras in the 18th century, managed them in the 19th century. They built simple shrines far from Punjab. Above: an Udasi shrine in Nepal. Udasis are known for their Akharas along with the Nirmala sect of Sikhism. They accept asceticism and monastic traveler lifestyle. Udasi is derived from the Sanskrit word \\"Udasin\\", it literally means \\"detached, journey\\", and that reflects their approach to spiritual and temporal life. They were key in preserving Sikhism from extinction in the 18th century, after the death of Guru Gobind Singh and during the Mughal persecution. Their help to Sikhism was notable in the decades between the martyrdom of Banda Singh Bahadur in 1716 and the rise of Ranjit Singh and the Sikh Empire. The Udasi ascetic akharas managed Gurdwaras, rebuilt them and preserved the Sikh scriptures. They were respected and patronized by Ranjit Singh through land grants and responsibility of Sikh temples. The Udasis were key interpreters of the Sikh philosophy and the custodians of important Sikh shrines until the Singh Sabha movement. Like missionary Nirmala Sikhs, they also brought a large number of people into the Sikh fold during the 18th and the early 19th centuries. Their religious practices accept images and statues of Sikh Gurus inside temples, as well as Hindu iconography. They greet each other with \\"Om namo Brahmane\\", and they practice Hatha yoga like the Hindus. When the Singh Sabha movement, dominated by Khalsa Sikhs, redefined the Sikh identity in the early 20th century, the Udasi mahants were expelled from the Sikh shrines. During the dispute, the Udasis increasingly regarded themselves as Hindus rather than Sikhs. =Miharvans= The Miharvan sect followed Baba Prithi Chand (1558‚Äì1618), the eldest son of Guru Ram Das after the younger brother Guru Arjan was officially made the next Guru. They were called Minas by the orthodox Sikhs, a derogatory term meaning \\"scoundrels\\". An alternate non-derogatory term for them has been the Miharvan Sikhs, after the son of Prithi Chand. This sect was shunned by orthodox Sikhs, declared by Guru Gobind Singh as one of the five Panj Mel that a Sikh must avoid. They emerged in a period of religious persecution and inner dispute within the Sikh tradition during the 17th-century on the appropriateness of violence and non-violence in the pursuit of religious freedoms and spiritual matters. According to Hardip Syan and Pritam Singh, Miharvans emphasized more of the non-militant approach of Guru Nanak and earlier Gurus in theological pursuits, while the Guru Hargobind followers pursued the \\"miri-piri\\" approach and began militarizing the Sikh tradition to resist the Mughal persecution. The Miharvan-Minas controlled Amritsar and Harmandir Sahib built under Guru Arjan for much of the 17th-century. They are now nearly extinct. =Ramraiyas= Ram Raiyas are a sect of Sikhism who followed Ram Rai, the eldest son of Guru Har Rai. He was sent by his father as an emissary to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi. Aurangzeb objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (Asa ki Var) that stated, \\"the clay from a Musalman's grave is kneaded into potter's lump\\", considering it an insult to Islam. Ram Rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting \\"Musalman\\" with \\"Beiman\\" (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved. The willingness to change a word led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence. Aurangzeb responded by granting Ram Rai a jagir (land grant) in Garhwal region (Uttarakhand). The town later came to be known as Dehradun, after Dehra referring to Ram Rai's shrine. Many Sikhs settled with Ram Rai, they followed Guru Nanak, but orthodox Sikhs have shunned them.Ram Rai, Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab UniversityRƒÅm RƒÅiyƒÅ, Encyclopaedia Britannica They were one of the Panj Mel, the five reprobate groups that orthodox Sikhs are expected to shun with contempt. The other four are the Minas, the Masands, the Dhirmalias, the Sir- gums (those Sikhs who accept Amrit baptism but subsequently cut their hair). =Nanakpanthi= A Nanakpanthi is a follower of the teachings of Guru Nanak, the first guru of Sikhism. The community transcends the boundaries of Sikhism and Hinduism, and was also a reference to the early Sikh community. Most Sindhi Hindu people are Nanakpanthi, and during the 1881 and 1891 censuses, the community could not decide whether to self-identify as Hindu or Sikh.Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River - Alice Albinia In 1911, Shahpur District (Punjab) reported 12,539 Hindus (20% of the total Hindu population) identifying themselves as Nanakpanthi, in addition to 9,016 Sikhs (22% of the total Sikh population).A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, Vol. 1 The institutional focus of Nanakpanthi social life was around a dharamsala, playing the same role before the 20th century as the Gurdwara has played thereafter under Khalsa dominated period. The beliefs and practices of the Nanakpanthis overlapped with those of Sahajdhari and Udasi Sikhs in pre-20th century period, as evidenced by documents dated to that period. In 1891 Census of British India, which was the first to categorize Sikhs into sects, 579,000 people identified themselves as \\"Hindu Nanakpanthi\\" and another 297,000 as \\"Sikh Nanakpanthi\\". The other major Sikh categories were Sikh Kesdhari and Gobind Singhi Sikhs in this census. Contemporary groups =Namdharis= Namdhari Sikh singer and musicians. Namdharis are a sect of Sikhism, also known as Kuka Sikhs. They believe that the line of Sikh Gurus did not end with Guru Gobind Singh because he did not die in Nanded, he escaped and lived in secret. Sects and other groups: Sikhism, Encyclopaedia Britannica This sect claims he nominated Balak Singh to be the 11th Guru, a tradition that was continued through the Namdhari leaders. Their 12th guru was Ram Singh, who moved the sect‚Äôs center to Bhaini Sahib (Ludhiana). They have been strictly vegetarian and a strong opponent of cattle slaughter, and retaliated against Muslims for killing cows in 1872. Their leader Ram Singh was arrested by the British and he was exiled to Rangoon, Myanmar. Dozens of Namdharis were arrested by the British and executed without trial in Ludhiana and Ambala. They consider Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth as equally important, and compositions from the Chandi di Var are a part of their daily Nitnem. Like Hindus, they circumambulate the fire (havan) during their weddings, but they differ in that the hymns are those from the Adi Granth. The Namdharis wear homespun white turbans, which they wrap around their heads (sidhi pagri). They are called Kuka, which means \\"crier, shouter\\", for their ecstatic religious practices during devotional singing. They also meditate, using mala (rosary). Some texts refer to them as Jagiasi or Abhiasi. =Nirankari= The Nirankari movement was founded by Baba Dyal Das, as a Sikh reform movement around the middle of 19th century, in the later part of Ranjit Singh's reign. Nirankari means \\"without form\\", and reflects their belief that God cannot be represented in any form and that true Sikh faith is based on nam simaran. Nirankari have opposed any form of ritualism in Sikhism, emphasizing the need to return to the teachings of their founder Guru Nanak. They were the first sect to demand major changes in how Sikh temples are operated, the Sikh ceremonies. They also disagreed with the orthodox Sikhs on only 10 Gurus and the scripture as the living Guru. Nirankaris believe that human guru to interpret the scripture and guide Sikhs is a necessity. The Nirankari sect diverged into two in 1940s, when Sant Nirankaris emerged as a separate group. They believe that scripture is open and therefore added works of their leaders into the Guru Granth Sahib. This led to increasingly conflicts with the orthodox Sikhs. In late 1970s, Jarnail Singh Bhindranvale repeatedly denounced their practices. In 1978, the orthodox Sikhs and Sant Nirankaris had an armed confrontation in Amritsar which resulted in many deaths. In 1980, the leader of Sant Nirankari tradition, Gurbachan Singh, was assassinated. =Nirmala= Nirmal Akhara procession at Ujjain Simhastha 2016 (Kumbh Mela) Nirmalas are a Sikh tradition of ascetics.Nirmala: Sikhism, Encyclopaedia Britannica According to the traditional beliefs, the Nirmala Sikh tradition was founded by Guru Gobind Singh in late 17th century when he sent five Sikhs to Varanasi to learn Sanskrit and Hindu religious texts. Another tradition states that they originated during the time of Guru Nanak.Nirmala, The Encyclopedia of Sikhism Volume III, Punjabi University, Patiala, pages 236‚Äì237 These beliefs, according to W. H. McLeod, are of doubtful historicity because they are \\"scarcely mentioned\\" in Sikh literature before the 19th-century. The Nirmala Sikhs wear ochre-colored robes (or at least one item) and keep kesh (unshorn hair). They observe the same birth and death rituals as the Hindu ascetics and have an akhara (martial organization) in Haridwar, and a number of deras in Punjab (India). They have been one of the procession participants in Kumbh Melas. They were early missionaries who traveled and spread Sikhism among the masses, thus making an important contribution to the growth of Sikhism. They often served as one of the mahants in Sikh temples (gurdwaras) during the 18th-century. Nirmalas interpret the Sikh literature in Vedantic terms. During the Singh Sabha Movement of late 19th-century and early 20th-century, they were condemned by the Tat Khalsa faction of Sikhs, and cordially supported by the Sanatan Sikhs faction. =Radha Soami= The Radha Soami Satsang derives its name from the gopi Radha and Soami which means Krishna's soul, ideas also found in the Vaishnavism tradition. This movement was started by Shiv Dayal Singh (also known as Soamiji) in 1861. The Radhasoamis, states Mark Juergensmeyer, are considered in Punjab as an offshoot of Sikhism, because the teachings of their founder were based, in part, on those of the founder of Sikhism ‚Äì Guru Nanak and many recite verses from the Adi Granth during their worship. However, they are also different from the Sikhs because they reject the Sikh idea of installing the scripture in the sanctum of their temple, have present-day Gurus beyond the first ten Gurus of the Sikhs, many reject parts or all of the Khalsa Sikh dress code and rituals such as Karah Parshad. The Radhasoamis are a religious fellowship that accepts saints and living gurus from anywhere. The Radhasoami movement started within Sikhism prior to the Singh Sabha Movement when a diversity of ideas were accepted within Sikhism. After the ascendance of the Khalsa Sikhs, the Radhasoamis have continued to follow their traditions instead of falling in line with the reforms enforced by the Khalsa Sikhs. Like the writings of Sikh gurus, Shiv Dayal Singh used the epithet \\"sat nam\\" for the divine. The Radhasoamis do not install the Guru Granth Sahib or any other scriptures in their sanctum, as they consider it ritualistic. Instead, the guru sits in the sanctum with the satsang (group of Sikh faithfuls) and they listen to preachings from the Adi Granth and the living guru, as well as sing hymns together. The Radha Soami are strict vegetarians. They are active in charitable work such as providing free medical services and help to the needy. They do not believe in orthodox Sikh ritual practices such as covering one's head inside the temple or removing shoes, nor do they serve karah prasad (offering) at the end of prayers. =Sanatan Sikhs= Sanatan Sikhs emerged as a significant group of conservative Sikhs who opposed the orthodox Sikhs in their interpretation of Sikhism, particularly during the Singh Sabha Movement. They campaigned for an inclusive interpretation that accepted wide range of beliefs drawn from Hinduism and Islam. Sanatan Sikhs affirmed that they are a tradition within Hinduism, that Sikhs and Hindus are indivisible. They founded the Singh Sabha in 1873, led by Khem Singh Bedi ‚Äì a direct descendant of Guru Nanak, Avtar Singh Vahiria and others. Sanatan Sikhs accept beliefs and practices such as the belief in the teachings of the Vedas and Puranas, Hindu epics and Sufi Pirs. =3HO= The 3HO sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa. They also call themselves the \\"Sikh Dharma movement\\" and \\"Khalsa Dharma movement\\" and are called \\"Gora Sikhs\\" by the mainstream adherents of Sikhism. Their name 3HO, stands for Healthy Happy Holy Organization. This Sikh sect emphasizes meditation and Yoga. The sect started and grew a number of international business brands such as Yogi Tea. 3HO's relations with the orthodox Khalsa are quite mixed. The 3HO sect has a strict rahit, the code of conduct expectation. Split traditions =Ravidassia= The Ravidasi Panth used to be a part of Sikhism. In 2009, the sect left Sikhism and gained recognition as a separate Indian religion. It is based on the teachings of the 14th century Indian guru Ravidas, revered as a satguru. The movement had attracted Dalits (formerly untouchables), and they felt that they were a victim of social discrimination and violence from Khalsa Sikhs. Historically, Ravidassia represented a range of beliefs in the Indian subcontinent, with some devotees of Ravidass counting themselves as Ravidassia Sikhs, but first formed in the early 20th-century in colonial British India.Paramjit Judge (2014), Mapping Social Exclusion in India: Caste, Religion and Borderlands, Cambridge University Press, , pages 179-182 The Ravidassia community began to take on more cohesion following 1947, and the establishment of successful Ravidassia communities in the diaspora. Ravidassias, states Ronki Ram, accept contemporary living sants of Ravidass Deras as Guru whereas the Sikhs do not. In 2009, Sikh radicals violently attacked the living guru, his deputy and followers at a Ravidassia gurdwara (temple) in Vienna.Inflamed passions, Ajoy A Mahaprashasta (2009), Frontline (The Hindu), Volume 26, Issue 12, Quote: \\"The riots were sparked off by an attack on Sant Niranjan Dass, the head of the Jalandhar-based Dera Sachkhand, and his deputy Rama Nand on May 24 at the Shri Guru Ravidass Gurdwara in Vienna where they had gone to attend a religious function. A group of Sikhs armed with firearms and swords attacked them at the gurdwara, injuring both; Rama Nand later died. The Austrian police said the attack that left some 15 others injured ‚Äúhad clearly been planned‚Äù.\\" This assassination attempt injured many and killed the deputy Ramanand Dass. This triggered the Ravidasi Sikhs to leave Sikhism and become an independent religion fully separated from Sikhism. Prior to their break from Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan revered and recited the Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism in Dera Bhallan. However, following their split from mainstream Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan compiled their own holy book based exclusively on Ravidas's teachings, the Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji, and these Dera Bhallan Ravidassia temples now use this book in place of the Guru Granth Sahib.

Caiani assumed the religious name of \\"Maria Margherita of the Sacred Heart\\" in 1902 after she professed into her new congregation that was devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ. Her beatification was celebrated on 23 April 1989. Life Mother House of the order. Maria Anna Rosa Caiani was born to Jacopo Caiani and Luisa Fortini on 2 November 1863 in Florence as the third of five children. Her siblings were all brothers including Gustavo (1868‚Äì1879) and Osea. She was baptized at Bonistallo in the Church of Santa Maria Assunta in Bonistallo. As a child she was called Marianna. Younger brother Gustavo suffered a grave illness for less than a decade after suffering a hip fracture in 1872 and Caiani cared for him until his death at the age of eleven when she was sixteen in 1879. After the death of her brother she decided that - in a humble and charitable spirit - she wanted to care for others who required assistance. Her father died not long after in 1884 and her mother followed less than a decade after this in 1890. After the death of her father she helped her brother Osea in a tobacco shop but the death of her mother following this left her alone since all her brothers had married. It was in her solitude that she realized what her vocation was and found the desire to give herself to God and to others. She had entered the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Maximus of Turin in Campi Bisenzio but grew dissatisfied and left. On 1 November 1891 she visited her sick aunt where she would later meet and become friends with Maria Fiaschi who was her junior of less than a decade. It was in 1893 that Gious√® Menchi recommended Caiani that she go to a Benedictine convent. It was there that she discovered that the cloister was not the life for her and so she left. It was around this time that she met Bishop Pio Alberto del Corona who encouraged her work. She opened a home with Fiaschi on 19 September 1894 that took in twelve children with the permission of the Bishop of Pistoia Marcello Mazzanti. In her hometown she founded her order on 15 December 1902 and named it the Minim Sisters of the Sacred Heart where she took a new religious name and progressed with five other new recruits. Bishop Mazzanti gave his permission for Caiani to establish her new congregation. In 1910 she sought the guidance of Elena Guerra so that she could take an example for her work for her congregation. She also had a private audience with the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Andrea Carlo Ferrari who also encouraged her to continue the work of her congregation. With the establishment of her order she was made the Superior General and in the first general chapter in 1915 she was retained in her post. She died on 8 August 1921 in Florence. After her death she left a total of 124 religious branches and 13 houses of the congregation. At present it has expanded to places such as Israel and Sri Lanka. Pope Pius XI approved her new congregation in 1926. Beatification The beatification process commenced in both Florence and Pistoia and first started in Florence in a diocesan process that commenced on 8 August 1952 and concluded on 13 November 1957. The opening of the cause in 1952 allowed for her to be conferred the title Servant of God. However the formal introduction of the cause came on 15 December 1981 which solidified the use of the title Servant of God. The second process in Pistoia opened not long after and concluded prior to the validation of the two processes in 1985. This allowed for the postulation to submit the Positio to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1985 for further evaluation of her life and virtues. On 5 June 1986 she was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope John Paul II recognized that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated in a diocesan process in Lucca and was validated on 7 March 1986. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints evaluated the miracle and received the approval of the pope. John Paul II beatified her on 23 April 1989. The postulator assigned to the cause is the Franciscan Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Death Walter Devereux of Bodenham and Bromwich probably died in rebellion at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265. His son, Walter Devereux the Younger made claim against Roger Mortimer and Maud his wife for 2 carucates of land in the village of Bodenham, 1 carucate in the village of Maund, and 1 carucate in the village of Wellbrook that they withheld by reason of war and because he was underage. He demonstrated that he was of full age, and was granted his lands according to the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth. Walter Devereux the younger In 1275 there is a description in the fine rolls of an accusation by Richard de London against a group of men for beating, ill-treating and imprisoning him at Thirlegh (Tirley). He claimed 20 pounds as damages. He identified his assailants as Philip de Arcy, John Devereus,Richard St. George, William Dugdale, and Henry Grazebrook.

Around this time the Marnhams granted to Robert de Grete a portion of ‚Äòhey‚Äô in Bromwich that had previously been held by William de Wavere.

Pages 486-498 Walter Devereux the Younger came before the Justices on 6 January 1293 to demonstrate his right (Quo Warranto) to hold Bromwich. The first matter had a jury upholding the younger Walter Devereux ‚Äòs rights to common pasture in West Bromwich by inheritance from his mother, Sarah (de Offini) Devereux, who had inherited this from her grandfather, Richard de Offini. Walter Devereux the Younger‚Äôs aunt, Margaret (de Offini) de Marnham‚Äôs rights were also upheld on the same grounds. The court additionly upheld their shared rights to have free warren, fair market, and gallows for the manor of Bromwich. The right of ways was deferred to be heard before the king.In 1301, a Walter Devereux filed suit against Osbert and Margaret de Tamworth of West Bromwich, Richard le Parker, Richard de Wygemere, Ralph Swyft, Henry Dun, and William del Hull for cutting down his trees at West Bromwich. The next year Walter having not prosecuted his writ of novel disseisin against de Tamworth and his wife respecting his tenements in West Bromwich, was placed at the mercy of the court, but his fine was remitted at the instance of Edmund de Mortimer.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, Volume 7, Part 2.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 July 2008.  History  Eimeo Hotel, circa 1935 The avenue of mango trees at Eimeo, north of Mackay, was established probably in the 1880s by Jeremiah Downs Armitage, owner of the beachside Eimeo hotel/boarding house, to delineate the track leading from the main road through his property to the hotel. The Pioneer River district was taken up for pastoral and agricultural purposes from 1860. In 1862 a settlement was established on the south bank of the river; in 1863 this was surveyed as the township of Mackay, the first sale of town lots was held, Mackay was gazetted as a port of entry, and a customs house was opened. The town prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre, drawing business from nearby pastoral holdings and the sugar plantations being developed along the river from the late 1860s. In the 1880s the population expanded as the Queensland economy enjoyed a boom and government settlement programs attracted agricultural immigrants to the colony. The Pioneer River sugar industry was flourishing and Mackay was emerging as an important regional centre. Jeremiah Armitage came to Mackay in the early 1870s, and took up a selection with ocean frontages, about north of Mackay, which he named after the island of Eimeo (Moorea) near Tahiti in the Society Islands. The land was selected in the name of Nancy Armitage (spinster), who gained a deed of grant to the property in 1876. Following her marriage in 1881, title was transferred early in 1882 to Jeremiah Downs Armitage. In 1874 he was recorded as a Mackay timber merchant, but had turned his attention to fruit growing by the 1880s. To supplement his income as a fruit grower, Armitage developed Eimeo as one of the Mackay district's first tourist destinations. In April 1880 he opened a newly completed boarding house on a promontory overlooking the sea on three sides (later known as Eimeo Hill). The house sat in a garden stocked with fruit trees, and visitors were invited to enjoy \\"sea bathing, yachting, fishing and shooting\\". He may have licensed this building for a short period, as he held a publican's license for the Eimeo Hotel, Eimeo, in 1889-1890. Armitage is believed to have planted an avenue of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) and another of mango trees (Mangifera indica) along the track through his property leading to the boarding house/hotel. The mango is a large tree indigenous to India and South East Asia. As well as producing an edible fruit, the mango is an excellent shade tree. Walter Hill, first superintendent of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, is credited with its introduction to Queensland and it was cultivated widely in North Queensland by early settlers, as a specimen tree in botanic gardens, as a household fruit tree, and as a shade tree along streets and in public parks. From January 1885 Jeremiah Armitage, fruit grower, conducted the first postal receiving office at Eimeo. By 1891 this duty had been transferred to Mrs Kemp of the Sea View Hotel. Contemporaneously with Armitage's license for the Eimeo Hotel, William George Kemp held a license for the Seaview (or Sea View) Hotel at Eimeo from 1887 to 1894. This was transferred to Mrs ER Kemp in 1894, then to WJ Clemments (or Clements) in 1895 and to PA Christiansen in 1896. Seaview Beach (now Bucasia) was located just west/north-west of Eimeo Hill. Kemp Street at Bucasia commemorates Mr and Mrs Kemp, early licensees of the Seaview Hotel. On 21 August 1890 Armitage advertised Eimeo for sale. The property then consisted of , the Beach Hotel, a large residence and numerous fruit trees. No license for the Beach Hotel has been identified. The hotel did not sell at this time. In October 1890 J Armitage was appointed Superintendent of Coconut Planting by the Queensland government, to plant and manage coconut palms on coastal islands for the use of shipwrecked sailors. He appears to have held this position for a short period only, someone else being appointed to the position in July 1892. Armitage was declared insolvent in 1893, at which time his Eimeo property passed to his mortgagor, the Queensland National Bank, which leased the whole of the land to Robert Bridgman from 1895. Bridgman conducted the boarding house at Eimeo. Armitage retained some connection with the area, being listed as an apiarist at Eimeo in the 1900 Queensland Post Office Directory. He died in Brisbane in 1919. In 1905, George Francis Bridgman obtained title to the property, which was transferred in 1913 to Mackay publican Martin Hassett, and in 1915 to another Mackay hotelkeeper, William Thomas Eyles. From at least Eyles' occupation, the business was known as the Eimeo Hotel. In November 1919 title to the whole of the property was transferred to Charles Louis Albert Brown, who carried out the first subdivision of the property in 1920, creating a number of beachfront residential allotments. In the mid-1920s the track leading to the Eimeo Hotel at the northern end of the property was surveyed as a public lane, which became known as Mango Avenue. In 1923 the bulk of the property, including the Eimeo Hotel, was transferred to Arthur James Wallis Mowlam, then to James Amstead in 1926. Their names are perpetuated in nearby streets. As the use of motor vehicles expanded in Queensland from the 1920s, Eimeo beach and the Eimeo Hotel, easily accessed from Mackay by road, gained in popularity with both local residents and tourists as recreation venues. The Queensland Government Intelligence and Tourist Bureau's 1929 publication The Mackay District, North Queensland (2nd edition pp29, 31) confirms this popularity and suggests that the Mango Avenue trees were well established by the late 1920s: > \\"In close proximity to Mackay are many splendid beaches. Some of them are > beautifully situated, surrounded by coconut palms, and reached through > avenues of mango trees. The two most popular seaside resorts are Eimeo and > Slade Point. Both of these are within easy motoring distance. Eimeo is about > 9 miles north-west of Mackay, and can easily be reached by motor-car in half > an hour. The drive to Eimeo is interesting all the way. At Eimeo there is a > comfortable hotel, where every attention is paid to visitors. The hotel is > situated on a beautiful headland, and commands charming views on all sides. > The grounds of the hotel are extensive and well laid out with many varieties > of fruit trees, while the approach thereto is laid out with stately coconut > palms. Excellent shooting and fishing may be enjoyed here, and a motor-boat > is available for conveying parties around one or other of the beautiful bays > in this vicinity.\\" In late 1932 title to the hotel site, on a reduced parcel of just under , was transferred to Mrs Lavinia Walters, who demolished the building and constructed a new Eimeo Hotel in 1934, using some of the materials from the demolition. She purchased an old Anglican parish hall and moved it to the site to form an annex, and built an open-air dance floor and skating rink on the property. She is credited with being instrumental in having a bitumen road built between Eimeo and Mackay in 1938. In the early 1940s, during World War II, the Eimeo Hotel was occupied by American servicemen on rest and recreation leave from New Guinea. The present Pacific Hotel on the site dates from 1954. The coconut palms were removed in the 1990s, but the mango trees along Mango Avenue, between Whittles Lane and Heidke Street, survive and remain a tourist attraction.  Description  Mango Avenue is characterised by an avenue of mature mango trees (Mangifera indica) extending approximately along the road reserve, between Whittles Lane and Heidke Street, heralding the approach to the Pacific Hotel that sits atop a prominent headland (formerly the site of the Eimeo Hotel). The trees are large mature trees of about tall. There are 16 trees on the western side of the road reserve and 18 on the eastern side, with a large Hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) adjacent to the northernmost tree on the eastern side of the avenue. The canopies of the trees meet, forming a well-shaded tunnel along the road as well as overhanging adjacent properties, despite the spacing of the trunks being sometimes irregular. The trees commonly have evidence of severed lower branches and some sport street numbers for adjacent house blocks. The road is a narrow strip of bitumen running roughly north-south. There is no curbing and little formal delineation of adjacent property entrances or boundaries on the east side. A concrete pathway exists along the western side of the road reserve, west of the trees. Property entrances on both sides of the roadway are simply sporadic gaps between the tree trunks.  Heritage listing  Mango Avenue was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 July 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The s mango trees along Mango Avenue at Eimeo provide important tangible evidence of an early phase of North Queensland tourism, little of which survives in built form. It is associated with the 1880 establishment of one of the Mackay district's first seaside resorts, the Eimeo boarding house/hotel, during a period of strong economic growth in the region. They are important also in illustrating the use of the mango as a shade tree and for street beautification in tropical Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Once constituting the private entrance to the Eimeo boarding house/hotel, this avenue of Mangifera indica, now over 120 years old, remains an excellent example of a grand-entrance avenue of trees in a coastal setting. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As an approach avenue of substantial shade trees that leads to a site closely linked to the recreational history of Mackay, the place has long been appreciated for its aesthetic significance. The dramatic tunnel effect of driving through the shady avenue when approaching or leaving the Pacific Hotel (formerly the site of the Eimeo Hotel) generates an aesthetic response known to have been enjoyed by visitors since at least the 1920s, and likely much earlier.

In September, with the establishment of a common DoD-wide aircraft designation system, the A3J-1 was redesignated as the A-5A Vigilante. In October, this short cruise was extended beyond its originally-scheduled duration due to the Cuban Missile Crisis, with VAH-7 remaining embarked aboard Enterprise as the carrier steamed as a show of force in Caribbean waters near Cuba. From 6 February 1963 to 4 September 1963, VAH-7 completed a full deployment to the Mediterranean with the A-5A while embarked aboard Enterprise in support of the U.S. Sixth Fleet. The following year, following only a five month turnaround period at Naval Air Station Sanford, VAH-7 deployed again aboard Enterprise, this time from 8 February to 3 October 1964 as part of Operation Sea Orbit, a round-the-world cruise by Task Force 1, a nuclear-powered task force consisting of Enterprise, the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser , and the nuclear-powered guided missile destroyer leader .http://www.gonavy.jp/navy/sqn/VAH07.html As the submarine-launched ballistic missile became the primary Navy strategic nuclear deterrent, the Navy concluded that it no longer needed carrier-based strategic bombers and that Naval Aviation's strike arm would remain strictly a tactical force. Having been designed as a supersonic nuclear strike bomber, aircraft such as the A-5A no longer had a mission, and in 1963 the Navy decided to halt any further procurement of the A-5A and the follow-on A-5B. However, in lieu of prematurely retiring the Vigilante, it was deemed that it would be reconfigured as a dedicated multi-sensor reconnaissance platform under the designation RA-5C. Following its return from Operation Sea Orbit, the squadron commenced transitioning to the RA-5C and the Peacemakers were redesignated as RVAH-7 on 1 December 1964. =RVAH-7 / Vietnam=26 October 1965 ‚Äì 20 June 1966, RVAH-7 embarked aboard for a Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and Vietnam deployment. On 16 December 1965, RA-5C BuNo 151633 was lost in combat; both crewmen ejected and were rescued. *19 November 1966 ‚Äì 6 July 1967, RVAH-7 embarked aboard USS Enterprise for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. On 12 February 1967, RA-5C BuNo 151623 was lost in combat; both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. Budgetary pressures of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Sanford. Following their 1967 deployment and prior to their 1969 deployment, RVAH-7 shifts home stations from NAS Sanford to the former Turner Air Force Base, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia. *11 August 1969 ‚Äì 8 May 1970, RVAH-7 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. *17 February ‚Äì 28 November 1972, RVAH-7 embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. On 7 May 1972, RA-5C BuNo 151618 was lost in combat. Both crewmen, the pilot and RVAH-7 Executive Officer, Commander C. R. \\"Ron\\" Polfer,http://veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=1387 and the reconnaissance attack navigator, Lieutenant (junior grade) Joe Kernan,http://veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=1059 successfully ejected and were captured as POWs by the North Vietnamese. Both were repatriated to the United States on 28 March 1973. =RVAH-7 / Cold War=23 November 1973 ‚Äì 9 July 1974, RVAH-7 embarked aboard USS Kitty Hawk for a WESTPAC deployment. Budgetary pressures following the end of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to again close several stateside air bases, to include Naval Air Station Albany. In late 1974, RVAH-1 shifts home stations from NAS Albany to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida. *5 March - 22 September 1975, RVAH-7 embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *25 October 1977 - 15 May 1978, RVAH-7 embarked aboard USS Kitty Hawk for a WESTPAC deployment. This would be the last deployment of the RA-5C aboard Kitty Hawk. *21 February - 22 September 1979, RVAH-7 embarked aboard . This would be the final overseas deployment for RVAH-7 and the final overseas deployment for the RA-5C. At the conclusion of RVAH-7's last deployment, the last catapult launch of an RA-5C took place aboard USS Ranger off the coast of California on 21 September 1979, with the aircraft, NE611, BUNO 156615, returning with two others to their home station of Naval Air Station Key West.http://www.rvahnavy.com/5history.html Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. RVAH-7 was the last Fleet RVAH squadron to operate the RA-5C and the last to deploy with it overseas. With the retirement of the RA-5C, carrier-based reconnaissance was conducted by the active duty VFP community at Naval Air Station Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community at Andrews AFB / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader until 29 March 1987, when the last RF-8G was retired and the carrier-based reconnaissance mission was fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve VF community at NAS Miramar, Naval Air Station Oceana, Naval Air Station Dallas and NAS JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with the F-14 Tomcat equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS). Following its return from its final Western Pacific deployment in late 1979, RVAH-7 was disestablished as the last remaining Fleet RVAH squadron at Naval Air Station Key West on 28 September 1979 following nearly 29 years of active service. Upon disestablishment, the RVAH 7 remaining squadron members prepared the last three RA-5C Vigilantes for their final flight. One of the aircraft was flown to Naval Air Station Millington, Tennessee to be set on a pedestal for static display outside the gate of the Air Station. The two remaining aircraft were flown to Naval Air Station China Lake to be used as targets at the China Lake weapons ranges. After nearly 30 years of sitting in the desert, NE611, BUNO 156615 was discovered relatively intact and completely restored in 2012 by the Castle Air Museum restoration team. It is now on display at the Castle Air Museum in Atwater, California.

SGR was developed in the Arup Hong Kong office and is derived from design practice, observations and collective research on East Asia‚Äôs energetic urbanisation and is now regarded as a key component of Hong Kong's city strategy. The SGR planning approach is based on observations of East Asia‚Äôs rapid urbanisation processes that have left many cities and landscapes in the region vulnerable to climate change, environmental degradation and socioeconomic fluctuations. The approach espouses the holistic resolution of critical issues pertinent to contemporary cities with an equal focus on the organization of urban systems and their management as well as physical design (including infrastructure and buildings.) According to recent public discussions on the merits of SGR,YEUNG, Theresa.

Presentation entitled ‚ÄúA Smart Green Resilient Aerotropolis‚Äù, International Summit Conference on the Development of Aerotropolis, Taipei, Taiwan, April 2014. the combined use of the terms ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and ‚Äúresilient‚Äù is derived from the proliferation of similar terminologies in current urban practice aiming to guide the transformation of urban environments into ‚ÄúSmart Cities‚Äù, ‚ÄúResilient Cities‚Äù or combinations thereof. However, SGR does not aim to replace other planning approaches but instead is considered necessary to coordinate the often multidisciplinary nature of collaborative city-building and to maximize benefits to urban residents, businesses and governments.Lau, Wilfred; Lecture entitled ‚ÄúTowards Smart Green Resilient Cities‚Äù (See the link for the video clip of presentation on Youtube or from Arup's official website for full version), Hong Kong Polytechnic University, October 2015.  History  The key ideas behind SGR were initially conceived in 2008 and formally consolidated in January 2014. The phrase ‚ÄúSmart Green Resilient‚Äù (or ‚ÄúSGR‚Äù) first appears in this form to describe the holistic planning approach employed to advise the government of Taoyuan on the strategic master plan for North Taiwan‚Äôs Taoyuan Aerotropolis. Since then SGR has been the subject of lectures, presentations and research papers outlining the concerns as well as the solutions and direction that urban planning should adopt.Chong, Bruce et al. ‚ÄúFrom Smart to Smart-Green-Resilient City planning‚Äù (Âæû‚ÄúÊô∫ÊÖß‚ÄùÂà∞‚ÄúÊô∫ÊÖß-Á∂†Ëâ≤-ÈüåÊÄß), Annual China Urban Planning Conference, Hai Kou, Hainan, 2014, http://www.planning.org.cn/thesis/view?id=7697 Published in 2015, the book entitled Smart Green Resilient, traces the development of the concept since 2008 beginning with the Ninh Thuan Integrated Development Plan and followed by the planning study for Hong Kong‚Äôs Lok Ma Chau Loop based on smart city and sustainable development principles. The book summarises the growth of environmental awareness and the different ways cities and planners have responded to these escalating challenges over the recent past. The book also outlines some of the main elements that characterise the SGR approach, various applications in project work and sources of inspiration from global geographies. As of 2016-2017, the phrase ‚ÄúSmart Green and Resilient‚Äù has been adopted by Hong Kong‚Äôs Planning Department and Development Bureau to describe the 2030+ planning vision for the city. Reference to Smart Green Resilient is also made in relation to the New Territories North development in Hong Kong, where the approach is intended to enable \\"a low-carbon environment equipped with smart city infrastructure and technology.\\"  Themes  The SGR planning approach is characterized by various themes that range from identification of critical urban issues to their collaborative resolution, usually by large multidisciplinary groups that can include engineers, residents, economists, city administrators, environmentalists etc. = Current Planning Solutions = A key thesis of SGR involves the limitations inherent in current planning approaches including Smart City, Resilient City, Ubiquitous City, Wise City etc. While there are merits in each of these directions, none of them present a holistic design system that takes into consideration the complexity of urban networks and their social, economic and cultural dimensions. This lays the groundwork for an alternative approach to urban planning that can shed light into wider issues and incorporate comprehensive solutions that are intended to multiply the benefits for city residents. In the SGR approach for example, the term ‚Äúresilience‚Äù is not limited to climate adaptation but equally embraces the adaptability of physical infrastructure as well as economic and social resilience. = Cognitive Prism = SGR is not intended to present a prescriptive methodology for urban planning. In contrast to many urban planning approaches, SGR seeks to reveal the relationships between critical issues by interrogating already identified concerns through different lenses. As such SGR is described as a ‚Äúcognitive prism‚Äù through which ‚Äúurban planners can gain a holistic view of the challenges they need to address.‚Äù = Three Elements of SGR = Three important elements characterize the SGR planning approach. * People Oriented that advocates designing for end users, the need to broaden stakeholder engagement, formulate broad alliances with concerned parties and realize community benefits; * Contemporary Relevance espousing the importance of addressing current issues through the use of a composite systems approach that can lay the foundation for a structured long-term implementation as well as revealing territorial relationships; * Future Proofing that supports capacity-building, the utilization of appropriate technology and scenario-testing to secure plans have adequate built-in flexibility to adapt under various conditions.  See also  Over the recent past, researchers, industrial practitioners, bloggers, and interested groups have also promulgated their thoughts around concepts that utilize the terms ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and ‚Äúresilient‚Äù by combining ‚ÄúS‚Äù, ‚ÄúG‚Äù and ‚ÄúR‚Äù into ‚ÄúSG‚Äù, ‚ÄúSR‚Äù or GR‚Äù. These do not form part of the SGR planning approach.

It has also been described as the only Allium species endemic to the Southern Hemisphere, though some descriptions of the genus also include Allium juncifolium (Chile) and Allium sellovianum (Brazil), which are much less studied than Allium dregeanum. The distribution of Allium dregeanum extends from the summer-rainfall region, into the winter-rainfall zone of South Africa. Since Allium species are almost exclusively found in the Northern Hemisphere, with major centers of diversity in Central Asia and western North America, the biogeographical history of Allium dregeanum is of interest. Though some theories have been put forward, no explanation for the geographic isolation of Allium dregeanum has been confirmed. In 1976, De Wilde-Dufyes proposed that Allium dregeanum is a modification of the European species Allium ampeloprasum, and may have been brought to South Africa by early European settlers. De Saarker et al. contradicted this theory in 1997, when they explored genetic similarities between Allium dregeanum and Allium ampeloprasum, and did not find evidence of a significant genetic relationship. They also point to evidence that Allium dregeanum was already established in South Africa in the mid-17th century, when the first Dutch settlers colonized South Africa, but do not suggest other explanations for Allium dregeanum's isolation. Allium dregeanum occurs at elevations of 100-1000m, and flowers in spring and early summer (October to December). It can grow to 0.6m by 0.2m, growing best in well-drained soils in sunny areas. Allium dregeanum is also notable for its high chromosome counts: polyploidy is not uncommon in Allium, with 14% of representative Allium species exhibiting more than two sets of chromosomes, but Allium dregeanum has particularly high ploidy levels, and can be octoploid or decaploid.

The church is situated in Ramkote locality of the twin cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad and 24 km away from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Shamshabad. For Church administrative purposes, it falls under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak and caters to a diverse Tamil-speaking congregation of about 500 members. The church was consecrated and dedicated in 1869, and is the oldest Tamil Church in Hyderabad. History =Foundation= Prior to 1869, Tamil-speaking Christians from the Hyderabad area travelled all the way to St. Thomas's church in Secunderabad with their families in bullock-carts to worship in Tamil, which proved to be a hardship and inconvenience. In 1867, the Nizams' Government, with Prime Minister Sir Salar Jung, donated a small parcel of land with sufficient donations to construct a church. The foundation stone was laid by the wife of Major General Grant, commanding subsidiary forces of Secunderabad in 1867 after an impressive address by Sir Richard Temple. In two years' time, Christ Church was constructed, and dedicated in 1869 on Christmas Eve by the Rt. Rev. Frederic Gell, Bishop of Madras Diocese. =Inauguration of the diocese= On 3 October 1947, the churches in South India united to form the \\"Church of South India (CSI) Medak Diocese\\". The Rev. Whittaker, chairman of Wesley Church Hyderabad, was consecrated as the first Bishop of the diocese, and in 1950 he ordained Rev. G. D. Samuel to minister to the Christ Church congregation. Since 1947, eight Bishops have contributed to the edification of the church and its activities. =1970 centenary celebration= In commemoration of the church's 100-year history (1869‚Äì1969) in Hyderabad, the church building was enlarged. Construction was made possible by contributions from church members and a loan from the Diocese. =Christ Church High School= On 15 June 1979, Christ Church School, located inside the church compound, was inaugurated by founding members Rev. D. Justus Moni (first Manager and Correspondent), Mrs. Enid. David, the late Prof. A. P. Rajaratnam, the late Mr. George Michael, the late Mr. W.A. Deva Das, the late Mr. C. John Rose and the late Mrs. Victoria Robert, Rev. S. M. Jothi Raj (Manager and Correspondent [1984‚Äì1987]), and Rev. A. Bennet(Manager and Correspondent [2003 ‚Äì July 2014]). When inaugurated, the school served 8 students. Now the school has attained high school status, and has grown to accommodate 500 children. 100% results have been reported in SSC in the last few years. The Rev. S. Sathia Joseph has served as Manager and Correspondent since July 2014, and Mrs. Shirley Solomon, the present Head Mistress, now leads a staff of 15 teachers and 5 support staff. =Post-Centenary silver jubilee celebration (1869‚Äì1994)= This celebration was inaugurated on 2 October 1994 by Bishop B. P. Sugandhar at the confirmation service, and began with various construction projects such as the extension of the wings of the church, repairing of the roof, addition of a choir vestry, etc. Special meetings with Dr. Ken Gnanakan were held on 26 and 27 November 1994. =Clergy= Nearly 29 clergy have served Christ Church since 1880: *1880‚Äì1887, Rev.

Early life and education Lomnitz was born to a Jewish family in Cologne, Germany.Cinna Lomnitz Aronsfrau profile, 100.unam.mx; accessed 11 July 2016. He graduated as engineer from the University of Chile in 1948. He then studied with Karl von Terzaghi in Harvard University and obtained a Master's degree in soil mechanics. Lomnitz received his doctorate from Caltech in 1955 with a dissertation on creep measurements in igneous rocks. Its principal thesis, a logarithmic creep behavior observed in rocks, was reformulated as the \\"Lomnitz Law\\" by Harold Jeffreys in 1958. The Lomnitz law is expressed as,\\\\varepsilon\\\\left(t\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{E_{0}}\\\\left[1+q\\\\ln\\\\left(1+at\\\\right)\\\\right],\\\\text{ }t\\\\geq0, where, \\\\varepsilon(t) is the time-varying creep (or, strain), \\\\sigma is the constant stress load on the material, E_{0} is the shear modulus, a is a positive material constant, and q is the creep constant. Though the Lomnitz law was inferred empirically from rheological measurements on rocks, its validity was firmly established by Pandey and Holm by deriving it from the physical principles in the framework of fractional calculus. They had used a time-varying Maxwell model in their analysis and found that the underlying physical mechanism in rocks that led to the Lomnitz law was a linearly time- varying viscosity, \\\\eta\\\\left(t\\\\right), \\\\eta\\\\left(t\\\\right)=\\\\eta_{0}+\\\\theta t, where \\\\eta_{0} is the constant part of the viscosity and \\\\theta t is the time- varying part of the viscosity, such that \\\\theta=d\\\\eta(t)/dt > 0. Such a property with increasing viscosity with time corresponds to rheopecty, or anti-thixotropy, a special class of Non-Newtonian fluid. Pandey and Holm extracted the physical interpretation of the parameters of the Lomnitz law as follows:q=\\\\frac{E_{0}}{\\\\theta}\\\\text{ and } a=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau}=\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\eta_{0}}where, \\\\tau is the relaxation time during which the transition from the elastic- to creep-type deformation occurs. The mechanism underlying the Lomnitz law is that the time-varying part increases linearly with time and dominates over the constant part, \\\\theta t \\\\gg \\\\eta_{0}. Further, since q \\\\ll 1, for igneous rocks this implies the time- varying part of the viscosity dominates over the elasticity of the rocks, i.e., \\\\theta \\\\gg E_{0}. Interestingly, the relaxation modulus of the time- varying Maxwell model was identified as the Nutting law from rheology. This physical justification has been lacking in both Nutting‚Äôs law and Lomnitz‚Äôs law since their inception in 1921 and 1956 respectively. As a result of these findings a useful physical interpretation of the fractional dashpot and hence the fractional derivatives was obtained. Career Lomnitz was the founding director of the Instituto de Geof√≠sica at the Universidad de Chile. He then taught at the University of California-Berkeley between 1964 and 1968, and moved to the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico's Instituto de Geof√≠sica in 1968, where he worked for the rest of his life. He founded Mexico's first seismic network, RESMAC, in 1971, and became editor of the journal Geof√≠sica Internacional in 1990. Lomnitz authored a number of books, notably Global Tectonics and Earthquake Risk (Elsevier, 1974). Personal life He married the social anthropologist, Larissa Adler Lomnitz, and they were the parents of Jorge Lomnitz (1954-1993), Claudio Lomnitz, Alberto Lomnitz and Tania Lomnitz. Cinna Lomnitz died in Mexico City in 2016 at the age of 91.

It was built in 1904. It is also known as Hatton railway station and Pelion railway station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 December 2004.  History  Group of people on the platform of the Finch Hatton railway station, circa 1906 The Finch Hatton railway station opened on 21 September 1904. The station formed part of the Pioneer Valley Line of the Mackay Railway, the first stage of which opened on 10 August 1885 terminating at Mirani. In search of new pastoral land, John Mackay and his party entered and named the valley of the Mackay River in 1860 (renamed Pioneer River in 1862), and the following year he returned to establish a cattle station. Other settlers quickly followed. In 1862, the ketch \\"Presto\\" entered the Mackay River landing stores and building materials, then surveyed the river mouth, which consequently was gazetted as a Port of Entry. In the earliest years of non-Indigenous settlement of the Pioneer Valley, the area was leased as two cattle runs, Hamilton and Hopetoun. They were worked as one property with the head station at Hamilton, across the Pioneer River from the township now known as Mirani. Prior to the opening of the railway station in 1885, the town of Mirani was known as Hamilton, after one of the cattle properties, but was changed so that no confusion could arise between it and the suburb of Hamilton in Brisbane. Sugar cane is a bulky crop that transports well, but it needs to be processed quickly once harvested. In the 19th century, the only transport method that answered these requirements was the railway. Every sugar district developed a network of tramways and railways, provided by a combination of the sugar mills, local government and the Queensland Government. The first sugar mill in the district, John Ewen Davidson's, Alexandra was established in 1868. Agitation for a local rail network began in the late 1870s. The principal advocates were the independent cane growers who were forced to send their cane to the nearest plantation mill to be crushed. A government-operated rail network was a means of overcoming that dependence and allowing growers to choose which mill crushed their cane. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company had introduced the two feet gauge steam tramway to the Queensland canefields when it built three large sugar mills simultaneously, at Homebush south-west of Mackay, at Victoria on the Herbert River and at Goondi on the Johnstone River. Homebush Mill opened in 1883. Approval for the Pioneer Valley line was granted by the Parliament in October 1882. Mackay was growing in name as the centre of a prosperous sugar district, and, due to the input on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, already had private steam tramways. In 1880 John Spiller built a five kilometre line on his River Estate plantation and worked it with a locally built vertical boiler engine. The following year he built a similar line on his Pioneer plantation, both on the north side of the river. A railway route was surveyed west from Mackay parallel to the south bank of the river to a point opposite Hamilton (later Mirani) railway station and construction began in late 1883. The contract was awarded to George Bashford & Co in late 1883. Nearly 2000 people assembled to watch the Queensland Governor, Anthony Musgrave, ceremonially turn the first sod on his first visit to Mackay even though work had been underway for a month. The first stage from Mackay to Mirani was opened on 10 August 1885. A branch line commencing at Newbury Junction, west of Mackay, ran south towards Eton, the only other settlement of note in the district apart from Mackay and Walkerston. In 1885, with the Mackay Railway terminating at Mirani, the town was the limit of closer settlement. Throughout the 1890s the government received requests for the Pioneer Valley line to be extended to open up more land for cane, particularly the extensive area of land that lay between Mirani and the Eungella Ranges. Selectors began to farm the fertile areas further west of Mirani within the vicinity of McGregor's Creek; however the unbridged Pioneer River was an impediment to further expansion. A short extension of the line was finally made over the Pioneer River at Mirani in 1897 to give growers access to rail transport. Expenditure for the bridge of five, long steel spans on high concrete piers was approved and contract let to A Overend & Co, in August 1896. The two kilometres of track to Mirani West officially opened on 11 December 1897. Plans for major extension of the Pioneer Railway line were tabled before Parliament on 30 November 1900. The extension further west to Pinnacle, opened on 7 July 1902. This was the first line completed under the new day labour system. The Pioneer Valley line was instrumental in the expansion of the sugar industry, significantly increasing the amount of land that could be cultivated for sugar on an economically viable basis, as well as being a critical factor in the development of a central mill system, providing an alternate transport system to shipping, thus enabling cane plantations to be located away from major waterways. Whilst the Pioneer Valley line was extended to Pinnacle by 1902, good quality agricultural land lay for many kilometres beyond the railway terminus. Around the same time as the extension of the Pioneer Valley line, the Racecourse Central Sugar Company had embarked upon an extension program of developing cane growing in the Upper Pioneer Valley. The Sugar Company, together with the Pioneer Shire Council and the selectors in the area combined to turn what was previously a sparsely settled area into a productive sugar district. Playing a key role in furthering the area cultivated for sugar was the extension of the railway line through to Finch Hatton. Almost immediately after the railway line was extended to Pinnacle, the government was lobbied to extend the line further. The government, however, had other priorities, resulting in the Pioneer Shire Council deciding to construct the next stage to Finch Hatton, as well as a branch line from Pinnacle along McGregor's Creek. The railway from Pinnacle to Finch Hatton opened on 21 September 1904. Finch Hatton now became the terminus for the Pioneer Valley line and this was the trigger for closer settlement within the area and gave rise to the establishment of the township. In September 1904, the Mackay Chronicle reported that Hatton (as Finch Hatton was then known) was beginning to assume a business air with the residences of Messrs Peoples and Zahmel within sight of the terminus. A hotel, run by a Mr Waters, had also been constructed. The extension of the railway line to Finch Hatton was a catalyst for the opening up of further land for sugar cane with the opening of the Cattle Creek mill, south-east of Finch Hatton in 1906. In 1906, Hatton was renamed Pelion, however a few months later the name was changed to Finch Hatton. The government took over responsibility of the Pinnacle-Finch Hatton section of the railway line from 1 July 1910 and quickly constructed the extension west to Netherdale (this station was also known as the Eungella Range). By 1914, tourists began to access the Eungella Range area by travelling to Netherdale by rail and walking up the newly improved road to Eungella. Finch Hatton station had a station master in charge, attending to the substantial traffic to and from the adjacent Cattle Creek mill which had its own private siding. The Station Master, Edward Crow, was promoted in mid-1915, and the local newspaper correspondent mentioned the long hours at the station. There was also a Night Officer so that the station was manned two shifts. In 1913, Queensland Railways published a brochure titled \\"Tours in the Mackay District \\"which highlighted the natural beauty of the region especially that of the Eungella Ranges. By the 1920s, Finch Hatton had become the largest township in the area outside of Mackay and Sarina. In 1932, a special committee was set up, comprising the representatives of the departments of Land, Forestry and Agriculture and the Director of the Mackay Butter Factory to investigate the settlement, forestry and scenic potential of the Eungella area. The outcome of that investigation was that the area of \\"primeval\\" jungle should be preserved. In 1941, acknowledgement of the importance of the Eungella area led to the gazettal of Eungella National Park. The Mackay Railway, from Kowari to Netherdale (west of Finch Hatton) officially closed on 19 December 1977 after being damaged by flooding. The section of the Mackay Railway between Marian and Finch Hatton (which included the Finch Hatton railway station) closed on 2 October 1990. The position of station master was abolished in 1988 and the goods shed had been sold for removal. The Cattle Creek Mill also closed in 1990. This was a common pattern in sugar districts as industry deregulation resulted in cane lands going out of production and mills closing. Many tram and rail lines disappeared and road transport was increasingly used to take the harvest to the mills. By 1994, the railway complex comprised only the station building as the station master's house was relocated to Zahmel Street, Finch Hatton. The former station building was then taken over by the Mirani Shire Council, operating the building as the Finch Hatton Historic Railway Station and Internet Access Centre. The Station and Centre focuses on the local and social history and the development of the Pioneer Valley and opens on a daily basis. In 2015, following the amalgamation of local government areas including Shire of Mirani, the building is owned and operated by the Mackay Regional Council.  Description  The former Finch Hatton Railway Station is a single storey, timber framed building, set on low timber stumps, clad with timber weatherboards. The building has a gable roof on the eastern side and a gambrel roof on the western side, clad with corrugated iron. Timber louvered ventilators are located high in the western and eastern elevations. The roof extends on the northern, southern and sides of the building creating shade to these sections. The fretted shelter shed spandrels running the length of the structure on the northern and southern sides compare with the Mirani railway station building, further to the east along the line. The station building has timber louvred valance along the western elevation with station name boards. Accommodation from east to west consists of the former ladies' room and closet, shelter area and office. The building is surrounded by well manicured grounds and mature trees. A number of commemorative cairns are located within the property.  Heritage listing  The former Finch Hatton Railway Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Finch Hatton railway station building is important as a substantially intact example of a country branch line station building, demonstrating the importance of the Queensland sugar industry's railway networks and the gradual loss of this network following industry deregulation and a shift to road transport of harvested cane. Located on the Pioneer Valley Line of the Mackay Railway, the Finch Hatton railway station building is an extant reminder of the growth of the district as pre-eminent cane growing area in the late 19th and early 20th century. The opening of the area through the establishment of the railway also prompted the development of the timber and tourism industries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. With spaces formerly consisting of office area, shelter area with shade to both sides of the building and with ticket windows facing the shelter areas, the Finch Hatton Railway Station building is a good example of a country branch line timber railway building. Its decorative fretted shelter shed spandrels compare with the Mirani railway station building. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Finch Hatton railway station building is important for its aesthetic significance, particularly with regard to the station building's unusual architectural features, its intact state and by its picturesque setting in the main street of the township, close to the Finch Hatton War Memorial.

Below is a styllized representation of Mary's Tomb, with flowers lying on the sarcophagus. The Holy Girdle, also known as the Girdle of Thomas, Holy Girdle of Mary, Holy Soonoro, (or) Zunoro, and Holy Belt of Saint Mary the mother of Jesus, is a relic of the Blessed Virgin Mary which is one of the important relics of Syriac Orthodox Church and venerated by Oriental Orthodox Communion. The word \\"soonoro\\" is also translated as \\"belt\\", \\"sash\\" or \\"girdle\\". It is the Oriental Orthodox equivalent of the Girdle of Thomas in the Western church, and the Cincture of the Theotokos in the Eastern Orthodox Church, now located at Mount Athos. Tradition According to Orthodox tradition, the Virgin Mary died in the presence of all apostles except Thomas, who was in India. He returned to Jerusalem and travelled on the sky by the help of Holy Spirit to attend the assumption of Mary. He was late to arrive and visualised that Mary's body had been taken by angels. Suffering from doubts at that time, Thomas requested Mary to give him a sign in her memory, which caused a chariot to stop in the air and Mary to gift her girdle to him. Thomas showed this girdle to other disciples of Jesus and convinced them. He took the girdle, otherwise known as a zounoro, on his subsequent journeys. Those who believe in him claim that many miracles have happened since then as a result of touching or even seeing this girdle. The incident is not recorded in the Bible. The Holy Girdle is taken out annually on the last day of 8 Day Lent in September.  History  Saint Thomas the Apostle kept the holy belt with his own. After he died in Mylapore, his body and relics were kept in India. In 394 AD, the holy girdle moved from India to Uraha (modern Urfa, Turkey). and then to Homs in Syria, where it was placed in Saint Mary Church of the Holy Belt, also known as The Church of the Lady of the Girdle. The supreme head, Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum, Patriarch of Antioch, studied manuscripts and a Garshunian book containing stories and speeches send by the people of Homs in 1852. The archbishop of Homs ordered to renovate the church. On 20 July 1953, the Holy Girdle was discovered from the altar of the church by Barsoum in the presence of Alexandros, the Greek Orthodox bishop of Homs and it is scientifically proved.http://www.syriacchristianity.info/doc/HolyVirginMary.htm It is considered to be one of the most important relics in Syriac Orthodox Church.The Oxford History of Christian Worship  pg 157  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195138864  Malankara Church  The Some parts of Holy Girdle is distributed into the Malankara Church.

Not far from Duchcov Duxit is found since the 1980s in a lignite workhouse at B√≠lina. In the lower section of the mined here lignite occur grade category tree residues with Duxit. Mostly it involves Taxodium. Properties Doelter reported the following composition for the samples which were extracted in 1874 (air-dry basis): 78.25% carbon, 8.14% hydrogen, 13.19% oxygen and 0.42% sulfur. The specific gravity was determined 1.133. The sample was in alcohol sparingly soluble in benzene. Doelter noted a certain similarity of the analyzed sample resin to Walchowit, gave the resin but because of the opposite Walchowit significantly higher oxygen content and because of some differing physical properties has its own name. He has classified Duxit in the category of Retinite fossil resins. Already in the middle of the 20th century, Duxit was known as the \\"Resinous bitumen\\".J.

She is a recipient of the 2001 Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi for her novel Kalikatha: Via Bypass. Biography Alka Saraogi was born in a Marwari family of Rajasthani origin in Kolkata. She studied at Calcutta University, receiving a PhD for her thesis on the poetry of Raghuvir Sahay. Following her marriage and the birth of two children, Saraogi began to write short stories. Her first published work was ƒÄp kƒ´ ha·πÅsƒ´ (Your laughter), a story taking its title from one of Raghuvir Sahay's poems. Saraogi's mentor, Ashok Seksaria, sent it to Vartaman Sahitya, a Hindi literary journal, where it received favourable notice. She then published KahƒÅnƒ´ kƒ´ talƒÅ≈õ me·πÅ in 1996, a collection of short stories. Her first novel, Kalikatha: Via Bypass, came out in 1998. It was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi literature in 2001. She followed this up with four further novels, the latest - JƒÅnkidƒÅs TejpƒÅl mansion - published in 2015. Critical commentary =Language and culture= Marwaris and Bengalis, despite coexisting in Kolkata for many generations, have led largely disjoint lives. In Bengali literature and art, the Marwari appears typically as a stereotype, a money-making reactionary. Saraogi's writing is in Hindi, albeit neither overly Sanskritised, nor informed by the popular Hindi film industry. Though she often uses Bengali expressions in her novels, especially in the speech of Bengali characters, even in her oeuvre the breach between the Hindi- and Bengali-speaking communities remains unbridged. =Kalikatha: Via Bypass= Saraogi's first novel, Kalikatha: Via Bypass, is a work of historical fiction. It examines the Marwari community, long established in Kolkata as a merchants yet still exploring its position among the Bengali culture. It is written from the point of view of a male protagonist, Kishore Babu, who following an operation for a head injury, begins to wander around the city, observing its economic life and histories. He compares its majoritarian society against the patriarchal mores of his Marwari community, contrasts his own memories with popular memory, and experiences the ways in which Kolkata of the 1940s melds into that of the 1990s. As Kishore Babu wanders across the city and his own memories, pondering the loves and lives of his ancestors and descendants, his ruminations enliven the entire community, and the narrative structure of the novel too flips between the ages. Saraogi's unflinching prose does not flatter the Marwaris, though the privations of a community on the margin are described evocatively. Kolkata Marwaris have often been accused of making money at the expense of the Bengalis, but this is not addressed in the novel. Rather, it sets in stark contrast the ostensible nobility of their spirit against the parochiality of their lives. =Shesh Kadambari= The protagonist of this novel, Ruby Gupta, is a Marwari woman who faces the dichotomy of two social values: the wealth and enterprise of her Marwari father versus the austere and intellectual nature of her mother's family. Saraogi addresses the nuances of cultural differences through Ruby's eyes. Once again, the narrative oscillates between periods of Ruby's childhood and her old age. Having been wealthy in a city of poverty is a stigma she finds hard to atone. Discovering the source of her father's wealth - the opium trade - adds further discomfort. Meanwhile, she recognises the innate hypocrisy of her mother's relatives who disparage her father and his business, yet continue to live off him. Following the male- dominated viewpoint of her first novel, Saraogi's switch to a female perspective offers further reinforcement of the weight of cultural expectation. Despite being a patriarch, Kishore Babu in Kalikatha: Via Bypass was unable to step outside his social mores to ameliorate his widowed sister- in-law's life. In Shesh Kadambari, seeking an understanding of self for all her seventy years of life, Ruby Gupta comes to realise that her social work has not resulted in any social justice for herself. =Jankidas Tejpal Mansion= The story of a US-educated engineer who returns to India and gets embroiled in the Naxalite movement, Saraogi's novel sweeps across the early optimism of India's freedom to the broken dreams of the present. Jaygovind's life follows the disappointments of the first post-Independence generation, mirrored in the social schisms of America, from the Vietnam war to Wikileaks.

The squadron was disestablished on 1 June 1975.

A small group of officers collected from various other squadrons of the Heavy Attack Wing at NAS Patuxent River assembled in the Fleet Aircraft Support Squadron 52 Ready Room to hear Commander Eugene P. Rankin, one of the pilots of the famed P2V-1, the \\"Truculent Turtle,\\" read the orders establishing VC-8. Approximately one minute after Commander Rankin finished, VC-8's first scheduled flight became airborne. Personnel from VC-5, VC-6, and VC-7 were pooled to form a nucleus for VC-8 as the first squadron equipped with the AN/ASB-1 radar bombing system that would later be incorporated into the AJ Savage and the A3D (later A-3B) Skywarrior. Unlike other VC squadrons previously formed, VC-8's first aircraft were not AJ-1 Savages, but P2V-3C Neptunes, later redesignated as P2V-3Bs.http://skaneateles.org/ChuckHuber/charles379/USNComposite/page18.html These aircraft would serve as training platforms until production AJ-1s became available for VC-8.http://www.tailsthroughtime.com/2015/08/the-atomic- neptunes-navys-interim.html VC-8 later transitioned to and eventually operated both the AJ-1 and AJ-2 Savage. In 1955, VC-8 relocated to Naval Auxiliary Air Station Sanford, Florida, and on 1 November 1955, was redesignated as Heavy Attack Squadron Eleven (VAH-11), also known as Hatron Eleven. =VAH-11 / Cold War (pre-Vietnam)= VAH-11 continued to fly the AJ-1 and AJ-2 until reequipped with the A3D-2 Skywarrior in November 1957. With the replacement of the AJ-1 and AJ-2 with the new A3D, Naval Air Auxiliary Station Sanford was the focus of extensive military construction during the mid and late 1950s, all intended to upgrade the installation to full naval air station status as a Master Jet Base and resulting in its redesignation as Naval Air Station Sanford.http://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-squadron-history.html Remaining homeported at NAS Sanford throughout its existence as VAH-11, the squadron made seven Mediterranean deployments, five aboard the and once each aboard the and the . Given the size and complexity of the A3D as a carrier- based aircraft, mishaps plagued the VAH community during its early years Navy- wide. VAH-11 was not immune to this, and one fifteen-month period from March 1961 to June 1962 proved particularly costly: *On 21 March 1961, while operating from the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt, a VAH-11 A3D-2, BuNo 138976, was lost at sea with all crewmembers. During a nuclear weapon loft maneuver demonstration abeam the carrier, the aircraft exceeded breakaway limits and the nose of the jet came down in a 70 degree dive. The dive flattened, but the aircraft struck the water in a nose high attitude. *On 7 May 1961, another VAH-11 A3D-2, BuNo 142245, sustained a ramp strike on its initial pass aboard the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt. Four more attempts to land were unsuccessful and the crew successfully bailed out just south of Souda Bay, Crete. *On 6 October 1961, while at Naval Air Station Sanford, A3D-2 BuNo 142637 was conducting training over the Lake George bombing target, part of the Navy Pinecastle Impact Rangehttp://www.militarybases.us/navy/pine-castle-bombing- range/ in the Ocala National Forest. During a bomb run on the target, the crew executed an inert bomb release, rolled the aircraft in excess of 90 degrees and disappeared into the clouds. Per range observers, the aircraft was next seen in a steep dive followed by an uncontrolled crash into Lake George with a loss of the entire crew. *On 12 October 1961, only six days after the preceding mishap over Lake George, an A3D-2 assigned to VAH-11, BuNo 142648, collided in mid-air with another A3D-2, BuNo 142663, assigned to VAH-5 while both aircraft were on approach to landing at Naval Air Station Sanford. All eight crewmen, four in the VAH-5 aircraft and four in the VAH-11 aircraft, were killed. *On 25 June 1962, while VAH-11 was again embarked aboard USS Franklin D. Roosevelt, A3D-2 BuNo 138962 experienced a dual-engine flameout. All crew except the pilot bailed out. The bombardier/navigator and an observer from the Roosevelt's ships company were rescued, but the pilot and 3rd crewmember were never recovered.http://www.a3skywarrior.com/personnel/memorials/a-3-accidents-by- date.html In September 1962, the Department of Defense instituted a new aircraft designation system, discarding the legacy USN / USMC / USCG designation system and effectively transitioning all branches of the U.S. armed forces to the USAF aircraft designation system. As a result, the A3D-2 was redesignated as the A-3B Skywarrior. Between August 1962 and January 1965, VAH-11 was divided into two units: one with six Skywarriors performing all the normal duties of a heavy attack squadron deploying aboard Fleet aircraft carriers, and the other taking up an operational readiness posture from other heavy attack squadrons while they converted from A-3Bs to the North American A-5A or RA-5C Vigilante. In turn, VAH-11 transitioned to the RA-5C Vigilante in April 1966 and was redesignated Reconnaissance Attack Squadron Eleven (RVAH-11), also known as RECONATKRON ELEVEN, in July 1966.Grove, M. & Miller, J; Aerofax Minigraph 9, North American Rockwell A3J/A-5A Vigilante; Aerofax, Inc., Arlington, TX c1989, p15; =Cold War/Vietnam= With the increasing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam after 1964, RVAH-11 added to the mix of RVAH squadrons participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia, although its first such deployment would be a watershed event in terms of shipboard and aviation safety for the U.S. Navy in general and Naval Aviation in particular: *From 6 June - 15 September 1967, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard USS Forrestal for an Atlantic and Indian Ocean transit en route to its first Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and Vietnam deployment. On 29 July 1967, three of the squadron's RA-5Cs, BuNo 148932, BuNo 149284 and BuNo 149305 were destroyed in the disastrous 1967 flight deck fire aboard USS Forrestal of the same date. None of the 134 men lost that day were RVAH-11 personnel. After a damage assessment and brief refit at Naval Station Subic Bay in the Philippines, the ship and air wing returned to their home stations and homeport on the east coast of the United States. Subsequent deployments were as follows: *18 November 1967 ‚Äì 29 June 1968, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. On 18 May 1968, an RVAH-11 RA-5C, BuNo 149283, was shot down in combat over North Vietnam. The pilot, RVAH-11 Executive Officer CDR Charlie James,http://veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=1403 ejected successfully, was captured by the North Vietnamese and was repatriated to the United States on 14 March 1973. The remains of the navigator, LCDR Vince Monroe, were returned in August 1978.http://www.rvahnavy.com/08-01-09%20In%20DC%20Story.pdf The simultaneous budgetary pressures of the Vietnam War and President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs forced the Department of Defense to close several stateside U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy air installations, to include Naval Air Station Sanford, as part of an economy move in the late 1960s. Upon return from their 1967-1968 deployment, RVAH-1 shifted its home station from NAS Sanford to the former Turner Air Force Base, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, effective June 1968. *30 December 1968 ‚Äì 4 September 1969, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard USS Kitty Hawk for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. For this deployment, RVAH-11 became the first RVAH squadron to be awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. *23 June 1970 - 31 January 1971, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *1 October 1971 ‚Äì 30 June 1972, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard for a WESTPAC and Vietnam deployment. =Cold War (post-Vietnam)= With the end of the Vietnam War, RVAH-11 returned to stateside training and forward deployed operations aboard Fleet aircraft carriers. Subsequent deployments were as follows: *16 April 1973 - 1 December 1973, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. *27 September 1973 - 19 March 1974, RVAH-11 was embarked aboard for a Mediterranean deployment. Budgetary pressures and force reductions following the end of the Vietnam War forced the Department of Defense to once again close several stateside U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy air bases, to include Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, as an economy move. In late 1974, RVAH-11 executed a shift of home station from NAS Albany to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida.http://www.gonavy.jp/navy/sqn/VAH01.html Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974. Carrier-based reconnaissance was concurrently conducted by the active duty VFP community with one squadron at Naval Air Station Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community with two squadrons at Andrews Air Force Base / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader until 29 March 1987, when the last RF-8G was retired and the mission was fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve VF community at Naval Air Station Miramar, Naval Air Station Oceana, Naval Air Station Dallas and NAS JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with those F-14 Tomcat squadrons equipped with the Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System. Following its return from its final Mediterranean deployment in 1974 and subsequent relocation to Naval Air Station Key West, RVAH-11 was disestablished at NAS Key West on 1 June 1975 following nearly 24 years of active naval service.http://www.rvahnavy.com/5history.html Home station assignments The squadron was assigned to these home stations: *Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland *Naval Air Auxiliary Station Sanford / Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida *Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia *Naval Air Station Key West, Florida Aircraft AssignedP2V-3B Neptune *AJ-1 and AJ-2 Savage *A3D-2 / A-3B Skywarrior *RA-5C Vigilante See also Reconnaissance aircraft * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * History of the United States Navy References External links Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Category:Fleet air reconnaissance squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"RVAH-11"},{"id":"48950101","text":"Surveyors on the Minidoka Project in Idaho, 1918. The project controlled the flow of the Snake river with a series of dams and canals. Surveying in North America is heavily influenced by the United States Public lands survey system. It inherits the basis of its land tenure from the United Kingdom, as well as the other countries that established colonies, Spain and France. History Map of North America showing historical claims for the Colony of Virginia The first European Explorations of North America were quickly followed by territorial claims. The original colonies the made up the United States were granted royal charters that described the limits of the lands where the settlements could be located. Since much of the lands were unknown to Europeans, the grants allocated sweeping areas and were often later amended or superseded. As the population grew and the land was explored, the state borders were defined, like the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, finalized in 1767. The Lewis and Clark Expedition included a preliminary survey of the features of the western United States, resulting in maps of geographical features. Organization The current geodetic model of the earth used in the US is the North American Datum 1983, often called NAD83. The system is used to define horizontal co-ordinates of reference markers all over the US. Although created as a geocentric datum which originates at the center of the earth, more recent models of the earth have shown the origin to be 2.2 m off the centre of the earth. Elevation is recorded against the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88), which uses as its origin point Father Point, in Quebec, Canada. Error in the system is approximately 0.5 mm per mile, resulting in a total error of approximately 1 m from one corner of the continental US to the other. North American bearings are quadrant bearings. = Licensing = Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Canada In Canada, land surveyors register to work in their respective province. The designation for a land surveyor breaks down by province. It follows the rule whereby the first letter indicates the province, followed by L.S. There is also a designation C.L.S. or Canada lands surveyor. They have the authority to work on Canada lands, which include Indian Reserves, National Parks, the three territories, and offshore lands. The Canadian version of the PLSS is the Dominion Land Survey. Mexico United States Most of the US recognizes surveying as a distinct profession apart from engineering. Licensing requirements vary by state, but they have components of education, experience, and examinations. Most states insist upon the basic qualification of a degree in surveying, plus experience and examination requirements. In the past, candidates completed an apprenticeship before taking a series of examinations to gain licensure. The licensing process follows two phases. Upon graduation, the candidate may take the Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) exam. If they pass and meet the other requirements they become a surveying intern (SI). Upon certification as an SI, the candidate then needs to gain on-the-job experience to become eligible for the second phase. In most states, this is the Principles and Practice of Land Surveying (PS) exam and a state-specific examination. SIs were formerly called surveyors in training (SIT). Licensed surveyors usually denote themselves with post nominals. The letters PLS (professional land surveyor), PS (professional surveyor), LS (land surveyor), RLS (registered land surveyor), RPLS (Registered Professional Land Surveyor), or PSM (professional surveyor and mapper) follow their names, depending upon their jurisdiction of registration.

Surveying in Australia is triangulation-based and shares many similarities with the United Kingdom, including the title deed system. However, a distinctive feature of surveying in Australia is the Torrens System, where real estate records are held in a central deposit and guaranteed by the state. History Australia's first map\\" from 1547 (North is down).alt= Map of Australia 1644. Indigenous Australians created constellations in the night sky that related to the geography of the land and used these 'maps' for navigation. Dutch explorers, in 1606, made the first recorded European sightings and first recorded landfalls of the Australian mainland. The first accurate drawn maps of Australia were compiled during the voyages of Captain Cook. Cook's experience in creating nautical charts of the eastern seaboard of Canada was an important factor in his appointment as captain of the voyage observing the transit of Venus. As he sailed the coastlines, he charted the bays and coastlines. =Early exploration= Early surveying efforts concentrated on finding suitable town sites. Many towns in Australia were established by dividing a suitable site into small plots of land that were sold to English residents who then emigrated. Other exploration expeditions were made to the interior in an attempt to find fertile land. =New South Wales= The first attempts to regulate surveying in New South Wales was in 1836. In 1876, use of the circumferentor was prohibited. The theodolite supplanted it as a more accurate measurer of angles. The Torrens system was introduced in 1862 by the Real Property Act. The previous system of registering deeds is now known as the \\"old system\\". Swan River, Western Australia in 1839. The map was drawn by John Arrowsmith from the survey data of John Septimus Roe. Survey system of Australia Initially surveys were conducted using magnetic bearings. Later measurements were made on county arbitrary meridians, where surveys in each county were based on an initial point determined by government surveyors. In 1966, the first nationwide system, the Australian geodetic datum (AGD) was established. Most states appointed surveyors-general early in their history. These officials were responsible for setting up reliable systems to record land purchases and claims. The current Australian survey system is the geocentric datum of Australia, established in 1994. It was adopted nationally on 1 January 2000. Surveying is regulated at a federal level by Geoscience Australia.  Finding a site for the capital  Melbourne‚ÄìSydney rivalry led to division in the late 1800s on where the capital city should be sited. After an extensive search, the present site, about 300 kilometres south-west of Sydney, in the foothills of the Australian Alps, was chosen in 1908 as a result of survey work done by the government surveyor Charles Scrivener in that year.National Archives of Australia ‚Äì Seat of Government Act 1908 (Cth) Professional associations Surveying in Australia is still highly differentiated between the states.

He made his first-class debut at the age of 13 and was considered to be an \\"exceptionally gifted batsman\\" and a \\"prodigy\\". He became the youngest Indian and one of the youngest players in the world to score a century in first-class cricket, with his 137 against Jammu and Kashmir in 1988 coming at the age of 14 years and 294 days.Youngest batsman to score 100 Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians He was the youngest player to reach the 1000-run mark in Ranji Trophy, reaching the milestone at the age of 17 years and 341 days. On the night of 31 January 1992, Pandove was killed in a road accident in Ambala. Life and career Pandove was born on 9 January 1974 in Patiala. His father M. P. Pandove was a first-class cricketer who appeared in 75 first-class matches playing for Southern Punjab, Punjab, and North Zone, and later became a cricket administrator. Dhruv Pandove came into the limelight after scoring heavily for Punjab under-15s and under-17s. Following scores of 159 against Jammu and Kashmir under-17s and 51 against Delhi under-17s in the 1987‚Äì88 Vijay Hazare Trophy, Pandove made his first-class debut in November 1987 at the age of 13 and scored 94 in that match against Himachal Pradesh.

The cab driver was also killed and Pandove's friend Bittu was critically injured. Pandove's death was mentioned by BBC and the Australian commentators of the Australia-India Test match that was happening at Perth. The Indian team observed a two minutes' silence before the start of the match. The Baradari Ground in Patiala was renamed as \\"Dhruve Pandove Stadium\\" in 1992. The Pandove family started a trust called the Dhruv Pandove Trust in 1994. According to the Tribune, the main goals of the trust was \\"to promote the game, nurture young talent and also organise blood donation camps to commemorate the death of Dhruv.\\" The trust also assumed the management of the Dhruve Pandove Stadium and has since been responsible for its maintenance. In 1999, the trust started training young cricketers. The Punjab Cricket Association started a cricket tournament named after Pandove (Dhruv Pandove Trophy) in 2011. Playing style Pandove started as a right-handed batsman, but later changed to left-hand. He did not obtain much formal cricket training, and picked up tips from his father. Sachin Tendulkar, who knew Pandove from his early career, wrote in a mail in 2011 that Pandove was a \\"fantastic left hander with a lot of talent and class\\" and that he \\"had a wonderful future as a cricketer ahead of him.\\" He added, \\"I think my association with Dhruv in my earlier cricketing days has a lot of bearing on my eventual success in the International arena.\\" Pandove's teammate Ajay Jadeja recalls Pandove as \\"fearless\\" with an \\"infectious spirit to fight\\", while Vikram Rathour commended his maturity and intelligence about cricket.

Summary  The poem recounts chronologically the events that led to the Uprising against the Dahije and the First Serbian Uprising in 1804. In the opening part of the poem, the poet sends an artistic message about the imminent rebellion by describing rare natural events.

Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá Meanwhile, Turks are also watching these occurrences. For Serbian people, the signs mean they should fight the Turks, and for Dahiyas, Turkish leaders, they are bad omens that need to be interpreted. Dahiyas use traditional divination methods: hydromancy and interpreting holy prophet books. All signs indicate the downfall of the Turks. Dahiyas were cruel to the Serbian people and thereby they offended their fallen Sultan‚Äôs legacy. Liberation of Belgrade The sin is as great as the punishment that will befall them.

Crystal structure and stability The crystal structure adopted by ceria-zirconia depends on the Zr/Ce ratio and temperature. At very low Zr concentrations, ceria-zirconia exhibits the cubic fluorite structure, which is common to both pure ceria and cubic zirconia (pure zirconia normally only adopts a cubic structure at high temperatures). However, at higher Zr contents, other crystal structures are formed, including two different tetragonal phases at intermediate Zr concentrations, and a monoclinic phase at very high Zr concentrations. There is both experimental and theoretical evidence showing that the decomposition of ceria-zirconia into Ce-rich and Zr-rich oxides is thermodynamically favorable in a wide range of solid solution compositions, which means that ceria-zirconia is metastable with respect to phase separation. Technological importance Ceria-zirconia is widely used as a component in current three-way catalytic converters. The ceria-based component of the converter has several functions, including promoting the dispersion of the noble metals in the catalyst, but also storing and releasing oxygen. The incorporation of zirconium in modern converters, forming ceria-zirconia, improves the performance of the catalyst by enhancing the resistance of the material to sintering, and simultaneously increasing the ability of the oxide to accommodate oxygen vacancies in its structure.

He assumed office in April 2019.  Early life  Yoshimura was born in the Osaka suburb of Kawachinagano. He studied law at Kyushu University, graduating in 1998. He passed the Japanese bar examination later that year and was admitted to practice as an attorney in 2000, at the age of 25. After working for several years under Tokyo-based attorney Shintaro Kumagai (ÁÜäË∞∑ ‰ø°Â§™ÈÉé), Yoshimura returned to Osaka and co-founded the Star Law Office in 2005. He remains a partner in the firm as of 2017.  Political career  = Osaka City Council = Yoshimura was elected to the Osaka city council in 2011 as a member of the Osaka Restoration Association headed by Osaka Prefecture governor Toru Hashimoto. = House of Representatives = Yoshimura was elected to the Japanese House of Representatives in the 2014 general election as a member of the Japan Innovation Party. He was a candidate in the Osaka 4th district and lost in a close race with LDP incumbent Yasuhide Nakayama, but picked up a seat through the JIP proportional representation list. Yoshimura's tenure in the Diet was short. Following an unsuccessful referendum in May 2015 to restructure the Osaka government, Toru Hashimoto announced his resignation as mayor of Osaka. In October, Hashimoto announced that he would transform the Osaka Restoration Association into a national party with about a dozen Diet members who had broken away from the JIP. On the same day, Yoshimura resigned from the House to run in the November 2015 election to replace Hashimoto. Hashimoto reportedly hand-picked Yoshimura to serve as his successor. = Mayor of Osaka = Yoshimura was initially considered an underdog in the November 2015 \\"double election\\" for the governor of Osaka Prefecture and mayor of Osaka City. However, he won the election by a wide margin with former mayor Hashimoto's support. In the final tally, he won 596,045 votes versus 406,595 for runner-up Akira Yanagimoto, who was supported by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the LDP. Yoshimura took office on 18 December 2015. At the beginning of his term, Yoshimura joined with the newly elected Osaka Prefecture governor Ichiro Matsui to establish a joint office for the purpose of promoting Osaka as a \\"vice capital\\" of Japan, such as by hosting government agencies currently based in Tokyo. Yoshimura is a proponent of casino development in Osaka, and led a 2017 proposal to re-develop part of the Yumenoshima artificial island in Osaka Bay as a casino facility. In 2017, Yoshimura threatened to cancel Osaka's sister city relationship with San Francisco due to plans from a pan-Asian coalition to incorporate a statue of a comfort woman in a San Francisco municipal park. In October 2018, he officially terminated Osaka's sister city relationship with San Francisco. He resigned from the post on 21 March 2019 to contest the Osaka Gubernatorial Election. =Governor of Osaka= Yoshimura won the Osaka gubernatorial election held in 2019. He was backed by Osaka Ishin. His opponent, Tadakazu Konishi, was backed by the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito.

In February 1943, he was sent to the Central Front with the 109th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 37th Guards Rifle Division. Bantsekin joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He became a telephonist for the regiment and fought in the Battle of Kursk. During Operation Kutuzov, Bantsekin reportedly was completing the repair of telephone lines when he was surrounded by a 15-man German detachment. Engaging them in combat, he killed nine and caused the remainder to retreat on 9 August while on the outskirts of Dmitrovsk. On 10 August, Bantsekin provided telephone communications from the company commander to the battalion commander during the repulse of German counterattacks. While repairing the line, he reportedly came under mortar fire twelve times. Bantsekin then fought in the Chernigov-Pripyat Offensive. During the crossing of the Desna River on 12 September near Chernihiv, he was one of the first to cross the river on a raft under fire. On the right bank, when the unit reached a minefield covered by a machine gun nest, Bantsekin reportedly volunteered to cross it first. He dug up 32 mines and then destroyed the machine gun nest with a grenade, allowing the unit to advance. On 21 September during the fight for the village of Kudlaevka, Bantsekin broke into the village with an assault team and helped capture three houses, which were turned into firing points. During the fighting, he reportedly killed 17 German soldiers. By the end of September, he had killed a total of 57 German soldiers. In November, he went missing during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. Bantsekin was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet UnionHero of the Soviet Union citation, available online at pamyatnaroda.ru and the Order of Lenin posthumously on 15 January 1944.

Collected from these elements, this religious world view reminds of a patchwork quilt with a unique pattern. Similar social concepts are syncretism, bricolage and sheilaism.  History  Patchwork religion was first suggested by American sociologist Robert Wuthnow. Wuthnow studies aspects of American religiosity, believing that its patchwork and avoidance of keeping to strictly defined forms are its essential features. Thus he writes: > \\"Now, at the end of the twentieth century, growing numbers of Americans > piece together their faith like a patchwork quilt. Spirituality has become a > vastly complex quest in which each person seeks in his or her own > way\\".Wuthnow R. After Heaven: Spirituality in America Since the 1950s / > Robert Wuthnow. ‚Äî Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. ‚Äî –†. 2. Patchworks of individual religiosity do not contradict loyalty to a church's official position. In his other book Wuthnow connects patchworks with a feature of American religiosity called shopping mentality. Bearers of such mentality mostly admit the existence of God or some kind of mystical force, but believe that no religion is able to explain this mystery. The framework of each religion offers good examples of penetration into mysterious spheres of the divine. > \\"When God is ultimately a mystery, it is easy to assume that all religions > contain insights about God but no religion provides a complete understanding > of God, and thus one way to increase one\`s understanding of God is by > gleaning ideas from many different religious traditions\\".Wuthnow R.

Collective consciousness  Originally patchwork religion was applied to individual religiosity. It later became used in descriptions of public worldview features. Patchwork appears in religious traditions that include elements not found in original practice. This explains dual faith and superstitions that can be characterized as interpolations, brought during a historical process. Some scientists claim that each religious tradition has a people's interpretation (for example, people's Catholicism, people's Buddhism etc.).Denz H.

Among these Dive di Lo (The Flame of the Earthen Lamp), Mul da Mas (Flesh at a Price) and Badla (Revenge) deal with the eternal problem of the woman about which most Indian writers and artistes cannot help being sentimental. Sohan Singh Seetal has in due course travelled from sentimentality, which often becomes macabre, to competent realism, although here also the projection of problems and their solution are not without a sentimental tinge. On the whole, Seetal has described in his novels the countryside of Central Punjab and the life of its people as a kind of parallel to Nanak Singh who deals with urban life in the same tract of land. Both are reformist and sentimental to start with and then grow into realists in their later work but while Nanak Singh tends towards a kind of Gandhian Socialism, Seetal's concern with the peasant's life takes a populist form.

He was Minister of the Colonies from 1899 to 1902. He supported the exploitation of the colonies by concessionary companies, and opposed the slave trade. During his term in office a volcanic eruption destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre, Martinique. Early years Albert Pierre Louis Decrais was born on 18 December 1838 in Bordeaux, Gironde. He was from a bourgeois Protestant family. His parents were Louis Decrais, a merchant, and Marie D√©sir√©e Debans. He graduated from the lyc√©e in Bordeaux on 3 August 1857, then went to Paris to study law, where he was a brilliant student. He was secretary of the conference of attorneys in 1862‚Äì63, and won a prize for his √âloge de M. de Vatimesnil. He joined the bar of Paris and became a licensed attorney in 1867. He was opposed to the Second French Empire and moved in Republican circles. Official career During the Franco-Prussian War Decrais was part of the diplomatic mission of Tachard in Brussels. On 2 March 1871 he was named prefect of Indre-et-Loire. He married Marguerite Alice Dethomas, and they had three children. In August 1874 he was decorated with the Legion of Honour. On 11 November 1874 he was made prefect of the Alpes- Maritimes, and on 21 March 1876 he was appointed prefect of the Gironde. He resigned on 19 May 1877 in protest against the selection of Albert, 4th duc de Broglie as prime minister. He was reinstated on 20 December 1877, and on 7 February 1878 was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honor. He was appointed Councilor of State on 16 March 1879. Diplomat Decrais was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Brussels on 8 May 1880. From 4 February 1882 to 11 November 1882 he was director of political affairs at the Foreign Ministry under the 2nd cabinet of Charles de Freycinet. He was appointed French ambassador to Italy on 11 November 1882, to Austria on 17 July 1886 and was appointed ambassador to Great Britain on 21 July 1893. He retired from the diplomatic service in 1894. Political career =Deputy= Vanity Fair, 28 December 1893 From 1880 to 1886 Decrais was a member of the general council of the Gironde. He ran for election to the legislature in 1896 for the 1st district of Bordeaux, but did not succeed. He ran as Republican candidate in a by-election for the 4th district of Bordeaux on 21 February 1897, and was elected. He was reelected on 8 May 1898 and 27 April 1902. In the chamber he was interested only in foreign affairs. =Minister of the Colonies= Decrais was Minister of the Colonies from 22 June 1899 to 3 June 1902 in the cabinet of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau. He stated that he was in favor of a humane policy towards the natives of the colonies. Decrais supported the system by which companies were given concessions to exploit areas of the colonies in exchange for paying taxes and developing their areas. The number of concessions increased under his administration. The colonial governors were often hostile to concessions where the companies were only concerned with maximizing profit, and which were harmful in the long run. The companies themselves generally did poorly despite government loans. However, Decrais ignored these issues. In 1901 he set up a banking commission to look at ways of financing the companies, with the end result that taxpayers paid the salaries and dividends of the exploiting companies. In October 1899 Decrais reorganized the Sudan so that the southern cercles were attached to the coastal colonies. In the interior there were two colonies under military rule, centered on Ouagadougou and Timbuktu respectively. A new military territory covering what is now Niger was established in 1900. On 11 December 1899 the Catholic deputy Jules Auguste Lemire spoke in the Chamber on the persistent slave trade, particularly in women. Decrais said he was not aware of the problem but would ensure that slavery was suppressed. Soon after he wrote a strongly worded letter to all governors in which he said, Early in May 1902 the volcano Mount Pel√©e above the city of Saint-Pierre, Martinique began to erupt. Decrais received a cable from senator Am√©d√©e Knight on 7 May 1902 that said serious damage had been done and asked for humanitarian help. Decrais sensed that the problem was not urgent, and the request might have political motives, so did not take immediate action. Later he explained, \\"With an election pending, the situation was delicate. To intervene at the behest of a party leader would have slighted the governor's authority and could have been interpreted as action for political gain.\\" The eruptions continued, and by 12 May 1902 it was known that Saint-Pierre had been completely destroyed and 30,000 people had died. =Senator= On 26 April 1903 Decrais was elected to the Senate in a by- election. He was reelected on 7 January 1906. Again, he was almost entirely devoted to foreign affairs. He died on 27 February 1915 in M√©rignac, Gironde aged 76.

The impetus came from meetings between Protestant Observers at Vatican II with Pope Paul VI, and a subsequent meeting between the pope and Patriarch Athenagoras I in Jerusalem. The property is owned by the Holy See and leased to the University of Notre Dame for the administration of the institute. It is governed by an international ecumenical board, including Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant/Anglican members. On a thirty-six acre hill overlooking the way between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, Tantur is located as an oasis of learning, dialogue, prayer, and community amid the geo-political and religious complexity of the Holy Land. Mission \\"No one climbs up to Tantur except to follow a vocation, the same vocation that led on the pioneers of ecumenism. That is the climate in which the research here must develop.\\" (Professor Albert Outler, Tantur, 1972) The mission of the Tantur Ecumenical Institute is to: * To work toward the unity of Christians (ecumenism); * To contribute to positive relations between peoples of the Abrahamic faiths (Interreligious Dialogue); * To be agent for the reconciliation of peoples in conflict (peacebuilding, especially with respect to the Arab-Israeli Conflict/Israeli- Palestinian Conflict). While the ecumenical mission of Christian Unity is the central and core mission of Tantur, its situation in between Jerusalem and Bethlehem give easy context for the second-tier mission areas of interreligious dialogue and peacebuilding. Tantur is as a place and resource for global ecumenical research, as well as for local initiatives in these areas. In anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the lease and groundbreaking for the institute (1967), the international advisory board recently developed a new Strategic Plan for Tantur, which identified the following strategic goals: * To once again become an internationally recognized galvanizing force for scholarship and dialogue on themes related to Christian unity. * Embed Tantur more deeply into the academic and scholarly enterprise of the University of Notre Dame. * Cultivate a commitment to spiritual ecumenism and a culture of encounter among pastoral leaders. History In October 1963, Ecumenical Observers at the Second Vatican Council approached Pope Paul VI and shared the dream of an international ecumenical institute for advanced theological research and pastoral studies. This produced a seed that would find fertile ground for planting when the bishop of Rome met with Patriarch Athenagoras of Constantinople on the Mount of Olives on 5 January 1964. This famous first encounter of pope and patriarch in centuries inspired the idea that the international ecumenical institute be located in Jerusalem. In September 1964, Pope Paul received in audience Rev. Theodore Hesburgh (Fr. Ted), then president of the University of Notre Dame, at the head of the International Federation of Catholic Universities. From this meeting and others over the next year and a half, the bishop of Rome entrusted the idea of Tantur to Notre Dame and a committee of international ecumenical advisors ‚Äì including the likes of Yves Congar, Oscar Cullman, Jean-Jacques von Allmen, Georges Florovsky, J.N.D. Kelly, Raymond Pannikar, Karekin Sarkissian, and several other great ecumenical theologians of the age. This board began its work in earnest in November 1965. right The Vatican purchased the 36 acres ‚Äì then in Jordan ‚Äì from the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for $300,000, and leased the property to the University of Notre Dame for fifty years, renewable. Groundbreaking took place on 4 June 1967. The Six-Day War began the next day, with the invasion of Israel by Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. Within a week, the property was under Israeli sovereignty. Fr. Ted had secured a donation for the construction costs from Mr. and Mrs. I. A. O‚ÄôShaughnessy of St. Paul, Minnesota. Due to difficulties of the Arab-Israeli conflict, construction was delayed for a short while, but Tantur was officially opened in September 1972, with an inaugural community of thirty scholars and their families, six Benedictine (Catholic) monks from Montserrat in Spain, and five international staff. In total, ten nationalities and thirteen religious identities were represented. Yves Congar, OP, was one of the first senior scholars to reside in community at Tantur. In the mid-1980s there was increased interest among the churches in interreligious dialogue and in the ‚Äòlife and work‚Äô aspect of ecumenism, especially in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. The First Intifada (1987-1991) resulted in a decreased interest in international scholars spending time in Jerusalem for research. As local tensions eased, the ecumenical movement entered what has been called its \\"ecumenical winter\\". The combination of these factors had a desultory effect on Tantur programs and participation. Briefly during the 1990s, the University of Notre Dame took advantage of the lacuna by using Tantur as a site for one of its international study-abroad programs, with a focus in theology and peace studies. During this time, much of the programming shifted from semester- or year-long research fellowships to shorter sabbatical and continuing education programs for pastoral leaders and educators from around the world. The Second Intifada (2000-2005) again caused nearly all international students and scholars to cease their travels to Jerusalem, and Tantur entered a period of maintenance and local activities. Library acquisitions were interrupted for several years and for several reasons, only to be restored recently. The University of Notre Dame re-established its study abroad program in the early 2010s for its undergraduate students at Tantur, as well as internships for its Master‚Äôs in International Peace Studies students. Tantur is also the University‚Äôs Jerusalem \\"Global Gateway\\": a kind of embassy of Notre Dame in the Holy Land. Tantur has remained, first and foremost, a center for advanced theological research in ecumenism throughout its history, despite these interruptions, serving academics and pastoral leaders from around the world. The Institute has welcomed over 5,000 Anglican, Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant scholars and program participants over the years. =Location: Jerusalem= \\"Why Jerusalem?\\" was a question frequently asked of the founders. The regional instability of Jerusalem was demonstrated by the fact that groundbreaking for the Institute was one day before the Six-Day War began, and that the Institute was open for only a year before the Yom Kippur War. The question implied a certain expectation, as described by the founding rector, Charles Moeller: \\"that research requires mountains of books and such libraries could not be found anywhere in the Third World, but only in the university centers of Europe and North America.\\" Such was the perspective of the time. Aside from the obvious inspiration from the meeting of Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras on the Mount of Olives in 1964, Jerusalem is the birthplace of Christianity, and home to its first Church. The holiest site of Christianity, the Church of the Resurrection is a witness to the divisions of Christianity and the need for ecumenical work. Robert McAfee Brown answered the question at the inauguration of Tantur in 1972 by stating that Jerusalem becomes a symbol of many things that must concern the ecumenically minded: * It is the locus of many of the holiest sites of Christianity, but also of Judaism and Islam; * A strident and humbling reminder of the ongoing divisions within Christianity (as a visit to the Holy Sepulcher makes cacophonously clear); * Location of some of the deepest strife and division among world religions anywhere * It sits at a crossroads between technologically developed west and emerging nations; * All the major problems of the 20th century are present here: poverty, war, racism, hunger; * In the midst of this remains symbol of hope, the vision of the New Jerusalem. One of the early rectors of Tantur, Jean-Jacques von Allmen, noted additional benefits of an ecumenical research center in Jerusalem: * The traditions of Eastern churches (Catholic and Orthodox) are the living tradition of the local church here, which would help move Catholics beyond a kind of Romano-Centrism and tendency toward Latinization; * It challenges Protestants‚Äô latent Docetism, attaching the geography of salvation to the history of salvation; * Theology is here forced to take into account mystery of Israel; * Likewise, it must take into account Islam, as well as Judaism, and its place in Gods design; * This is the city from which the Gospel came and to which must return: here is both evangelism and eschatology. Scholarly research and community The core of Tantur‚Äôs mission and program is a community of doctoral and post-doctoral researchers working in areas related to its mission of promoting Christian unity (ecumenism). This particularly includes scripture studies, ecclesiology, patristics, and sacramental theology. Other scholars focus on the aspects of interreligious dialogue and peacebuilding. Tantur was built to house up to a hundred individuals, including scholars and their families. Historically, though, at its largest the scholarly community has been no more than 30‚Äì40 individuals. In recent years, there are usually only 3‚Äì5 research fellows in residence at any given time. Additional community members are drawn from participants in the sabbatical and continuing education programs, graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Notre Dame, ecumenical pilgrim groups, volunteers from church organizations, and participants in local programs and conferences. All community members are invited to participate in a community evening on Sundays, including ecumenical evening prayer and dinner. Except for some of the study-abroad programs, most are offered full board and participate in daily common ecumenical prayer. =Continuing education programs= Several different sabbatical, continuing education, and accredited courses are offered to serve those seeking to deepen their understanding of the Land, its history, culture, and the faiths of the people here. They are primarily designed for Christian pastoral leaders (ordained or lay) from all communions and denominations, or academics and educators in a field of theology related to the mission of Tantur. All of the programs take advantage of the experience of the Holy Land as the \\"fifth gospel\\", weaving classroom instruction with on-site excursions. Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Biblical Geography and Archaeology, History of the Middle East, Christian Spirituality, Peace-building., and encounters with Judaism, Islam, and local Christian communities are integrated with visits to Christian holy sites and those important to the history of the Land. Programs often include visits around Jerusalem and Bethlehem, the Galilee, the Dead Sea, and the Negev. Longer programs include visits to the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock; experience at a synagogue and Shabbat meal with a Jewish family; experience at a local Arabic Christian liturgy and meals with families, and the like. A three-month sabbatical program is offered in the fall, and usually draws clergy, lay pastoral workers, and educators. A three-week Easter Encounter program is organized around the Western Holy Week in Jerusalem, and includes liturgies or meetings at Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches during that time. When the Gregorian and Julian dates for Easter coincide, Orthodox liturgies are included. One-month programs are offered during the summer months, usually in June and July. An intensive four-week course in the summer is offered in Modern Hebrew specifically for academics who have already a knowledge of Biblical Hebrew. =Study-abroad programs= During the spring semester, undergraduate students of the University of Notre Dame are invited to come on a study abroad program at Tantur, with courses offered in Anthropology, Art History, Political History, International Peace Studies, Philosophy, Theology, and language studies in Hebrew or Arabic. A three-week theology seminar is offered for undergraduates from any U.S. college or university, entitled, \\"Three Faiths, Two Peoples: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Holy Land.\\" =Ecumenical pilgrims= Tantur is also a destination for university groups, ecumenical pilgrimage groups, retreats and academic conferences. Campus and facilities Tantur has 100,000 square feet in building space, on a campus of 36 acres. The architect, Francesco \\"Frank\\" Montana, was dedicated to using only local Jerusalem sandstone and local labor. He describes the effect, : \\"The pattern of the stones is irregular, with uneven contours on which light can play. The idea behind this was that the masonry should lead the eye out to the surrounding landscape of the desert of Judea, because there you have before you a complete geography of salvation, from the Old Testament to Jesus Christ. I planned many terraces on which people can meet and from which they can look towards Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Beit Jala. On the terraces, you can watch the galloping clouds coming up from the sea, bringing a life-giving benediction to the far deserts, or you can feel the east wind scorching your face like the fire of the burning bush.\\" =Library= left The Tantur Ecumenical Research Library is the jewel of the Institute. It is one of the largest Christian theological libraries in the Holy Land and the Middle East, and one of the largest ecumenical libraries worldwide. The library houses 65,000 volumes, with room for another 40,000. Its periodicals collection includes 400 journals, though a smaller number of these are current. The primary collection is in ecumenism and patristics, but there are strong collections in religions and interreligious dialogue (especially with Judaism and Islam), biblical studies, church history, and international peace studies, with an emphasis on Arab-Israeli and Israel- Palestine questions. The library houses the collection of the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information (IPCRI), the periodicals of the Ecumenical Fraternity, and personal collections of former resident scholars such as Oscar Cullmann and Thomas Stransky. The majority of texts are in English, French, and German, but with a number of titles in Spanish, Italian, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. The catalogue has been converted to an online database, but an old-style card catalogue is still present and usable. =Chapels and prayer spaces= There are four primary places of community prayer at Tantur, though prayer and the practice of spiritual ecumenism is encouraged in all places at all hours: * A large ecumenical chapel * A medium interfaith meditation room * A small oratory with the Blessed Sacrament reserved * An outdoor shrine with an Icon of Christ Pantocrator and the New Jerusalem, written by Ian Knowles of the Bethlehem Icon School. * Forty acres of olive groves and a bit of nature. right =Classrooms and meeting spaces= When built, the Tantur Auditorium was the largest of its kind in Jerusalem, with a capacity of 120 people. Seminar rooms include the Bethlehem Room and Chapel Seminar Room, each with broad vistas and terraces of the surrounding villages, and a capacity for about thirty people. Small seminar rooms include the Notre Dame Room and Library Seminar Room, each ideal for about a dozen people. The Jerusalem Global Gateway building houses the Notre Dame study abroad classes, just southwest of the main facility. =Flora and fauna= Tantur‚Äôs hill is covered with about 500 olive trees, and is a home or oasis for a variety of local fauna: snakes, scorpions, bats, parrots, quail, lizards, geckos, feral cats and dogs, foxes, and a jackal.

It is approximately long and flows through Spring Township, Beaver Township, and Beavertown. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream has two named tributaries: Luphers Run and Wetzel Run. Kern Run is dammed in one place to produce a lake for drinking water and flood control. Some reaches of the stream are impaired. A number of bridges have also been constructed across it. The drainage basin of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce within it. Course Kern Run begins on a large ridge in Spring Township. It flows down the ridge in a northerly direction for several tenths of a mile before turning east-northeast for about a mile, flowing between the ridge and the much smaller Ore Ridge, and entering Beaver Township. Here, the stream turns north-northeast for a few tenths of a mile before entering an unnamed lake. The stream then turns north-northwest for a few tenths of a mile, leaving its valley. At this point, it turns north-northeast for more than a mile, passing through Beavertown and reentering Beaver Township. In Beavertown, the stream crosses US Route 522 and receives the tributary Luphers Run from the right. A short distance north of Beavertown, it receives the tributary Wetzel Run from the right and turns north-northwest for several tenths of a mile, passing between Freestone Ridge and Thomas Ridge and then reaching its confluence with Middle Creek.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Kern Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is above sea level. The creek is a relatively small stream. Its headwaters are on a ridge sometimes known as Shade Mountain. In its upper reaches, Kern Run is a mountain stream in a wild setting. In the late 1980s, one book described the stream as a \\"little mountain brook\\". However, it goes underground for a time near Beavertown.

The war pitted the royalists, supporting the continued adherence of Mexico to Spain, versus the insurgents advocating Mexican independence from Spain. After of struggle of more than 10 years the insurgents prevailed. Background The Mexican War of Independence was an attempt, ultimately successful, led by Mexican-born Spaniards, called \\"criollos\\", to shake off the rule of Spain and the political and social dominance in Mexico of a small number of Spanish-born people living in Mexico, called \\"peninsulares\\" or derisively \\"gachupines.\\" The war began in 1810, led by a small group of criollos in the Bajio region who were supported by a large number of mixed-blood mestizos and indigenous people. In 1810, a tax official calculated that New Spain (Mexico plus California, the American Southwest, and Texas) had a population of 6.1 million people, of which 18 percent or 1,097,928 were Spaniards. Of the Spanish only about 15,000 had been born in Spain and, thus, were peninsulares. The remainder on the Spaniards, the criollos, had been born in Mexico. The greatest concentration of peninsulares was in the capital of Mexico City.Hamill Jr., Hugh M. (1966), The Hidalgo Revolt: Prelude to Mexican Independence, Gainesville: University of Florida Press, p. 19 The non-Spanish 82 percent of the population consisted of 22 percent mestizo (people with descent from both indigenous peoples and Spaniards) and other mixed-blood peoples, and 60 percent members of one of many indigenous (American Indian) groups.Cuello, Jose (2005), \\"Racialized Hierarchies of Power in Colonial Mexican Society,\\" in Choice, Persuasion, and Coercion, ed. by de la Teja, Jesus F. and Frank, Ross, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, pp. 211-212 The rigid casta system in Spanish colonies is important for understanding the origins of the independence movements in Mexico and other Latin American colonies. 1799 November 10. Thirteen young men of modest means and humble families, led by Pedro de la Portilla, were ordered arrested by Viceroy Miguel Jos√© de Azanza in Mexico City on grounds of fomenting a 105th rebellion against Spanish rule. The event was called the Conspiracy of the Machetes because the young men had only two guns and 50 machetes and sabers to carry out their plan to assault the palace and take the viceroy prisoner. The group was betrayed by one of their number. They were sentenced to prison. Portilla lived long enough to see Mexico gain its independence. The conspiracy is considered a precursor of the independence movement and illustrates the enmity between criollos and the ruling class of peninsulares.\\"Hamill, pp. 93-94 1808 June 6. Napoleon Bonaparte of France installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king of Spain. A revolt, called the Peninsular War, against the French occupation of Spain intensified. Spanish colonies overseas questioned the legitimacy of the Spanish government. The Viceroy of New Spain, Jos√© de Iturrigaray, and his council in Mexico City affirmed their support for the deposed Spanish king, Ferdinand VII, and refused to accept French representation in the council.Hamill, p. 95 * August 25. A Peruvian-born priest, Melchor de Talamantes, wrote a paper to the city council of Mexico City asserting reasons that justified a colony claiming independence from its home country. Those reasons included secession when the home country was dominated by another country, as Spain was by France, and when popular sentiment favored independence.Hamill, pp 94-97 * September 16. Viceroy Iturrigaray was deposed in a coup d'etat by the peninsulares. Although born in Spain, Iturrigaray was considered pro-criollo and his removal from office was illustrative of the ongoing political conflict between Spaniard- born peninsulares and Mexican-born criollos.Kinsbruner, Jay (2000), Independence in Spanish America,, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, pp. 43-44 1809 December 21. The Mexican authorities uncovered the \\"Conspiracy of Valladolid\\" in what is today Morelia, Michoacan. The conspirators were a group of mostly military officers headed by Jos√© Mariano Michelena and Jos√© Maria Garcia Obeso. The movement began in the city of Valladolid (today Morelia, Michoacan). The conspirators intended to establish a junta in Mexico City, repudiating any attempt by France to exercise influence in Mexico and ruling in the name of the deposed Spanish monarch, Ferdinand VII. The conspirators were betrayed and arrested. The punishment meted out to them was moderate, with the leaders being sentenced to a comfortable incarceration. The conspiracy was a criollo movement that stopped short of declaring Mexican independence from Spain.\\"Conjura de Valladolid,\\" Historia de Mexico , accessed 25 Jan 2019 1810 September 9. The colonial government of New Spain heard glimmerings of the Queretaro conspiracy. The conspiracy aimed to overthrow the rule of the Peninsulares and their replacement by Criollos. The pretext for the insurrection was the fear that the Peninsulares would turn the rule of Mexico over to the French. The tentacles of the conspiracy had spread from the city of Queretaro throughout the Bajio region. The conspirators included military officers Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama, the Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo, and the Mayor (Corregidor) of Queretaro, Miguel Dominguez, and his wife Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez, called \\"la Corregidora.\\" Hidalgo was selected as the leader of the conspiracy, partially because it was believed he could attract the mestizos and indigenous people of the Bajio to the cause. The date planned for the beginning of the insurrection was October 2.Hamill, pp. 101-116 * September 15. La Corregidora in Queretaro learned the government had begun arresting conspirators. She sent messengers, Ignacio Perez and Juan Aldama, to Dolores, some distant, to warn Hidalgo. Allende was visiting Hidalgo in Dolores.Hamill, pp. 106, 117-118 * September 16. At 2 a.m. Hidalgo and Allende were awakened by Aldama and advised that the conspiracy was in danger of being quashed by the government. Meeting with other conspirators, they decided to initiate the revolt immediately. In the early morning Hidalgo rang the church bells, assembled his followers to worship, and made a speech, the \\"grito\\" or Cry of Dolores, which set in motion the Mexican War of Independence. Hidalgo affirmed support for King Ferdinand VII and demanded the end of economic abuses by peninsulares. Accounts differ as to whether he called for the full independence of Mexico from Spain. Hidalgo and his followers, 500 to 800 men, took over Dolores and advanced southward. By nightfall, they took control of San Miguel de Allende, home town of Allende and Aldama. Along the way Hidalgo raised a banner with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, who became the symbolic leader of the insurgency.Hamill, p. 118-123 * September 19. Outside the city of Celaya, Hidalgo and Allende sent a letter to the city government threatening to \\"cut the throats of seventy-eight Europeans\\" held prisoners if the insurgent army was fired upon.Hamill, p. 182 * September 24. The Bishop of Michoacan excommunicated Hidalgo, Allende, Aldama, and Mariano Abasolo.Hamill, p, 152 * September 28. Conquering cities and gathering more men as he marched, Hidalgo and his army of 25,000, primarily indigenous people and mestizos, defeated the defenders of Guanajuato City, storming the fortified granary (Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas). They sacked the city and slaughtered many inhabitants.Hamill, p. 124 File:Dolores hidalgo.jpgStatue of Hidalgo and the church of the \\"grito.\\" File:Ignacio Allende.jpgIngnacio Allende File:Juan Aldama.pngJuan Aldama File:Josefa Ortiz, √≥leo sobre tela.jpgJosefa Ortiz de Dominguez.

In support of Hidalgo, a mestizo priest, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, started a military campaign to expel the Spaniards from the state of Guerrero. This came to be called \\"Morelos' First Campaign.\\" Initially he had only 25 men, but he quickly added many more as he progressed.Timmons, Wilbert H. (1963), Morelos: Priest, Soldier, Statesman of Mexico, El Paso: Texas Western College Press, p. 44 Unlike Hidalgo, Morelos invested time and effort in training his men. He imposed strict discipline and forbade looting.Henderson, Timothy J. (2009), The Mexican War of Independence, New York: Hill and Wang, page 114 * October 30. Marching toward Mexico City with a disorganized army of 60 to 80 thousand men, Hidalgo defeated a much smaller royalist army in the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. With his army in the outskirts of Mexico City, Hidalgo inexplicably ordered a retreat. The insurgent army had suffered heavy casualties in the battle and many desertions afterwards and failed to gain much support from the Criollos, indigenous people, and mestizos in and near the capital city.Hamill, pp 178-179 * November 7. With an army reduced to about 40,000 men, Hidalgo was defeated by a royalist army of 7,000 at Aculco.Hamill, p. 180-181 * November 9. Jos√© Antonio Torres, a mestizo, secured the surrender of Guadalajara, the second city of Mexico, to insurgent forces.Hamill, p. 147 * November 19. Ignacio Allende proposed to Hidalgo that the insurgents concentrate their forces in Guanajuato. He said that the royalist forces were advancing and public opinion \\"may shortly be converted into a hatred for us and for our government.\\" Hidalgo ignored Allende's recommendation and advanced toward Guadalajara.Hamill, p. 184 * November 24. Allende and his soldiers were forced by royalist pressure to abandon Guanajuato. After his departure a mob killed 138 peninsulares who had earlier been taken prisoner.Hamill, p. 184 * November 26. Hidalgo and 7,000 followers entered Guadalajara in triumph, the entry to the city prepared by Torres. Hidalgo began setting up the machinery of government in Guadalajara and appealed to criollos, mestizos, and indigenous people to support the insurgency. During December, Hidalgo dropped the fiction that the insurgency supported ousted Spanish king Ferdinand VII and openly declared that the goal was complete independence for Mexico.Hamill, pp. 184-196 * December 12. Suspecting a plot against his rule, Hidalgo ordered the execution of at least 350 Spanish-born peninsulares in Guadalajara. Allende, who had joined Hidalgo in Guadalajara, contemplated poisoning Hidalgo to \\"end the evil he was doing.\\"Rodriguez O., Jaime E. (2012), We are Now the True Spaniards: Sovereignty, Revolution, Independence, and the Emergency of the Federal Republic of Mexico, 1808-1824, Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, pp. 138-139 1811 The route of Miguel Hidalgo's military campaigns, 1810-1811. * January 8.

Aware that a royalist army under the command of F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja del Rey was advancing on Guadalajara, Allende and Mariano Abasolo led the insurgent army out of the city at to a plain near Calderon Bridge where they planned to meet the oncoming royalists.Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional, , accessed 29 January 2019 * January 17. In the Battle of Calderon Bridge, 6,000 well armed and disciplined royalist soldiers defeated the insurgent army of up to 100,000 poorly armed and untrained men. This was a decisive battle; afterwards the insurgent leaders and their diminished number of loyal soldiers were on the run, pursued by the royalists.Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional * January 21. The Casas Revolt in Texas overturned royalist rule and the insurgents ruled Texas for 39 days before a counter-coup upset them.Almaraz, pp. 452-454 * January 24‚Äì25. In flight after the Battle of Calderon Bridge, insurgent leaders met at the Pabellon hacienda, near Aguascalientes. Hidalgo was stripped of his command, and Allende was selected to replace him. However, the decision was kept secret, with Hidalgo remaining the puppet leader. Hidalgo became a virtual prisoner, warned that he would be executed if he attempted to leave the army.Hamill, p. 205 * February 24. The main body of the insurgent army, led by Allende, arrived in Saltillo to join Jim√©nez who had taken control of many areas in northern Mexico. The objective of the insurgents was to continue their retreat to the United States where they hoped to find support for Mexican independence.Harris III, Charles H. (1975), A Mexican Family Empire, Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 129 * March 17. Rebel leaders Allende, Jim√©nez, and Aldama, Hidalgo, and more than 1,000 soldiers of the insurgent army departed Saltillo to march north to Monclova to continue their flight toward the United States.

Ignacio L√≥pez Ray√≥n, left behind in Saltillo after the departure of Hidalgo and Allende, abandoned the city and led 3,500 men with 22 cannons southward, seeking a refuge from the advancing royalist armies.

After a long flight southward and many skirmishes with royalist forces, Ray√≥n found a safe-haven in Zitacuaro, Michoacan and formed a revolutionary government, the \\"Junta of Zitacuaro,\\" headed by himself. Among the members of the Junta was Jos√© Maria Morelos, the leader of the insurgent forces in the state of Guerrero.Zarate, pp. 259-261 The junta never became effective because the insurgency had fragmented into four areas, each controlled by a different leader.Guedea, Virginia (Feb 2000), \\"The Process of Mexican Independence,\\" The American Historical Review, Vol. 105, No. 1, p. 123.

The district encompasses 1,019 contributing buildings in a predominantly residential section of Brooklyn. The district features noteworthy examples of Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival, Renaissance Revival, Beaux-Arts, and Colonial Revival style architecture. It largely developed between about 1853 and 1942, and consists of densely constructed rowhouses, townhouses, two-family houses, semi-attached houses, freestanding houses, flats, apartment buildings, and institutional and commercial buildings. Notable buildings include the former Union League Club Building (c. 1889), Union United Methodist Church (1889-1891), Brooklyn Methodist Episcopal Church Home (1889, 1913), Bedford Central Presbyterian Church (1897, 1906), Hebron French Speaking Seventh Day Adventist Church (1909), St. Gregory the Great Roman Catholic Church (1915-1916), and the former Kings County Savings Bank (1929-1930).

It was one of the opening engagements of Operation Crusader and the first tank battle in North Africa where Italian armoured forces achieved a success, after their previous poor performance during Operation Compass.  Background  On 15 November 1941 General Claude Auchinleck, commander of the Eighth Army, launched Operation Crusader, aimed at forcing the Axis army in Libya to lift the siege of Tobruk and, if possible, to retreat from Cyrenaica. The Eighth Army was composed of the XIII Corps, formed of infantry divisions, and of the XXX Corps, which included the 7th Armoured Division, formerly belonging to the Western Desert Force and one of the authors of the destruction of the Italian Tenth Army during Operation Compass. The British plan was to circumvent the Italo-German positions on their southern side, with the 7th Armoured Division, and then to attack the Axis forces besieging Tobruk. In the same days, Erwin Rommel was planning a new attack on Tobruk, and had therefore gathered his forces on the north-west, between Tobruk and the Egyptian border, near the coast. The Ariete division was given the task of facing the XIII Corps (on the eastern flank) and defending the road junction at Bir el Gubi, from where supplies headed for Bir Hakeim, Giarabub, Sidi Omar, Tobruk and El Adem were sent.  Prelude  = Forces involved = The Ariete Division, under the command of general Mario Balotta, included the 132nd Tank Regiment with three battalions (VII, VIII, IX Battalions) equipped with M13/40 medium tanks, the 32nd Tank Regiment with three more battalions (I, II, III) equipped with Fiat L3 tankettes, the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment with two motorized Bersaglieri battalions (V and XII) and one Infantry support gun battalion (III), the 132nd Artillery Regiment with two 75/27 mm gun Groups, one Blackshirt Artillery Militia (Milmart) Battery with three 102/35 gun trucks and one section of the 6th Milmart Battery with two 102/35 gun trucks.Antonio Maraziti, L'\\"Ariete\\" a Bir el-Gobi, Storia Militare N¬∞ 136 January 2005, p. 5 As the 32nd Tank Regiment was deployed far away and would not take part in the battle with its L3 tankettes, the Italian forces involved in the battle would be about 130 M13/40 medium tanks. The Commonwealth forces tasked with attacking Bir el Gubi consisted of the 22nd Armoured Brigade (Brigadier John Scott-Cockburn) consisting of three armoured regiments - the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and the 3rd and 4th County of London Yeomanry, one motorised infantry company of the 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, one battery of the 4th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery with eight 25 pdr guns, one anti-tank artillery section with 2 pdr guns, one light anti- aircraft battery with Bofors 40 mm guns, and the 11th Hussars as a reconnaissance force. Overall, the Commonwealth forces involved in the attack had 150 Crusader tanks plus a number of armoured cars.  Battle  On 15 November the Ariete Division, facing the XXX Corps on the eastern flank, was re-deployed on the southern flank, as concentrations of British forces (the 7th Armoured Division) had been detected near Fort Maddalena. The defense was then re-organized in a line of strongholds held by Bersaglieri, directly supported by 47/32 mm guns and 81 mm mortars, and indirectly supported by the 75/27 mm batteries. Fortification work started at once, and was continued till noon on 18 November. The 7th Armoured Division was divided in three armoured brigades, the 4th, 7th and 22nd Armoured Brigade (the latter having been detached from the 1st Armoured Division). The 4th moved directly north from its bases, in order to support the advance of XXX Corps, while the 7th headed for Sidi Rezegh (where the Axis air bases were) and the 22nd (on the left flank of the 7th) headed for Bir el Gubi, aiming at driving off the Ariete Division and then attack the 21st Panzer Division from the rear. The 22nd Armoured Brigade was preceded by the armoured cars of the 11th Hussars Regiment, employed as a scouting force. = 18 November = At 14:00 on 18 November the British armoured cars (Squadron B of the 11th Hussars) were spotted about 10 km south east of Bir el Gubi by a platoon of M13/40, which closed in on them and opened fire. The armoured cars, having a higher speed, easily disengaged and broke contact. The oncoming darkness prevented a section of Royal Horse Artillery from approaching to allow the armoured cars to carry on the reconnaissance. Meanwhile, some British aircraft bombed the bulk of the Ariete, wounding some men and destroying a tractor of the 132nd Artillery Regiment. Upon learning of the enemy's appearance, Balotta ordered his division to assume a defensive formation. The frontline held by the Bersaglieri was shortened, and the five Milmart gun trucks were deployed just north of Bir el Gubi; the 132nd Tank Regiment was deployed six kilometres north-west of Bir el Gubi, in order to repel potential counterattacks and to cover the road to El Adem. The 3rd, 5th and 12th Bersaglieri Battalions held the defensive line. = 19 November = In the morning of 19 November, the 22nd Armoured Brigade moved towards Bir el Gubi, again preceded by armoured cars of the 11th Hussars. The 3rd Company of the VII Tank Battalion (M13/40 tanks), supported by a section of 75/27 guns, counterattacked and forced the armoured cars to retreat. The Italian tanks were however uncovered on their right flank; 25-pdr fire from the Royal Horse Artillery prevented them from advancing, and they were thus circumvented and attacked from the rear by the Crusaders of Squadron H/2, Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. The Italians lost three M13/40s (and several men, including three officers) in the fight and then retreated to their lines, along with the artillery section.Italian military personnel in a radio truck, Bir el Gobi, November 1941 After this action, the armoured cars of the 11th Hussars returned to the front of the brigade, and, around 12:00, they sighted the Bersaglieri defensive line about 4,5 km south of Bir el Gubi. Meanwhile, at 10:30 the 22nd Armoured Brigade, supported by Royal Horse Artillery fire, advanced with 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars on the right and 4th County of London Yeomanry on the left, while 3rd County of Londonr Yeomanry was kept in reserve. The first Italian unit to be engaged was the III Bersaglieri Infantry Support Gun Battalion; not having been fully deployed yet, the battalion was overrun by the tanks of Squadron H/2, Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. A platoon of M13/40 tanks of IX Battalion was sent to help the Bersaglieri, but was destroyed by the combined action of Squadrons G and H of 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, the Italian platoon commander being among the killed. Squadron F of 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars instead faced the V Bersaglieri Battalion, which, being well-entrenched and supported by Milmart artillery, halted the British advance. The British tanks then regrouped and Squadrons F and G of 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars managed to break through the line held by the III Infantry Gun Battalion, thus opening their way north. 4th County of London Yeomanry headed towards the (not yet fortified) positions held by the XII Bersaglieri Battalion, but Squadron A, leading the attack, was stopped by Italian artillery fire, while Squadron B attempted to overtake the Italian right flank, in order to outflank the Bersaglieri battalion. Several British tanks managed to break through the strongholds, and they cut off the regimental command, which rejoined XII Battalion with difficulty. The situation had become critical for the Italian defenders. At 13:30, 132nd Tank Regiment launched a counterattack; the 1st Company of the VII Tank Battalion, closely followed by the 2nd Company and by the entire VIII Battalion (overall 60 Italian tanks), was sent south to attack the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. The Italian tanks heavily engaged the two British regiments, eventually outflanking them and forcing them to retreat. Squadron C of 4th County of London Yeomanry was sent to try to circumvent the Bersaglieri positions, but the attempt was stopped by the fire of the Italian anti-tank guns and by the Milmart gun trucks, which inflicted heavy losses on the British troops. 3rd County of London Yeomanry was moved to cover the right flank of 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and it managed to take by surprise the Italian tank platoon that had outflanked the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars on the right side; the British tanks quickly defeated the Italian tanks, then they left Squadron B in defensive formation to keep contact with the other regiment, while the British regimental command advanced. At this point, however, the British force ran into the Bersaglieri anti-tank defenses, which soon knocked out four tanks, including the one of the regimental commander. At 16:30, 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was forced to retreat, under pressure from Italian tanks, and constantly kept under the fire of anti-tank guns and gun trucks. 4th County of London Yeomanry also withdrew; 3rd County of London Yeomanry, which had been less worn out by the previous fight, was ordered at 16:50 to regroup to try a new attack, but the losses suffered induced a countermand at 17:50. The attack of 22nd Armoured Brigade had completely failed.  Aftermath  The Battle of Bir el Gubi had been an impressive victory for the Italians. They had not only stood up under the weight of a large British armored offensive but inflicted heavy damage to the attacker while retaining the ground they defended. With their forces unexpectedly tied up with the Italians, only one full-strength Armored unit reached Sidi Rezegh. Rommel's Afrika Korps subsequently crushed it. The battle might have turned out differently had the British hit the Afrika Korps with the intended strength they had planned for. This marked the failure of the initial British move in Operation Crusader, an operation which would later succeed in forcing the Italian-German forces to retreat through a subsequent attrition battle. = Casualties and losses = On the Italian side, 132nd Tank Regiment lost 34 tanks (29 M13/40s and five light tanks) and 132 men (5 officers and 11 men were killed, 5 officers and 45 men were wounded, and one officer and 65 men were missing), while the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment suffered 9 killed, 18 wounded and 17 missing and the 132nd Artillery Regiment had six wounded and lost one gun and three vehicles.A British Crusader tank abandoned at Bir el Gubi in the winter of 1941. British tank losses are somewhat debated; 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars lost 30 tanks and 50 men (11 killed, 19 wounded and 20 missing), 4th County of London Yeomanry lost eight tanks and 26 men (4 killed and 22 missing) and 3rd County of London Yeomanry reported the loss of four tanks, six men killed and an unspecified number of wounded. Nearly all of the British missing were taken prisoner. Some sources, however, claim that whereas British war diaries revealed accurate losses for 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and 4th County of London Yeomanry, the losses reportedly suffered by 3rd County of London Yeomanry were incomplete, as they were all related to one single squadron, while the war diaries contain no information about the other squadrons for several days. Correlli Barnett, in his book The Desert Generals, stated that British tank losses at Bir el Gubi amounted to 52 tanks.The Desert Generals After Bir el Gubi the brigade reported that it had lost 82 tanks, and another account stated that it had only 10 to 20 battleworthy tanks left. These figures included not only battlefield losses but also Crusaders lost during the two days leading up to and including the battle due to mechanical problems. = Analysis = The British attack was carried out with the Crusader tanks being used as an autonomous weapon, without infantry support and with only long-range artillery support. Ariete, instead, had learned the German tactics of tank-infantry coordination while training together with the Panzer units of the Afrika Korps during the previous months, and had put it into practice at Bir el Gubi.

The mixtape was announced in 2008 and released on February 6, 2009. It features guest appearances from Mak Mustard, Dame Grease, Meeno, E-Snaps and Maino. Producers on the project include Dame Grease, J.Cardim, Young Los and Rome.  Critical reception  Coke Wave received mixed to very positive reviews from music critics. While initially met with skepticism, it has managed to garner a sizeable cult following among listeners. David Drake of Complex magazine commended the \\"strategic alignment\\" between French and Max B, and complimented Max's songwriting and \\"slurred, sing-song style\\" comparing it to a \\"slick, casual delivery of a drunken street poet.\\" In contrast, Infamous O of XXL magazine was not a fan of the former's slurred delivery style or attempts at harmonizing, but complimented French for his energy and style. David Drake praised the artists' and producer Dame Grease's ability to take instrumentals from varying genres and reinventing them into new molds, such as Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\" which became the inspiration for \\"I Warned U\\" or Sting's \\"Englishman in New York\\" which became the track \\"We Run NY\\". The latter of which, with its Branford Marsalis saxophone and French Montana hook, he termed \\"one of the grittiest, catchiest New York street anthems in recent memory.\\" In 2013, Complex magazine listed the mixtape at #33 on its list of \\"The 50 Best Rapper Mixtapes\\".
