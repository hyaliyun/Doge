It defines details of data that need to be exchanged between software applications in order to support different processes commonly applied at utilities. The MultiSpeak effort is funded by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a Smart Grid Conceptual Reference Model as part of its Smart Grid Standards Framework and Roadmap. NIST has identified 42 standards to support this vision. MultiSpeak was chosen by NIST as a key standard in the Operations area of the NIST Conceptual Model.National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 1.0, NIST Special Publication 1108, January, 2010. The MultiSpeak Specification is the most widely applied de facto integration standard in North America pertaining to distribution utilities. It is currently in use in daily operations of more than 600 electric cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, municipals, and public power districts in at least 15 different countries.MultiSpeak Webpage, accessdate=2013-02-03. Over 80 software vendors active in the utility industry have joined the MultiSpeak initiative and contribute their experience to refining the standard. The MultiSpeak standard makes use of three components: * Definitions of common data semantics: It contains the details of data that need to be exchanged. Data semantics are documented in the form of an extensible markup language (XML) schema. * Definitions of message structure: It defines message structures to support the required data interchanges. Web services calls with specific structures are used for real-time exchanges. * Definition of messages required to support specific business process steps: This details the business process steps to accomplish the data. Comparison between CIM and MultiSpeak * CIM covers transmission, generation and distribution whereas MultiSpeak is distribution focused. * MultiSpeak is focused to meet the needs of electric cooperatives in the US, while IEC 61968 / CIM is focused towards all utilities in the international marketplace. * IEC 61968 is transport independent while MultiSpeak is transport specific. SOAP messages using HTTP, TCP/IP sockets connections directly between applications, and file-based transfers are used for transferring data in MultiSpeak. * Both standards use XML Schema for definition of messages and focus on interfaces between applications, as opposed to data structures internal to applications. * Message headers can be readily mapped between MultiSpeak and IEC 61968 but mapping of message content between the two is more complex. Harmonization between MultiSpeak and 61968 In June 2008 MultiSpeak and WG14 announced an initiative to establish two sets of standards that will lead towards harmonization of their respective specifications. After completion of the same, this will provide a mapping between MultiSpeak Version 4.0, IEC 61970 Version 13, and IEC 61968 Version 10. Two sets of standard work planned for the same are listed below: * IEC 61968-14-1-3 to 14-1-10 http://xtensible.net.s60489.gridserver.com/wp-content/uploads/grid- interop-08-mcnaughton-robinson-gray-multispeak-cim-interoperability.pdf ‚Äî Proposed IEC Standards to Map IEC61968 and MultiSpeak Standards. * IEC 61968-14-2-3 to 14-2-10 ‚Äî Proposed IEC Standards to Create a CIM Profile to Implement MultiSpeak Functionality.

Trajanopolis has been variously identified; Radet\\"En Phrygie\\", Paris, 1895 locates it at √áarikk√∂y, about three miles from Giaur√∂ren towards the south-east, on the road from U≈üak to Suzusk√∂y, a village abounding in sculptures, marbles and fountains, where the name of the city may be read on the inscriptions. However, RamsayAsia Minor, 149; Cities and Bishopries of Phrygia, 595 continues to identify Trajanopolis with Giaur√∂ren. Modern scholars place it near Ortak√∂y.  History  The only Ancient geographer who speaks of Trajanopolis is Claudius Ptolemy,v, 2, 14, 15 who wrongly places this city in Greater Mysia (another region of Asia Minor). It was founded about 109 by the Grimenothyritae, who obtained permission from Roman emperor Hadrian to give the place the name of his predecessor. It had its own coins. Hierocles calls it Tranopolis.Synecedemus, 668, 150 The Roman Empire and its administrative divisions, ca. 395. For a more detailed version, see this map.  Ecclesiastical history  In the Notitiae Episcopatuum, Traianopolis is usually called Tranopolis, and is mentioned as an episcopal see up to the 13th century, among the suffragans of Laodicea, the capital and Metropolitan see of the Roman province of Phrygia Pacatiana Prima. Le Quien names seven bishops of Trajanopolis: * John, present at a Council of Constantinople in 459 under the Patriarch Gennadius I * John, at the Council of Constantinople under Patriarch Menas in 536 * Asignius, at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 * Tiberius, at the Council in Trullo in 692 * Philip, at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 * Eustathius, at the Council of Constantinople (879-880). * Another, doubtless more ancient than the preceding, Demetrius, is known from one inscription.C.

Tommy Tom Furey was a native of Oranbeg, Oranmore, and was a founding member of the Oranmore Irish volunteers, established in 1914. Too young to carry a gun, he became a dispatch rider. On the Tuesday after Easter Sunday 1916, the Oranmore Company assembled at 10.00 a.m. under the command of Captain Joe Howley. Furey participated in the following attack on the local R.I.C. station, which failed. They retreated to Clairinbridge where they were joined by the Clarinbridge and Maree companies, following which the three companies march back to Oranmore, and decided to march to Athenry to join up with the local company under command of Larry Lardner. This followed on information that a detachment of the British army led by Captain Morcombe were on the way from Galway. Captain Morcombe and his force reached the centre of Oranmore just as the last of the volunteers were leaving and a brief battle ensued. Furey remained with the volunteers over the next ten days, and participated in the seizing of Moyode Castle, Athenry. With the failure of the rebellion in Dublin the Galway companies disbanded, Furey and his brother Patsy returning home. They, along with almost all of the Oranmore company, were arrested, though their brother Johnny escaped to Connemara. Transferred to Arbour Hill, Dublin, the Furey brothers were two of fourteen men from Oranmore - including their cousin, Tom Furey of Bushfield - court martialed and sentenced to five years penal servitude. They were shipped to Britain, serving time in Dartmoor prison. Furey met √âamon de Valera, also imprisoned at Dartmoor, and participated in a protest against wearing prison clothes. This resulted in Furey being chained to Thomas Ashe, Eoin McNeill, Tommy Hunter, J.J. Walsh, and Bill Cosgrave for the duration of their day-long transfer to Lewes Prison, Brighton. In Lewes, Furey against participated in agitation, this time to be accorded Prisoner of War status, which resulted in being chained in gangs of seven and a diet of bread and water. On 15 June 1917, all prisoners were released and given five shillings to return to Ireland. He had served time in a total of eight prisons. On being asked by his granddaughter, Brenda Furey, why he never tried to escape, he stated \\"Your couldn't, there would be police with ammunition, continually walking around the wall, and even if we did where would we go because we didn't even know the country.\\" Upon his return, he and other prisoners posed for a group photograph. In later life he was a valued source for local historians on the background and events of the Easter Rebellion in Galway, the only other one in the country outside of Dublin.

Moses Radio provided smooth RnB vocals while Weasel's contribution is a fusion of reggae, ragga and dancehall vibes. Because of their prominence, Moses Radio and Weasel have formed their own duo known as Radio and Weasel. The Lead singer Moses and Vocalist Radio died on 1 February 2018 from brain injuries after an assault by a bouncer at a club in Entebbe. Radio's attacker threw him down about onto a concrete pavement which resulted in massive intracranial hemorrhage. Radio and Weasel also formed The Goodlyfe Crew. The crew saw many changes in its set-up but at various times included Chagga, Lenin Briton, and Lawrence (Goodlyfe Crew). Many of its members had their own solo projects and collaborations. Radio and Weasel Moses Radio (birth name Moses Nakintije Ssekibogo) had a prosperous musical career. He studied his ordinary level from 1998 to 2001 at Holy Cross Lake View Secondary School in Jinja, where he served as president of the school's Youth Alive Club. He composed musical projects for the club that succeeded in inter-school Youth Alive Club competitions. In 2002, Radio studied at Kiira College Butiki in Jinja where he had a two-year break in his musical career concentrating on his studies. He later joined Jose Chameleone's Leone Island Crew in 2004. While working as Chameleone's backing vocalist, Radio released solos on Leone Island Records. These include \\"Jennifer\\", \\"Dagala\\", \\"Wololo\\" and \\"Sweet Lady\\". Sweet Lady was well received, though Radio's public profile remained low. Weasel (born Douglas Mayanja) started as an independent artist who released solo projects under the auspices of his elder brother's records, but it was his collaboration with Chameleone on \\"Bomboclat\\" that caught audience attention. Radio and Weasel became backing vocalists for the greatly popular Ugandan musician Jose Chameleone, but later broke off from Chameleone's Leone Island Crew in 2008 to form the Goodlyfe Crew. The duo Radio and Weasel songs have been successful on Ugandan radio. Starting with \\"Nakudata\\" in 2008, the duo released \\"Lwaki Onumya\\", \\"Zuena\\", \\"Nyambura\\" and \\"Bread and Butter\\". In mid-2008, the duo collaborated with artists such as Rachel Kay, Blu*3, OS, Allan Toniks, GNL and Zambia's General Ozzy. They performed live and collaborated with Ugandan artist Keko. of recently, they new African faces further with the likes of PJ Powers, with their song dubbed \\"Home to Africa\\", with Jamaican superstar on their jam \\"Fire & Butter\\" The super talented duo have further their road to success by collaborating with the Warner Music Group twin brothers Locnville in their single Done Goodlyfe Crew members Radio And Weasel were also the lead performers of Goodlyfe Crew.

In 2010, Radio and Weasel recorded \\"Maama Wabaana\\" with Tom Close. and in 2013, they recorded with Desire Luzinda, and \\"Hellena\\" with David Lutalo. In March 2011 a new dispute arose in Kampala between Radio/Weasel and Kenzo. This dispute stemmed from Kenzo's song \\"Mundeke Numbe\\". The Goodlyfe Crew claimed that the whole concept of the song and video was copied from their song \\"Talk and Talk\\". In December 2013, Radio and Weasel fought a famous musical battle with Bebe Cool. Dubbed \\"The Battle of the Champions\\", it was held at Kyadondo Rugby grounds. Chameleone praised the Goodlyfe Crew for their performance; he also praised Bebe Cool. No clear decision emerged. This also led into resolving of their dispute with their former Leone Island boss Chameleone and Radio and Weasel teamed up again with Chamleone for the first time since their breakup in 2008. This prompted the duo to share the stage with Chameleone in the Tubonge concert of 2014. In 2013 the two claimed to have ended their dispute with Gagamel singer Bebe Cool as well.

The network involves more than 8,000 decision-makers from all over the region and beyond. History March 2014 former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Lene Espersen replaced the interim Chairwoman, Mrs. Helle Bechgaard as chairwoman of Baltic Development Forum. Until November 2011, Baltic Development Forum was chaired by Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark 1982-1993. Mr. Ellemann-Jensen is co-founder of Baltic Development Forum (in 1998) and the Council of the Baltic Sea States (1992). Former CEO of Confederation of Danish Industry Hans Skov Christensen replaced Uffe Ellemann-Jensen as chairman. When Hans Skov Christensen died in autumn 2013 he was provisionally replaced by Member of the Board, Mrs. Helle Bechgaard. The Baltic Development Forum Honorary Board and Advisory Board consist of high-level political dignitaries and prominent business executives and researchers representing the entire Baltic Sea Region. Director of Baltic Development Forum is Hans Brask since August 2007. His background is in international affairs. He holds a MA in Political Science from the University of Aarhus (1990) and an MA in History and Philosophy from the University of Essex, UK (1990).  Mission  The mission of Baltic Development Forum is to promote the Baltic Sea Region as an integrated, prosperous and internationally competitive growth region, to position the Baltic Sea Region in the EU and on the global map. Baltic Development Forum has consolidated its position as internationally recognized think-tank and networking organization that wants to inspire and challenge national and international decision-makers within business and government in the Baltic Sea Region. The Region‚Äôs potential and challenges are highlighted at the Summit as an important part of an increasingly globalised world. BDF offers a unique platform for innovative thinking, informal cross-sector/cross- border/cross-level encounters and concrete new business opportunities with a global perspective.  Main activities  The Annual Summit takes place in different capitals and metropolis in the Baltic Sea Region - 1999: Copenhagen; 2000: Malm√∂; 2001: Copenhagen; 2002: St. Petersburg; 2003: Riga; 2004: Hamburg; 2005: Stockholm; 2006: Helsinki; 2007: Tallinn; 2008: Copenhagen/Malm√∂; 2009: Stockholm; 2010: Vilnius; 2011: Gda≈Ñsk; 2012: Copenhagen/Malm√∂; 2013: Riga. 2014: Turku, Finland. Baltic Development Forum's Baltic Sea Award has been established together with Swedbank as sponsor in 2007. Recipient of the Award is given to personalities that have made an extraordinary contribution to the future of the region. Baltic Development Forum publishes different reports in order to support a common regional agenda for integration, innovation and sustainable growth. The State of the Region Report has developed into a key reference document on tracking the region's competitiveness and economic development. Nordic Council of Ministers, European Investment Bank, and Nordic Investment Bank have co-sponsored this report. Baltic Development Forum also carries out different cooperation projects with partners from many parts of the region in the field of energy, water, investment promotion, transport, branding and ICT. Baltic Development Forum has been a key supporter of the EU's adoption of an EU strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. In October 2009, the European Council of the EU endorsed the first EU strategy for a macro-regional area of the EU. The Baltic Sea Region thereby has the chance to make an innovative combination of European and regional integration and news efforts to improve territorial cohesion of the EU according to EU's Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region.  The History of the Region  The Baltic Sea Region comprises 11 nations and more than 100 million inhabitants. The Baltic Development Forum defines the Baltic Sea Region as including the Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, Northern Germany (Hansestadt Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein), Northern Poland (Pomorskie, Warminsko-Mazurskie and Zachodnio-Pomorskie), and Russia's Northwestern region including Kaliningrad. The region shares many historical ties, which often are symbolized by the legacy of the Hanse around the Baltic Sea. Thus, the Baltic Sea has been the facilitator of integrative processes in more than 1000 years with more intensive periods than other. Naturally, the Cold War to a large extent hindered extended cooperation, but when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 new strong ties emerged. Nowadays the Baltic Sea Region is interlaced by a myriad of formal and informal cross-border organisations and fora signalising the multidimensional scale of interaction.

The story combines three principle themes: the Nordic passion for winter sports; the prejudices, rivalries and stereotypes of the Nordic nations; the role of McDonald's as the largest host of diverse people and fun experiences in the region.Renegademedia, McDonald's Premieres \\"Dreaming In Mono\\"  Story  Dreaming in Mono is a fictional drama revolving around McDonald's customer and former professional alpine skier Alain Duchamp and his archrival Hansi Von Spitzmark. The two rivals regularly competed against each other in the 1970s with fundamentally different styles and philosophies concerning their approach to life and to their sport. In one particular race Alain attempted to race against Hansi by using his revolutionary new monoski. Hansi quickly reported Alain to the relevant ski governing body and Alain was disqualified and never raced again. Hansi, meanwhile, won gold after gold medal and became an international celebrity. Fast-forward to the present day and Alain is based somewhere remote in the northern borderlands of Sweden, Finland and Norway still unable to come to terms with what happened so long ago. He devises a plan to exact his revenge on Hansi and enlists a disparate group of Nordic characters to help him.  Characters  *Alain Duchamp: Former alpine ski professional. Founder of 'Team Monoski' *Hansi Von Spitzmark: 1970s alpine ski legend. Poet, recording artist and media celebrity *Terje Olsen: Obsessive but shy Norwegian monoski engineer *Lene Olsen: Terje‚Äôs long-suffering wife *'Mad Mads' Steen: Self-styled Danish daredevil and extreme sports enthusiast *Lovisa Svensson: Talented Swedish snowboarder *Tiina Nieminen: Tough, independent Finnish entrepreneur and former love interest of Alain Duchamp *Yasmine Carlsson: Ambitious young Swedish documentary filmmaker *Carlos: Reluctant documentary cameraman from Spain *Tony Giuseppe Giacosa: Hansi‚Äôs loyal sidekick and bodyguard  Content  Dreaming in Mono combines a 56-minute-long drama (divided into 7x8 minute episodes) with character interviews by the fictional documentary filmmaker Yasmine, history of monoskiing backstories, character songs and videos, website, character Myspace and Facebook pages, character Twitter feeds. The aim of the initiative was to connect via non-traditional and social media with an audience difficult to reach through conventional marketing tactics and messages.McDonald's Next Step: Create the Content, Control the Media. Burger Business, February 2, 2010 A number of elements were also designed to enable the audience to interact with the content both live and online including: Hansi 'Two Sides of Me' song remix; iPhone 'random menu generator' application, online 'McDate' tool, polls, competitions, 'Mad Mads' milkshake flashmob live events, Facebook Fan pages and the opportunity to comment or start discussions on both the site and social media pages.Viralblog.com January 30, 2010  Branding elements  The McDonald's name only appears in the introduction title to each episode: \\"McDonald's Nordic Presents\\". Much of the story then takes place in and around a McDonald's restaurant in the far north. Familiar products such as Chicken McNuggets, Big Mac, juice, coffee and soda are visible in the restaurant scenes.  Transmedia activation  Dreaming in Mono launched in mid-January 2010 with movie-style trailers and ran until the end of February across TV and cinema media, video sites, social media sites, print media and in McDonald's own restaurants within the Nordic region. The 7 episodes were released weekly both online on Vimeo, YouTube and MSN Video and broadcast with exclusive TV station partners either as part of the station's program schedule (Sub Finland) or as full 8 minute commercial 'powerbreaks' (TV3 Puls Denmark, Viasat 4 Norway, TV6 Sweden). Both the character interviews and character webpages were released online in advance of and during the episodal broadcast. The timing of the activation was designed to coincide with the build-up to, and closing weekend of, the Vancouver Winter Olympics in which McDonald's was a global sponsor. What makes it stand out from other branded content initiatives is the way in which brand, agency, director and media outlets worked together to extend that story across a variety of platforms, each accentuating the central idea.The Winter's Tale, Boards Magazine, March 1, 2010  Music  Music written by Martin Landqvist, Swedish music producer, recording artist, remixer and songwriter working under the name N√•id. He has produced and remixed music for big artists such as Kent, A-ha, The Cardigans, Meja and Titiyo.

Countries where Frejon is popular include Brazil and Nigeria (especially among Yoruba who returned to Nigeria from Brazil at the abolition of the slave trade, and settled in what is known as the \\"Brazilian Quarters\\" in Lagos Island), and also Sierra Leone on Good Friday, or for functions such as weddings. Because dairy foods and flesh meat (beef, pork, goat) are strictly forbidden on Good Friday, this dish is a suitable accompaniment to non-dairy foods such as fried fish and peppered snail. The frejons consumed in Nigeria and West Africa are puddings made of black beans cooked slowly overnight over a wood or charcoal fire, and then mixed with coconut milk to form a thick, sweet, smooth pudding. In certain countries the dish is flavored with cocoa. Frejon is often served with fish stew, peppered snail and Garri Ijebu. Other variations * Pepper, crayfish, salt and tomatoes can be added to the mashed beans and coconut mixture. * Sweet frejon may also be achieved by adding sugar.

Beginning in 1875, when he joined the survey of the American West led by Maj. John Wesley Powell, and continuing through 1881, Pilling did extensive fieldwork and proofread Powell's Report on the lands of the arid region of the United States (1879).J. W. Powell, Report on the lands of the arid region of the United States, with a more detailed account of the lands of Utah, 2nd ed., U.S. Government Printing Office, 1879, 195 pp. (p. 9) Education and early work Pilling attended Gonzaga College, at the time chartered by Congress to offer university degrees but today a Jesuit high school. Having taught himself Pitman shorthand while still in grade school, he became highly proficient as a stenographer, later working for several government agencies. Ethnology career In 1875, John Wesley Powell hired him to help administer the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the Rocky Mountain regions. In 1879, when Powell founded the Bureau of Ethnology (known from 1897 to 1965 as the Bureau of American Ethnology or BAE), Pilling became the bureau's chief clerk. When Powell took over as director of the USGS and of the BAE from Clarence King (1881), Pilling became the USGS chief clerk as well, while continuing his work with the BAE.\\"Pilling, James Constantine (1846-1895), Papers\\" in p. 2 of Guide to the Collections of the National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved 2010-02-04. In his unpaid hours over the next 15 years Pilling compiled an extensive bibliography of books and manuscripts on North American languages. He was also responsible for the initial development of the BAE library and for maintaining its archives system. By 1891, a debilitating illness he had contracted during his years of ethnological fieldwork forced him to resign from such administrative duties, but he continued his ethnology work until his death in 1895. In 1885, the BAE published his labour of love as the 1,200-page Proof- sheets of a Bibliography of North American Indian Languages; only 100 copies were printed. Scholars of American Indian languages, however, gave the work an enthusiastic reception, and their cooperation enabled Pilling subsequently to revise this monumental work and publish a series of bibliographies, each dealing with a particular family of Amerindian languages. Organizing his data sets in card catalogues and using a cross-reference system, between 1887 and 1894, Pilling published revised bibliographies of Eskimo‚ÄìAleut, Siouan‚ÄìCatawban, Iroquoian, Muskogean, Algonquian, Athabaskan, Chinookan, Salishan, and Wakashan language families (Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletins 1, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19). In addition, Pilling had compiled much of the material for a proposed bibliography of Mexican languages, which was not published during his lifetime.Marcus Baker, In memoriam: James Constantine Pilling, 1846-1895\\", D. W. Gregory, 1895, p. 4. Now known as the Uto-Aztecan languages, their kinship was conclusively established by Edward Sapir in the 1920s, but Powell had opposed such a classification scheme. Pilling's Shoshonean languages are now known as Northern Uto-Aztecan, while his Sonoran and Aztec groupings are now both considered among the Southern Uto-Aztecan languages. Pilling died of locomotor ataxia, now called Tabes dorsalis, a disease associated with untreated syphilis, in 1895.W. J.

The programme featured a panel of guests who reviewed developments in the world of the arts and culture. History The Review Show began as Late Review in 1994, a strand within The Late Show, an arts magazine which followed the current affairs programme Newsnight, airing on Thursday nights. On 19 March 2000, it moved to a peaktime Sunday evening slot within the Art Zone strand, and the title shortened to Review, before moving to Friday nights from 23 February 2001 where the review show was appended to Newsnight, and renamed Newsnight Review. Newsnight Review was a consumer survey of the week's artistic and cultural highlights which appeared on Friday evening's edition of Newsnight. The programme featured a chair and a panel of three invited guests who would review a selection of books, plays, films and exhibitions. Mark Lawson was the programme's original main presenter from 2001 to December 2005, having previously presented the Late Review and The Late Show strands. Other presenters included Kirsty Wark, Martha Kearney, Tom Sutcliffe, John Wilson, Natalie Haynes, Tim Marlow, Kwame Kwei-Armah and Hardeep Singh Kohli. Regular reviewers included Allison Pearson, Mark Kermode, Tom Paulin, Tony Parsons, Ekow Eshun and Germaine Greer. As part of the BBC's commitment to moving programmes out of London, it was announced in 2009 that Newsnight Review would end and be replaced by The Review Show, produced from Glasgow. The final edition of Newsnight Review was aired with an hour-long special with a review of the year on 18 December 2009. The Review Show was launched on 22 January 2010, with the same producer as Newsnight Review, and following the same format of a chair and a panel of guests (normally three) reviewing the arts, and still presented by Kirsty Wark and Martha Kearney. As of March 2013 The Review Show was moved to BBC Four and reduced to a monthly, rather than weekly, broadcast. The duration of each episode was increased to an hour. The final episode of the show was aired on 30 March 2014.

Retrotronics is a popular strand within the steampunk movement. At the Oxford exhibition of Steampunk art, a third of the works on show had a strong retrotronic influence, from light fittings of period components through to computer keyboards and webcams of burnished copper and brass. Outside steampunk, similar influences are found amongst the retro-futurist scene. Other sources cite the Maker movement as an influence. A recent musical trend has sought to recapture early 1980s 8-bit game and synthesiser sounds, often referred to as chiptune. Artists such as Kid Carpet perform entire sets on children's toys or pocket synths of the period. Other artists, such as Nullsleep, perform using only period video game hardware. DJs offer dance music events built from samples of period games or gadgets. Quad II power amplifier Some audiophiles and electric guitarists also favour the use of valve (vacuum tube) amplifiers, on the ground of sound quality or particular \\"colour\\". This is still within the scope of retrotronics, but is on a functional ground, rather than aesthetic. Designs of the 1960s are highly sought after today, and still support a market in manufacturing new valves and replacing time-expired components such as electrolytic capacitors. In the audiophile world, such popularity is justified on the basis of sound quality; the earlier valve amplifier designs were free of such artifacts as crossover distortion that beset the early bipolar transistor designs of the 1960s. Despite more recent designs that have removed these problems, the \\"valve sound\\" is still preferred by some, who will pay large amounts to achieve it. It's also notable that almost all recent audiophile valve amplifiers make a deliberate display of their valves and place them visibly on show. Another trend is the mixing of tubes with more up-to-date circuitry; these systems are referred to as a \\"hybrid systems\\". For example, in the Netherlands, the TubeSociety employs this technique.Hybrid systems using Hypex UcD- modulesTubeSociety webpageTentlabs website Amongst guitarists, the goal of a \\"valve sound\\" is different, a deliberate distortion effect achieved through either over-driving valves, or through microphonics, the valve's sensitivity to air vibration as well as electrical signals. Original, or reproduction, guitar amplifiers such as the Vox AC30 now command a premium price. A few guitarists are collecting germanium transistors, and built effect pedals with them, because of the distorted \\"older rock\\" sound of effect pedals built with early germanium transistors. UK 300 series telephone One of the earlier examples of widespread retrotronics was the resurgent popularity of black Bakelite telephones in the UK. In the early 1980s, the UK domestic telephone market was deregulated and for the first time it was possible to legally purchase telephones outright and install them at home through a simple plug and socket. As well as the expected rush for modern lightweight handsets, there was also a brisk trade in 300 series telephones, refurbished internally to modern standards, but as a functional decorator item that appeared unchanged from the 1930s.

Rasmussen was the founder of VELUX and Velfac, Danish window companies. Both foundations are part of VKR Holding A/S, owned by the Rasmussen family and the Villum Foundation, which is the main shareholder. The foundations fund scientific, cultural, artistic and social projects, and award honorary prizes. In 2018, they together granted EUR million 118 divided among 1,015 donations. The money comes from the revenues of the VKR Group and income generated by the foundations‚Äô other assets.  Grants  The foundations support large research activities in the technical and natural sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, the environment, and industrial research, providing money for payroll costs, running expenses and procurement of major research apparatus. The foundation supports research centres, the so- called ‚ÄúCentres of Excellence‚Äù with larger grants. The designation of the centres is made upon the initiative of the foundation. Its visiting professor programme gives funds to Danish research institutions to permit leading professors from international universities to spend a period at Danish universities. Additionally, since 2001, the foundation has financed a postdoctoral program in the natural and technical sciences. Beginning in 2006, it has donated a larger proportion of its grants to social and cultural projects outside Denmark, with a special focus on Hungary, Poland and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe. The Velux Foundation is more narrowly focused. It has a program supporting citizens more than 60 years old who are actively engaged in activities of personal or common interest that contribute to maintaining their active lives. In addition, it supports research into diseases of the eye, diseases among the elderly, and living conditions for elderly people. It also supports larger research projects within the humanities, health and medical sciences.  Awards  Each year the Foundation awards The Villum Kann Rasmussen Annual Award for Technical and Scientific Research to a Danish researcher. The award is the largest Danish research award. The 2008 award was granted to Professor Anja Boisen, Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark, for her research in nanotechnology. The 2009 awards marked the centenary celebration of Villum Kann Rasmussen. One went to Professor Eva Bj√∏rn Vedel Jensen, Department of Mathematical Science Aarhus University, for research in mathematical and statistical methods for three-dimensional imaging of objects such as the brain from one or two-dimensional observations.http://science.au.dk/en/news-and- events/news-article/article/danmarks-stoerste-forskerpris-til-professor-i- matematiske-metoder-ved-aarhus-universitet/ The other went to Professor Jan Oskar Jeppesen, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of Southern Denmark, for producing large and complex organic molecules with unique functional characteristics.

Life and career Cherrett was born in Christchurch. A centre forward who could also play as an inside forward, Cherrett turned professional with Portsmouth in 1920, having started his career with Boscombe. He scored 36 goals in 67 league appearances before losing his place in the team after three seasons. He was transferred to Plymouth Argyle in the summer of 1923 and continued to score goals regularly. Cherrett was the club's top goalscorer in his first season with Argyle, scoring 27 goals in 41 matches, and he scored nine more in 21 games the following season. The arrival of Jack Cock in 1925 saw Cherrett lose his place in the side and he was sold to Crystal Palace later that year. He finished as the club's top goalscorer in the two seasons that he played for Palace, scoring 33 and 32 goals in all competitions, and he also scored two hat-tricks. Cherrett joined Bristol City in 1927, where he scored 15 league goals in 25 appearances, and then moved to Bournemouth & Boscombe in 1928.

Distribution Most Euliini (nearly 98%) are found in the Neotropics and a small number is found in the Nearctic. Only Eulia is found in the Old World, since it has a Holarctic distribution. Diversity The tribe includes over 650 described species in nearly 90 genera. Most species have been described in recent years. Taxonomic history The tribe was first proposed as Euliae by Kuznetsov and Stekolnikov (1977) as a subtribe of Cochylini. Powell elevated the group to tribal status in 1986. Research by Regier et al. in 2012 has provided fairly convincing evidence that Cochylini are a monophyletic lineage within a broader Euliini. If this is accepted, Cochylini should be treated as subtribe Cochylina of Euliini. Biology The larvae of most species are leaf-rollers or leaf-folders. However, some may be gall-inducers or leaf litter- feeders.Encyclopedia of Life Genera Unplaced species *Phtheochroa inexacta Butler, 1883 *Sericoris cauquenensis Butler, 1883 Former genera :Mexiculia :Paraneulia :Pseudargyrotoza References * , 2003: Three new genera, two new species, and some rectifications in neotropical Euliini (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).

He was founding-member of the German artist group M√ºlheimer Freiheit and the Junge Wilde Art movement, which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Dokoupil lives and works between Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, Plovdiv, Dakar and Las Palmas.. Biography Ji≈ô√≠ Dokoupil was born in Krnov, then Czechoslovakia, in 1954. After the invasion of the Soviet army in Prague in 1968, he escaped with his family over Austria to Germany. In 1976 he began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Cologne. Later on he also attended classes at the Universities of Frankfurt and the Cooper Union in New York, where he studied among others under German concept artist Hans Haacke. The influence of Haacke is evident in Dokoupil‚Äòs early work. From 1983‚Äì84 Dokoupil was guest professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of D√ºsseldorf and 1989 in Madrid. In 1979 Dokoupil founded the group M√ºlheimer Freiheit with artists such as Gerhard Naschberger, Hans Peter Adamski, Gerard Kever, Peter B√∂mmels and Walter Dahn. The group was associated with the art dealer Paul Maenz who organised Dokoupil‚Äòs first solo exhibition in 1982. In their shared studio in Cologne on a street named M√ºlheimer Freiheit, the six Jungen Wilden sought to explore a contemporary expression for their art by using a neoexpressive, figurative style of intensely colourful painting with traditional subjects and by overriding the intellectual, reduced formal language of Minimal and Conceptual Art. \\"I‚Äôd come to realize that the conceptual artists had become liars,\\" Dokoupil has said. \\"What they had promised us was salvation, art without form. But I‚Äôd go into a gallery and there would be nothing to see, and it would be for a lot of money ‚Äì that just couldn‚Äôt be it.\\" But already in an early stage Dokoupil developed a less wild, rather unusual method of working and soon found his own radical subjective way with individual considerations. With his \\"book painting\\" shown at Documenta 7, Kassel, in 1982, Dokoupil attracted the attention of the art world. It was a gigantic material painting called God, show me your balls, a kind of homage to a Julian Schnabel plate painting, (which were made of broken ceramic dishes collaged into an image). Schnabel was not invited to participate in the exhibition ‚Äì in Dokoupil‚Äòs eyes a serious effront. Since then ‚Äì besides the early group exhibitions with the M√ºlheimer Freiheit ‚Äì Dokoupil's work has been seen in numerous one-man shows in galleries, museums and at other cultural sites worldwide. Works In accordance with the thesis of Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles. A selection of his series is listed below. *M√ºlheimer Freiheit (1980‚Äì1981) *New School of Cologne (1982) *Blue Paintings about Love (1982) *Documenta Paintings (1982) *Theoretical Paintings (1983) *Terry Cloth Paintings (1983‚Äì1984) *The Pacifier Paintings (1984) *The Apple Maiden (1984) *Children Paintings (1983‚Äì1985) *Corporations & Products (1985‚Äì1986) *Madonnas in Ecstasy (1985‚Äì1987) *Esoteric Paintings (1987) *Jesus Paintings (1986‚Äì1987) *Soot Paintings (Candle and Torch) (1989-today) *Mother's Milk Paintings (1989‚Äì1991) *Tire Paintings (1991‚Äì1992) *Soap Bubble Paintings (1992-today) *The Green Paintings (1996) *Slavic Paintings (1996‚Äì1999) *Pigment Paintings (1998‚Äì2002) *Whip Paintings (2002‚Äì2003) *Buddha Paintings (2003‚Äì2004) *The Arrugadist Paintings (1999‚Äì2005) *Movie Paintings (2007‚Äì2009) Since 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of Soot Paintings, painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling. The Soot Paintings, often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the Subastas- series, of 1989 or recent ones called Leopards(2000‚Äì2009) or \\"Christ\\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his Tire paintings of 1991‚Äì1992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his Soap Bubble Paintings of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates Whip Paintings by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil‚Äòs most recent work is the series of spray-painted Buddhas on canvas. They are meant to be like Buddha, Marilyn and Mona Lisa all at once, since Warhol‚Äòs Marilyn is the Mona Lisa of the 20th century. Even though a retrospective of his oeuvre would resemble a group show of different painters, it has nothing to do with any pluralism of styles, with the claim of the coincidence of styles, or with a variety of post-modern irony. The focus of his multifaceted oeuvre is in fact on exploring original techniques and configurations generating a domain for playful experimentation and physical tension in which new images can arise and assuring that the act of making images is independent of the iconographic compulsions of the media world today. In that sense Dokoupil could be seen as an \\"artist inventor\\": inventor of styles and techniques ultimately a clearly conceptual approach.

At that time, Mohammad Khatami was president.  Khatami's Presidency  Running on a reform agenda, Khatami was elected president on 23 May 1997 in what many have described as a remarkable election. Voter turnout was nearly 80%. Despite limited television airtime, most of which went to conservative Speaker of Parliament and favored candidate Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, Khatami received 70 percent of the vote. \\"Even in Qom, the center of theological training in Iran and a conservative stronghold, 70% of voters cast their ballots for Khatami.\\"1997 Presidential Election He was re- elected on June 8, 2001 for a second term and stepped down on 3 August 2005 after serving his maximum two consecutive terms according to the Islamic Republic's constitution. Khatami supporters have been described as a \\"coalition of strange bedfellows, including traditional leftists, ... business leaders who wanted the state to open up the economy and allow more foreign investment\\" and \\"women and younger voters.\\" The day of his election, the 2nd of Khordad, 1376, in the Iranian calendar, is regarded as the starting date of \\"reforms\\" in Iran. His followers are therefore usually known as the \\"2nd of Khordad Movement\\". Khatami is regarded as Iran's first reformist president, since the focus of his campaign was on the rule of law, democracy and the inclusion of all Iranians in the political decision-making process. However, his policies of reform led to repeated clashes with the hardline and conservative Islamists in the Iranian government, who control powerful governmental organizations like the Guardian Council, whose members are appointed by the Supreme Leader. Khatami lost most of those clashes, and by the end of his presidency many of his followers had grown disillusioned with him. As President, according to the Iranian political system, Khatami was outranked by the Supreme Leader. Thus, Khatami had no legal authority over key state institutions: the armed forces, the police, the army, the revolutionary guards, the state radio and television, the prisons, etc. (See Politics of Iran). Khatami presented the so-called \\"twin bills\\" to the parliament during his term in office, these two pieces of proposed legislation would have introduced small but key changes to the national election laws of Iran and also presented a clear definition of the president's power to prevent constitutional violations by state institutions. Khatami himself described the \\"twin bills\\" as the key to the progress of reforms in Iran. The bills were approved by the parliament but were eventually vetoed by the Guardian Council.  Economic policy  Khatami's economic policies followed the previous government's commitment to industrialization. At a macro-economic level, Khatami continued the liberal policies that Rafsanjani had embarked on in the state's first five-year economic development plan (1990‚Äì1995). On April 10, 2005 Khatami cited economic development, large-scale operations of the private sector in the country's economic arena and the six percent economic growth as among the achievements of his government. He allocated $5 billion to the private sector for promoting the economy, adding that the value of contracts signed in this regard has reached $10 billion. A year into his first term as president of Iran, Khatami acknowledged Iran's economic challenges, stating that the economy was, \\"chronically ill ... and it will continue to be so unless there is fundamental restructuring.\\" For much of his first term, Khatami saw through the implementation of Iran's second five-year development plan. On 15 September 1999, Khatami presented a new five-year plan to the Majlis. Aimed at the period from 2000 to 2004, the plan called for economic reconstruction in a broader context of social and political development. The specific economic reforms included \\"an ambitious program to privatize several major industries ... the creation of 750,000 new jobs per year, average annual real GDP growth of six percent over the period, reduction in subsidies for basic commodities ... plus a wide range of fiscal and structural reforms.\\" Unemployment remained a major problem, with Khatami's five-year plan lagging behind in job creation. Only 300,000 new jobs were created in the first year of the plan, well short of the 750,000 that the plan called for. The 2004 World Bank report on Iran concludes that \\"after 24 years marked by internal post-revolutionary strife, international isolation, and deep economic volatility, Iran is slowly emerging from a long period of uncertainty and instability.\\"SJIR: Khatami and the Search for Reform in Iran At the macroeconomic level, real GDP rose from 2.4 percent in 1997 to 5.9 percent in 2000. Unemployment was reduced from 16.2 percent of the labor force to less than 14 percent. The consumer price index fell to less than 13 percent from more than 17 percent. Both public and private investments increased in the energy sector, the building industry, and other sectors of the country's industrial base. The country's external debt was cut from $12.1 billion to $7.9 billion, its lowest level since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire. The World Bank granted $232 million for health and sewage projects after a hiatus of about seven years. The government, for the first time since the 1979 wholesale financial nationalization, authorized the establishment of two private banks and one private insurance company. The OECD lowered the risk factor for doing business in Iran to four from six (on a scale of seven).[Tahavolat, 98-138; Economic Trends, no. 23 (Tehran: Central Bank, 2000-2001); and Iran: Interim Assistance Strategy (Washington: The World Bank, April 2001).] The government's own figures put the number of people under the absolute poverty line in 2001 at 15.5 percent of the total population ‚Äî down from 18 percent in 1997, and those under relative poverty at 25 percent, thus classifying some 40 percent of the people as poor. Private estimates indicate higher figures.Project MUSE Among 155 countries in a 2001 world survey, Iran under Khatami was 150th in terms of openness to the global economy. On the United Nations' Human Development scale, Iran ranked 90th out of 162 countries, only slightly better than its previous position at 97 out of 175 countries four years earlier.UNDP, Human Development Report 2001 (New York: UNDP, 2001). The overall risk of doing business in Iran improved only marginally from \\"D\\" to \\"C.\\"Iran Economics (Tehran), July/August 2001.  Foreign policy  Vladimir Putin, president of Russia meeting Khatami in Sa'd Abad Palace. During Khatami's presidency, Iran's foreign policy began a process of moving from confrontation to conciliation. In Khatami's notion of foreign policy, there was no \\"clash of civilizations\\", he favoured instead a \\"dialogue among civilizations\\". Relations with the US remained marred by mutual suspicion and distrust, but during Khatami's two terms, Tehran increasingly made efforts to play a greater role in the Persian Gulf region and beyond. As President, Khatami met with many influential figures including Pope John Paul II, Koichiro Matsuura, Jacques Chirac, Johannes Rau, Vladimir Putin, Abdulaziz Bouteflika and Hugo Ch√°vez. In 2003 Khatami refused to meet militant Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.Hoover Institution - Hoover Digest - Order Out of Chaos After the 2003 Bam earthquake in Iran, the Iranian government rebuffed Israel's offer of assistance. On April 8, 2005, Khatami sat near Iranian-born Israeli President Moshe Katsav during the funeral of Pope John Paul II because of alphabetical order. Later, Katsav claimed that he shook hands and spoke with Khatami. Katsav himself is in origin an Iranian Jew, and from a part of Iran close to Khatami's home; he stated that they had spoken about their home province. That would make this incident the first official political contact between Iran and Israel since diplomatic ties were severed in 1979. However, after he returned to Iran, Khatami was subject to harsh criticism from conservatives for having 'recognised' Israel by speaking to its president. Subsequently, the country's state-run media reported that Khatami strongly denied shaking hands and chatting with Katsav.Iranian president denies Israeli handshake - World news - NBC News In 2003, Iran approached the United States with proposals to negotiate all outstanding issues including the nuclear issue and a two-state settlement for Israel and the Palestinians.Washington Post \\"Road Map\\"  Currency crisis  During 1995-2005, Khatami's administration successfully reduced the rate of fall in the value of the Iranian Rial bettering even the record of Mousavi. Nevertheless, the currency continued to fall from 2,046 to 9,005 to the US dollar during his term as president.  Khatami and Iran's 2004 parliamentary election  In February 2004 Parliament elections, the Guardian Council banned thousands of candidates, including most of the reformist members of the parliament and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party from running. This led to a win by the conservatives of at least 70% of the seats. Approximately 60% of the eligible voting population participated in the elections. Khatami recalled his strong opposition against holding an election his government saw as unfair and not free. He also narrated the story of his visit to the Supreme Leader, Khamenei, together with the Parliament's spokesman (considered the head of the legislature) and a list of conditions they had handed him before they could hold the elections. The list, he said, was then passed on to the Guardian Council, the legal supervisor and major obstacle to holding free and competitive elections in recent years. The members of the Guardian Council are appointed directly by the Supreme Leader and were considered to be applying his will. \\"But\\", Khatami said, \\"the Guardian Council kept neither the Supreme Leader's nor its own word [...] and we were faced with a situation in which we had to choose between holding the election or risking huge unrest [...] and so damaging the regime.\\" At this point, student protesters repeatedly chanted the slogan \\"Jannati is the nation's enemy\\", referring to the chairman of the Guardian Council. Khatami replied, \\"If you are the representative of the nation, then we are the nation's enemy.\\" However, after a clarification by students stating that \\"Jannati, not Khatami\\", he took advantage of the opportunity to claim a high degree of freedom in Iran.FToI: What did Khatami really say? When the Guardian Council announced the final list of candidates on 30 January, 125 Reformist members of parliament declared that they would boycott the election and resign their seats, and the Reformist interior minister declared that the election would not be held on the scheduled date, February 20. However, Khatami then announced that the election would be held on time, and he rejected the resignations of his cabinet ministers and provincial governors. These actions paved the way for the election to be held and signaled a split between the radical and moderate wings of the Reformist movement.Strategic Insights - Iranian Politics After the 2004 Parliamentary Election  Cultural and political image   Dialogue Among Civilizations  Following earlier works by renowned philosopher Dariush Shayegan, President Khatami introduced the theory of Dialogue Among Civilizations as a response to Samuel P. Huntington's theory of Clash of Civilizations. After introducing the concept of his theory in several international societies (most importantly the U.N.) the theory gained a lot of international support. Consequently, the United Nations proclaimed the year 2001 as the United Nations' Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations, as per Khatami's suggestion. Pleading for the moralization of politics, Khatami argued that \\"The political translation of dialogue among civilizations would consist in arguing that culture, morality and art must prevail on politics.\\"  Khatami as a scholar  Khatami's main research field is political philosophy. One of Khatami's academic mentors was Javad Tabatabaei, an Iranian political philosopher. Later on Khatami became a University lecturer at Tarbiat Modarres University, where he taught political philosophy. Khatami also published a book on political philosophy in 1999. The ground he covers is the same as that covered by Javad Tabatabaei: the Platonizing adaptation of Greek political philosophy by Farabi (d. 950), its synthesis of the \\"eternal wisdom\\" of Persian statecraft by Abu'l-Hasan Amiri (d. 991) and Mushkuya Razi (d. 1030), the juristic theories of al-Mawardi and Ghazali, and Nizam al-Mulk's treatise on statecraft. He ends with a discussion of the revival of political philosophy in Safavid Isfahan in the second half of the 17th century. Further, Khatami shares with Tabatabaei the idea of the \\"decline\\" of Muslim political thought beginning at the very outset, after Farabi. Khatami Support Moeen in 2005 presidential election Like Tabatabaei, Khatami brings in the sharply contrasting Aristotelian view of politics to highlight the shortcomings of Muslim political thought. Khatami has also lectured on the decline in Muslim political thought in terms of the transition from political philosophy to royal policy (siyasat-i shahi) and its imputation to the prevalence of \\"forceful domination\\" (taghallub) in Islamic history.

Grant and Dr. Mark Greenberg, of North Star Computers, Inc. One notable difference with other dialects of BASIC of the time was the way in which substrings were addressed using an array-like syntax, a concept sometimes referring to as \\"slicing\\". For example, in North Star BASIC corresponded to in other dialects. This string addressing technique is analogous to the one used in Fortran, and was also used in HP Time-Shared BASIC, Atari BASIC and Sinclair BASIC. Strings could be of any length, limited only by available memory, but had to be ensioned before use. While the language was very similar to other BASICs overall, one interesting addition was the addition of an keyword to pop out of a loop. Different dialects of BASIC handled this in different ways, the equivalent in Integer BASIC and Atari BASIC was . could be used to fill a block of memory with a given value.

Lien, \\"The BASIC Handbook\\" Compusoft Pub., 1981 The language used the backslash (\\\\\\\\) instead of a colon (:) to delimit statements on a single line. The language also added a number of direct-mode commands like to exit BASIC and return to DOS, to renumber the lines in the program, and which defined how many nulls to print after pressing return, to use as fill characters. Version 5 was assembled for 8-digit floating-point precision. North Star would re-assemble the interpreter for customers with a different precision, up to 14 digits. Some other dialects of BASIC were created that were based on and inspired by North Star BASIC, such as BaZic (a rewrite of North Star BASIC, taking advantage of the faster Zilog Z80 instructions), Megabasic and S.A.I.L.B.O.A.T. (a basic optimized for Z80 and X86 MS-DOS). Some of these were available for other hardware and operating systems, including Unix, CP/M and DOS.

He spent twelve years in Japan from the age of six months; another six years from age 29, and four and half years from age 46. He was a member of Voice of America under the Office of War Information in June 1942, as well as in 1952 and 1960. He was well known for his contributions to the Japanese broadcasting industry after World War II at NHK under the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (GHQ) and in initiating commercial broadcasting in Japan. Early life His father Tamotsu was from Ayauta, Kagawa, and worked for the Asahi Shimbun in Osaka. In 1904, he immigrated to San Francisco, seeking employment at the San Francisco Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner. When he did not receive job offers from either newspaper, he returned to Japan, married Kiyo, who was born in Ayauta District, Kagawa, and then returned to California. Frank Shozo was born on the 3rd day of the , thus he was named , the meaning of which reflects the occasion. When he was six months old, Frank Shozo was sent to his mother Kiyo's hometown in Ayauta District, Kagawa, Japan. There he was raised and educated until the age of twelve, when he returned to California. Baba studied at Oakland Technical High School and graduated from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. He also self-studied Japanese literature and competed in Japanese speech competitions. He lost his job after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, along with many other Japanese- Americans. His parents were confined to the Gila River War Relocation Center, and his father Tamotsu died there. The parents of his wife Fumie were assigned to Heart Mountain Relocation Center.  World War II  After World War II began, the United States Navy opened a Japanese language school at the University of California, Berkeley to help commissioned officers learn Japanese. Baba was recommended as a language instructor by one of his university professors. He also obtained his translator license and became a certified civil servant. Baba was assigned to a section initially called \\"Coordinate Information\\", later renamed the Office of War Information (OWI). The Voice of America started in 1942, with Baba working on the news and commentary related to psychological warfare against the Japanese with radio shortwave, which was prohibited at that time in Japan. :Immediately you ought to cease the war :You are out-maneuvered by militaristic power, and led in the wrong way. Baba made appeals such as these in Japanese, and worked for the VOA for three years. His program was titled \\"Japan versus Japan\\", and implicated that \\"Japanese citizen versus militaristic power or government\\", or that the government was leading Japan in the wrong direction. When Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and agreed on the Surrender of Japan, he explained, in plain language, what this meant for ordinary Japanese citizens. When Nazi Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Baba was able to broadcast in Japanese, after seeing the incoming telex message. This was the first voiced information to the world, with translations for other languages taking 30 minutes.  Post-war  Baba was assigned to the Strategic Bombing Survey-GHQ, and he arrived at Naval Air Facility Atsugi by C-54 Skymaster on November 2, 1945. On September 5, 1945, GHQ had already requisitioned the NHK building in Uchisaiwaich≈ç, Tokyo. Baba became a key person of the CIE (Civil Information and Education DivisionCivil Information and Education Division, GHQ/SCAP in Japan, 1945-1952, CiNii National Institute of Informatics) and deeply involved in the NHK radio program and its policy. GHQ deemed that radio broadcasting would be the strongest weapon to bring up democracy in post-war Japan. Baba also arranged and guided entertaining programs. Popular ones included Information Please, Twenty Questions and Now It Can Be Told, with Japanese programs naming, to lit. Fountain of talking (Ë©±„ÅÆÊ≥â), Twenty doors (‰∫åÂçÅ„ÅÆÊââ) and True story is this (ÁúûÁõ∏„ÅØ„Åã„ÅÜ„Å†). He planned, offered and involved NHK prior to the new election program for the 22nd Imperial Diet in 1946, as well as many other democratizing and entertaining programs.  Commercial broadcasting in Japan  Baba worried about whether the democracy among Japanese people would be maintained after GHQ left Japan, they might revert to non-democratic ways quickly if NHK and newspapers were under the control of some of the remaining powers. He wanted to establish the commercial broadcasting system in parallel with NHK's monopoly, and would attempt to have his boss use his proposal to help persuade. The proposal was successfully brought to the CIE, which was the top level for GHQ. On October 16, 1947, GHQ noticed the strategic plan to establish a commercial broadcasting station in Japan. In spite of GHQ planning, the Japanese government, ministry and NHK resisted strongly. Baba persuaded newspapers, advertising agencies and parts of the private sector to be in support of the plan for commercial broadcasting. At the end of 1949, GHQ grew tired of waiting for the promotion of commercial broadcasting by Japan, and, finally, GHQ was able to get a letter from Douglas MacArthur to Shigeru Yoshida. There were 74 applications for commercial broadcasting, and 18 stations were approved by the end of 1951. The first commercial stations, Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting and Mainichi Broadcasting System, opened on September 1, 1951, and four more stations opened by the time Baba returned to California for VOA in February 1952. The Strategic Bombing Survey team left Japan after 2 months of surveying. Baba, however, was recruited by the Japanese broadcasting industry to stay in Japan until the VOA had repeatedly urged him to come back to VOA. He worked for VOA a second time, until returning to Japan for a third time in 1961, assigned to the United States Information Agency of the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo. He was in Tokyo right after the 1964 Summer Olympics of Tokyo. He worked for the VOA for a third time, as the chief of Japanese Service until finishing a Japanese- language program. Baba's final message was on February 28, 1970. VOA judged that Japan was well-informed enough of the world without VOA in Japanese language.

The term \\"micromega\\" references Microm√©gas, a tale by Voltaire in which dwarfs and giants dialogue. Party preferences For electoral rules, it is postulated that a few large parties tend to prefer small assemblies, small district magnitudes (the smallest being one), and rules based on small quotas of votes for allocating seats (the smallest being simple plurality, which does not require any specific threshold), while multiple small parties tend to prefer large assemblies, large district magnitudes, and large quotas (like those of proportional representation: within proportional representation systems, given the same number of seats, systems with a higher quota such as Hare or Sainte-Lagu√´ favour smaller parties, while systems with a lower quota such as Droop or D'Hondt favour larger parties). Large parties may prefer small institutions in order to exclude others from competition, while small parties prefer large institutions able to include them within. More specifically, political configurations in which there is a single dominant party or two rather balanced parties tend to produce choices in favor of rather restrictive or exclusionary electoral systems, such as those based on plurality rule in single-member districts, while settings with multiple parties tend to support choices in favor of more inclusive electoral formulas, such as those using rules of proportional representation. In comparison with Duverger's laws This has been seen as an upside-down reading of Duverger's laws holding that a plurality rule election systems tend to favor a two-party system, while proportional representation tends to multipartism. By suggesting, in contrast, that electoral systems are an effect of party systems rather than a cause, it has been shown that changes from a plurality system to a proportional system are typically preceded by the emergence of more than two parties, and are typically not followed by a substantial increase in the number of parties. Existing parties tend, thus, to choose electoral systems that are able to crystallize or consolidate the previously existing party configurations and systems. More generally, electoral systems and other prominent political institutions can be seen as a consequence of already existing political party systems in assemblies and governments, each of which tends to prefer those institutional formulas and procedures that can consolidate, reinforce or increase their relative strength. Calculating assembly size Inspired by the micromega rule, Rein Taagepera presented the seat product of simple electoral systems, which is obtained by multiplying some transformation of the assembly size by the number of seats in the average district magnitude, in order to predict the number of parties in the system. As he acknowledges, the relationship between party systems and electoral systems accepts two-direction lines of causality. A relevant implication of Taagepera‚Äôs equation for political practitioners of institutional design is that if the size of the assembly is rather stable and depends on the country's size, for a small country with a small assembly just a few parties can be sufficient to produce a change of electoral system in favor of proportional representation, while, for a large country and a large assembly, many parties would be necessary to produce such a result.

It took almost another fifty years when his brother Hadrian re-edited the work of Anonymus in the edition of Ammianus Marcellinus in 1681. It was the first time when Excerpta Valesiana, that is the edition of the Pars Posterior was clearly separated from other fragments. The texts exist only in a single ninth-century manuscript in Berlin.Codex Berolinensis 1885. The collection later turned up in the Jesuit Coll√®ge de Clermont in Paris. The parchment bundle, originally consisted of 34 flimsy layers ‚Äì a manuscript prepared by nine different hands ‚Äì was later ordered and attached together according to the hands. The collection appeared in the catalogue of the Jesuit college at the occasion of the sale of the library by auction in 1764. The collection was sold and transferred to a certain Johannes Meermann (Codex Meermannus 794) in the Hague. Following the death of Meermann, the collection was possessed by an English collector Sir Thomas Phillipps (Codex Phillippsianus 1885). Later, through the heirs, it was taken by the German State Library in Berlin in 1887 where it is accessible today under the shelf-mark: ‚ÄòMs. Phill. 1885‚Äô. They are sometimes referred to as the Excerpta Valesiani. The work of the Anonymus Valesianus is a debated issue of historiography for more than one hundred years, all the more so as both the identity of the author and the circumstances of the compilation of the work are obscure.  Anonymus Valesianus I  Anonymus Valesianus I, sometimes given the separate conventional title Origo Constantini Imperatoris (\\"The Lineage of the Emperor Constantine\\") possibly dates from around 390, and is generally regarded as providing a reliable source. The beginning of Origo already looks like the final sentence of an account on the rule of Diocletian and Maximian. In 1963 Arnaldo Momigliano summarized the results of scholarship on Origo Constantini in the words that ‚ÄúAll is in doubt about the first part of the Anonymus Valesianus‚Äù. There are questions left, with regard to the date of Origo‚Äôs editions, sources, and revisions, which have not yet found convincing answers.

The identity of the author and the circumstances of the compilation of the Pars Posterior is obscure, however a few scholars think it \\"based on a no longer extant chronicle by the bishop of Ravenna, Maximianus\\".Geoffrey Nathan, \\"The fate of Romulus Augustulus\\", Classica et Mediaevalia: Revue Danoise de Philologie et d'Histoire 1993:268 note 23; the connection to Maximianus was made by Thomas Hodgkin, Italy and Her Invaders: The Ostrogothic invasion, 476-535. 1896:261. The Pars Posterior consists of 60 chapters and it presents the chain of events as a chronicle from Chapter 36 to 59: from the rule of Emperor Zeno, through the decline of the power of Odoacer, up to the succession of Theodoric the Great in 493. In the next section, from Chapter 60 to 79, the description of the rule of Theodoric the Great ‚Äì the Italian ruler of Germanic origin ‚Äì can be found. Besides the description of political events the author dwells on portraying the major virtues of the ruler through different narratives. In the closing section (Chapter 80 to 96) the author describes the tragic years of Theodoric's rule. The work was used by Edward Gibbon as a major source for the Roman perspective on the Ostrogothic period in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.

This engraving was used as a frontispiece to Burton's Description of Leicester Shire (1622). Portrait attributed to William Segar, Society of Antiquaries of London William Burton (24 August 1575 ‚Äì 6 April 1645) was an English antiquarian, best known as the author of the Description of Leicester Shire (1622), the county's first published county history. Life Burton was the son of Ralph Burton, and elder brother of Robert Burton, born at Lindley in Leicestershire on 24 August 1575. At the age of nine he went to school at Nuneaton, and on 29 September 1591 entered Brasenose College, Oxford (B.A. 22 June 1594). He was admitted, on 20 May 1593, to the Inner Temple. He was one of a group of antiquaries there, including Sir John Ferne, Thomas Gainsford, and Peter Manwood.philological.bham.ac.uk, article on John Ross. On 20 May 1603 he was called to the bar, but soon afterwards, owing to weak health, he retired to the village of Falde in Staffordshire, where he owned an estate. Among his particular friends were Sir Robert Cotton and William Somner. In his account of Fenny Drayton he speaks of his \\"old acquaintance\\" Michael Drayton. When the First English Civil War broke out, Burton sided with the royalists, and endured persecution. He died at Falde on 6 April 1645, and was buried in the parish church at Hanbury. Works Frontispiece to Burton's Description of Leicester Shire (1622) He wrote in 1596 an unpublished Latin comedy, De Amoribus Perinthii et Tyanthes. In 1597 he published with Thomas Creede a translation of Cleitophon and Leucippe from the Greek of Achilles Tatius, with a dedication to the Earl of Southampton. Burton knew Spanish and Italian, and studied the emblem-writers, but his interest lay chiefly in heraldry and topography. In 1602 he issued a corrected copy, printed at Antwerp, of Christopher Saxton's map of the county of Leicester. His county history, the Description of Leicester Shire, was begun by 1597. It appeared in print in 1622, dedicated to George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham. Burton then spent years in making large additions and corrections for a new edition. In the summer of 1638 a copy of the intended second edition was sent to London for press. However the whole project was \\"overtaken by more momentous events ‚Äì the outbreak of the Civil War ‚Äì and had to be abandoned\\".Daniel Williams (1975), \\"William Burton's 1642 revised edition of the Description of Leicestershire\\", Transactions of the Leicester Archaeological and Historical Society, 50, 30‚Äì36 It is not known what became of this manuscript. Burton began work on a further revised version of the work in 1641. After Burton's death his son Cassibelan presented the materials for this final version to Walter Chetwynd, comprising a copy of the Description with large manuscript additions by the author, a folio manuscript with further additions and corrections, and a further secretary-hand copy with further additions, corrections and omissions. These are now in the Staffordshire Record Office.Staffordshire Records Office, manuscripts D649/4/1 to 3 (Catalogue). In 1798 Shaw discovered this copy at Ingestree, and it was utilised by John Nichols in the third and fourth volumes of his Leicestershire. In 1777 there was published by subscription a folio edition which claimed to be enlarged and corrected; the information contained in the Description was incorporated in Nichols's Leicestershire. William Dugdale in his Autobiography acknowledges the assistance which he had received from Burton. In 1612 Thomas Purefoy of Barwell in Warwickshire bequeathed at his death to Burton the original manuscript of John Leland's Collectanea. Anthony Wood says Burton needlessly expanded this work; but Thomas Hearne, in the preface to his edition of the Collectanea, denies that. In 1631 Burton caused part of Leland's Itinerary to be transcribed, and in the following year he gave five quarto volumes of Leland's autograph manuscripts to the Bodleian Library. Among the manuscripts that he left were: * Antiquitates de Lindley, which was later in the possession of Samuel Lysons, who lent it to Nichols and is now in the British Library (Additional MS 6046); * Antiquitates de Dadlington Manerio, com. Leic., which in Nichols's time belonged to Nicholas Hurst of Hinckley; * Antiquitates de Falde (British Library Additional MS 31917) * Collections towards a history of Thedingworth. About 1735 Francis Peck announced his intention of writing Burton's life, but did not do so. Family In 1607 Burton married Jane, daughter of Humfrey Adderley of Weddington, in Warwickshire, by whom he had a son, Cassibelan Burton.

While the concept was not prevalent within the Wehrmacht, it was common in the Waffen-SS to reward its most successful personnel, as the organisation was far more attuned to the propaganda imperatives of Nazi Germany. These commanders were credited with the destruction of large numbers of tanks and other armoured vehicles. The British and American militaries did not recognise the concept of \\"tank ace,\\" though many commanders and crews were also responsible for destroying a large number of enemy tanks. The term \\"panzer ace\\" has become prominent in contemporary popular culture as part of the uncritical portrayal of the Waffen-SS in English-language militaria and popular history works, especially in the United States. The term is featured prominently in English translations of works by German fiction author Franz Kurowski. His ahistorical biographical Panzer Aces series focuses on highly-decorated tank commanders, such as Michael Wittmann and Franz B√§ke. In recent years, German historian S√∂nke Neitzel and American military historian Steven Zaloga, amongst others, have examined the combat performance of highly-decorated German tank crews during the war. Zaloga argues that the term \\"panzer ace\\" is a romanticisation of reality mixed with propaganda, as it is neither possible to correctly determine \\"tank kills\\" in the heat of battle, or to separate individual performance separate from technological or battlefield advantage. In contrast, British historian Robert Kershaw argues that the large number of tanks destroyed by some German commanders can be attributed to the skills they gained through years of combat.  Wartime perceptions  During World War II the concept received little attention. To the extent that the concept existed, it was mainly advanced by the Waffen-SS as part of its contributions to Nazi Germany's propaganda campaigns. In most German Army (Heer) units, tank crews and commanders generally received awards for mission performance rather than tank kills. A Tiger I tank during the Battle of Kursk in June 1943. Most of the successful German tank commanders served in units equipped with Tigers during this period. German highly decorated tank commanders were most often soldiers who served in units equipped with Tiger I or Tiger II tanks between mid-1943 and mid-1944. The Allies did not have any tanks capable of easily defeating the Tigers during this period. Few soldiers who operated Panther tanks at this time received the same high decorations, as these tanks were more vulnerable to Allied tanks and initially less mechanically reliable than the Tiger. Historian Dennis Showalter has suggested that the confidence which the crews of Tigers and the operators of other relatively advanced weapons had in the capabilities of their equipment may have reinforced their ideological conditioning, and encouraged them to take risks in combat. The United States Army did not recognize the concept of \\"tank aces\\" during World War II, with proposals to do so being rejected. US Army tank commanders such as Lafayette G. Pool and Creighton Abrams were responsible for the destruction of large numbers of German tanks and other armoured vehicles. The US Army's weekly magazine Yank featured several successful tank commanders such as Pool. The March 1945 Yank described Pool as \\"the ace of American tankers\\" and stated that \\"[he] is an almost unbelievable document of total victory.\\" United States. Dept. of the Army. Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, Issue 44, p. 25Tank Aces: From Blitzkrieg to the Gulf War, pp. 25-26 A 1943 New York Times story also labelled Chinese Major General Hoo Hsien-Chung as a \\"tank ace\\" for the actions of a force under his command during the 1938 Battle of Taierzhuang. Similarly, the British Army did not recognise any tank aces. Opportunities for British commanders to destroy large numbers of enemy tanks were limited as the various tanks operated by the Army generally did not heavily outclass German tanks. Some British Sherman Firefly tank commanders were responsible for destroying multiple German tanks. In the opinion of George Forty, the Soviet Red Army did not regard destroying tanks as an act of particular heroism for its tank commanders, as the main role of its armoured units was to support infantry. According to Russian military historian Mikhail Polikarpov, in contrast to the German model, the Russian concept was based on the heroic acts or deeds the soldier achieved.Mikhail Polikarpov, \\"–ü–æ–∫—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –º–∏—Ä–∞–∂–∏\\" lit. Debunking Myths, 2004. Translation: \\"It is noted that the German and Soviet propaganda models were fundamentally different. At the heart of the German model was the \\"ideal warrior\\", destroying enemies in large numbers. Wittmann was an ideal tankman, Rudel was a superhero for bomber aviation, Hartman (and a whole group of Aces) ‚Äì for fighter pilots. The success of a soldier is measured in downed fighters, destroyed tanks. Each soldier had to be equal to the \\"ideal warrior.\\" \\"In the Soviet propaganda model, the concept was based to the theme of achievement (Kosmodemyanskaya, Matrosov, Gastello). The heroic deed of the soldier was extolled in a specific ‚Äì often unequal ‚Äì battle, often ending with the death of this soldier. The reality and circumstances of some of the textbook exploits of Soviet soldiers committed in the battles of the Great Patriotic War have also recently been disputed.\\" The Soviet Military Review magazine notes further: \\"The tankmen's heroic deeds were popularised over the radio, in special orders of the day, in newspapers and leaflets, and in individual talks with servicemen. Some tank whose crews had distinguished themselves most in action, were given, by order of tank formation commanders, the name of Russian generals or of the heroes of the units, who had fallen fighting for their country.\\"Soviet Military Review, Issue 4, April 1972, p. 34.

Moscow: Krasnaya Zvezda Publishing House Overall, English newspapers devoted a lot of space to aircraft and naval tallies, human interest stories, and the Eastern Front, but paid little attention to tank combat.Kershaw, Robert \\"Tank Men: the Human Story of Tanks at War\\", Hodder, p. 331.  Contemporary use  The German author Franz Kurowski covered \\"panzer aces\\" in several of his hagiographic accounts. Published in the U.S. by J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing in the 1990s and by Stackpole Books in the 2010s, his popular series Panzer Aces describes fictionalised careers of highly-decorated German soldiers during World War II. A veteran of the Eastern front (as a member of a propaganda company), Kurowski is one of the authors who \\"have picked up and disseminated the myths of the Wehrmacht in a wide variety of popular publications that romanticize the German struggle in Russia\\", according to The Myth of the Eastern Front by historians Ronald Smelser and Edward Davies. The most famous German \\"panzer ace\\", Michael Wittmann, is credited by Kurowski as having destroyed 60 tanks and nearly as many anti-tank guns in the course of a few days near Kiev in November 1943. According to historian Steven Zaloga, Wittman was credited with about 135 tanks destroyed ‚Äì although 120 of those were made on the Eastern Front from a Tiger tank. After the war, Wittmann gained a cult status among admirers of the Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and tank warfare. Kurowski's book also describes the actions of \\"panzer ace\\" Franz B√§ke in the Cherkassy Pocket. In Kurowski's retelling, after fighting unit after unit of the Red Army, B√§ke is able to establish a corridor to the trapped German forces, and then \\"wipes out\\" the attacking Soviets. In another of Kurowski's accounts, while attempting to relieve the 6th Army encircled in Stalingrad, Bake destroys 32 enemy tanks in a single engagement.  Analysis  The concept of what constitutes success in tank battles has received considerable attention in recent years. The historian S√∂nke Neitzel questions the numbers of tanks destroyed attributed in popular culture to various tank commanders. According to Neitzel, numbers of successes by highly decorated soldiers should be approached with caution as it is rarely possible to determine reliably, in the heat of the battle, how many tanks were destroyed and by whom. The Wehrmacht's intelligence service on the Eastern Front, the Fremde Heere Ost (FHO), routinely reduced the reported number of Soviet tanks being destroyed by 30 to 50 per cent in their own statistics to make up for double counting and repairable vehicles. Zaloga considers these numbers to be reasonably accurate tallies of actual Soviet tank losses. At the time of Operation Citadel and during the subsequent Soviet counteroffensives in the Summer of 1943, German combat units claimed 16,250 tanks and assault guns destroyed. According to Zetterling, the high command was a little too drastic with its 50% reduction, and a reduction of claims by 42% would have been more accurate. The historian Steven Zaloga opines that \\"tank kill claims during World War II on all sides should be taken with a grain of salt\\". Zaloga uses the term \\"tank ace\\" in quotation marks in his 2015 work Armored Champion: The Top Tanks of World War II. He notes the \\"romantic nonsense\\" of the popular inclination to imagine a tank versus tank engagement as an \\"armoured joust\\" ‚Äì two opponents facing each other ‚Äì with the \\"more valiant or better-armed [one] the eventual victor\\". In reality, most tank to tank combat involved one tank ambushing the other, and the most successful tank commanders were generally \\"bushwhackers\\" with \\"a decided advantage in firepower or armour, and often both\\". The grave of \\"panzer ace\\" Michael Wittmann and his tank crew in 2007 Zaloga uses Wittmann's career to illustrate the point of the battlefield advantage. He credits Wittmann with \\"about 135\\" tanks destroyed, but points out that Wittmann achieved 120 of these in 1943, operating a Tiger I tank on the Eastern Front. Having advantages both in firepower and in armour, Tiger I was \\"nearly invulnerable in a frontal engagement\\" against any of the Soviet tanks of that time. Wittmann thus could \\"kill its opponents long before they were close enough to inflict damage on his tank\\". Zaloga concludes: \\"Most of the 'tank aces' of World War II were simply lucky enough to have an invulnerable tank with a powerful gun\\". He has also written that \\"the considerable attention paid to German tank aces in recent years obscures the fact that they were an exception to the rule and that most of the anonymous young German tankers in late 1944 were thrown into combat with poor training\\". Historian John Buckley has also criticised accounts of Wittmann's career, arguing that \\"many historians through to today continue to repackage unquestioningly Nazi propaganda\\" by repeating false claims that Wittmann's tank single-handedly defeated a British offensive in Normandy. In reality, this tactical success was achieved by the entire unit Wittmann formed part of, but was attributed only to him as part of a propaganda campaign. Author Robert Kershaw, in his book Tank Men, refers to a \\"tank ace\\" being the minority of tank commanders that accounted for the most destroyed enemy armour, saying it is roughly analogous with a flying ace.Kershaw, Robert \\"Tank Men: the Human Story of Tanks at War\\", Hodder, p. 332. He says some tank aces like Wittmann encapsulate what cumulative skills from years of combat in multiple campaigns may achieve. British author George Forty writes that some German tanks (in particular the Tiger I) were often better armoured and armed than their allied counterparts, which often helped the survivability of crews, enabling them to either win engagements or at least survive encounters so as to be able to fight again.Forty, George \\"Tanks Aces: Bliztkrieg to the Gulf War\\", Sutton Publishing, p. 84. Forty notes that the expertise and bravery of tankmen who had achieved high numbers of \\"kills\\", such as Michael Wittmann, was also a factor.Forty, George \\"Tanks Aces: Blitzkrieg to the Gulf War\\", Sutton Publishing, p. viii. He points out that there were tank commanders, like Buck Kite and Lafayette Pool, who still had success in their tanks despite them being inferior to the tanks they opposed.

After studying medicine and zoology with Ernst Haeckel (1834‚Äì1919) at the University of Jena where he was a pupil of Fran√ßois Jules Pictet de la Rive (1809‚Äì1872) and Ren√©-√âdouard Clapar√®de (1832-1871), he accompanied Haeckel on a prolonged scientific journey (1866 and 1867) around the coasts of West Africa and of the Canary Islands. On his return to Europe he undertook medical studies in Heidelberg and completed them by obtaining his diploma in 1869 in Zurich and Berlin. In 1871 he studied planktonic fauna in Villefranche-sur-Mer on the recommendation of Carl Vogt (1817‚Äì1895). In 1878, he obtained a post of professor at the University of Geneva where in the following year, he observed the penetration of a spermatozoon into an egg becoming thus a pioneer of the microscopic studies of fertilisation and cellular division. In 1886, he resigned from his post in Geneva to devote himself entirely to his research in Villefranche-sur- Mer where, in 1880, he had established a small marine laboratory with Jules Henri Barrois (1852‚Äì1943). Then, financially aided by the French government to carry out a study of distribution of sponges on the Tunisian and Greek coasts, he departed Le Havre on his new yacht, l' Aster on March 13, 1892, accompanied by several team members. After a stopover in B√©nodet, the yacht disappeared at sea, and Fol was never seen again. Barthometer A New Barthometer by Hermann Fol Fol is credited with the invention of the barthometer. The barometer properly measured mercury, the pressure to which the apparatus had been submitted, and the determination of the depth of compressible liquid within the device. His invention consisted of a spherical glass reservoir of a liquid that is slightly compressible, such as water or ether. The single hole to the vessel is a capillary tube that corresponds with a minor reservoir filled with mercury. Mercury, along the assumed temperature of the water at the sea bottom, must remain at the stage with the hole in the pointed stopper within the large reservoir. The top surface of the mercury is released to contact the water. The device is lowered by the sound line. The water or ether will compress as the device lowers, a given amount of each atmosphere of pressure, and a correlating amount of mercury will release between the hole and lower to the base of the bottom reservoir.T.

History  Between 1865 and 1870 the northern embankment and sewer was built by Sir Joseph Bazalgette. In 1874 gardens were created on the reclaimed land on the inward side of the roadway named Victoria Embankment. There were four sections created, the Temple Garden to the east, the Main Gardens to the west (originally known as the Adelphi Gardens), and two other sections to the south following the bend of the Thames. The gardens are now under the control of the City of Westminster.  Features  The gardens are fully fenced and are open during designated hours. They open at 07:30 throughout the year, but close at varying times between 16:30 during the coldest months and 21:30 at the height of summer. All gardens have gravel paths that are well lined with seats mainly given as memorials. The river side of the gardens is lined with mature trees. Grass and flower beds are spread throughout the gardens, and on warm days workers from near-by establishments can be seen having picnic lunches both on the seats and the grass.  Statues  Arthur Sullivan Memorial, Victoria Embankment Gardens In the Temple section there are statues to Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Stuart Mill. The main section has memorials Sir Arthur Sullivan, Robert Burns, Sir Wilfred Lawson, Robert Raikes and the Imperial Camel Corps. The southern section has memorials to General Sir James Outram, General Gordon, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, and the Chindit Memorial which also commemorates Orde Wingate. Victoria Embankment Gardens, equatorial sundial A memorial to the British soldiers in the Korean War was unveiled in Victoria Embankment Gardens, between the River Thames and the Ministry of Defence headquarters in London, England, in December 2014. Although not strictly a statue, there is an equatorial sundial made from stainless steel in the main garden under the Savoy, dedicated to Richard D'Oyly Carte.  Other facilities  In the main garden there is a caf√©, open in the warmer periods, and a band shell where concerts are held daily in June and July. A charge is made for seats in the enclosure, but the concerts can easily be heard outside on the paths' seats. The York Water Gate can be seen adjacent to the Villier Street entrance. This marks the original bank of the Thames, which is now 135 metres away. Public toilets are outside the gardens' Embankment gate next to the underground station.

History Formation, New American Shame and Breakup (1998‚Äì2001) In 1998, guitarist Jimmy Paulson, formerly of The Lemons, and vocalist Johnny Reidt (often credited as the one-named Johnny) formed New American Shame in Seattle, Washington, adding guitarist Terry Bratsch, bassist Kelly Wheeler and drummer Jack Stringham to complete the band's lineup. Drawing influences from the likes of Aerosmith, Black Sabbath and Jimi Hendrix, the band built a fan base with \\"powerful live performances.\\" They soon recorded material for their debut album, produced by Paulson, with Brett Eliason and former Seaweed guitarist Clint Werner mixing and engineering the album respectively. The resulting album, New American Shame, was released on March 9, 1999 through Will Records. Stringham soon left the band and was replaced by former Green Apple Quick Step drummer Geoff Reading with the band playing at SXSW '99. They attracted major- label attention, including Island, before signing with Atlantic Records. Atlantic re-released the band's debut album with minor track adjustments and additional drums by Reading. \\"Under it All\\" was chosen as the first single, which peaked at number 35 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. A tour of the US, with The Cult, and Japan followed. By 2001, the band walked away from their deal with Atlantic and disbanded soon afterwards.

In 1983, he was awarded the Prix de la Jeune Peinture (\\"Young Artist's Award\\") in Brussels. From 1989 to 1996, Vandekerckhove temporarily stayed in Tuscany where he was exposed to the artworks of Cimabue, Giotto and Piero della Francesca. A studio fire in 1990 destroyed his works from this period. In 1997, he visited Dungeness and discovered the avant-garde filmmaker, Derek Jarman. In 2003, Vandekerckhove mounted a solo exhibition at the Mu.Zee, modern art museum in Oostende entitled Stalking Hi√´ronymus. These works were inspired by the Hieronymus Bosch painting St. Jerome at Prayer and by the film Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky. In 2007 he mounted a show of recent paintings at City Museum for Modern Art in Ghent. He was also featured in a dual exhibition alongside Juan Mu√±oz at the Fundacion Amb√®res, Madrid.

Stasko is best known for his extensive research in information visualization and visual analytics, including his earlier work in software visualization and algorithm animation. Early life and education John Stasko was born on August 28, 1961 in Miami, Florida. As a youngster, he lived in Pennsylvania (Lancaster and Reading) and south Florida (Miami, Boca Raton, and Deerfield Beach). Stasko attended Bucknell University and graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1983. He went directly to graduate school and earned an Sc.M. and Ph.D. in Computer Science at Brown University in 1985 and 1989, respectively. His doctoral thesis, \\"TANGO: A Framework and System for Algorithm Animation,\\" is a highly cited project in the area of Software Visualization. Stasko joined the faculty of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech in 1989. He and his wife Christine have three children, John IV (Tommy), Mitchell, and Audrey. Stasko is an avid golfer and was winner of the 1996 Bobby Jones Memorial Tournament at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. Professional career Upon joining the faculty at Georgia Tech, Stasko continued his research in algorithm animation and software visualization.

Fall 1963, pp 3-4 A 4 √ó 4 magic square can be constructed by writing out the numbers from 1 to 16 consecutively in a 4 √ó 4 matrix and then interchanging those numbers on the diagonals that are equidistant from the center. (Figure 1). The sum of each row, column and diagonal is 34, the ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù for a 4 √ó 4 magic square. In general, the ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù for an n √ó n magic square is n(n^2 + 1)/2. center Properties of a mystic square As seen in the example for a 6 √ó 6 square (Figure 2), the properties of the mystic square are related to those of a 6 √ó 6 magic square. The sum of the diagonals is 111, the magic number for a 6 √ó 6 magic square. The sums of the rows increase arithmetically with a common difference of 12 and an average of 111. The columns also increase arithmetically with a common difference of 2 and an average of 111. The quotient of the two common differences is 6. This pattern proves true for all values of n. For the special case of n = 4 (where the mystic square is already a magic square), the quotient of the common differences is the indeterminate 0/0, which may be assigned the value 4 for consistency. center Converting an n √ó n mystic square to a magic square when n is a multiple of 4 As illustrated in the case where n = 8, the method consists of changing the position of the numbers that lie of the sides of the square that is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of the mystic square (Figure 3). Each of these lines is first ‚Äúreflected‚Äù with the number on the opposite end of the same line (Figure 4). These numbers are in turn reflected ‚Äúacross the board‚Äù (Figure 5). This produces an 8x8 Magic Square. upright=1.25 upright=1.25 upright=1.25 In general, (n/4) ‚àí 1 reflection lines are required to convert an n √ó n mystic square into a magic square. When applying this method to a 12 √ó 12 mystic square, two reflection lines are necessary (Figure 6). Note that each reflection line must contain n terms. In the case of the 12 √ó 12 illustrated here, each second set (4, 15, 26, 37) contains only 4 terms, and so must be completed by adding two terms (54, 65). (In the case of a 4 √ó 4 mystic square, 0 reflection lines are required.) center  References  Category:Magic squares ","title":"Mystic square"},{"id":"26079571","text":"Carl McVoy (January 3, 1931 ‚Äì January 3, 1992) was an American pianist.

The gens Canuleia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Although members of this gens are known throughout the period of the Republic, and were of senatorial rank, none of them ever obtained the consulship. However, the Canuleii furnished the Republic with several tribunes of the plebs.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 596 (\\"Canuleia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Canuleius belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', which was typically of Oscan names. It might perhaps be derived from the same root as Kanus, a surname originally referring to someone with white hair.Chase, pp. 120, 121.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. canus. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Canuleii were Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus, the three most common names throughout all periods of Roman history. Branches and cognomina None of the Canuleii mentioned by ancient writers bore a cognomen, except for Lucius Canuleius Dives, praetor in 171 BC. His surname originally signified someone possessing great wealth.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. dives. Members * Gaius Canuleius, tribune of the plebs in 445 BC, proposed the lex Canuleia, restoring the right of patricians and plebeians to intermarry. His proposal that the consulship should be opened to the plebeians failed, but as a compromise the patricians agreed to the election of military tribunes with consular power, who might be chosen from either order, in place of consuls.Livy, iv. 1‚Äì6.Cicero, De Republica, ii. 37.Florus, i. 25.Dionysius, xi. 57, 58. * Marcus Canuleius, tribune of the plebs in 420 BC, accused Gaius Sempronius Atratinus, the consul of 423, of misconduct during the Volscian war.

However their use dates back to the end of the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire.Grierson, P. (1993). Catalogue of the Byzantine Coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection, 2: Phocas to Theodosius III, 602-717. Universidad de Harvard. Estados Unidos. The Carolingian hoop crown was most probably derived from the contemporary Germanic hoop helmet (). The oldest such crown is the Crown of Saint Faith in Conques, worn either by Pepin I (797‚Äì838) or Pepin II (823‚Äì864) of Aquitaine. Other Carolingians known to have worn hoop crowns are Louis II \\"the German\\" (806‚Äì876), Charles II \\"the Bald\\" (823‚Äì877) and Odo of Vermandois (910‚Äì946). Charlemagne (742‚Äì814) possibly wore a hoop crown, although the obscurities of contemporary portraits, in particular on seals, mean that this cannot be stated with certainty.RGA V (1984), p. 371 Sometimes, the Carolingian hoop crowns were combined with a cap, worn beneath. Though hoop crowns were characteristic for Carolingian kings, there were several other types of crowns worn by the members of this dynasty. For example, Charlemagne also wore a crown shaped like a collar with an attachment on the front side. The features most Carolingian crowns had in common were \\"cap or bands over the head, edge-bands, and pendilia\\". Some of the Carolingian crowns were imitations of contemporary Byzantine Imperial crowns, which had the shape of a closed cap (kamelaukion). In turn, Byzantine Emperor Justinian I \\"the Great\\" (483‚Äì565) had hoops attached to his crown to carry a cross above it, creating the prototype of later hoop crowns. Spread Hoop crowns became popular in late medieval Europe. The Holy Roman Imperial crown was a hoop crown. Norman king William the Conqueror wore a hoop crown, and in the 12th century, the kings of Hungary amended their collar with two hoops. In both cases, the object of adopting a hoop crown was not to appear to occupy a position of inferiority to the Holy Roman Emperor. William's crown was modelled after the crown of emperor Otto I and similarly decorated with twelve types of gems.Schramm (1956), p. 756 In addition, William had sceptre and virga created, resembling the imperial insignia. However, not all late medieval crowns had hoops. For example, the 15th-century kings of France wore crowns of the lilly type, a collar decorated with four lilies. The hoop crown became the prevalent type of crown in the Early Modern Age.

Mkhitaryan was one of the best players of the Soviet Top League during the 1980s, scoring 46 goals for the club, and played for ASOA Valence during the peak of the team in Ligue 2. He is the father of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, a current Armenian international footballer who plays for Italian club AS Roma on loan from English side Arsenal. Club career Hamlet Mkhitaryan started playing for Ararat Yerevan in 1980. At this time, the club had few players who had played for it back in the 1970s, when the team has achieved a number of successes, including winning the 1973 Soviet Top League. Thus, the 1980s were a new era for Ararat Yerevan. Mkhitaryan was a team regular and one of the leaders of the club's attack. In the 1984 Soviet Top League, Mkhitaryan scored 18 goals. The only player who scored more than him was Sergey Andreyev, who scored 19 goals. Editors of the magazine Soviet Warrior awarded Mkhitaryan their newly established prize, Knight of Attack. This award was presented to the football player who had scored most often (per season) three or more goals in a single league match. Mkhitaryan made three hat-tricks and one poker in the 1984 Top League. In 1988, he moved to Kotayk Abovyan, where he spent half of the season. In July 1989, he went to France, where he later played for ASOA Valence, a club founded by French Armenians. Mkhitaryan is considered one of the first official foreign players from Armenia who went to play in the western, non-Soviet affiliated world (and not emigrated). Abraham Hayrapetyan, who lived in France and was mainly working on arranging tours of Soviet players to Europe, helped him to move to Valence. After Mkhitaryan came to the club, he helped Valence go up from the Championnat National third division to the Ligue 2 second division. Mkhitaryan later joined ASA Issy, another club formed by Armenians in France, which he played on for only six months. He could not continue his career as a football player because of a brain tumor. Knowing he was dying, Hamlet went back to Yerevan, wanting to die at home. After three operations performed within one year, his life could not be saved and he died at the age of 33 on 2 May 1996. International career Mkhitaryan debuted for the Armenia national football team on 7 September 1994 in a UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match against Belgium at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium in Brussels, which Armenia lost 0‚Äì2. He played his last game next in another UEFA Euro 1996 qualifier against Cyprus on 8 October 1994 at the Hrazdan Stadium in Yerevan. The match ended 0‚Äì0. Personal life Hamlet was married to Marina Taschyan. They had two children, a daughter named Monica and a son named Henrikh, who is currently a professional footballer for Roma and the Armenian national team. The Mkhitaryans lived in the Kentron district of Yerevan. His wife was the head of the national teams department in the Armenian Football Federation and their daughter works at the UEFA headquarters. His son followed in his footsteps and became a football player, currently being the captain of the Armenia national football team. Those who saw both Hamlet and Henrikh play say that their styles resemble each other very much.

McQuown was the 4th Kentucky's band director The 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment that served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It was part of the First Kentucky Brigade. Service The 4th Kentucky Infantry was organized on September 13, 1861, at Camp Burnett in Montgomery, Tennessee, under the command of Colonel Robert P. Trabue. After organization and muster, the regiment moved north into Kentucky and camped at Bowling Green, where it remained until early 1862. The 4th Kentucky Infantry first saw combat at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, losing 49% of its strength in the two-day battle. The regiment fell back to Corinth, Mississippi, after the battle and was next ordered to Vicksburg, Mississippi, to aid in the city's defense. The 4th Kentucky soon received orders to reinforce General Braxton Bragg, whose troops were engaged in the Kentucky Campaign. The regiment was north of Knoxville, Tennessee, 20 miles from Cumberland Gap, when it received orders to return to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, because of Bragg's subsequent retreat after the Battle of Perryville on October 8, 1862. The 4th Kentucky came under heavy fire at the Battle of Stones River on January 2, 1863. Ordered by Bragg to attack an area that division commander Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge had already reconnoitered and decided was to be too heavily defended, the First Kentucky Brigade nevertheless led the charge. Initially successful, the attackers soon encountered heavy Union Army artillery fire. The 4th Kentucky lost several men, including two color-bearers, but it fared better than the brigade's other regiments. Brigade commander Brigadier General Roger Hanson was mortally wounded in the attack. Later that year, the First Kentucky Brigade was ordered back to Vicksburg, to help relieve the siege. The brigade had not arrived when Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, 1863, so it fell back to Jackson, Mississippi, where it was attacked in mid-July. During the Battle of Chickamauga, the 4th Kentucky and 6th Kentucky Infantry charged a part of the federal line defended by the Union's 15th Kentucky Infantry and Bridges' Illinois Battery. The Kentucky Confederates routed the infantry and captured two of Bridge's cannons, turning them against the fleeing enemy. Weeks later, the 4th Kentucky was called upon to guard the Confederate army's rear following the Battle of Missionary Ridge. Bragg's army retreated to Dalton, Georgia and went into winter quarters. The First Kentucky Brigade took part in the Atlanta Campaign on May 7, 1864, when they left their winter camps and took up positions on Rocky Face Ridge. The regiment became part of the fighting retreating force as Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman pushed the Confederates further back toward Atlanta. The First Kentucky Brigade made an unsupported charge at the Battle of Dallas near New Hope Church, losing 51% of its strength. At the Battle of Jonesboro on August 31, 1864, the brigade was ordered to attack the entrenched federal position. The attack came to a halt at an unseen deep ravine, where the 4th Kentucky Infantry lost its original color-bearer, who had carried the flag since the beginning of the war. The next day, the brigade was overwhelmed, when two-thirds of a Union Army division attacked and began to surround their positions. Many of the men of the 2nd Kentucky Infantry, 6th Kentucky Infantry, and 9th Kentucky Infantry were captured. The remnants of the brigade fell back and managed to bring the Union attack to a halt. Only 500 men were present for duty in the entire First Kentucky Brigade on September 4. The 4th Kentucky was then ordered to Griffin, Georgia and converted to mounted infantry. The regiment engaged in delaying tactics during Sherman's March to the Sea, following him all the way to Savannah, Georgia, finally moving to Augusta, Georgia, in early 1865. Its last engagement was on April 29, 1865, in a skirmish near Stateburg, South Carolina. At the close of the war, the 4th Kentucky was ordered to Washington, Georgia and surrendered on May 7, 1865.

The Council stated its international responsibility over Namibia, noting that 1985 marked the 40th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, as well as the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, expressing the concern that the question of Namibia had yet to be resolved. Resolution 566, welcoming the worldwide campaign against apartheid, condemned South Africa for its continuing illegal occupation of Namibia and its defiance of resolutions on the topic. The resolution regarded the interim government in Windhoek as illegal, and declared that no recognition will be offered to it. It also supported the Namibian people in their \\"legitimate struggle\\", asking Member States to provide moral and material support to them. The Council went on to reject South Africa's efforts to link the independence of Namibia to irrelevant or extraneous issues incompatible with Resolution 435, and condemning all obstruction of it. Therefore, the Council insisted the United Nations plan is the only internationally accepted basis for a peaceful settlement of the issue. The resolution continued by outlining the Secretary- General's role in consultations with the Government of South Africa and resolving issues related to the implementation of Resolution 435, urging South Africa to cooperate with him, and that failure to do so will compel the Security Council to take further action under Chapter VII. Finally, the Council reminded Member States to continue to enforce the arms embargo against South Africa, including restrictions on investments, maritime and aerial relations, sport and cultural relations, and probitation of the sale of krugerrands. Resolution 566 was adopted by 13 votes to none, with two abstentions from the United Kingdom and United States.

Life He was born at Winchester (year unknown, but thought to have lived to past 70). He was educated at Winchester School and New College, Oxford, of which, after graduating B.A., he was admitted perpetual fellow on 5 April 1563. He left the university in 1565. He was minister at Norwich for five years, taken to be the period 1584‚Äì9. But he seems to have been in Norwich or the immediate neighbourhood at least as early as 1576, perhaps as assistant in the free school. His name appears in 1583 among the Norfolk divines (over sixty in number) who scrupled subscription to John Whitgift's three articles. He left an account of Norwich during his time. The leaders of the Puritans were John More, vicar of St. Andrew's (died 1592), and Thomas Roberts, rector of St. Clements (died 1576). For many years there was daily preaching, attended by the magistrates and over twenty of the city clergy, besides those of the cathedral. It was the custom each day for one or other of the magistrates to keep open house for the clergy, whose advice was sought in the city council. He saw the burning at Norwich, on 14 January 1589, of Francis Ket as an Arian. Burton testified to the apparent godliness of Ket's life and conversation, but is certain of his damnation. He also reports on the executions of Matthew Hamont (died 1579), John Lewes (died 1583) and Peter Cole (died 1587), all likewise burned. Burton took a Puritan line in rejecting ceremonies, but was firm against the Brownist separatists. He left Norwich after troubles which befell him about some matters of his ministry. In later years it was reported that the civic authorities had driven him away; his enemies wrote to Norwich for copies of records which they expected would tell against him; but it seems that the mayor and council had done their best to retain him. On leaving Norwich he found a friend in Henry Wentworth, 3rd Baron Wentworth, who took him into his house, gave him books, and was the means of his resuming work as minister. Richard Fletcher, Bishop of Bristol, gave him some appointment in Bristol. Complaints were made about his teaching, and he published his ‚ÄòCatechism,‚Äô 1591, which is a workmanlike presentation of Calvinism. In it he argues against bowing at the name of Jesus, and describes the right way of solemnising Christmas. He became vicar of St. Giles, Reading, on 25 November 1591. At some unknown date (after 1608) he came to London. He died intestate in the parish of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. His wife, Dorothy, survived him; his son Daniel administered to his effects on 17 May 1616. Works He calls his ‚ÄòCatechism,‚Äô 1591, his ‚Äòfirst fruites.‚Äô Of Burton's publications, the earliest written was a single sermon preached at Norwich on 21 December 1589 from Jer. iii. 14, but it was probably not published till later. He subsequently published several sets of sermons which had been delivered in Bristol. Anthony Wood enumerates eight subsequent collections of sermons and seven treatises, including ‚ÄòAn Abstract of the Doctrine of the Sabbath,‚Äô 1606. The little volume of sermons entitled ‚ÄòDauids Evidence‚Äô was reprinted in 1596, and in 1602. Burton translated seven dialogues of Erasmus, published to prove ‚Äòhow little cause the papists haue to boast of Erasmus, as a man of their side.‚Äô This was issued in 1606.

Opened in 1889, the line's usage declined after 1930 as road competition became stronger. In 1959 diesel railbuses were used for the line's passenger services; this initiative halted the decline, but did not reverse the financial losses on the line, and it closed completely in 1964. The main line at Kemble The Tetbury branch in 1889 Following on from the successful completion of the Great Western Railway between London and Bristol, there was a desire to open further railways connecting other important centres to the emerging railway network. The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway (C&GWUR;) was authorised in 1836 to build a line connecting Swindon (on the London to Bristol main line) and Cheltenham. The C&GWUR; ran into financial difficulties, and was unable to open its line promptly throughout, but it opened a section from Swindon to Cirencester via Kemble on 31 May 1841.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume I, 1833 ‚Äì 1863, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 170 The Great Western acquired the partly built C&GWUR; line in 1843 and proceeded with the construction of the remainder of the line.Ratified by Act in 1844. It opened onwards from Kemble on 12 May 1845, and there was a station named Tetbury Road. It was located close to the present-day Thames Head public house, immediately north of the Cirencester‚ÄìTetbury road.MacDermot, volume I, page 184Stephen Randolph, The Tetbury Branch, Wild Swan Publications, 1985, , pages 2 to 4 The line was broad gauge, until gauge conversion to in 1872.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume II, 1863 ‚Äì 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, pages 64 and 65 Tetbury Road station closed in 1882, remaining in service as Coates Goods depot.Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, fifth (electronic) edition, 2019 A line to Tetbury Railway Mania brought a huge number of railway schemes to the fore, and in the peak year of 1845 a Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Junction Railway was put forward. Running broadly north to south from Stonehouse to Chippenham, it would have passed close to Tetbury, but it was not built in the proposed form. Subsequently several schemes for north-south long-distance routes came and went. Tetbury railway station before 1920) A realistic proposal came forward when the independent Swindon and Cheltenham RailwayLater named the Midland and South Western Junction Railway. put forward a scheme for an extension of its own (as yet unbuilt) line. Its own main line was to run north from Swindon through Cirencester, and the extension would be a branch from Siddington, on its main line south of Cirencester, to Tetbury, crossing the GWR line. The GWR did not welcome a new line making a further encroachment into territory it considered its own, and it opposed the scheme in Parliament in 1883. To kill off the proposal it gave a formal undertaking to build a Tetbury branch itself. Accordingly in the 1884 session of Parliament, the GWR sought authorisation of a line from Kemble to Tetbury, 7 miles 6 chains in length, at an estimated cost of ¬£68,000, and the construction was authorised by Act of 7 August 1884.Colin G Maggs, Gloucestershire Railways, Halsgrove, Wellington, 2010, , pages 141 to 143 The GWR displayed no urgency in constructing the line and it was not until late 1887 that work started.Randolph, page 4 and 6 Construction and opening The earthworks were generally rather light, the greatest difficulty being cutting through a spur of rock near Tetbury to make a flat area for the goods yard part of the station. On 20 November 1889 Col Rich inspected the line on behalf of the Board of Trade; he reported that the permanent way consisted of Vignoles rail, fang bolted to sleepers. The line was single track, worked by train staff, and there were signal boxes at Kemble and at Tetbury, and the block telegraph was used. A siding at Culkerton was accessed by the use of a ground frame released by a key on the train staff.Col Rich, Report dated 20 November 1889, reproduced in Randolph, pages 11 and 12. The line opened to the public on 2 December 1889.Randolph, 9 to 13MacDermot, volume II, page 366 Train service The initial train service consisted of five passenger trains each way daily, except Sundays. It appears that mixed trains were the rule; in 1902 the 08:35 and 10:10 trains from Kemble, and the 11:50 trains from Tetbury were regularly mixed trains.Randolph, page 19 In the first few years of the twentieth century there were six return trains daily, taking between 17 and 25 minutes for the journey; the two mixed trains were allowed thirty minutes.Peter Dale, Gloucestershire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2002, , pages 7 and 8  Signalling improvements By 1910 the train staff system of operation was updated using the Webb and Thompson electric train staff system. The branch was controlled from Kemble West signalbox, and the signalbox at Tetbury. In 1929 the West box and the east box which controlled the Cirencester line, were abolished, and a new 62 lever box commissioned. From 1936 the Tetbury line was worked by the one engine in steam system. There were six round train trips daily at that time. The main line passenger train service was augmented considerably after World War II but the connections to and from the Tetbury line were sporadic.Adrian Vaughan, GWR Junction Stations, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1988, , pages 45, 47, 48, 50, and 52 to 54 Changes to infrastructure There was originally only a single intermediate station on the line, at Culkerton, but another, Rodmarton Platform, was added on 1 September 1904.Randolph, page 23 Rodmarton Platform was the first GWR stopping place to be designated \\"platform\\"; the term had been used in Scotland, to distinguish from a \\"halt\\". The station at Tetbury was originally constructed of timber, possibly to enable continuation of the line beyond Tetbury later. In 1916, the station building was in a poor condition, and a brick replacement was built. An additional wooden-platformed halt was added at Jackament's Bridge on 3 July 1939, to serve the nearby RAF aerodrome but this closed after the war in September 1948. Due to low usage, Culkerton station was closed on 5 March 1956, but it was later re-opened for the diesel railbus service.Randolph, page 91 Engines and rolling stock A diesel railbus at Tetbury station in the 1960sFor most of its existence, the daily routine on the branch line was the running of 8 trains per day up and down the line operated by steam tank engines. The passenger service usually consisted of two or three carriages and any freight wagons were added to the passenger train. The train engine performed any required shunting of goods wagons; for that reason the auto- train system was generally not favoured because of the time involved in uncoupling the through control mechanism if the engine was to be uncoupled from the passenger vehicle. At first 0-4-2 side tanks such as the GWR 517 Class were the main engine power on the line; later the 48XX and 58XX classes were in use, and later still 0-6-0 pannier tanks such as the GWR 1600 Class predominated.Randolph, page 104 The GWR appears never to have used their diesel railcars on the line. Sentinel locomotives In 1926, the GWR purchased two patent geared, four-wheeled steam locomotives from the Sentinel Waggon Works. They had vertical boilers set within the cab, rather than at one end. Capable of a speed of , No 12 was tested on the Tetbury branch, but it was not a success. Railbuses The branch in 1959Passenger business on the line declined sharply from the 1930s and further after 1945. In a cost-cutting measure aimed at reviving the fortunes of the line, diesel railbuses were introduced on the passenger service in February 1959, in combination with the Cirencester branch. The train service frequency was improved, and Culkerton station (which had been closed in 1956) was re-opened as a halt, and there were new halts at Church's Hill and Trouble House. The service of eight trains Monday to Saturday only, was provided by AC four-wheeled railbuses; they were powered with British United Traction diesel engines, and could seat 46. The train crew numbered two, with the guard selling tickets, avoiding staff cost at Tetbury booking office. The new halts were low-level platforms, reached from the railbus by extending steps.Randolph, page 77 At first there was a marked upsurge in passenger usage, to almost 13,000 annually, but this was not sustained. However the service still lost money. Accidents Early in the operation of the line, a fatality occurred on 9 October 1891, when a partially-deaf 85-year-old man, William Russell, was hit at the Larkhill crossing by the 05:20 from Kemble \\"literally cutting him to pieces, scattering his members about the line in horrible dissection\\". Later that year a man was crushed to death by a stone boulder while trimming back the rock cutting in Tetbury station yard. In June 1900, Olive Mitchell, the proprietress of a Tetbury grocer's shop, threw herself in front of a goods train at Kemble while returning from a stay in Gloucester Lunatic Asylum.Randolph, page 21 Soon after World War II, when there were still enough servicemen in the area to warrant the use of a NAAFI wagon to deliver supplies to Tetbury, one such wagon was pushed through the goods shed doors by its unattended engine.Randolph, page 73 Closure Following the Beeching Report of 1963, the line was earmarked for closure. The goods service on the line was discontinued on 4 August 1963. The last scheduled passenger train ran on 4 April 1964, but a steam-hauled special ran on the line on 5 April 1964; it was organised by the Gloucester Railway Society. In July 1964 contractors began lifting the track and the process was completed by the autumn. In the early 1970s, the station and engine shed were demolished. British Rail retained the land at Tetbury, and the goods shed was rented out and used as a warehouse by coal merchants and a tyre company, until it was sold to Tetbury Town Council in the mid-1990s.Randolph, page 100, 101 and 103 Locations * Kemble; main line station; opened 1 May 1882; still open; * Jackaments Bridge Halt; opened 3 July 1939; closed 27 September 1948; * Rodmarton platform; opened 1 September 1904; closed 6 April 1964; * Church's Hill Halt; opened 2 February 1959; closed 6 April 1964; * Culkerton; opened 2 December 1889; closed 5 March 1956; reopened 2 February 1959; closed 6 April 1964; * Trouble House Halt; opened 2 February 1959; closed 6 April 1964; * Tetbury; opened 2 December 1889; closed 6 April 1964.

Background  It is not known when Wang Shaoyi was born. His family had been, prior to his generation, in control of Chengde Circuit for two generations, after his grandfather Wang Tingcou seized control of the circuit in 821 without imperial approval and eventually forced the imperial government to acquiesce; his father Wang Yuankui later succeeded Wang Tingcou and took a more conciliatory stance with the imperial government. Wang Shaoyi had at least one older brother, Wang Shaoding.Old Book of Tang, vol. 142. When Wang Yuankui died in 855, the soldiers supported Wang Shaoding to succeed him. Then-reigning Emperor XuƒÅnzong initially made Wang Shaoding acting military governor, and, later in the year, full military governor. However, Wang Shaoding was inappropriate in his behavior, favoring drinking, and particularly liking to sling bullets at people from towers for fun. The soldiers became so displeased with him that they considered overthrowing him, but before they could do so, he fell ill and died in 857.

History Under the control of Ron Coles, Midlands Radio plc was floated on the full stock market in 1990. Following the introduction of the Broadcasting Act of 1990, a number of major groups began to lead a consolidation of the market. This led to Midlands Radio plc being purchased by for 18 million by Capital Radio plc, who then sold Trent, Leicester Sound, and Mercia Sound to GWR in 1993, but kept hold of BRMB. As Mercia and its medium wave frequency were sold in the bundle, GWR announced that 1359 kHz would be rebranded as Classic Gold. This meant Xtra AM would only continue in Birmingham, and due to the presenters urging Coventry listeners to retune to the Birmingham frequency GWR pulled the plug on Xtra AM in Coventry earlier than provisionally agreed. Under the new ownership, the FM stations were re-launched under GWR's Better Music Mix uniformed format. GEM continued to be live and local 24 hours a day until in 1997, when Tony Lyman's programme was networked from 12 midday - 3 p.m. across most of the Midlands and the Home Counties on the Classic Gold network, at this point the name of the station was changed to Classic Gold GEM. More and more shared programming began to creep in and the name GEM finally died on Friday 3 August 2007 at 7.00 p.m., when Classic Gold GEM became part of the Gold Network, following the merger of Classic Gold and Capital Gold. The only remaining local programme (12-4pm weekdays) is pre recorded.

Its leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide, linear to very narrow egg-shaped, usually half moon-shaped in cross section and covered with soft, silky hairs. The flowers are a shade of pink or purple, arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain two to six groups of flowers in threes. The outer surface of the flower cup (the hypanthium) is silky-hairy. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. Five bundles of stamens are seen around the flower, each with seven to nine stamens. Flowering occurs between August and January and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long and usually in small clusters along the stem.Salmon Gums Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sapientes was first formally described in 1999 by Lyndley Craven in Australian Systematic Botany from a specimen collected north of Salmon Gums. The specific epithet (sapientes) honours Rob and Ann Smart, farmers near Jerramungup, for their assistance with research into the Melaleuca genus. Sapientes is derived from the Latin word sapiens meaning \\"wise\\", hence \\"Smart\\". Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in and between the Jerramungup, Hyden, Salmon Gums, and Ponier Rock districts in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in gravel, sandy clay, or loam on slopes. Conservation Melaleuca sapientes is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This species of melaleuca has been cultivated as Melaleuca holosericea, mainly because of its attractive, silvery foliage. It grows well in a range of soils.

Biography Sources suggest that Willis was born either near Birmingham, Alabama, or at Irvin, Wilkes County, Georgia. In the late 1930s, he moved to North Carolina and started to play with musicians who were familiar with Blind Boy Fuller. Willis made his first recordings in 1944 and continued recording until 1953, issuing fifty tracks on several labels, including Savoy, Signature, 20th Century, Abbey, Jubilee, Prestige, Par, and King. Like Gabriel Brown, Alec Seward and Brownie McGhee, Willis relocated to New York City. At first he was recorded on his own, but eventually his record companies frequently paired him with accompanists. Judson Coleman joined Willis on his 20th Century recordings, and McGhee was employed in 1949. McGhee and Sonny Terry contributed to Willis's later recordings. Willis played in various musical styles, from slow blues to up-tempo country dance tracks. However, he spurned the growing popularity of folk blues and R&B.; He was musically conscious of Blind Lemon Jefferson and Luke Jordan, but in his later recordings his guitar style leaned towards the booming resonance of Lightnin' Hopkins. Willis died in New York City in June 1957, a week before his 48th birthday. His cause of death was unknown.

There are branches in Aberdeen (Scotland), Houston (USA), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Newcastle (England), Perth (Australia), London (England), Melbourne (Australia), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Singapore, Norway (Bergen), China (Beijing) West Africa (Nigeria), the Middle East (UAE) and new branches in early stages of development in St John's Newfoundland & the Eastern Mediterranean to be based in Cyprus.  Goals  SUT promotes the further understanding of the underwater environment and encourages: * Cross- fertilisation and dissemination of ideas, experience and information between workers in academic research, applied research and technology, industry and government * Development of techniques and tools to explore, study and exploit the oceans * Proper economic and sociological usage of resources in and beneath the oceans * Further education of scientists and technologists to maintain high standards in marine science and technology. SUT covers all aspects of technology applied to diving technology and physiology, submersible design and operation, naval architecture, underwater acoustics, subsea systems, geology, geophysics, marine resource exploitation, oceanography, environmental studies, pollution and marine biology. Evening lectures & online webinars are organised by most of the branches. Training courses are offered to industry, in particular \\"Subsea Awareness\\" courses, and the society also hosts a \\"Registered Subsea Engineer\\" scheme. Starting in 2020, SUT along with the Marine Technology Society have begun to offer Chartered Marine Technologist (CMarTech) professional status under license from the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology. Education about the marine world, in particular marine industry, is a strong focus for the society and it supports a number of studentships through awards and an \\"Educational Support Fund\\". In 2013 SUT Council voted to incorporate the Engineering Committee on Oceanic Resources (ECOR) into SUT.  Journal  SUT publishes a peer-reviewed scientific journal, Underwater Technology, and a monthly magazine UT2.  History  The Society for Underwater Technology was founded in 1966 following the demise of the Underwater Equipment Research Society the previous year. This precursor society had been set up to facilitate the \\"interchange of information between users and suppliers of [undersea] equipment\\". Many of its members went on to become early members of the SUT. In 1966 a steering committee was put in place to form the society, leading directly to the first general meeting on 2 March 1967, hosted by Lord Wakefield of Kendall in the House of Lords. Lord Wakefield was elected as president, with Rear Admiral Sir Edmund Irving as the first chairman of council, Nic Flemming as honorary secretary, and V. Grimoldby as honorary treasurer. The original technical committees were \\"Biological Technology\\", \\"Earth Science\\", and \\"General Technology\\". The first annual meeting was held 7 December 1967 at the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, where the Society had also found a home through the institute's \\"daughter society\\" scheme, paying ¬£500 a year for office space and administrative assistance. At this time the Society's association with what was to become Oceanology International was initiated with plans to run a major international conference in 1969 alongside an existing exhibition series in Brighton. In the early 1970s, branches were developed, mainly in the United Kingdom, while tie-ups with overseas organisations such as the Marine Technology Society in the US and the Engineering Committee for Ocean Engineering were also being sought. Branches were established in East Scotland, West Scotland, East Anglia, Southern England, and Southwest England, while overseas branch possibilities were looked at in Europe. At the beginning of the 1980s, the branch structure was reduced to a group of regional organisers who organised activities across the United Kingdom in the Southwest, Southern England, the Midlands and Northwest, Scotland East, Scotland Northeast, and Scotland West. In the 1990s the Aberdeen Branch, Southern, and Northeastern Branches were formed. In 1983 the Educational Support Fund was launched. In 1990 SUT moved home to the Institute of Marine Engineers and in 2019 moved to an office located at 2 John Street, London WC1N 2ES. Cmdr Ian Gallett RN (retired) succeeded Cmdr David Wardle RN (retired) as Secretary (later Chief Executive Officer) of SUT in 1994, with Dr Bob Allwood taking on the role in 2009. SUT was modernised throughout the period of Ian Gallett & Bob Allwood's leadership, emerging as a modern, international marine Learned Society with updated statutes and structure by 2015. By this point over 40% of members were located outside the UK, with the strongest branches being Aberdeen, Houston, London and Perth (Australia) and smaller branches operating in Brazil, China, Malaysia, Norway & Singapore plus emerging branches in Canada and Middle East. In April 2017 Stephen Hall, former vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO became the Chief Executive on Bob Allwood's retirement, and served until December 2020. The Engineering Committee on Oceanic Resources, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, became a partner of SUT in 2013. During 2020 as a consequence of the global coronavirus outbreak and difficulty in conducting face to face meetings, SUT began offering a weekly Underwater Technology podcast, and fortnightly webinars. As of October 2020 the main committees of SUT were: * Diving and manned submersibles * Defence * Education * Environmental Forces * International * Marine Renewable Energies * Ocean Resources * Offshore Site Investigation and Geotechnics * Panel on Underwater Robotics (with ECOR, the Engineering Committee on Oceanic Resources) * Policy Advisory * Publications * Salvage and Decommissioning * Training References External links  Weekly Podcast Category:Diving organizations Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom Category:Marine engineering organizations Category:Organisations based in the City of London Category:1966 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Scientific organizations established in 1966 Category:Submarines Category:Transport organisations based in London Category:Underwater diving companies ","title":"Society for Underwater Technology"},{"id":"26080223","text":"Hajibala Ibrahim oglu Abutalybov (, born May 13, 1944) is a Turkmen Azerbaijani politician and deputy prime minister of Azerbaijan.

The train had a green signal and was traveling at about when it hit the switch. The incident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and was found to be an Amtrak contractor's fault, caused by one of its employees improperly applying jumper wires to the signal system, bypassing safeguards that had been designed to prevent such an occurrence.

Google maintains that the photos were taken from public property. However, this does not take into account that the Street View cameras take pictures from an elevated position, enabling them to look over hedges and walls designed to prevent some areas from being open to public view. Before launching the service, Google removed photos of domestic violence shelters, and additionally allows users to flag inappropriate or sensitive imagery for Google to review and remove. When the service was first launched, the process for requesting that an image be removed was not trivial. Google changed its policy to make removal more straightforward, but has since removed the option to request removal of an image, replacing it by an option to request blurring of an image. Images of potential break-ins, sunbathers, and individuals entering adult bookstores have, however, remained active and these images have been widely republished. In Europe, the creation of Google Street View may not be legal in all jurisdictions. Some European countries have laws prohibiting the filming without consent of an individual on public property for the purpose of public display. Google Street View blurs parts of images containing car number plates and human faces in order to protect privacy and anonymity. Americas Argentina In Argentina, Street View cars started taking pictures four years later than originally planned. Initially, Google planned to start collecting images on the same day as in Brazil but they didn't get government permits. These permits were obtained in September 2013. One day after Google Street View cars started taking pictures, a lawyer from La Plata tried to stop them in his city but on October 4, 2013 a justice dismissed his complaint. Canada While Canada, like other jurisdictions, has raised the issue of privacy concerns regarding Google Street View, the presence of Google cameras in one Canadian city in March 2009 gave rise to a different complaint. Les MacPherson, a columnist with the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, complained in a March 28, 2009, column that the timing of the imaging, at the end of a protracted winter season and before the true onset of spring would cast an unfavourable image of Saskatoon and other cities. \\"What worries me more than any loss of privacy is the prospect of presenting to the world a highly unflattering impression of Canadian cities. With the possible exception of Victoria, they do not show off well in the spring. Google could not have picked a more inauspicious time to do its scanning. Saskatoon is unfortunately typical. For Google to record its images of the city at this most visually unappealing time of year is like photographing a beautiful woman who has just awakened from a six-month coma,\\" he wrote. In early October 2009, the first Canadian cities began to appear on Street View; several, including Saskatoon, were not included in the initial roll-out. One city that was included, Calgary, included images taken in both summer and winter. Images of Saskatoon were rolled out on December 2, 2009. United States Google delayed the release of Street View of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area following concern expressed by the United States Department of Homeland Security that some of the images taken might be of security-sensitive areas. Additionally, the Department of Defense has banned Google from publishing Street View content of U.S. Military bases and asked Google to remove existing content of bases. Google has complied with this order. Some cities in the United States where all streets are privately owned have asked Google to remove Street View images because their consent was not given. North Oaks, Minnesota may have been the first. In that case, Google complied. Aaron and Christine Boring, a Pittsburgh couple, sued Google for invasion of privacy. Street View made a photo of their home available online, and they claimed that this diminished the value of their house, which they had chosen for its privacy. They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. \\"While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, it is hard to believe that any ‚Äì other than the most exquisitely sensitive ‚Äì would suffer shame or humiliation,\\" Judge Hay ruled. Since then the decision was reversed in part and on December 1, 2010 Magistrate Judge Bissoon ruled that Google is an intentional trespasser and the company was ordered to pay one US dollar to the plaintiffs. In September 2007, a Street View vehicle took a picture of a house on fire in Gibson, Arkansas. In August 2008, the people who lived in the house asked Google to remove this picture. In 2010, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stating that Google's admitted downloading of private Wi-Fi data constituted a violation of The US Wiretap Act and The Federal Communications Act. The FTC decided not to take up the complaint. Documents subsequently obtained by EPIC under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) indicated, despite a request from Congress,http://epic.org/privacy/ftc/google/5_19_10_Markey_Barton_FTC_re_Google_WiFi.pdf that the FTC did not examine Google's data from private wireless networks before dropping the case. EPIC filed an administrative appeal with the FTC,http://epic.org/privacy/ftc/google/FTC_Streetview_FOIA_Appeal2.pdf challenging its decision, and in May 2011 EPIC filed a suit against the FTC for access to the documents on which the FTC's decision was based.http://epic.org/privacy/streetview/FTC_FOIA_Complaint_Final.pdf Asia Hong Kong Before the launch of Google Street View in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has taken the initiative to inquire into the Google Street View Project, to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in Hong Kong and to consider privacy issues that may arise. Google declares that the Project does not intend to compile information about specific individuals whose identities can be ascertained. Faces of passers-by and car licence plates in the photographs will be unidentifiable because blurring technology is to be used. Also, there will be at least a three-month gap between image gathering and publication, to prevent the images being used to identify an individual's current whereabouts. Google also assures the Commissioner that if anyone objects to any image of themselves, their cars, houses or children captured by the cameras, the related image will be removed. The commissioner concluded that Google Street View does not breach Hong Kong privacy laws. But he will look seriously into any complaint made by an affected individual in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. India Google started taking Street View images in Bangalore, India, on May 26, 2011. A Google executive promised that they would do their best to avoid security concerns. However, on June 20, 2011, Street View was blocked in Bangalore due to security concerns from the police in Bangalore. Google officials and leaders from BJP, the ruling party in Karnataka, organized a meeting on July 19, 2011, to continue Street View in Bangalore. The Google officials, however, failed to convince the leaders that they would not violate any privacy laws. Google has yet to receive permission to launch its Street View feature in India. The country is worried about Google's plans to put Indian cities, tourist spots, hills and rivers in an application in which one can explore through 360-degree, panoramic and street level imagery because terrorists are using these maps to plan terrorist attacks in India. Official sources said after a detailed analysis by security agencies and defense forces feel that allowing Google to cover India would compromise the country's security interest. Once the proposed Geo spatial Information Regulation Bill, 2016 comes into force, issues related to internet-based application would be resolved in India. As of October 2017 Google is in talks with the Indian Government to bring back street view services in India. Due to India being threatened by terrorist attacks, the Indian Government is not likely to allow Google Street View services. As of March 2018, the Indian Government has rejected Google Street View due to security concerns. Japan In Japan, Google Street View started in August 2008 and was made available for ten Japanese Prefectures in February 2009. The available Street View areas depicted residential and business areas, and showed the faces of pedestrians, displayed vehicle registration plates, and the ‚Äì Google's decision to show these has led to disputes. Local governments, lawyers and individuals claimed Google was violating privacy. On February 3, 2009, Google Japan representatives attended a meeting about privacy concerns held at a Tokyo Metropolitan Government facility, and agreed that privacy issues had not been adequately considered. Google pledged that, before taking photographs for Street View, they would in future notify the provinces' local government. Google Japan admitted that notifications and explanations of this kind had already been taking place in countries other than Japan, but had not done so in Japan as they were not aware of the potential privacy concerns.Yomiuri Shimbun (Japanese edition), February 4, 2009 Ver.13S page 28 On May 13, 2009, Google Japan announced that it would modify their cameras to scan from a lower height of 2.05 meters above ground level, 95 centimeters lower than the original height of the camera head. The new height is intended to avoid having cameras view over fences in front of homes and into homes. This reduced height is to apply immediately, and all areas previously visited will be rescanned from the reduced height. Scans taken at the original height will remain available until they are replaced with the new images. On November 11, 2011, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued an administrative guidance to Google Inc. that its collecting activity of Wi-Fi data were against the law of telecommunication which requests secrecy of communication, and requested to delete the recorded data, to take measures of preventing of recording the communication data, and to let it be known publicly in Japanese. Australia Australia has no laws prohibiting Google Street View. But in October 2010, despite this, Google Street View ceased operations in Australia, following months of investigations from Australian authorities. However, on May 4, 2011, Google announced that they planned to begin production again and on July 27, 2011 the Street View imagery for Australian towns and cities was updated. Europe Austria In Austria Street View was banned shortly after the launch after Wifi data was collected unauthorized. The ban has since been lifted but strict regulations were put in place that cause Street View to not be deployed despite available data. Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, Street View was banned in September 2010 by the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection after more than half a year of unsuccessful negotiation between the Czech Republic and Google. The Office described Google's program as taking pictures ‚Äúbeyond the extent of the ordinary sight from a street‚Äù, and that it ‚Äúdisproportionately invade citizens‚Äô privacy.‚Äù However, pictures taken before this decision (mostly in 2009) may have remained available online but Google was obliged to erase every picture from that period should they be disputed. In May 2011, the ban was lifted after Google lowered the cameras by 30 centimeters. European Union A recent demand from the European Union would require Google to warn local residents before sending out the cameras. It also required Google to keep the not blurred versions of the photos no longer than 6 months, instead of a year. This requirement was abolished on January 1, 2012. Google was instructed to give advance notice online and in the local press before photographing. In 2010, Google announced that it might cancel Google Street View service in the European Union due to unmanageable requests of the European Commission. The Data Protection Directive says that identifiable people have a right to data protection. Denmark According to a Danish media lawyer, Oluf J√∏rgensen, Google's practice of photographing people on private property is illegal. The Danish data authorities advised people who are photographed by Google, to turn Google in to the police. Since then, Google hasn't had any legal problems and continued filming. In 2010, Denmark, along with Ireland and Austria, requested that Google delete the WiFi data the company had collected, unauthorized. Google complied with all three requests. Germany In an April 2009 interview for the German magazine Focus, Google's Global Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer remarked that \\"public opposition to Google Street View in Germany, though not hysterical, had been tougher than in any other country.\\"Focus No. 18/2009, p. 20 (April 28, 2009) On the same occasion he stated that the project has now been \\"essentially aligned with the concerns of data privacy advocates,\\" and that \\"specific privacy tools would be developed for the German launch while imaging continues at the fastest possible pace.\\" The option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in Germany. German Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor Guido Westerwelle said \\"I will do all I can to prevent it.\\" However, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re said that people should not get \\"hysterical\\" about the issue and called for \\"caution in introducing blanket rules allowing objections.\\" As of October 2010, 244,237 German households have opted out Street View. Google complied by blurring the facades on the corresponding Street View images. This procedure is misleadingly called 'pixelating' in Germany (German: 'Verpixeln'). At a forum on privacy held in Berlin by the Green Party, a member of the audience asked whether future historians would blame the current generation for leaving German cities in digital ruins as bombs did the real landscape in World War II. In April 2013 Google was fined ‚Ç¨145,000 for illegally recording information from unsecured wireless networks. Greece Google had been stopped from gathering images in Greek cities for its Street View service until it provides further guarantees about privacy. However, on January 18, 2010, the government legalized the service under the condition that adequate privacy protection would be realized. The service is enabled as of June 2013. Lithuania In May 2012 the Lithuanian State Data Protection Inspectorate (SDPI) refused permission for the Google Street View project to operate in Lithuania. The Transport Minister asked the Inspectorate to review its decision. The decision was changed and Google later was able to take photos of streets in Lithuania. Poland On May 2009 the Polish GIODO (G≈Ç√≥wny Inspektorat Ochrony Danych Osobowych - Chief Inspectorate for the Protection of Personal Data) expressed doubts about Google Street View and its privacy, mostly concerned about the same issues as in other EU countries. However, from 2010 onwards, Google cars appeared on the Polish streets with the consent of state authorities and in consultation with the Ministry of Sport and Tourism. In 2011 GIODO began monitoring service Street View and published the report which included non-binding demand that Google should clearly communicate and warn when it's going to take pictures in a certain area at a certain time. It was also proposed that car drivers should be added to the records of persons who process personal data in accordance to the Polish law. Switzerland In November 2009, Switzerland's Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner Hanspeter Th√ºr announced that his agency would be suing Google because in Street View \\"numerous faces and vehicle number plates are not made sufficiently unrecognizable from the point of view of data protection\\".Swiss Contend Google Doesn't Blur Street View Enough PC World by Jeremy Kirk United Kingdom In the first days of launch the UK service drew criticism due to privacy. Images were found of a man leaving a sex shop, a man vomiting and another man being arrested. Some images were removed including those of areas around Downing Street. The service drew criticism in Belfast that it represented a \\"reckless\\" security risk, particularly for showing the exteriors of army bases and police stations so soon after the killing of two soldiers in the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting, and a police officer. Soon after the launch human rights watchdog Privacy International sent a formal complaint about the service to the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which cited more than 200 reports from members of the public who were identifiable on Street View images. Privacy International director Simon Davies said that the organization had filed the complaint due to the \\"clear embarrassment and damage\\" Street View had caused to many Britons. He said that Street View fell short of the assurances given by Google to the ICO in July 2008 that had enabled its launch, namely that privacy would be protected by blurring faces and vehicle licence plates, and asked for the system to be \\"switched off\\" while an investigation was completed. He said the few cases where Google's face blurring system had failed meant the data used by Street View would fall under UK Data Protection legislation, which requires that subjects give permission for the use of information concerning them. Davies subsequently sent an open letter to then-Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, accusing the company of briefing journalists against him, claiming Davies was biased in favour of Microsoft. Google has pointed to connections between Microsoft and data protection consultancy 80/20 Thinking, run by Davies, and has said that Davies' connections to Microsoft should be made clear in public, as the credibility of his criticisms is undermined by the fact that he acts as a consultant to companies who are direct rivals and critics of Google, a fact Davies rarely discloses in press releases or comments. On April 23, 2009, the Information Commissioner ruled that although Google Street View carries a small risk of privacy invasion it should not be stopped. They ruled that \\"There is no law against anyone taking pictures of people in the street as long as the person using the camera is not harassing people\\". They also ruled that Google Street View does not contravene the Data Protection Act, as an image of a house held on Street View is not a data protection matter, as data protection is about people's personal information. In March 2010, Google was forced to remove images of military, security and intelligence installations admitting that it had ignored signs warning that photographing the sites breached the Official Secrets Act with fears that the published photographs could be useful to terrorists.

The band's original lineup consisted of singer Christopher Scum, guitarist Steven Crime, bassist \\"Shaggy\\", and drummer B. Riot. Formed in 2004, their first album, Frogwater Injection, sold over 400 copies (via \\"official\\" CD-R, available from the band), despite not being formally released. The band became known for their live performances which typically featured blood and self-abuse. Singer Christopher Scum became known for his purportedly cathartic on-stage antics, such as beating himself with a pair of brass knuckles attached to his microphone. The band released their second album Biscuits and Liquor in 2006. From 2006, the band became the focus of a full-length documentary ‚Äì Rebel Scum The Movie ‚Äì produced by Atlanta-based company Worldstorm Art Labs. After two years of filming, the movie finally premiered to a private Knoxville audience in January 2010. Opening to a flurry of positive reviews from those present on the night, the film was released on DVD in 2015. After losing bassist \\"Shaggy\\", Scum took over that position and the band continues to perform as a three-piece to this day. Under his Christopher \\"Scum\\" soubriquet, Christopher also performs and self-releases solo material. Since the re-release of Fifty Acres of Pain, Christopher Scum has been more successful than ever. On June 27, 2015, Scum, his long-time girlfriend Donna Renee Bailey, and their dog, Mackey were involved in a serious car accident when their SUV was hit from behind by a diesel tanker that jackknifed and exploded. Scum suffered serious burns and was airlifted to a burn center in Augusta, Georgia. His girlfriend Renee and their dog did not survive.

When the Tibetan Empire plunged into civil war, he led a rebellion, capturing several cities and reverted the area's allegiance to the Tang Dynasty. He subsequently conquered the Hexi Corridor and governed it as the military commissioner (Jiedushi) of Guiyi Circuit (headquartered in modern Dunhuang) under nominal authority of the Tang emperors.  Rebellion against the Tibetans  Mogao cave 156, Late Tang Dynasty Little is known about Zhang Yichao's early life, other than that he was a resident of Sha Prefecture (Dunhuang). Following the Anshi Rebellion, Tibet conquered Sha and Gua prefecture of Tang dynasty in the year of 781. Chinese population of the locality remained. By 851, the Tibetan Empire which had ruled the southern Tarim Basin and modern Gansu region since 790 was being torn by civil war. In 848, Zhang secretly planned a rebellion with the other Han Chinese, Yugur (Uyghur), Tuyuhun and Qiang residents of Sha Prefecture to return Sha Prefecture to Tang allegiance. One day, he led armed soldiers and approached the city gates, and the Han all rose in response. The Tibetan garrisons abandoned the city and fled. Zhang thereafter claimed the title of acting prefect of Sha Prefecture and submitted a petition to Emperor XuƒÅnzong of Tang, offering his loyalty and submission. XuƒÅnzong thus made him Official Guard (Èò≤Á¶¶‰Ωø, Fangyushi) of Sha Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. Later in the year, Zhang's launched an attack on ten other nearby prefectures with Tibetan garrisons ‚Äî Gua (ÁìúÂ∑û, in modern Jiuquan, Gansu); Yi (‰ºäÂ∑û, in modern Hami Prefecture, Xinjiang); Xi (Ë•øÂ∑û, in modern Turpan Prefecture, Xinjiang); Gan (ÁîòÂ∑û, in modern Zhangye, Gansu); Su (ËÇÖÂ∑û, in modern Jiuquan); Lan (Ëò≠Â∑û, in modern Lanzhou, Gansu); Shan (ÈÑØÂ∑û, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai); He (Ê≤≥Â∑û, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu); Min (Â≤∑Â∑û, in modern Dingxi, Gansu); and Kuo (ÂªìÂ∑û, in modern Haidong). Afterwards they prepared maps of the 11 prefectures and his brother Zhang Yize () submitted them to XuƒÅnzong at Chang'an to prove their allegiance to the Tang dynasty. XuƒÅnzong named the 11 prefectures Guiyi Circuit (), with its capital at Sha Prefecture, and made Zhang Yichao its military commissioner and his secretary Cao Yijin () its secretary general.  As military governor of Guiyi  In 863, Zhang Yichao led a group of 7,000 Han and non-Han soldiers to capture Liang Prefecture (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, in modern Wuwei, Gansu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. In 866, Zhang submitted a report stating that the Uyghur chieftain Pugu Jun () had recaptured from the Tibetan Empire Xi Prefecture, Ting Prefecture (Â∫≠Â∑û, in modern Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang), Luntai (Ëº™Âè∞, in modern √úr√ºmqi, Xinjiang), and Qingzhen (Ê∏ÖÈéÆ, modern location unknown) ‚Äî apparently implying that Pugu Jun did so under his command. In 867, Zhang visited Chang'an and paid homage to Emperor Yizong of Tang. Yizong made him a general of the imperial guards and kept him at Chang'an. Yizong also commissioned Zhang's nephew Zhang Huaishen () to serve as the acting military governor of Guiyi. He died in 872, probably while residing at Chang'an.

Michener, the last to be released during his lifetime. (Recessional, however, was the last to be completed.) In addition to his output of large, multigenerational novels, Michener was also a prolific journalist, traveling around the world and reporting on a variety of issues for peer-reviewed journals and sometimes for individual publication as novels,Michener: A Writer's Journey, Stephen May, University of Oklahoma Press, 2005 as was the case with The Bridge at Andau and Iberia. Miracle in Seville is just such a book. The tale is narrated by Shenstone, an American sports writer who is in Spain to research an article about a disgraced breeder of fighting bulls. He witnesses a miraculous intervention, and a conflict between the Virgin Mary and the fortune teller sister of a matador who may have cursed the rancher's herd. Plot The story draws on religious themes, interweaving gypsy traditions, belief in the intervening power of the Virgin Mary, and the hope of God's forgiveness and redemption, into the Spanish tradition of bullfighting. The action occurs during Holy Week in Spain, and Michener competently captures the religious processions. He provides meticulous detail of bull fights (although some reviewers have taken umbrage at supposedly erroneous details in his narrative). The tale involves a Gypsy matador (Lazaro L√≥pez), his sister (Magdalena L√≥pez) who reads fortunes, a cross-eyed Virgin Mary (La Bizca), the American writer (Shenstone), the Spanish bull breeder (Don Cayetano Mota) who is struggling to revive his once-famed herd, and of course the many bulls in Mota's herd. Despite his initial skepticism, the American is drawn into Mota's efforts, which involve fervent prayers to The Virgin and Herculean acts undertaken during Holy Week to prove his devotion and piety. He knows that his prayers will eventually be rewarded, and this knowledge allows him to live with the often-humiliating performance of his bulls in the arena vis-a-vis the arrogant G√≥mez. We learn that Lazaro L√≥pez is also being aided by a powerful female, his sister, who may have the ability to curse the bulls that her brother must face. She is determined that her brother must prevail. References Category:1995 American novels Category:Novels by James A.

Early life and education Thomas was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on January 13, 1807 to father William Lawson and mother Frances Lawson. He worked his way up in the dry goods industry, first as a clerk they up to having his own store at the age of 21. Also having a passion for painting, he began to teach himself the art by copying famous works of other artists. By his 23rd birthday, he was accepted to the National Academy of Design in New York City where he trained for a half year in the art of drawing, and then went on to Philadelphia in the Spring of 1832 for another six months. After a year of formal training, Thomas returned to Newburyport to open his own studio, where he remained as a portrait painter for the next decade. On December 17, 1838 he married Catherine, daughter of Nathan Follansbee of Newburyport. Lowell years In 1842, Thomas Lawson relocated his family to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he quickly became one of the prominent portrait painters. He painted many social elites, such as; John Avery, George Brownell, Jane A Lock, Judge John Look, Rev. Miles, John Nesmith. In 1844, he was commissioned to travel to Washington, D.C. and paint Daniel Webster who was acting Secretary of State at the time. Secretary Webster sat a dozen times for Thomas to complete the work, but well worth the effort. Thomas was commissioned to replicate the painting over twenty times, and according to Fredrick W. Colburn, Daniel Webster complimented the painting for its uncanny likeness by saying; \\"That is the face I shave.\\" During the American Civil War, Lawson shifted his talent to painting more still lives, especially grapes and fruits. All in all, he painted some 30 still lives. In 1878, Lawson was instrumental in creating the Lowell Art Association, as founder and first president, which is the organization that is responsible for the preservation of the birthplace of James Whistler and the creation of the Whistler House Museum of Art. Having not forgotten his roots, Thomas also donated to the improvement and development of the Newburyport Public Library. In 1883 he donated one of his Daniel Webster portraits, and in 1884 he donated the portrait of Caleb Cushing.\\"History of Newburyport Mass.(1764-1909)\\", John J.

Japanese Village was the nickname for a range of houses constructed in 1943 by the U.S. Army in the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, roughly southwest of Salt Lake City.

The purpose of the replicas of Japanese homes, which were repeatedly rebuilt after being intentionally burned down, was to perfect the use of incendiary bombing tactics, the fire bombing of Japanese cities during World War II. Testing on the Japanese Village at Dugway Proving Ground coincided with the erosion of precision bombing practice in the U.S. Army Air Force and validated civilians as targets of air warfare during World War II. As such, the interiors of Japanese Village contained furnishing (including tables, futon, radios, chests, hibachi stoves, etc.) as found in contemporaneous Japanese housing. The principal architect for Japanese village was Antonin Raymond who had spent many years building in Japan. Boris Laiming, who had studied fires in Japan, writing a report on the 1923 Tokyo fire, also contributed. The most successful bomb to come out of the May‚ÄìSeptember 1943 tests against the mock-up Japanese homes was the napalm-filled M-69 Incendiary cluster bomb. Contenders had been the M-47 (containing coconut oil, rubber, and gasoline) and the M-50 (a blend of magnesium and powdered aluminum and iron oxide). Also tested was the \\"Bat bomb\\" a lightweight \\"bat incendiary\\" that was attached to live bats. For the tests B-17 and B-24 bombers were used operating at normal bombing altitude, and the effects on the villages were meticulously recorded. Popular culture The novel The Gods of Heavenly Punishment by Jennifer Cody Epstein contains a fictionalized account of the building and destruction of the Japanese Village.

In 1787 the weavers went on strike. Troops opened fire on the demonstrators and six weavers were killed. In the early 19th century, many of the weavers emigrated to Canada, settling in Carleton Place and other communities in eastern Ontario, where they continued their trade. Origins Handloom weaving in 1747, from William Hogarth's Industry and Idleness In 1705, Walkinshaw of Barrowfield bought some pastureland from the community of Glasgow, then known by the name of Blackfauld, on which he started to establish a weaving village. Walkinshaw was involved in the 1715 Jacobite rising, which ruined him. Glasgow Town Council reacquired the land in 1723, naming the area Calton, a name retained when Glasgow sold Calton to the Orr family in 1730. The land lay on the east bank of the River Clyde just upstream of Glasgow. Although close to the center of modern Glasgow, Calton was an independent village, later a municipal burgh, that was not incorporated in the city of Glasgow until 1846. The newly formed weaving settlement of Calton was beyond the reach of the Glasgow weavers guild. On 23 February 1725 an agreement was recorded between the weavers of Glasgow and the weavers of Calton and Blackfaulds to regulate and control the industry, to ensure good standards of craftmanship and to prevent destructive competition. The agreement involved payment. As late as 1830, the weavers in Calton were paying the weavers of Glasgow five groats out of every loom, and thirty pounds Scots yearly. The technology of weaving improved throughout eighteenth century, while remaining accessible to the master weaver working in his home. The quality of linen cloth became more uniform and productivity was higher. There was steady demand from Britain's North American and Caribbean colonists and slave plantations, protected from European competition. At the peak of Calton's prosperity after 1780, when the fly-shuttle was introduced, wages had risen to nearly ¬£100 a year and weavers had risen to high places in society. The handweavers and warpers of Calton were known for their clubs or friendly societies. The Calton book club was educational in intent, reflecting the aspirations of skilled workers just above the common laborer on the social scale. Other clubs were more concerned with issues such as wages and working conditions. Their descendants were much later to evolve into trade unions. The community appears to have been better administered than the neighboring city of Glasgow. As late as 1840 a study noted that the burgh of Calton was not exposed to the same degree of \\"animadversion\\" as Glasgow. The magistrates required that all lodging houses were licensed, and laid down sanitary regulations that were rigidly enforced. The streets were intersected with common sewers of the best description, which were kept very clean. Industrial revolution During the period between 1760 and 1830 the Lowland Clearances reduced demand for farm labour, forcing families to the cities to find work, usually in the mills. Life was hard; poverty, disease and desperation were rife. The displaced cottars had few skills other than weaving. They crowded the mills depressing wages. The end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 released soldiers into the workforce, increasing the problem. Irish immigrants also swelled the working population. By 1851, 23% of the population of Glasgow was Irish in origin. The Irish were blamed for crime and unemployment but, evidence of the time showed that, in fact, the Irish were more willing to work and less likely to seek relief than the Scots. Illustration of power loom weaving in 1835, from History of the cotton manufacture in Great Britain by Edward Baines (1800‚Äì1890). An idealized view of women working in a clean and spacious environment. From the later part of the 18th century, and accelerating in the 19th century, the weaving industry became increasingly mechanized. The flying shuttle halved the time to weave a piece, although it was not introduced to Scotland until the end of the 18th century. Steam-powered spinning mills were built starting in 1798. Power looms were used in Scottish linen weaving as early as 1810. Population growth and industrial mechanization combined to cause increasing social problems. Social problems Calton Weavers Strike In the summer of 1787, the journeymen weavers of the Calton started to agitate for a wage increase. The dispute grew bitter, with the strikers cutting the webs from the looms of weavers who continued to work at the old rate, and making bonfires in the street from the contents of warehouses. On 3 September the city magistrates, with a force of officers, went to the Calton but were driven back by the mob. A detachment of the 39th Regiment marched, and a pitched battle occurred at Parkhouse, in Duke Street. The Riot Act was read, and a volley of musket fire killed three of the weavers and injured others. Further disturbances were quickly suppressed by the troops. This was the earliest major industrial dispute in Scottish history. The Calton Weavers became Scotland's first working-class martyrs. Nineteenth century In October 1800 there were food riots in Calton. In 1816 a soup kitchen was established in Calton which led to a riot that again had to be put down by troops. By the 1830s the Calton handloom weavers were among the most destitute of the skilled working class. Not just men but women and children worked the looms in their struggle to survive. During the frequent depressions of that period many were forced to pawn their bedding and clothes to avoid starvation. Powerloom factories threatened the weavers. In 1816 two thousand rioters tried to destroy such factories in Calton and stoned the workers. An 1812 inquiry into wages was told that 1792 regulations pricing weavers' work had not been adhered to. Wages had fallen from 18 shillings for six days work to 8 shillings. In 1834 an inquiry found that there was full employment but the large numbers meant that all were very poor. The average working day was said to be 13 hours, with 6 shillings 5 pence being earned for a six-day week, from which a frame rent of 1 shilling 5 pence was deducted. Although women had long worked as weavers, journeymen weavers regarded women as competition. In 1810 the Calton association of weavers had moved that no new female apprentices could be taken except from the weaver's own families. In June 1833, male cotton spinners struck against female spinners at Dennistoun's mill in Calton, using violent means to drive them from the workplace. Children were frequently employed in the mills. The proprietor of a factory in New Lanark said that when he bought the mill he found 500 children working there, mostly between the ages of five and eight, who had been taken from the poor-houses. Although the children had been well fed and clothed, their growth was stunted in many cases. Another mill owner claimed that most of the children he employed, who were under the age of ten, had very poor parents. If they were deprived of work this would cause great hardship. A Factories Inquiry Commission of 1833 found that children working in the mills were often too tired to eat and, when woken in the morning, unable to dress themselves. Scotland was considered the worst area for child cruelty and their tiredness often caused serious accidents with the machinery. A writer in the 1840s said that \\"the religious, moral and intellectual conditions of the weavers were long of a very high grade ... but as poverty prevents many of them from attending public worship, and still more from educating their children, there can be little doubt that their character is fast deteriorating, and that their children will be in a still more deplorable condition.\\" A report on the state of the burgh of Calton presented by a magistrate to the British Association described high levels of pilfering, including the bowl weft system generally carried on by weavers and winders. These workers embezzled cotton yarns, silks, etc. and sold them to small manufacturers to eke out their wages by an amount estimated at one penny per day for each man. The Templeton's Carpet Factory in the Calton, opened in 1892, designed to resemble the Doge's Palace in Venice. During its construction, on 1 November 1889, part of a wall collapsed. Over 100 women working in the weaving sheds at the back were trapped and 29 were killed. With the incorporation into Glasgow of 1846, the later history of Calton and its weavers is part of Glasgow's history. The city expanded further and the textile mills, clothing factories and dyeworks enlarged together with carpet- making and leather works. Exporting was greatly enabled by new shipping iines using the deepened River Clyde. The city also diversified into heavy industries like shipbuilding, locomotive construction and other engineering that could thrive on nearby supplies of coal and iron ore. Migration The Scottish weaver communities formed many emigration societies, seeking for government assistance. They were granted some help with their passage and free land in the Rideau Valley, a strategically important part of Upper Canada where the government was anxious to settle loyal Scots. Nearly three thousand people were helped to emigrate in 1820 and 1821, founding the Lanark Settlements in what is now Lanark County to the north of Perth, Ontario. There are many Scottish place names such as Perth, Glengarry, Lanark and Renfrew along the Rideau and in the small lake area north of Kingston. The majority of the first settlers came from the overpopulated towns and countryside of Lanarkshire and Glasgow. Many of them found work in the newly opened woolen mills in the area. In popular culture The Calton Weavers massacre of 1787 is commemorated in a panel by Scottish artist Ken Currie in the People's Palace, Glasgow commissioned on the 200th anniversary of the event. The song The Calton Weaver is a variant of Nancy Whiskey which first appeared in print in the early 1900s. The Scottish folksinger Nancy Whiskey took her name from the song, and it has been recorded by many other artists including Ewan MacColl.Steam Whistle Ballads Topic 12T104; The Definitive Collection Highpoint HPO 6006 The song tells of a Calton weaver who spent his life savings on Whisky. The song ends with a solemn caution: Come all ye weavers, Calton weavers A' ye weavers where'er ye be Beware of whiskey, Nancy Whiskey She'll ruin you as she ruined me. Alaska based Celtic rock band Fire on McGinnis released their version of Nancy Whiskey on their debut album Fire on McGinnis (2012).

The gun was used as a standard destroyer weapon during World War II, and it was also used as a coastal gun and railway gun. The gun was produced in three different versions which all had mutually incompatible ammunition and range tables. Mountings for the weapon included single open mounts and twin turrets. Besides the Soviet Union, the gun was used on ships sold or donated to Poland, People's Republic of China, Egypt and Indonesia. Finland captured five guns during Continuation War and used them until the 1990s. Background In 1929 design work began in the Soviet Union for a new 130 mm 45 caliber submarine deck gun that would have the same external ballistics as the older 130 mm/55 B7 Pattern 1913 gun. It was intended for the gun to use a wedge lock and fixed ammunition, but the plans were changed already before the prototype was ordered. Blueprints and a prototype was ordered from Bolshevik Plant no. 232 in 1930. The design bureau director was N. N. Magdasijev and project leader G. N. Rafalovits. Others involved in the design were S. A. Morozov, S. A. Zalazaev, B. A. Lever, V. M. Rosenberg and V. I. Kudrjashov. The gun design was changed from submarine to destroyer weapon using separate instead of fixed ammunition and in 1932 new specifications included a change from 45 to 50 calibers and a screw breech block instead of wedge block. During test firing in 1934‚Äî35 several shortcomings were found in the gun design, particularly with the breech and loading mechanism. Because the Leningrad-class destroyers that were supposed to use the guns were already under construction the 130 mm B-13 gun was accepted for mass production in 1935 and the first twelve guns were finished during the same year. Models In order to match the performance of the longer barreled 130 mm/55 Pattern 1913 gun it was necessary to use a higher barrel pressure in the 130 mm/50 B13 Pattern 1936. This led to such a rapid barrel wear that the Leningrad and Gnevny class destroyers using the first gun versions could not even empty their magazines a single time before needing to change out the barrel. The solution to the excessive barrel wear was found to be deeper rifling grooves. The original design had deep grooves and a barrel life of 130 rounds; a modified version with deep grooves had a barrel life of 1100 rounds. Additionally there existed a model with deep grooves. The gun had 40 grooves with a constant twist. All three gun models with different groove depths had different, mutually incompatible, ammunition, sights and range tables. A loading platform that could be rotated next to the gun barrel was used to deliver the shell to a pneumatic loading mechanism. The gun could be loaded on any elevation angle, but the rate of fire was reduced on elevations higher than +25¬∞. A modified dual-purpose model with 55 caliber barrel suitable for anti-aircraft fire was planned but the project was stopped due to the war. Mountings Early destroyers and coastal guns used single open mountings protected by a Gun shield. An enclosed twin turret was developed for later destroyer classes and monitors. B-13 was the earliest mounting. This was a single mounting open from the rear and protected by a gun shield against shrapnel and bullets. This mounting was used in the destroyers constructed the before Second World War and in coastal and railway guns. The weight of the mount was and it was equipped with indicators for a central fire control system, but had hand-operated training and elevation. B-2LM was a twin turret used in later destroyer classes. It was intended to use this turret to arm the , but the ship was equipped with B-13 mounts instead. The destroyer leader was initially equipped with B-13 mounts, but received the planned B-2LM turrets during a refit. Additionally the lead ship of the s, , was also refitted with a single B-2LM turret forward. The turret was used to arm the post-war and s. The weight of the turret was . B-2LMT twin turret was used as the armament on the monitors Sivash and Perekop and with Shilka-class monitors. Weight . B-28 twin turret was used on the monitor Khasan, weight . B-2-U was a planned dual-purpose universal twin turret (U = Universal'naya) that could have been used effectively also as an anti-aircraft weapon. This turret was planned to use a new 55-caliber model of the B-13 gun and to have a maximum elevation of 85¬∞ with a weight of . Due to the war the project was stopped and neither the turret nor the guns were produced. Service in Soviet Union 130 mm/50 B13 gun was the standard armament of the newest destroyers of Soviet Union during World War II and it was used to arm the destroyers built in Soviet Union until 1954. The destroyers classes armed with 130 mm/50 B-13 gun were the Leningrad-class (project 1 and modified project 38 Minsk class), Tashkent, Gnevny class, Soobrazitelny class, Opytny, Ognevoy class and Skoryy class. The mass production of the gun resulted in more than one thousand guns being built, and the gun was also used to arm smaller warships and as a coastal gun. The coastal guns remained in use until the fall of the Soviet Union, and in the 1970s 90 guns in 20 batteries were installed in Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula to protect Vladivostok from a possible Chinese attack. Service in Finland One of the 130/50 N guns captured by Finland Finland captured several 130 mm/50 B13 guns during the Battle of Hanko. The captured guns were known in Finland as 130/50 N or 130 mm 50 kaliiperin merikanuuna mallia N (130 mm 50 caliber coastal gun model N). Soviet Union had four batteries of B-13 guns in Hanko, but they were damaged or blown up when the Russians evacuated Hanko. Valtion Tykkitehdas (State Artillery Factory) and Helsinki Naval Base ordance personnel succeeded in repairing five guns. Only a few hundred rounds of ammunition were captured, so Finns began manufacturing suitable ammunition domestically. Captured Russian ammunition included modern high explosive fragmentation shells with point and base fuzes and semi-armour piercing shells, while the Finnish produced ammunition were older style high explosive shells. Three captured guns were used for short periods of time in Pihlajasaari and Miessaari forts by Uusimaa Coastal Brigade. Two guns were used to arm the auxiliary gunboats Aunus and Viena. Three guns were converted into railway guns 130/50 NRaut (Raut = rautatietykki, railway gun) in 1964 in the Hanko Coastal Artillery Battalion. The railway wagon was attached to rails with clamps and supported from the sides by wooden planks and support beams on track sides. In 1972 the three guns were converted back to static coastal guns and installed on Glosholma fort of the Suomenlinna Coastal Artillery Regiment. Three spare gun shields were used on 152/46 VLo guns installed in Sommar√∂ fort on Replot and two other gun shields as armoured observation posts on the test fire sites at Puolustusvoimien Tutkimuskeskus (Finnish Defense Forces Research Facility) and Keuruun Pioneerivarikko (Keuruu Engineering Depot). In the 1980s it was attempted to convert the ammunition of the 130/50 N guns as sea target shells for 130 TK turret guns, but the project failed. The three guns in Glosholma were removed from service in the 1990s, but left on their positions. Additionally two spare guns were in storage. One gun was placed on display in Kuivasaari in 2005. The origin of the designation N (also Nl or NI) is uncertain, but most likely stood for Neuvostoliittolainen (from Soviet Union). The gun had a nickname Nikolajev in Finland. B-2LM turret of the Polish destroyer Service in other countries Two Skoryy class destroyers were transferred to the Polish Navy in the late 1950s. Additionally 130 mm B-13 guns were used as coastal guns in Hel Fortified Area. Skoryy-class destroyers were also sold to Egypt (six ships) and Indonesia (seven ships). Four Gnevny- class destroyers were donated by Soviet Union to People's Republic of China as Anshan-class destroyers. Modifications In the early 1940s an attempt was made in the Soviet Union to mount the 130 mm B-13 gun on a tank chassis. After Winter War one of the T-100 tank prototypes was refitted with a hull mounted 130 mm B-13 gun. This vehicle was known as SU-100Y Self-Propelled Gun and the prototype was used in action during the Battle of Moscow. The prototype survived the war and is now on display in Kubinka Tank Museum.

Spider Recording Scheme News No. 56 Site description Grass Wood is on the west and south- facing slopes of a Carboniferous Limestone spur in Upper Wharfedale, to the south of Conistone Moor. Rock outcrops, scree and limestone pavement areas occur throughout the wood, along with two significant scar precipices. The original woodland would have been ash Fraxinus excelsior dominating over the limestone soils, with Wych elm Ulmus glabra and oak probably Quercus petraea and with an understorey of hazel Corylus avellana.Grass Wood SSSI citation Natural England Felling and replanting has altered the dominant woodland structure, extensively modifying its composition and making it a less natural woodland than the adjacent Bastow Wood. During the 19th century the lower slopes were interplanted with beech Fagus sylvatica and sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, and in the 1960s the north-eastern part of the site was replanted with Norway spruce, European larch, Scots pine and beech. A management objective now is to remove areas of non-native tree species and replant with broadleaves from local seed sources. As well as these areas cleared through selective felling, many areas of the woodland have the appearance of an early successional stage of advance natural regeneration through mainly saplings of ash, birch and sycamore, this enclosed within a variable canopy of ash, sycamore, beech, oak, and with some birch. Shrubs and small trees in the understorey include bird cherry Prunus padus, hazel, spindle Euonymus europaeus, buckthorn Rhamnus cathartica, wild privet Ligustrum vulgare, blackthorn Prunus spinosa and guelder-rose Viburnum opulus. The underlying geology ensures that most of the site is well drained, favouring lime-loving plants ‚Äì the calcicoles. There are, however, localised areas with poorer drainage and in which some lime-hating plants can be found ‚Äì the calcifuges - such as bracken Pteridium aquilinum, as well as plants associated with water-logged conditions such as common valerian Valeriana officinalis and wild angelica Angelica sylvestris. The floristic interest of Grass Wood is described and explained in a book by Sylvia Arnold on the wildflowers of the Yorkshire Dales,Wild flowers of the Yorkshire Dales, Sylvia Arnold (1988) and there is a description of a wildflower walk that points out the location of particular wildflowers as the walk progresses around and through the wood.Wildflower walks of the Yorkshire Dales, Southern Region, Amanda and Brin Best (2002) The woodland is served by one public footpath, and as a registered commons is open access within its boundaries. There is however an extensive network of paths that have arisen through common usage over the years. It is a popular location for dog walkers, which often limits the chance of seeing the local roe deer feeding in the woodland. Botanical interest An extensive remnant upland woodland area of this size is uncommon on limestone in the Yorkshire Dales, hence the notification of Grass Wood as a SSSI. The woodland element is unsettled and is atypical of its location-- Bastow Wood is more settled since it has not been replanted - but the very rich ground flora of Grass Wood is characteristic of an ancient woodland on limestone. This floristic value owes its continuing existence to the continuity of the woodland cover, which gives it recognition as ancient woodland, but also because of the lack of sheep grazing in the wood that has evidently in the past cleared through the woodland ground flora of the adjacent Bastow Wood. The view from Grass Wood eastwards towards the limestone pavements of Sweet Side There is a good variety of vascular plants that are considered to be indicators of undisturbed, ancient woodland.Ancient woodland: guidance material for local authorities, Natural England These include Herb Paris (Paris quadrifolia), Lily-of-the-valley (Convallaria majalis), Ramsons (Allium ursinum), Wood Sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), Wood Anemone ((Anemone nemorosa), Dog's Mercury (Mercurialis perennis), Woodruff (Galium odoratum), and Wood-sedge (Carex sylvatica). There is also an extraordinary range of geophytes, the plants that have bulbs or bulbous growths that make them especially adapted to woodland. These include the ancient woodland indicators of lily-of-the-valley, herb paris and ramsons, but also the uncommon in angular Solomon'-seal (Polygonatum odoratum) as well as the common in bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and lord-and-ladies (Arum maculatum). The one patch of Solomon's-seal (Polygonatum multiflorum) is considered to be of garden origin. Early-purple Orchid (Orchis mascula), another geophyte, is found under the lighter shade of sparser woodland cover in Grass Wood. This shows its ability to occupy a range of habitat since it is more often associated with open grassland, and can be seen in profusion in the nearby Conistone Old Pasture. The conditions in Grass Wood would also seem ideal for a rare and highly endangered orchid, the Lady's-slipper (Cypripedium calceolus) that is known historically to have grown in the limestone area of the Yorkshire Dales.Endangered Plants, Jan ƒåe≈ôovsk√Ω (1995) It is found in continental Europe growing in the decomposed humus of semi-shaded woodland cover on limestone. While the virtual extinction of the Lady's-slipper orchid from its historical range is often blamed on uprooting by gardeners and botanists, it is also the case that its preferred habitat shrunk markedly with human clearance of woodland from the limestone landscape, and the grazing of sheep will have finished it off.Britain‚Äôs Rare Flowers, Peter Marren (1999) It is to be hoped that the rescue plan for the Lady's-slipper orchid is successful, and that Grass Wood may eventually be chosen as one of the locations for its general re-introduction.Lady‚Äôs-Slipper Orchid Cypripedium calceolus Species Action Plan Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority Other woodland species found in Grass Wood include Wild Strawberry (Fragaria vesca), Red Campion (Silene dioica), Wood Cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum), Primrose (Primula vulgaris), Bugle (Ajuga reptans), St John's wort (Hypericum hirsutum), and a few Columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) are found at woodland edges. There are scarce clumps of Stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and of Stinking Hellebore (Helleborus foetidus). The grassland species of Lady's-mantle (Alchemilla glabra), Great Burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), Melancholy Thistle (Cirsium helenioides) and Goldilocks Buttercup (Ranunculus auricomus) are found in clearings. The open landscape species of dry, rocky calcareous grassland are also found in refuge in Grass Wood on the steep un- wooded scar edges of the limestone, especially along the sunlit areas of Dewbottom Scar. Here can be found the locally uncommon Rock Whitebeam (Sorbus rupicola) as well as Burnet Rose (Rosa pimpinellifolia), Common Rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), Bloody Crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum), Salad- burnet (Sanguisorba minor), Wild Marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and Wild Thyme Thymus polytrichus.

It \\"trains military, civilian, and international personnel in leadership skills [and] integrates aviation warfighting doctrine and requirements determination across the DOTMLPF\\" Its Commanding General is Major General David J. Francis.\\"Commanding General USAACE and Fort Rucker\\" Retrieved on 7 July 2019. The Center of Excellence includes three aviation brigades, the 1st Aviation Brigade, 110th Aviation Brigade, and 128th Aviation Brigade, and a Noncommissioned Officers' Academy. History right Most training of pilots and mechanics for World War II Army Aviators was conducted by the Department of Air Training within the Field Artillery School at Henry Post Army Airfield, Okla., although the Army Air Forces conducted some primary training of Army Aviation personnel. During the Korean War, the Department of Air Training at Post Field expanded, and in early 1953, it became the Army Aviation School. As a result of the expansion of both aviation and artillery training, Post Field became overcrowded, and the Army decided to move the Army Aviation School to a different post. When no satisfactory permanent Army post was found, a temporary post, Camp Rucker, Ala., was chosen. The Army Aviation School began moving to Alabama in August 1954 and the first class began at Rucker in October. On 1 February 1955, the Army Aviation Center was officially established at Rucker. In October of that year, the post was given permanent status with the name change from Camp Rucker to Fort Rucker. Before the mid-1950s, the Air Force had provided primary training for Army Aviation pilots and mechanics. In 1956, the U.S. Department of Defense gave the Army control over all of its own training. Gary and Wolters Air Force Bases in Texas, where the Air Force had been conducting this training, were also transferred to the Army. Lacking adequate facilities at Fort Rucker, Army Aviation continued primary fixed-wing training at Camp Gary until 1959 and primary rotary-wing training at Fort Wolters until 1973. The pioneer African American flying instructor Milton Crenchaw taught at then- Camp Rucker from 1954 to 1966. In 1956, the Army Aviation Center began assembling and testing weapons on helicopters. These tests, conducted while the Air Force still theoretically had exclusive responsibility for aerial fire support, led to the development of armament systems for Army helicopters. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that Aviation logistics establishments at Fort Eustis be consolidated with the Aviation Center and School at Fort Rucker, although this did not take place. What had become the U.S. Army Aviation Warfighting Center was subsequently renamed the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence on 26 June 2006. Command and Directorates The 1st Aviation Brigade is based here. The Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence (UAS CoE), as the U.S. Army UAS Proponent's principle management agency, provides intensive, centralized total capacity management and Unmanned Aerial System integration. The CoE coordinates with all Army institutional and operational organizations, Joint and other DoD agencies as required, to achieve a coherent and sustainable UAS strategy fostering the development of relevant and responsive concepts for current, emerging and future UAS interoperability with all manned and unmanned platforms.http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/january2010/Documents/Carlile.pdf The UAS CoE mission statement is to provide: \\"integration and coordination with all Army organizations, the joint services, and other Defense Department agencies to achieve the U.S. Army UAS strategy that includes concepts for current, emerging and future UAS interoperability with all manned and unmanned systems\\". The 110th Aviation Brigade consists of four battalions using three different sites. 1st Battalion, 11th Aviation Regiment, operates and manages air traffic control services for USAACe/Fort Rucker and the National Airspace System. 1st Battalion, 14th Aviation Regiment operates from Hanchey Army Heliport and conducts graduate level training using the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. 1st Battalion, 212th Aviation Regiment operates from Lowe Army Heliport and Shell Army Heliport and conducts combat and night operational training, using OH-58 Kiowa, UH-1 Iroquois, and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters. 1st Battalion, 223d Aviation Regiment operates from Cairns Army Airfield and Knox Army Heliport and conducts flight training using the CH-47 Chinook helicopter and C-12 Huron aircraft. Training At the Center students both learn to fly and also to employ aviation assets to assist United States forces with the 110th Aviation Brigade. Students usually spend 15‚Äì18 months in aviation school, learning a wide range of subjects, and finally graduating with their \\"wings\\" or Aviator's Badge. When second lieutenants arrive at Fort Rucker after graduating from their commissioning source (USMA, ROTC or OCS) they secure housing, they attend the two-month Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC) at Fort Rucker. Upon completion, they join the rest of their classmates, usually junior Warrant Officers, many of whom have previous enlisted experience. Before starting academics, students must complete Dunker training and Army SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) school. After SERE, students transition to Initial Entry Rotary Wing Aeromedical Training, or \\"aeromed\\" at the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine, where they learn subjects pertaining to flight and the human body. The information taught in these classes is tested frequently by instructor pilots (IPs) throughout flight school. Flight training varies by student and aircraft type, but in general students will complete Basic flight training, Instrument flight training and basic combat skills training. Students are taught the basics of flight as well as instrument flight in a TH-67 Bell Jetranger aircraft. Basic Combat skills training is taught in an OH-58. See also * Allen M.

The play is best described as a satirical farce, and among its satirical targets was Richard Blackmore. Three Hours After Marriage tells the story of Doctor Fossil, a pompous ageing scientist, who has just married a much younger woman, Mrs Townley who is then immediately beset by two rival suitors who try to win her affections. The wife and suitors then go to comical lengths to hide their intentions from Dr Fossil. The plot is complicated by the presence of a female poet Phoebe Clinket and Sir Tremendous, a literary critic. It premiered on 16 January 1717 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.Gay, John. \\"Three hours after marriage. A comedy, as it is acted at the Theatre Royal\\" (London printed; Dublin reprinted by S.

Winton, Calhoun. John Gay and the London Theatre. University Press of Kentucky, 2014. p.52 It is likely that two of the targets of the plays satire John Woodward as Doctor Fossil and John Dennis as Sir Tremendous would have been recognisable to London audiences due to their known hostility to Gay, Pope and the Scriblerus Club.Winton p.53 Initial reception The play received seven sell-out performances, then a record for the Drury Lane theatre and influenced The Author's Farce. Critical reception was less friendly. Charles Johnson, in the preface to the published version of his The Sultaness called Three Hours \\"Long-labour'd Nonsense\\" and it was also attacked in Leonard Welsted's 1717 Palaemon to Caelia, or, The Triumvirate and in the Poetical Register by Giles Jacob, who stated that it included scenes that \\"trespass on Female Modesty\\".Kilburn, Matthew. \\"Giles Jacob\\" in Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison, eds. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. vol. 29, 546-7. London: Oxford UP, 2004 - page 547 This view of the play as obscene became the majority view, and it would not be given a major performance again until 1996. It is likely that opponents of Pope and Gay succeeded in preventing any further performances after the initial, successful run. A probable influence on this was Richard Steele, joint manager of Drury Lane, who was a friend of Doctor John Woodward one of the major targets of the play's mockery. Steele was also likely to have been concerned by criticisms of indecency which might have threatened Drury Lane's status as a patent theatre.Winton p.54-55 Commentary Scientist Jacob Bronowski cites the play in episode 7 of the 1973 BBC television documentary series The Ascent of Man,The Ascent of Man (1973) Publisher: Little, Brown and Company, Pages: 448 p. which deals with the discoveries of Newton and Einstein: \\"By the time Newton was in his seventies, England under the Georges was pre-occupied in the coffee houses with gossip, money, politics, and with scandal. Nimble businessmen floated companies, to exploit fictitious inventions (most famously The South Sea Bubble). Writers poked fun at scientists, in part from spite, and in part for political motives, because Newton was a big wig in the government establishment. The group of Tories, who later helped John Gay to satirise the government in The Beggar‚Äôs Opera, also helped him, in 1717, to write the play Three Hours After Marriage\\". While there is scholarly consensus about the active role of Arbuthnot and Pope in Three Hours After Marriage, however, The Beggar's Opera is generally considered Gay's own work. Revivals In 1996, Richard Cottrell directed a Royal Shakespeare Company production at the Swan Theatre. Dr. Fossil was played by Clive Francis, his new wife was played by Jane Gurnett, with her two persistent suitors Plotwell (Richard McCabe) and Underplot (Adam Godley). This production won two Laurence Olivier Awards for Best Set Designer and Best Costume Designer for Tim Goodchild in 1998. The play was revived again in 2008 at the Union Theatre in a production by Blanche McIntyre.

The bomblet used napalm (jelled gasoline) as an incendiary filler, improving on earlier designs which used thermite or magnesium fillers that burned more intensely, but were less energy- and weight-efficient, and were easier to extinguish.Science: Incendiary Jelly, Time, Apr. 02, 1945 In Germany they were filled with jellied oil and dropped in clusters of 36 in the non-aerodynamic M19 bomb. Over Japan they were used in clusters of 38 as part of the finned E-46 'aimable cluster', which opened up at about . After separation, each of the 38 M69s would release a 3-foot (1 m) cotton streamer to orient its fuze downward. Upon hitting a building or the ground, the timing fuze burned for three to five seconds and then a small explosive charge (black powder in the standard M-69 type deployed operationally during WW2, white phosphorus in a later modification, the M-69X, which did not see wide use) ignited and propelled the incendiary filling up to 100 feet (30 m) in several flaming globs, instantly starting intense fires. It was tested against typical German and Japanese residential structures at Japanese Village and German Village, constructed at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, in 1943. The M69 was the most successful incendiary in the tests. Against Japan, the M69 was carried in the bomb bay of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, with a typical load containing 40 cluster bombs, a total of 1520 M69 bomblets. The bombs were very effective in setting fire to Japanese civilian structures in mass firebombing raids starting in February 1945 against Kobe.World Battlefronts: BATTLE OF THE PACIFIC: Firebirds' Flight, Time, Mar. 19, 1945 In the first ten days of March 1945, raids with the M69 and M47,http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/V/AAF-V-20.html extensive damage was done to Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.World Battlefronts: Ten-Day Wonder, Time, Mar. 26, 1945 See also *Mark 77 bomb References Category:Cluster bombs Category:Incendiary weapons Category:Aerial bombs of the United States ","title":"M69 incendiary"},{"id":"26081063","text":"Wyoming Highway 50 (WYO 50) is a north-south Wyoming state highway located in the southwestern and central part of Campbell County that travels from Wyoming Highway 387 at Pine Tree Junction north to Interstate 90, US 14/US 16/WYO 59 in Gillette.

Peyton has been an active member of science fiction fandom since 1961, when he co-founded the Birmingham Science Fiction Group. From 1964 to 1966, he served as editor for the British Science Fiction Association's critical magazine Vector. He also started the British Science Fiction Association's fiction magazine Tangent. He began a long tradition of working on science fiction convention organizing committees with work for Brumcon 2, the 1965 Eastercon. Since then he has attended over 150 science fiction conventions including being one of only six (The Magnificent Six) who have attended all 45 Novacons and in 1979 won the Doc Weir Award for his services to fandom. In 1971 Peyton and business partner Rod Milner launched a part-time bookselling business, Andromeda Book Company, in Old Hill, a few miles outside of Birmingham. Moving into the city centre in 1973, Peyton gave up his job in the building industry to sell books full-time, which was to last until 2002 when the business went into voluntary liquidation. Following the demise of Andromeda, Peyton went solo selling on the internet as Replay Books. During the Andromeda years, their ventures included co-editing the Venture SF series of reprints of classic adventure science fiction from Arrow Books (1985‚Äì1989). Peyton and Milner also ran the small press Drunken Dragon Press, which among other titles published the 1988 collection of parodies The Dragonhiker's Guide to Battlefield Covenant at Dune's Edge: Odyssey Two by David Langford.

The band's lineup consisted of guitarist and singer Matt Werm, drummer Brady Parr and bassist Mat Davis. They were best known for their 1996 song \\"Freeway\\" from their Salmonblaster self-titled album, which received regular play on Canadian music station Much Music. Their 1996 self-titled album was a top 10 hit on Canada's college music chart in 1996 peaking at number 5 in July of that year. By November 1996, they were Toronto's top selling indie band.  Early years (1994-1996) Salmonblaster's members came together from various London bands in July 1994. Werm (originally known as Matt Wormsbecher) played guitar for Boris is Back, Parr played in Petch and Mat Davis was the guitarist for M.A.D. Davis was the second bassist for Salmonblaster. Originally Dave Hall, who was also in Petch, played bass but left the band when he moved to Ottawa. In 1994 they released a 3-song cassette that received heavy local airplay on CHRW-FM, the University of Western Ontario's radio station. The song \\"Chomalungma\\" made it onto the London Underground III compilation. In 1995 they released a second 3-song cassette that contained two songs that would later appear on their self-titled album: \\"Sugar Rush\\" and \\"Brian Jones\\".  Self titled album and early success (1996-1998)  On July 16, 1996, Salmonblaster released their debut (and only) album. The self-titled album was a college chart hit, debuting at No. 5\\\\. The band toured behind the album throughout 1997 opening shows for I Mother Earth, Stabbing Westward, Econoline Crush, Glueleg and The Gandharvas, along with a long list of Canadian independent bands. During this time Davis left and The Gandharvas bassist Eric Howden (now the solo artist Raised by Swans) filled in. On March 20, 1998 the band appeared on the Tom Green Show. They played a new song called \\"Secret Agent\\" with a new bassist who was not introduced and was replaced by Jesse Buchanan who remained with the band until their dissolution. \\"Secret Agent\\" was to be the first single off their forthcoming second album which had the working title of Headfuls of Chills, however shortly after appearing on the Tom Green Show the band broke up citing creative differences, though Werm and Parr would form two subsequent bands (Panic Coast and Tournament!). Werm would later tell the UWO Gazette that Salmonblaster succumbed to pressure. The appearance on the Tom Green Show was released as part of the DVD set The Tom Green Show: The Complete Series - Inside and Outside the Box in 2005. Post break up After Salmonblaster broke up, Werm and Parr went on to form Panic Coast, who released Future Projected in 2000. The band later changed their name to The Black Saturdays and released a self-titled album. Werm was also in Viperscheme who released one EP called Sell the Sky in 2001.

It was created by lifetime resident Charles A. Pilling and has been a bird breeding site and a roadside attraction since the 1920s. History In the 1880s, a member of the Denny family built a house on North 90th Street and Densmore Avenue North in Seattle. James and Marietta Pilling purchased the property in 1909, and converted it to a dairy farm. Licton Springs, a neighborhood history, text and research by Mimi Sheridan & Carol Tobin In 1924, their twelve-year-old son Charles A. Pilling (October 6, 1911 - October 24, 2001) dug a small pond to care for three injured mallard ducks he had been given. \\"Mr. Pilling's Pond\\" by Patricia Nikolina Clark, Highlights for Kids \\"The family doctor gave Charles three crippled mallards, and Charles suddenly needed a good place to keep ducks. The pond he dug, about ten feet across and three feet deep, was on his father's dairy farm near Seattle, Washington.\\" This began Pilling's lifelong interest in breeding waterfowl. Over the years, the size of the pond was expanded to on the half-acre lot. It was fed fresh water by diverting Licton Springs. It is bordered by bamboo stands, and yet with a viewing area on North 90th Street, it still remains part of Seattle's urban landscape. In the 1950s Pilling created a manually operated flood control system that was still in use in 2011. ‚ÄúCharles Pilling, renowned bird breeder, left a legacy‚Äù by Duff Wilson, The Seattle Times, October 29, 2001 Shovelers and cinnamon teals on the pond Pilling gained international fame when in 1955 the International Wild Waterfowl Association (IWWA) recognized him as the first to breed the hooded merganser in captivity. He received the female merganser as an injured duck, nursed her to health and then found a male partner for her. This was followed by similar awards in 1964 for the bufflehead and in 1977 for being first to breed the harlequin duck. He received the Grand Master Breeder Award from the American Game Bird Breeders Cooperative Federation.\\"Charles Albert Pilling\\" obituary, The Seattle Times, October 27, 2001 Charles Pilling's most prestigious award was induction into the IWWA's Hall of Fame. \\"In 1990, he was the fourth person ever to be inducted into IWWA's Waterfowl Breeders Hall of Fame, an award that he and his wife, June, traveled to Nova Scotia to accept.\\" All of these achievements occurred while managing the activity on Pilling's Pond. As Pilling became well known in the bird breeding community, he was sought out as a mentor. In 1972, Paul Dye moved to Seattle for the purpose of learning the art and craft of bird breeding from the master. Pilling mentored Dye, and Dye went on to establish his own duck reserve near Lake Stevens, Washington, known as Northwest Waterfowl Farm. \\"Paul G. Dye, 1937-2005: His bird sanctuary is world famous\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, April 5, 2005 \\"His mentor, Charles Pilling of Seattle, taught him bird breeding methods that had never been used with wildfowl in captivity.\\" Siberian geese and a fledgling green-winged teal In May 2001, Seattle Community Access Network (SCAN) produced a documentary video about Pilling's Pond. It shows green-winged teals, blue-winged teals, wood ducks, mandarins, hooded mergansers, red heads, goldeneye, buffleheads, ring-necks, and northern shovelers, as well as some exotic Siberian geese, black-necked swans and Australian black swans. The pond has been home to over 100 waterfowl in its peak Autumn season. Interviews with Pilling, biologists Peter Lortz and Ellie Cauldwell, and other local pond experts, are also presented in the documentary.\\"Chuck Pilling's Pond, a Seattle Legacy\\" Video documentary published through Seattle Community Access Network (c)2001 SCAN In October 2001, Chuck Pilling died at 90 years of age. In 2005, David Kunkle, a long-time neighbor, purchased the property with the intention of preserving the pond's legacy. Since then, family members and neighbors, organized under the non-profit corporation, Pilling's Pond Preservation Society, have maintained the pond and have continued to preserve it as an educational resource, with the support of Puget Consumers Coop, who for over a decade has donated lettuce trimmings as a healthy staple diet for the birds.\\"What's new at Pilling's Pond?\\" by Mike Bonn, Licton Springs Currents, Summer 2004 \\"We set about to honor in-kind donors who provide food for the ducks. This included an award ceremony on June 5, 2004 for the Greenlake PCC. For about 10 years, they have been providing lettuce trimmings that have become a staple for the waterfowl. They were honored with a plaque of pictures from the representatives of the Pilling family, Licton Springs Community Council, Pilling's Pond Preservation Society and active neighbors\\".

Summary of plot The film takes place between the 1950s and 1970s. Turkish Cypriot Omer and Greek Cypriot Rhodou grow up together in Akamas. Rhodou initially falls in love with a Greek fighter but when he is killed she turns to Omer. Omer becomes an active member of EOKA. In spite of protests from her parents she decides to marry him. Omer and Rhodou escape from their families and friends and attempt a new life together, but this is Cyprus and a marriage between a Muslim man and a Christian woman is not something that local people are prepared to accept. Production Inspirations Although the main plot is archetypal, the subplot draws from the directors own life. Panicos' parents owned a coffee shop in Kythrea where he would hear many stories. Location Most of the film was filmed in the Akamas area. Akamas has many scenic views allowing for superb cinematography. Akamas is a symbol for the film; it is a peninsula. Financing Financing was made available by Turkey, Bulgaria and Cypriot government bodies (the individual production companies were Artimages Ltd, Cyprus - Marathon Filmcilik, Turkey - Creator C, Hungary). Screenings, reception and criticism Akamas controversy Many Cypriots living in Cyprus have not seen the film. This is largely due to the Cypriot government's actions, which effectively banned the film in Cyprus (but not in Europe). Although Chrysanthou, several other notable filmmakers and some politicians claim that the government's actions were politically motivated, the government claims that Chrysanthou was in breach of the filmmaking contract. The government did not take direct action to stop the film production but it made it very difficult for its successful completion by withdrawing crucial funds and severely limiting its market potential by making distribution almost impossible and by banning it from Cypriot TV and Cypriot cinemas. The government was also reported to have attempted to censor a specific scene in the film by using its funding as a pressure for censoring. The Cypriot Commissioner of Administration, after researching the matter, concluded that the state attempted to censor Akamas without sufficient justification, thus violating the freedom of artistic expression.Report of the Commissioner of Administration in regards to the support of the production of the film ‚ÄúAkamas‚Äù and the allegation of censorship that was practiced on the film director and producer of the film, 2007 Nevertheless Akamas was completed and screened at several film festivals worldwide. Positive reception Akamas was the first Cypriot film to be screened at the Venice Film Festival. Akamas won the Los Angeles Greek Film Festival's Orpheus Award. At the Cypriot Film Festival UK the screening of Akamas was the most widely attended event. Simos Panayi, the founder of the Cypriot Film Festival UK, invited Panicos Chrysanthou to give a speech about Akamas and its historical context. The speech was primarily directed at younger British Cypriots, many of whom are born outside of Cyprus. It was also screened at Thessaloniki Film Festival, The Festival Against Intolerance and Fanaticism, Los Angeles Greek Film Festival, and the New York Turkish Film Festival. The film received positive statements and reviews from Boyd van Hoeij, Polycarpou, Joseph Proimakis, Alexander Andreou, Oliver Hilt, Ellen Angelopoulos and Simos Panayi. Simos Panayi, the founder of the Cypriot Film Festival UK, said that Akamas was the highlight of the event and invited Panicos Chrysanthou to give a speech about Akamas and its historical context. Boyd van Hoeij, a film critic on Rotten Tomatoes, says Akama's success lies in its ability to reunite the emotional and the political, the historical and the natural into a familiar cinematic story. Ellen Angelopoulos has suggested that it be re-edited after its festival circuit to accommodate more peaceful messages and be shown in schools as part of history lessons and broadcast on television. Negative reception and response Greek nationalists including ex EOKA B members labeled Panicos Chrysanthou a traitor to Cyprus, claiming that the film was funded with Turkish money and is therefore a Turkish propaganda film. Chrysanthou responded by saying \\"It belongs to Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, it belongs to peace and humanity.\\" Dervi≈ü Zaim and Panicos Chrysanthou followed it up with this statement: One scene of the film portrayed the execution of a Greek Cypriot, inside a church, by a Greek Cypriot, which resulted in the government of the Republic of Cyprus withdrawing funding promised to the filmmakers. Panicos Chrysanthou Panicos Chrysanthou is an award winning director who focuses primarily on documentaries. Akamas was his first fictional feature film. Films that he has worked on have been shown at Venice, Cannes and Berlin. √áamur (Mud) won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Panicos Chrysanthou was born in Kythrea.

She was significant in the history of women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. Biography Margaret Haig Thomas was born on 12 June 1883 in London. Her parents were industrialist and politician David Alfred Thomas, first Viscount Rhondda, and Sybil Haig, also a suffragette. In her autobiography, Margaret wrote that her mother had 'prayed passionately that her baby daughter might become feminist'. And indeed she did become a passionate activist for women's rights. An only child, although born in London Thomas was raised at Llanwern House, near Newport, until the age of 13 when she went away to boarding school, first to Notting Hill High School then St Leonards School in St Andrews. In 1904, aged 19, she took up a place at Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied history. Despite her tutors providing positive feedback on her academic progress, she returned to Llanwern to live with her family after two terms. Adult life Working for her father at the Consolidated Cambrian company headquarters in Cardiff Docks on a salary of ¬£1,000, Thomas spent three years as a debutante. Women's suffrage Pillar box burnt in 1913, Newport In the same year that she married local Newport landowner Sir Humphrey Mackworth, in 1908 at aged 25 she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), and became secretary of its Newport branch. Between 1908 and 1914, she took the campaign for women's suffrage across South Wales, often to hostile and stormy meetings. Thomas was involved in protest marches with the Pankhursts, and jumping onto the running board of Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's car in St Andrews. In June 1913 Thomas attempted to destroy a Royal Mail post-box with a chemical bomb. The activities resulted in a trial at the Sessions House, Usk, and after refusing to pay a ¬£10 fine, she was sentenced to serve a one month period in jail there. She was released after only five days after going on a hunger strike.\\"2nd Viscountess Rhondda, Politician and businesswoman\\" at bbc.co.uk Thomas had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. When Emmeline Pankhurst died in June 1928, it was Kitty Marshall, Rosamund Massey and Lady Rhondda who arranged her memorials. They raised money for her gravestone in Brompton Cemetery and a statue of her outside the House of Commons (which place she had frequently been prevented from entering). Money was also raised to buy the painting that had been made by fellow suffragette Georgina Brackenbury so that it could be given to the National Portrait Gallery. It was unveiled by Stanley Baldwin in 1930. World War One and sinking of RMS Lusitania On the outbreak of World War I, she accepted the decision by the WSPU leadership to abandon its militant campaign for suffrage. She worked with her father, who was sent by David Lloyd George to the United States of America to arrange the supply of munitions for the British armed forces. Her father became aware of his daughter's depressive state, and although Margaret brushed her father's concern aside, he became aware of tensions within her marriage. On 7th May 1915, she was returning from the United States on the RMS Lusitania with her father and his secretary Arnold Rhys-Evans, when it was torpedoed at 14:10 by German submarine U-20. Whilst her father and his secretary made it onto a lifeboat, having been blown overboard Margaret spent a long period clinging to a piece of board before being rescued by the Irish trawler \\"Bluebell\\", recalled in her 1933 autobiography This Was My World. By the time she was rescued and taken to Queenstown, Margaret had fallen unconscious from hypothermia. After a period in hospital, she then spent several months recuperating at her parents' home. Peerage On 3 July 1918, after his hard work on his business interests, politics and latterly his war works, her father died. While the Rhondda Barony died with him, the title of Viscount Rhondda passed to Margaret by special remainder, something Thomas had insisted on from King George V when he was offered the honour. After her father's death, Lady Rhondda subsequently tried to take his seat in the House of Lords, citing the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 which allowed women to exercise \\"any public office\\". After initially being accepted, the Committee of Privileges membership was altered and her request was rejected.Viscountess Rhondda's Claim [1922] 2 AC 339. She was supported for many years by Lord Astor, whose wife Nancy had been the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons. Less than a month after Lady Rhondda's death in 1958, women entered the Lords for the first time thanks to the Life Peerages Act 1958; five years later, with the passage of the Peerage Act 1963, hereditary peeresses were also allowed to enter the Lords. Business interests She succeeded her father as chair of the Sanatogen Company in February 1917. In total, she was a director of 33 companies throughout her life, having inherited 28 directorships from her father. The majority of her business interests were in coal, steel and shipping via Consolidated Cambrian Ltd. She was passionate about increasing the number of women in the corporate world. In the summer of 1919, Margaret was involved in creating and chairing the Efficiency Club, a networking organisation for British businesswomen, which she envisioned would have four aims, 1) to promote greater efficiency and cooperation between established businesses and professional women; 2) to encourage leadership and self reliance amongst all women workers; 3) to form a link between businesses and professional women for their mutual benefit and 4) to work towards the admission of women to the British Chambers of Commerce. However, with the slump in coal prices during the late 1920s, the colliery's of Consolidated Cambrian fell into receivership, and its assets later sold to GKN. Aside from inheriting her father's publishing interests, in 1920 she had founded Time and Tide magazine, a left-wing feminist weekly magazine. But after the collapse of Consolidated Cambrian, her personal accounts show that her outgoings always exceeded her income. Lady Rhondda was elected as the Institute of Directors' first female president in 1926, and in 2015, the annual Mackworth Lecture was launched by the IoD in her honour.\\"Institute of Directors launch annual Mackworth Lecture\\" Six Point Group In 1921 she set up the Six Point Group, an action group that focused heavily on the equality between men and women and the rights of the child.* The group's manifesto of equal rights for women within the workplace, and for mothers and children, sought the following: * Satisfactory legislation on Child Assault * Satisfactory legislation for the Widowed Mother * Satisfactory legislation for the Unmarried Mother and her Child * Equal rights for Guardianship for Married Parents * Equal pay for Teachers * Equal Opportunities for men and women in the Civil Service A Canadian steamship, the Lady Mackworth, was named after her.  Personal life  In 1908 she married Sir Humphrey Mackworth, Bt (see Mackworth Baronets). They divorced in 1923 and she never remarried. She lived with Time and Tide magazine editor Helen Archdale in the late 1920s. She later had a close relationship with Winifred Holtby, the author of South Riding, who was in a \\"friendship\\" with the writer Vera Brittain.Shopland, Norena 'A purpose in life‚Äô from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales, Seren Books, 2017 She subsequently spent 25 years living with writer and editor Theodora Bosanquet, who acted as amanuensis to Henry James from 1907 to 1916.

In a journeyman career, he totalled 65 games and three goals in Segunda Divisi√≥n with five clubs, and 113 matches and nine goals in Segunda Divisi√≥n B in service of seven teams. He also spent three years in Scotland, representing Hearts , Raith Rovers and Livingston. Football career Early years Born in M√©rida, Extremadura, Pereira went from hometown club CP M√©rida to Atl√©tico Madrid as a youth, and made his professional debut with the latter's reserves on 21 September 1997, in a 1‚Äì1 Segunda Divisi√≥n away draw against Real Ja√©n where he came on as an 86th- minute substitute for Luis Tevenet. Used rarely, as he was the following season in the same level at his previous team, he dropped down to Segunda Divisi√≥n B where he played for √âcija Balompi√© and SD Ponferradina over the next two years. In 2000, Pereira signed for division two side Getafe CF, and scored his first professional goal on 19 November by converting a penalty in a 4‚Äì1 win at Elche CF after also coming from the bench. He concluded the campaign with Xerez CD whom he helped to promotion to that tier, and represented the Andalusians there for one-and-a-half years before a brief return to Ponferradina, signing for CD Logro√±√©s also in the third division at the start of 2003‚Äì04. Scotland Amidst his last club's financial crisis that would see them eventually relegated for administrative reasons, Pereira moved abroad on 10 January 2004, signing for Raith Rovers of the Scottish Football League First Division. After scoring regularly in Kirkcaldy, he joined Heart of Midlothian in the Scottish Premier League on a one-year deal; manager Craig Levein likened him to Nacho Novo, another attacker who went from the lower Spanish leagues to the SPL via Raith. Pereira's opportunities were limited at the Tynecastle Stadium, and in the summer of 2005 he transferred to fellow league team Livingston. He netted his first goal for them in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Dunfermline Athletic. On 21 September, he finished Derek Adams' cross to score the only goal of a home win over a previously unbeaten Hearts in the third round of the Scottish League Cup. Pereira left the Livi Lions on 30 November 2005, to return to his homeland. Later career Pereira signed for a third time at Ponferradina in January 2006, helping them to a first-ever promotion to the second level in his first year. On 6 May 2007, he scored the only goal away to CD Tenerife, but his team was eventually sent back to where they came from. Until his retirement at the age of 33, Pereira competed in the third tier or lower.

History The CCSO has had 60 sheriffs since its formation in 1749. The CCSO saw much action during the American Revolutionary War including Patrick Henry reciting his famous speech from St. John's Church and the area surrounding the Courthouse was a very strategic location. In 1841 the original jail, which was commissioned in 1749, was destroyed in a fire. This resulted in a new jail, which was used until the 1940s when it was converted into an emergency communications (dispatch) office. From the 1940s to 1960 CCSO inmates were housed in other jails until a new, modern facility was built. In the 1970s an addition was built onto the jail.Chesterfield County Sheriff's Office - History In 1994, a new building was constructed to hold those charged with misdemeanors. Those facing and/or convicted of felonies were still housed in the old 1960 building, which was torn down in 2002. A new building, along with the 1994 section, now constitute the men's jail. There is no longer a Chesterfield jail for female inmates. They all are held at Riverside Regional Jail. In 1917 the original courthouse was demolished to make room for the new one. The 1917 courthouse is now on the National Register of Historic Places. It closed in 1989, when the current courthouse opened at the intersection of Courthouse and Iron Bridge roads. CCSO has implemented a voluntary addiction recovery program in the county jail which utilizes peer-to-peer recovery support and professional counselors working to treat underlying conditions. The program is called the HARP program, an acronym for Helping Addicts Recover Permanently. Participants of the program are allowed to return to the jail and participate in group meetings after they have been discharged. The program has grown a robust recovery support network in the community. Organization The agency is currently headed by Sheriff Karl S. Leonard.

History of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia In Salamanca, Spain On September 4, 1401, in the city of Paris, capital of France, a child was born to pious and religious parents, Rolan and Barbara. He was christened Simon. The family was quite well off, and their property was more than sufficient to maintain a family of four. Early in his youth, however, Simon despised wealth although his parents could well afford his wishes. When his parents and his only sister died, Simon inherited all their property. To avoid trouble, which he thought might ensue from his possession of such wealth, he sold his patrimony and donated the proceeds to the Church, the poor and the destitute, as well as to charitable institutions. He then applied for a position as a chamber boy in the convent of a Franciscan church in Paris. Simon would frequently visit the church and spend hours in prayer before the altar of the Virgin Mary. Many times, in his deep meditation, he would ask the Holy Virgin to inspire him in what he might do to please her. Once, while he was absorbed in spiritual contemplation of the beauty of the Holy Mother, he lost consciousness. His prayer was answered for he heard a clear voice that tried to rouse him from slumber: ‚ÄúSimon, wake up; be on the watch‚Ä¶. From now on your name will be Simon Vela. Go to Pe√±a de Francia west of this country, and there you will find the shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\". For five (5) years Simon Vela traveled far and wide among caves, hills and mountains, in search of Pe√±a de Francia but he could not find the place. He wanted to give up the search, and was in fact already on his way back to Paris, when one night he heard the same voice once more saying: ‚ÄúSimon, do not give up the search; do not give up what you have begun. Persevere and your labors will be recompensed.‚Äù This suddenly buoyed up his spirits and so he resumed his search the next day. Simon went to the Church of Santiago de Galicia. And while he was passing the market place of Salamanca, he saw two men quarreling. One was seriously wounded and fell at Simon's side. The offender was caught by the crowd who milled around them and he brazenly remarked: ‚ÄúHad I killed my enemy, I would have escaped to Pe√±a de Francia where no one, not even the king, could find me.‚Äù Simon was overjoyed when he heard this for now he knew that such a place did actually exist. Several hours afterwards he resumed his way to the church of San Martin. On his way he met a man selling charcoal. Simon asked the man where he came from, and the man said he came from a place called Pe√±a de Francia. This was the second time that Simon heard the name of the place mentioned. He then begged the man to guide him to the place called Pe√±a de Francia but for some reason the latter refused to do so. Simon traced the road through which he thought the man has passed. He then reached a villa called San Martin de Casta√±ar on May 14, 1434. He went to church and after the mass, he asked a man to kindly indicate where Pe√±a de Francia was. The man took Simon Vela to a place some distance from the church and pointed to him a hill in the far distance saying that the hill was the Pe√±a de Francia he was looking for. Simon was very grateful and thanked God for having found the man who showed him the place of his dream. Simon then set out for the place indicated and, after a long weary journey, came to a steep rocky hill. By this time, his supply of provisions had been depleted and he was beginning to feel the pangs of hunger. The climb over the hill had considerably weakened him, but he was not disheartened because he knew deep within him that God had not forsaken him to a fruitless and useless search. And indeed how right he was for on the road otherwise abandoned he found a packet containing a loaf of bread and piece of meat. This relieved him so much until night overtook him and he sought shelter in a cave. Inside he prayed for guidance and soon he was lost in deep slumber. Early in the morning of the next day, Simon began the search for the shrine in every cave where he had slept the night before. He felt distressed and discouraged for his seemed as distant as it was when he started. He knelt and prayed for strength and courage. Soon, he heard the same voice he had previously heard resounding clearly through the cave: ‚ÄúSimon, be awake: do not sleep.‚Äù Simon continued the search with more zeal in the morning of the next day. At a distance on a rocky hill, he saw a glaring and dazzling light filling the place with its brilliance. Trembling with joy, he approached it and there he found the Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus in her arms sittings on a golden throne. He Knelt before her and prayed with all the fervor of his soul. The ecstatic Simon said, ‚ÄúOh, Lady, the dream of my soul, the inspiration of men and women! My labors are now ended. Many years have I traveled far and wide to seek you and to drink in the beauty of your eyes! Do not forsake me: be my protection.‚Äù In sympathy for Simon, the Lady answered: ‚ÄúSimon, rejoice! Your constancy will be rewarded. Your dream will be realized. Your labors are now ended. Take heed and keep in your heart what I wish you to do. Dig in this spot and take what you can see and place it on the summit of this rocky hill. Build on this hill a beautiful dwelling. You are to begin it and others will come to finish it.. This must come to pass as it has been the wish of my child.‚Äù Then the Lady suddenly disappeared and Simon was left standing alone and rooted in the spot with wonder and awe. On the morning of May, 1434, on the spot where the apparition of the Holy Virgin disappeared, Simon began the work of digging and excavating. He, however, heard the same voice again saying: ‚ÄúSimon, do not attempt to undertake that big task alone. Undertake it in the presence and with the help of two, three, or more persons.‚Äù Evidently this was to avert any doubt or suspicion from people as to a veracity of the miracle and the credibility of Simon. So Simon went to San Martin del Casta√±ar, a nearby town from the spot, and asked five men to help him. They were Anton Fernandez, Pascual Perez, Benito Sanchez, Juan Hernandez and Antonio Sanchez, the parish scribe of the place. These men thought that they were digging for hidden treasure but they were informed that they were going to dig for objects worth far more than any worldly goods their hearts could cherish. They dug unceasingly, clearly following directions from divine inspiration. Finally, on May 19, 1434, after removing a huge stone, they found embedded among the rocks, the most coveted image of the Holy Virgin with the Child in her arms. In the Philippines According to locals in what is now Naga City, a Spanish colonial official from Pe√±a de Francia, Spain (a native of San Mart√≠n de Casta√±ar) settled with his family in Cavite in 1712. One day, Miguel Robles de Covarrubias, a son of the official and a seminarian studying at the Universidad de Santo Tom√°s in Manila, fell seriously ill. He and his family prayed to Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia, whose picture Miguel clutched to his breast as he hoped for recovery. Miguel vowed that if cured, he would out of gratitude construct a chapel on the banks of the Pasig River in Manila which is now called Paco. Miguel was miraculously cured, and ordained a priest not in Manila but in Ciudad de Nueva C√°ceres (now Naga City) by Bishop Andr√©s Gonz√°lez. To fulfill his vow, Miguel (who was the first diocesan priest ordained in Naga), did two things. First, he mobilized natives along the slopes of Mount Isarog to build a chapel from the local nipa and bamboo, at a site by the banks of the Naga River and not the Pasig as he earlier desired. Second, he ordered a local artisan to carve an image patterned after the picture of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia that he always carried with him. Stories of miracles surrounding the image began circulating immediately, beginning with the account of a resurrected dog. The animal was killed for its blood, which was to be used in painting the newly carved image of Our Lady, and the carcass was dumped into the Naga river. The dog suddenly came back to life and began swimming; hundreds allegedly witnessed the event. News of many other miracles spread quickly, as did public devotion to the image. A letter sent by Miguel to the Dominicans in Salamanca, Spain in 1712 reported numerous miracles through the intercession of Our Lady. The number of devotees eventually increased beyond the Diocese of Nueva C√°ceres, which comprised the Bicolandia and Marinduque, and in modern times the devotion has reached other parts of the world along with the Filipino diaspora. The image is known to devotees by the title Ina, a local term for \\"Mother\\". Other history Canonical coronation of the image The Canonical Coronation of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia as \\"Patroness of Bicolandia\\" took place on September 20, 1924, officiated by Monsignor Guillermo Piani, the Apostolic Delegate. The image of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia currently enshrined in the church on Calle Balatas is approximately 275 years old, making it highly sought-after by antique dealers and collectors. Theft of the image On the morning of August 15, 1981, the image was stolen from its shrine inside Pe√±afrancia Church. The news shocked the entire region, and devotees were incredulous of the sacrilegiousity of the theft. A massive search for the image was immediately undertaken by the military and civilians, during which a policeman was killed and a police lieutenant wounded when their jeepney was ambushed by heavily armed men somewhere in Bolo Sur, Sipocot, Camarines Sur. Devotees almost lost all hope in finding the image, with many of the tip-offs proving to have been false. The approaching feast of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia necessitated an image to be borne during the traslaci√≥n or transfer of the image and the accompanying fluvial procession. A replica was commissioned by church authorities and another image was donated by the First Lady Imelda Marcos. Recovery A little over a year later, the image was returned to Rt Rev. Monsignor Florencio Yllana, P.A., Liaison Officer of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines and former Rector of the image's shrine. On September 8, 1982, (the Feast of the Nativity of Mary), a motorcade from Manila bearing the image arrived in Naga at the height of Typhoon Ruping. The foul weather did not deter thousands of devotees who braved the raging winds and devastating floods to celebrate the image's return. At 10:00 in the evening of the same day, the image was safely re-enshrined at the Metropolitan Cathedral, where a concelebrated pontifical Mass was offered in thanksgiving for the image's safe return and arrival. The image is now enshrined at the Minor Basilica along Calle Balatas in Naga, which was built as its new home after the old church, given the rising numbers of devotees who were attending services there in the late 1970s from all over the Bicol region and nationwide at the former church. Devotion Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia replica at the Church-owned San Juan de Dios Hospital. The feast of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia is celebrated on the Sunday after the Octave (8 Days) of September 8 (The Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary) that usually falls on the second or third Sunday of September in Naga City. All roads and routes will lead to Naga City in Camarines Sur where six million Bicolanos from both Bicol and abroad will flock to that progressive city to pay honor to the Virgin of Pe√±afrancia, miraculous patroness of the Bicol Region. Bicolanos from all walks of life gather in Naga City to meet their relatives, friends and fellow devotees, share food, drinks, and prayers with them, and most of all, to pay homage and make thanksgiving to the Virgin of Pe√±afrancia, whom the Bicolanos fondly call Ina. They will shout \\"Viva la Virgen\\" to the high heavens. The feast day is preceded by a novena, or nine days of prayer, in honor of the Virgin. On the first day, the image of the Virgin, a copy of the Madonna in Pe√±afrancia, Spain, is brought from its shrine to the Naga Cathedral where the novena is held. On the last day, the image is returned to her shrine following the Naga River route. The colorful evening procession is lit by thousands of candles from followers in boats escorting the image. When the flatboat reaches its destination, the devotees shout \\"Viva la Virgen\\" (Long live the Virgin!) and the image is carried back in a procession to the cathedral. Millions of Bicolanos, year after year, show to the whole Christian world their strong faith and loyalty to their Heavenly Mother. Amongst triumphant sounding shouts of Viva la Virgen, Bicolanos and pilgrims by the thousands, with lighted candles in their hands, will kneel on the ground and bow their heads in prayer as the colorful fluvial procession carrying the Virgin plows through the Bicol River in downtown Naga. A multicolored pagoda carrying the images/icons of the Virgin of Pe√±afrancia and the Divino Rostro will pass through the Bicol River. Male, sunburned devotees of the Virgin will adhere to the huge pagoda in a heartwarming display of faith and devotion. Actually, the fluvial procession marks the return of the Virgin from the Naga Metropolitan Cathedral to her home shrine at the Basilica. Upon its arrival, the Virgin will be received in formal religious rites by Roman Catholic dignitaries of the Bicol Region led by the Archbishop of Nueva Caceres, which is its home diocese. Considered the biggest and most popular religious event in the Philippines, the Pe√±afrancia fiesta is in fact a one-week affair that starts on the second Friday of September when the miraculous Ina is transferred from her shrine to the centuries-old Naga Metropolitan Cathedral where a nine-day novena and prayers are held in her honor. Ranking government officials, Cabinet members, ambassadors, provincial governors and board members, mayors, senators, congressional representatives of the Bicol Region, business/industry leaders, landlords, employees of the government and state firms, etc., vie for the distinct honor of sponsoring novena masses and prayers at the Naga Cathedral during the novena period. Events of the image's feast Fluvial Procession during Penafrancia Festival on the eve of the feast of Nstra Sra. De Penafrancia. The September festivities of the Lady and Mother of Bicol form an opening salvo to the long celebrations of Christmas in the Philippines, which begin in the very month the celebrations are held in Bicol and in countless other parts of the country. Novena to the Divino Rostro The festivities begin in a nine-day novenario to the Divino Rostro, a local icon of \\"the Divine/Holy Face\\". The Divino Rostro is brought in procession to the old Pe√±afrancia Shrine, where it stays for nine days of the novenario, which usually centres on the sick, and faith in Christ's power. Alongside the novena period is the hosting of the regional Miss Bicolandia beauty pageant, which marks the first salvo of the long festive period for the peoples of Naga City and all over the region. Usually, the first devotees coming from all over Bicol begin their celebrations during this period. Regardless of the period of the novena prayers, the only fixed celebration, that of the Nativity of Mary on September 8, is marked by Masses in the old shrine or the Metropolitan Cathedral, also in thanksgiving for the safe recovery and return of the image in Naga in 1982. Traslaci√≥n The second Friday of September marks the feast day of the Divino Rostro, following nine days of the novena at the shrine. The image of the Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia is transferred at dawn to her old home for the Traslaci√≥n in the afternoon. After the procession, a community and thanksgiving Mass is celebrated to honour the image's arrival. Bishops and delegates from other dioceses in the country then attend a Pontifical Mass concelebrated by archbishops outside the shrine to commemorate the feast of the Divino Rostro in the midday. The Traslaci√≥n begins after the noon mass from the procession of the students, delegates from other regions, teachers, government officials, and other professions while the images are being prepared for the procession. After the Mass, the Divino Rostro icon leaves the shrine and heads to the Cathedral at a very slow pace. After a recital or two of the Rosary (depending on the Divino Rostro's speed), the image of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia follows and moves at a very slow pace, quite slower than the Divino Rostro's. After two or three hours, the Divino Rostro icon arrives at Naga Cathedral, and after an hour, the image of Our Lady enters via the Portae Mariae (Gate of Mary) in the grounds. A Solemn Pontifical Mass is celebrated after the procession outside the Cathedral grounds, and following this the image is transferred to the interior of the Cathedral. After the Mass, the nine-day novena period for Our Lady begins inside the Naga Cathedral. Novenario to the Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia After the Traslacion, the nine-day novena to the Our Lady is held inside or sometimes outside the Cathedral. Millions of devotees come to the Cathedral for the novenario, praying for the divine intercession of Ina to her son, that their prayers be heard and be fulfilled. The novenario is said to have healed countless devotees and even the Bishop concelebrating the novena mass. The novena centers around Mary's intercession to Jesus her son as the people pray to Our Lady to help them grew closer in holiness and to strengthen their faith. During some of the days of the novena period, dawn and evening processions are mounted within the vicnity of Naga wherein the images of both Our Lady and the Divino Rostro are brought out to the streets of the city. Parades and celebrations Different parades are held during the nine-day novena to the Our Lady, and these events are open to the public, with coverage on radio and television as well as on online streaming. The Saturday following the Translacion is the day the citywide Marian Youth Congress is held, gathering young people all over the city and region to share and strengthen their faith. During the Sunday after the Traslacion, the majorettes, CAT, and Drum and Lyre Corps, plus marching bands, exhibit their skills in dancing, music playing, and silent drill at the Robredo Coliseum, with the best winners announced after the long day of events. On the Tuesday before the Fluvial Procession, the Regional Cheer-dance Competition is held at the Plaza Quezon. Almost all of the schools and universities in Bicol participate in this long, but very entertaining event. On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts, and Girls Scouts, including the Drum and Lyre corps, and majorettes from different elementary and high schools in Bicol parade in the daylong, Regional BSP/GSP and Drum and Lyre Corps parade and competition at the Plaza Quezon. The event is attended by representatives of both organizations in the region. Awards are given to the best contingents and DLCs which have distinguished themselves. On Thursday, the Civic Parade of the Government workers, and different associations, and organizations in Bicol, and the Float Parade that is joined by hundreds of floats, honoring Ina, is held in the morning. This is followed by, in recent years, a street dance competition of schools in the city and the region in the afternoon at Plaza Quezon, with the winning contingent awarded after all the performances. On Friday, the most awaited and the century-old military parade, participated by all high schools, colleges and universities all over the Bicol region, including service personnel of the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fire Protection, parade in the major streets of Naga City. It is considered to be the longest every parade outside Manila due to its daylong, sometimes reaching nighttime, parade. Dubbed the Bicol Region Military Parade, it is also one of the big highlights of the celebrations, with the Mayor of Naga acting as the reviewing officer, together with retired and active military and police officers and personnel in attendance, together with selected members of the House of Representatives, the Naga City Council and provincial officials, who take the salute at the Plaza Quezon grandstand together with armed forces and police veterans. Awards and decorations are handed out at the end of the long parade to the best contingents who marched past. Fluvial Procession A fluvial procession at the end of the novena caps the feast. Following a farewell service at the Naga Metropolitan Cathedral, the images are both carried through the streets and then in a pagoda (the Filipino term for a decorated shrine-barge, usually with more than one tier, used in fluvial processions) on its return journey to the minor basilica, where a Pontifical Mass is held. Along the route, people shout \\"¬°Viva La Virgen!\\" and people wave their handkerchiefs and towels. The images of both Our Lady and the Divino Rostro are escorted by a battalion of male (and sometimes foreigner) devotees, most of them are aboard colorful paddle boats pulling the pagoda and those who are privileged are joining the icons on the pagoda together with the bishops of Bicol, priests, seminarians, and representatives of the city, provincial and national government and legislature. Crowds by the hundreds line both banks of the river, praying and hoping to see the two images in the procession. Tradition holds that if a woman, either a Filipina or foreigner, rides on the pagoda during the September fluvial procession, it will spell disaster for everyone involved. Festival Sunday Festival masses held on the Sunday after the Octave of the Nativity of Mary at the Pe√±afrancia Minor Basilica mark the official termination of the festivities. Masses are held all day long in all the Catholic parishes and diocese cathedrals of the Bicol Region. In addition, masses are held in many parts of the country in her honor, organized by local devotees' associations. Changes in the 2020 Pe√±afrancia Fiesta celebration With the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the Archdiocese of Caceres and the Naga City Government decided to tone down the 2020 festivities to comply with the minimum health standards implemented in the country. https://cbcpnews.net/cbcpnews/covid-19-tones-down- traditional-penafrancia-festivities/ The following changes shall be observed for the celebrations all September:https://www.archdioceseofcaceres.org/news- caceres-inboxhttps://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1298825/church-naga-city-cancel- penafrancia-festival *Instead of the traditional novena to the Divino Rostro (the Holy Face of Jesus) from Sept. 2-10 and the novena to Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia from Sept. 11-19, at the Pe√±afrancia Shrine, Metropolitan Naga Cathedral, and the Basilica Minore, the practice of the devotion is encouraged in the homes of the faithful.

Tens of thousands of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists come to Naga City, Philippines every September for a nine-day festivities in honor of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia, the Patroness of Bicol. The festivities begin with the Traslacion procession during which the images of the Lady of Pe√±afrancia and the Divino Rostro (Holy Face) are brought by barefooted male voyadores from the Basilica through the main streets of the city to the Cathedral. This procession, which usually lasts for 4 hours, is participated in by thousands of devotees from all over Bicol and other parts of the country. The devotion started in 1710, when Fr. Miguel Robles de Covarrubias had an image carved, a chapel built and processions held in honor of the miraculous image of the Virgin of Pe√±afrancia on account to the many favors he received through the help of the Virgin, especially pertaining to his health. Since then the devotion has grown, including among non-Filipino Catholics. Devotees‚Äô accounts of healing and favors received through her intercession are a reason for the spread of the devotion. In 2010, the devotion marked its 300th year. The Archdiocese of Caceres has outlined a three-year preparation for the tercentenary with each year centered on a particular theme and objective. Year 1 (September 2007 to September 2008 ) whose theme was ‚ÄúRemembering the Gift of the Devotion to Ina‚Äù, was dedicated to revisiting the history of the devotion in view of a deeper understanding of the same devotion. Year 2 (September 2008 to September 2009) whose theme was ‚ÄúRenewing the Faith through Ina‚Äù, was dedicated to appreciating the devotees‚Äô giftedness towards a more vibrant and relevant faith life. In Year 3 (September 2009 to September 2010) whose theme was ‚ÄúSharing the Future in Hope‚Äù, was dedicated to envisioning the future with the intent of sharing the fruits of the devotion to the next generations. In Year 4 (September 2010), the church in Bicol celebrated in thanksgiving the grace of 300 Years of Devotion. The overall theme of the celebration is ‚ÄúA Gift received, a Gift to share‚Äù (Balaog inako, Balaog itao). Hymn The \\"Himno a la Nuestra Se√±ora de Pe√±afrancia\\" or \\"Resuene Vibrante\\" as Bicolanos call it, is the official hymn of the devotees to the Lady of Bicolandia composed by Fr. Maximo Huguera, CM in the year 1924. It won the first prize during the hymn-writing competition for the Lady's canonical coronation. This was translated to Central Bikol by Fr. Jesus Esplana and Fr. Sohl Saez. But after the Tercentenary celebration in 2010, the full Spanish text was played again in all masses. Spanish text Coro: Resuene vibrante el himno de amor Que entona tu pueblo con grata y emoci√≥n Resuene vibrante el himno de amor Que entona tu pueblo con grata emoci√≥n Patrona del B√≠col, Gran Madre de Dios S√© siempre la Reina de Nuestra Regi√≥n Patrona del B√≠col, Gran Madre de Dios S√© siempre la Reina de Nuestra Regi√≥n.

(Repeat Chorus)  Popular Artifacts  These two are some of the many artifacts of Our Lady which can be seen by visitors and devotees alike at the Pe√±afrancia Museum, which forms part of the Basilica complex.  Cherished Manto of Ina During the Historic September 20, 1924 Canonical Coronation  The third face of the Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia was made in the City of Naga. According to the picture of Ina from the devotional book by Fr. Miguel Robles de Covarrubias, the image of Ina is a 17-inch santol wood sculpture. This image of the Queen Mary is the Regional Patroness of Bicol ‚Äì ‚ÄúIna‚Äù as referred to by the Bikolanos. The replica of Nuestra Se√±ora de Pe√±afrancia is the second Marian image in the entire Asia and in the Philippines that has been given a Canonical Coronation. This coronation took place at the Church of Naga, currently known as the Naga Metropolitan Cathedral: Parish of Saint John the Evangelist, on the 20th of September 1924. It was presided by the Apostolic Delegate Papal Legate Guillermo Piani, own representative of Pope Benedict XV, and Michael J. O‚ÄôDoherty, Bishop of Manila. Msgr. Piani placed the bejeweled crown on the head of the statue of Ina while a significant number of teeming devotees from different places chanted, ‚ÄúViva la Virgen!‚Äù Also, it was on this solemn celebration that the award-winning piece of Maximo Heguera the ‚ÄúHimno a la Nuestra Se√±ora de Pe√±afrancia,‚Äù popularly known as ‚ÄúResuene Vibrante,‚Äù was sung. The actual manto used by Ina during the Canonical Coronation is currently kept and displayed at the Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia Museum. Along with the mantle, a description says that, ‚Äúthreadbare and torn this ‚Äúmanto‚Äù was worn by Our Lady for many years until her devotees started donating new ones... she has more than enough now.‚Äù It also states that the manto was ordered from Spain which has a label on the inside lining which appears to have the words Fabrica de Ornamentos de Yglesia, Jose Candela Albert, Sto. Tomas 18, Valencia, and a logo. This manto is a significant artifact that would commemorate the historic Canonical Coronation of Ina on September 20, 1924.  Holy Manto of Ina found in the Pe√±afrancia Cemetery in the aftermath of the 1981 theft of the image  On August 15,1981 at around 4:30 in the morning, the caretaker of the Pe√±afrancia Shrine discovered that the image of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia was gone from its familiar pedestal on the altar. The police reported that the culprits sawed the iron grills at the back of the church and took the Image. The identity of the thieves remained a mystery; however, investigators said that they were from the black market who were trying to sell valuable items. The manto and the steel bar which held the image was thrown like garbage in the cemetery grounds of Pe√±afrancia Shrine but the image was not found with it. On May 1982, an antique dealer and also a Pe√±afrancia Devotee, Francisco Vecin, acquired information about the lost image when a man in Mabini St. of Malate, Manila offered the Image. At that time, it was in the hands of a friend. He reported to Msgr. Florencio Yllana that the Lost Image was located in Cebu. It was on September 3, 1892 that the image in a sealed box was turned over to Francisco. The image was returned in Naga on September 8, 1982 it was the time when Typhoon Ruping hit the region but it was not a reason for the devotees to not celebrate the return of the image. The theft of the image of Ina opted for the production of a replica to be used in the 1981 Pe√±afrancia celebrations and today the original image is being kept safe at a prayer room in the Basilica grounds.

It spans through an area of 7,000 square meters and it regularly hosts modern and contemporary art works and famous collections in cooperation with notable museums and cultural institutions from across the world. More than 1,500 masterpieces are on display annually. It was originally designed to include two courtyards but these were later dismantled to make room for the Duomo. The Palazzo is located to the right of the Duomo's facade, opposite to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The facade of the Palazzo creates a recess in Piazza del Duomo which functions as a courtyard, known as the Piazzetta Reale (literally, a \\"Small Royal Square\\"). The famous Hall of Caryatids can be found on the main floor of the building, heavily damaged by World War II's air raids. After the war the Palazzo remained abandoned for over two years and its condition further deteriorated. Many of the Palazzo's neoclassical interiors were lost in this period. History Origins The royal palace has ancient origins. It was first called \\"Palazzo del Broletto Vecchio\\", and it was the seat of city's government during the period of medieval communes in the Middle Ages. The palace became a key political center under the Torriani, Visconti and Sforza households. After the construction of the Duomo Cathedral, the Palazzo was heavily renovated thanks to the efforts of Francesco Sforza's government. 16th century Until the early 16th century, the Dukes of Milan had their official residence in Castello Sforzesco. When the Sforza dynasty ended and the French invaded Milan, this castle became progressively more a fortress apt for warfare rather than an elegant noble residence. It was therefore under the French rule of Louis XII and of Fran√ßois I that the court was moved to Palazzo Reale. The Palazzo flourished under Governor Ferrante Gonzaga, who took permanent residence in Milan in 1546. The Gonzaga family refurbished and transformed the ducal court into a palace suitable for a governor, with expanded and newly inaugurated rooms dedicated to official functions. To pursue these expansions, governor Gonzaga demolished the old church of Sant'Andrea al Muro Rotto, annexing its land to the Palazzo's complex. An interior passageway in an enclosed courtyard was created to connect the royal palace to the Church of San Gottardo, which became at this time the official church of the court. At the end of the 16th century, Governor Antonio de Guzman y Zuniga, Marquis of Ayamonte, recruited Pellegrino Tibaldi to conduct further renovation at the royal palace. Tibaldi, archbishop Charles Borromeo's trusted architect, was at the time already working on the Duomo, on the Archbishop's Palace and on Cortile dei Canonici. Between 1573 and 1598 he coordinated work at the royal palace which completed overhauled the pictorial decorations of the apartments' porticoes, of the private chapel and of the Church of San Gottardo. Several major artists of the time attended to this work: Aurelio Luini, Ambrogio Figino, Antonio Campi and naturally Pellegrino Tibaldi himself. Some stuccoes and Gothic works were created by Valerio Profondavalle, a Flemish artist-impresario who had also worked on the windows of the Duomo. It is in this time that the Court Theater was completed, the first of a series of theaters built in Milan only to be lost to fire and replaced, until eventually La Scala was erected in the 18th century. 17th and 18th centuries Portrait of Maria Theresa of Austria by Anton von Maron, displayed in the Palazzo Reale to celebrate her contributions to the city of Milan On the night of 24 January 1695 a fire destroyed the Court Theater. Reconstruction and expansion of a new ducal theater would begin only in 1717 under the patronage of the Count of Loewenstein, the new Austrian governor of the city of Milan following the War of Spanish Succession. The new theater was designed by Francesco Galli Bibbiena and his pupils Giandomenico Barbieri and Domenico Valmagini. The theater was larger, with four tiers of boxes and a gallery in the shape of a horseshoe; on the side was a small ridottino for gambling and a shop for drinks, sweets and costumes. It was completed on 26 December 1717 and it was inaugurated with the opera Costantino by Gasparini. In 1723 a new fire accident damaged the ceremonial halls of the palace. The Austrian magistrate Wirich Philipp von Daun then commissioned restorations. The wings of the Cortile d'Onore (Honor Courtyard) were updated in a livelier style, introducing whitewashed walls and baroque window frames designed by Carlo Rinaldi. The church of San Gottardo was also re-decorated in painting, stucco and gilding and upgraded to be a proper Royal-Ducal Chapel. Salone dei Festini and Salone di Audienzia (now Hall of Emperors), both on the \\"piano nobile\\" (noble floor), were also restored. The Cortile d'Onore wings housed the chancery, the magistrate and accounting offices and other administrative and financial offices. The Governor and the Privy Council met in new rooms built on the north side of the garden. The Governor was housed in the newly built northern and southern wings of the courtyard. In 1745, Gian Luca Pallavicini became governor and minister plenipotentiary of Milan. He recruited the famous architect Francesco Croce of the Cathedral Workshop to completely refurbish the palace interiors (furniture, silverware, chinaware and chandeliers) at his personal expenses. Croce commissioned tapestries reproducing Raphaelite works from the Gobelins factories. The halls of Festini and Audienzia were merged to create an enormous 46 by 17 meter ballroom (current Hall of the Caryatids), inclusive of side boxes to hold an orchestra. Pallavacini also requested a hall destined to host gala dinners ‚Äì a new trend coming from France. When Pallavacini left in 1752, he sold his furniture and decor to the city of Milan. Reconstruction by Piermarini The Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, son of Maria Theresa of Austria, married Maria Beatrice d'Este in Milan in 1771. For their wedding, Ascanio in Alba by Mozart was staged in the Palazzo. Mozart was initially offered a post as Maestro in the Milan court, only to be rejected at last by the Empress Maria Theresa. Maria Beatrice was heir of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, governor of the Duchy of Milan and in a decade she would also be appointed Duchess of Lombardy. The archduke Ferdinand had hoped to build a new palace, but eventually settled on remodeling the royal palace by moving out many of the administrative offices to increase the size of the royal residence. The neoclassical grand staircase of the building The renovation work in 1773 was directed by Giuseppe Piermarini in collaboration with Leopold Pollack. Piermarini was tasked with the difficult job of balancing the demands of the archduke, who was not willing to live in the royal palace unless it was grandly renovated, and the financial limitations imposed by Vienna. For the exterior he opted for an austere look, abandoning the baroque style and introducing the neoclassical in Milan. One major modification was the elimination of the wing of the courtyard adjacent to the Duomo, to create Piazzetta Reale, then larger than the square of the Cathedral. He also built the famous neoclassical facade of the Palazzo that can be still admired to this day. Fire struck again, destroying the Court Theater on February 26, 1776. It was decided at this time that the fire-prone Court Theater was to be built elsewhere: Teatro Alla Scala was erected, to become arguably the earliest public opera house in the world. A smaller court theater, now Teatro Lirico, was built closer to Palazzo Reale by demolishing a nearby school. As per the interior work, the rooms was repurposed to meet the archduke's requests. The most notable modification is the creation of the famous Hall of Caryatids (named after 40 caryatid sculptures by Gaetano Callani.) At the same time, the ducal chapel of San Gottardo was provided with a new altar and fully redecorated in neoclassical style. Only the bell tower was preserved without changes, being considered a model of architectural beauty by Azzone Visconti. The Archduke ordered more Gobelin tapestries depicting stories of Jason to be placed side by side with the original ones by Pallavicini. The rooms were stuccoed by Albertolli and frescoed by Giuliano Traballesi and Martin Knoller. Renovation works in the palace rooms will continue, ending only in the 19th century with the final contributions by Andrea Appiani and Francesco Hayez. Piermarini officially completed his work on 17 June 1778, when the Archduke officially took residence into the new Palazzo Reale. Napoleonic era and restoration One of the commemorative paintings by Andrea Appiani displayed in the Palazzo Reale, celebrating Napoleon's triumph by depicting him as a Roman emperor In 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte - still a general of the French army - occupied Milan and made it capital of the newly proclaimed Cisalpine Republic, following his victory in the battle of Lodi. The Palazzo was then renamed the National Palace and became initially the seat of the Cisalpine Republic's military command and then its Directorate. When the Austro-Russians regained control of Milan in 1799, the French government quickly auctioned most of the Palazzo's furnishings and allowed the rest to be looted by the general population. After being damaged considerably, the Palazzo returned to and even surpassed its former splendor in 1805, when it was eventually named \\"Royal Palace\\": Milan had become the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, ruled by Napoleon's adoptive son Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, who was appointed Viceroy and chose it to be his official residence. Milan was now the capital of a vast kingdom spanning all across northern Italy and the Palazzo Reale was therefore renovated to ensure it was worthy of its title. The damaged interiors were repaired and replaced with new and lavish furniture; Andrea Appiani worked on new frescoes in the main official rooms (Sala delle Udienze Solenni, Sala della Rotonda and Sala della Lanterna). As per the exterior, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais invited Luigi Canonica to create an entire new block called \\"La Cavallerizza\\" ( nowadays occupied by the city council offices). New stables, a large riding school and a place to give equestrian public performances, together with many offices were built in the new block in austere neo- classical style. The project was completed years later by Giacomo Tazzini, who also worked on the Via Larga's facade. The complex was connected to the royal theatre (Cannobiana Theatre, at the time) through a bridge on via Restrelli. With the fall of Napoleon in 1814, the Kingdom of Italy toppled and the huge Palazzo, together with Milan, returned in Austrian hands. The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia was formed and the royal palace remained the official seat of power of a wide realm even under Austrian rule. Recent era and loss of the Hall of Caryatids Wilhelm I, held in the \\"Hall of Caryatids\\" of the Palazzo Reale before its destruction by fire on 15 August 1943. The Emperor's room in 1875 When Lombardy was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1859, the royal palace became the residence of the new governor of Milan, Massimo d'Azeglio. D'Azeglio could only enjoy the Palazzo for less than a year, though: following the events that led to the proclamation of the kingdom of Italy in 1861, it became the Savoy monarch's royal residence, even if it was not often occupied once the capital was moved to Florence. Umberto I preferred the Villa Reale di Monza to the Palazzo and his son too, Vittorio Emanuele III, avoided Milan and only visited the Palazzo Reale during official ceremonies. The last official royal reception held in Milan was in 1906, during the World Fair. Palazzo Reale was to host its last official visit in 1919, when the U.S. president Woodrow Wilson was invited in Milan by Vittorio Emanuele III of Savoy. Later that year, on October 11, the palace was sold by the House of Savoy to the Italian state, on condition that apartments would remain available for the Savoy royal family when necessary. Members of the family, among whom most notably the Duke of Bergamo, will continue to live in the royal palace until the Second World War. Big changes at the Palazzo were to follow its sale. In 1850 the side nearest to the Duomo was reduced in size to allow better road traffic, thus altering radically the monumental proportions of the palace. A second disruption occurred in 1925, when the Royal Stables were demolished and then again in 1936-37 when the so-called \\"long sleeve\\" (a narrow and long wing) was shortened by at least 60 metres to build Palazzo dell'Arengario. The whole building was heavily damaged on the night of 15 August 1943, when the city was caught in heavy shelling by the British forces. Even if the bombs only hit a small part of the roof, damages quickly extended across the whole structure because of a colossal fire that was not noted and quenched in time, testament to Milan's general state of disarray on that eventful night. All wooden fixtures and furnishings went lost but the high temperature damaged even the famous stuccoes and Appiani's paintings, ruining the Hall of Caryatids beyond repair. Its wooden beams collapsed and trusses smashed on the floor, damaging it together with the vault, the balcony and the gallery. The other halls were also damaged by water seepage, after many of the roof tiles went lost in the raid. After a few years being left to itself, repair works at the Palazzo commenced in 1947, after the end of the war. Italy's Cultural Heritage Superintendence started the refurbishment of the building and the Hall of Caryatids. A new floor and a new roof were built in a much simpler style, purposely leaving aside any ornate past decoration as a testament to the atrocities of the war. Fortunately it is still possible to admire the magnificent decorations of the Hall of Caryatids before its destruction in many paintings and photographs. The Hall, deprived of its ancient luster, was brought back to international attention in 1953 when it was chosen by Picasso to host an exhibition. The Spanish artist's work Guernica was the main feature of the exhibition, symbolically displayed in the now much plainer Hall of Caryatids. Starting in year 2000, the Italian government has commissioned a fuller restoration of the royal palace. The Hall of Caryatids was not redecorated to bring back its former splendor but only conservatively preserved, by removing the blackening on the walls, reinforcing the structural units and cleaning the remaining paintings. Sketches of the old ceiling were drawn on the cover of the new white ceiling, to give an impression of what the room looked like in the past. The Museum of the Palace At the beginning of the 21st century, more than fifty years after its destruction, Palazzo Reale found a new central role in the social and cultural life of Milan. Three phases of restoration were completed, even if the palace did not fully recover its original magnificence. The original purpose of the restorations was to create a \\"Palace Museum\\" to show the four historical seasons the Palazzo went through: the Neoclassical era, Napoleon's period, the Restoration and the Unification of Italy. The first phase of restoration undertook the complex task of refurbishing of the original furniture, to provide a stylistic representation of the life of the Ducal Court. Then the neoclassical halls were restored, to bring back the vision of Giuseppe Piermarini and the splendor of the \\"enlightened\\" era, when the city had a major role in Europe. The third phase focused on the old Apartment of Reserve, to portray the life of 19th century Austrian royalty. Unfortunately the original idea was abandoned and the Museum of the Palace was never inaugurated, despite the completion of its third phase of restoration in 2008. Cultural centre The Royal Palace is now a cultural centre in the heart of Milan, coordinated in conjunction with three other exhibition venues: Rotonda della Besana, Palace of Reason and Palazzo dell'Arengario. The building plays an important role within Milanese artistic life, having hosted in recent years prestigious exhibitions including works by Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and other internationally renowned painters and sculptors. Turn-point for its prestige as exhibition hall was the 2009 show to celebrate Futurism's centenary. Since November 4, 2013 a wing of the palace was repurposed to host the Great Museum of the Duomo of Milan.  References   Sources  * Melano, Oscar Pedro Milano di terracotta e mattoni, Mazzotta, 2002.

It was commissioned by the national television broadcaster Sveriges Television and directed by Jan Myrdal and Rune Hassner. The film, which was written by Myrdal, has been labeled as \\"one of the first successful political films in Sweden.\\" It tells the story of a man, myglaren, who works for the well-being of the employees at an organization presented as \\"the movement\\", hinting at the labour movement or the Social Democrats. Through various schemes, he is able to climb the ladder of success and foster himself and his work. The man works flexibly and manipulates his surroundings, allowing him to build a successful career and become a known name in Swedish well-being research. At the end he is assigned to start a governmental authority to foster the well-being of people in the society. The film shows his way to the top through fancy dinners, relationship making, and his handling of the media. Myglaren is 86 minutes long and was filmed in black- and-white. Photographer Christer Str√∂mholm plays the lead role in the film. The film was a sensation in Sweden and after six airings on television, it reached a larger audience than any prior Swedish film had. Myglaren was a sharp, modern social satire, a format that is unlikely to have been used in any previous Swedish films. Following the multiple airings of Myglaren, the noun \\"myglare\\" has been a common expression in Sweden. The dictionary Svensk ordbok defines it as a person who advances his or her own interests by scheming. Myglaren sparked a debate as to whether or not made-for-television films should qualify for Svenska Filminstitutet's (English: The Swedish Film Institute) quality subsidy. This debate led to a fight between Myrdal and Harry Schein, then-Managing Director of Svenska Filminstitutet. To qualify for the subsidy, the film was resized to a 33 millimeter format and was shown in a cinema once. Despite this, the film did not receive enough quality points in the vote by Svenska Filminstitutet's board of directors. Many believed the vote had been fixed in advance, and Myrdal called Schein a \\"cultural wangler\\". When the film was later released in movie theaters for the general public, it was viewed by 297 people, which Schein stated was \\"hopefully an unbreakable all-time low for Swedish cinema.\\" Myglaren was released on DVD in 2004 by the distributor Folkets Bio.

Origins She was the elder daughter of Thomas Wotton, 2nd Baron Wotton by his wife Mary Throckmorton, a daughter of Sir Arthur Throckmorton of Paulerspury, Northamptonshire. Career After the marriage of William and Mary in May 1641, she followed her husband to Holland as the governess to the princess Royal. As the princess came to age, Lady Stanhope grew to become her confidante and adviser. During the English Civil War, Lady Stanhope sided with Charles I and his heir, King Charles II; she is said to have supplied them both politically and financially, and to have been involved in much of the royalist plots of that decade. After the death of Heenvliet in 1660, Charles II created her Countess of Chesterfield in recognition of both her service and her friendship. She remained in princess Mary's service until the latter's death from illness on 24 December 1660. She then passed into the service of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, and in 1662 to Queen Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II. In 1662 Lady Catherine married her friend Daniel O'Neill (d.1664), Postmaster General, another one of the King's men during the civil war. Upon his death in 1664, she increased her by then already considerable wealth by inheriting O'Neill's office of Postmaster General. Marriages and progeny She married three times: *Firstly in 1628 to Henry Stanhope, Lord Stanhope (d.1634), 2nd surviving son of Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield, by whom she had progeny two daughters and a son: **Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield, who in 1656 inherited the Earldom of Chesterfield from his grandfather. **Mary Stanhope **Catherine Stanhope *Secondly in early 1641, after being courted by several suitors, she married the Dutchman Jehan van der Kerckhove, Lord of Heenvliet (d.1660), one of the diplomats involved in negotiating the marriage between William II, Prince of Orange and Mary, the Princess Royal, daughter of King Charles I, future parents of King William III of England. *Thirdly in 1662 to Daniel O'Neill (d.1664), Postmaster General, a Royalist during the civil war. Death She died of an edema in 1667, and was buried on her father's estate.

Nordahl gained initial fame through his scrupulously researched paintings of Apache life. Biography David Nordahl was born in Albert Lea, Minnesota in 1941. Of his early years, Nordahl stated: \\"I can't remember not drawing. I had an abusive, alcoholic father, and drawing is something that takes you out of the real world. I was always interested in cowboys and Indians. I sold drawings of the Lone Ranger to my classmates.\\" He graduated from Albert Lea High School in 1959. Besides painting portraits, Nordahl also created set pieces for theatrical productions for the Albert Lea Civic Theater in the mid-1960s. In 1964 in Minneapolis he founded Pandora Productions with Bart de Malignon, making posters and blacklight posters.Ensminger, David. \\"Black Light Panthers: The Politics of Fluorescence,\\" Art in Print Vol. 5 No. 2 (July‚ÄìAugust 2015). He moved to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, in 1977. In Colorado, Nordahl solely focused on painting photorealistic portraits of Apache life, which lured collectors due to his painstaking detail and high quality. Michael Jackson's patronage and friendship Nordahl left the world of commercial art to work as Michael Jackson's private portraitist in 1988. He received a late night phone call from Jackson, who had recently seen a Nordahl painting in Steven Spielberg's office, depicting a 19th-century raid on an Apache camp by US Army troops. Initially contacting Nordahl for art lessons, Jackson quickly found a kindred spirit and friend. This led to a creative collaboration which, until 2005, yielded thousands of drawings and roughly a dozen large-scale commissions. Nordahl and Jackson's bond was cemented not only through their mutual artistic appreciation, but through their shared experience of traumatic childhoods. \\"I grew up in a difficult home, and he did too,\\" says Nordahl. \\"We had no playtime growing up. We're both fanatical about work\\". In addition to his work as portraitist, Nordahl provided designs for Jackson's amusement park in Neverland Ranch. Post-Jackson career Since Michael Jackson's move to Bahrain in 2005 (and later his death in 2009), Nordahl has returned to painting Apaches and other subjects. He is currently represented by Settlers West Galleries in Tucson. Personal life Nordahl currently resides in Santa Fe, New Mexico with his wife, artist Lori Peterson. Nordahl's son, Blane David Nordahl,Blane David Nordahl was arrested in August 2013 in connection with a string of thefts that focused entirely on antique silver pieces.

Accessed online 2010-02-05. In February 2010, the Arlington School District was considering closing the school after the current school year. Then in June they indeed voted to do so. The two-story building, described in 2010 by the Everett Herald as \\"the oldest continuously operating small school in Washington\\", still retains its old school bell on the roof. It is the focal point of the Trafton community northeast of Arlington proper, and is the site of the annual Trafton Fair every September. As of 2010, the K-5 school has 135 students, from about 70 families. Faced with a $2.4 million budget crunch from the late-2000s recession, Arlington decided to close the school. According to the Everett Herald, Arlington's Eagle Creek Elementary School several miles away was \\"about 200 students below its capacity and could easily take in the staff and students from Trafton.\\" Trafton needed about $850,000 in repairs and improvements, which would have had to be funded by a bond issue if the school was to remain open; conversely, rolling Trafton into Eagle Creek was projected to save an estimated $300,000 a year.

It is among the most dangerous of highways in Nepal due to extremely steep slopes on each side of the road from Barabise onwards, massive landslides and bus plunges are not uncommon especially after rains. At the Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge, it connects with China National Highway 318 to Lhasa, and eventually to Shanghai. History The road was built in the 1960s with help from the Chinese on an older yak track. They also planned to expand the road in 2012, but keeping the route open was made more difficult by landslides from monsoons. The road became a conduit for a large amount of trade between China and Nepal, and also for some trade between India and China when it is open. Etymology The highway is named after Arniko, a 13th-century Nepalese architect who introduced Nepalese architectural styles to Tibet and China. It is said that he walked all the way from Tibet to China by a certain route which is now named after himself. Route Dhulikhel, about from Kathmandu and at an altitude of , is the last major town in the Kathmandu Valley through which the Araniko Highway passes. After Dhulikhel the road descends into the beautiful Panchkhal Valley. A road junction at Lamidanda, around 12 km from Dhulikhel, leads to Palanchowk where Palanchok Bhagawati Temple is situated. About five minutes' drive beyond the town of Panchkhal a dirt road takes off to the left, giving access to the Helambu region. About 8 km later the highway touches Dolaghat, a thriving town at the confluence of the Indravati and the Sun Kosi rivers and the departure point for many rafting trips. The turn-off to Jiri is another 14 km away, on the right. Lamosangu is a few kilometres after the Jiri turn-off, on the Arniko Highway. Next comes Barabise, the final destination for many buses from Kathmandu. Just before Barabise is the confluence of the Bhote Kosi and Sun Kosi rivers. The remaining part to the Nepal border village of Kodari the road runs alongside the Sun Kosi with extremely steep Himalayan mountainsides that are very prone to landslides during and immediately after rains (including monsoon). Beyond Kodari is the border town of Zhangmu in Tibet.

However, it is of limited use as an alternative route for transport of goods, as it is cheaper to ship Chinese goods via Kolkata than to truck them through China's Tibet region. These dynamics are subject to change with heavy road/rail building investment on the Tibet side. Closures The route was closed by the April 2015 earthquakes, but was re-opened in early August 2015. The route sustained heavy damage because of landslides triggered by the earthquake. In 2014 the highway was closed after landslides, but re-opened in September 2014. The landslide shut the route to Kathmandu for 46 days until a new alternate route could be built for Rs. 15.5 million. The landslides that closed it the summer of 2014 were called the Sunkoshi landslides, and the section of the highway near the Tibet border are especially prone to landslides.

The meaning of Dzodze. Dzodze is an Ewe language: Dzo = to fly. Dze = to land. Dzodze = flew and landed. According to the history, Torgbui Adzomefia's nephew Torgbui Amegayibor managed to cross the Aka river and settled on the part of the forest where his uncle Torgbui Adzomefia, and his people had already settled. During one of Torgbui Amegayibor's expeditions, he saw a cloud of smoke billowing from afar. He traced it to his uncle's village. He wondered how his uncle, and his family managed to cross the Aka River because he didn't see any human activity en route to the settlement. He asked his uncle, Torgbui Adzomefia, the means by which he got into the forest. This was the answer he got from his uncle; 'De mie dzo va dze.' we flew and landed. Hence the name Dzodze.

He was active in the civic and business communities of the city for more than five decades. Hill was president and chief executive officer of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, from 1973 to 1992, and was the first African American to be elected president of a chamber of commerce in a major city. During Hill's presidency of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company it became the largest black-owned life insurance company in the nation. He was a member of the board of directors for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Early life Born in 1926 in St. Louis, Missouri, to Nancy Dennis Martin and Jesse Hill, he grew up in a poor socio-economic background and attended public schools in St. Louis. He graduated from Lincoln University in Jefferson City with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 1947. He received his MBA from the University of Michigan in 1949. Career Hill's career in business began in 1949 when he moved to Atlanta, the center of African American entrepreneurship in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. He joined the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, one of the country's largest and most successful black-owned businesses, as assistant actuary; he was only the second African American actuary in the country. When he first moved to the city, Hill lived at the Butler Street YMCA in Atlanta, the headquarters of the city's black leadership during the period. He also volunteered for both the Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). During his first two decades with Atlanta Life, Hill became vice president and the chief actuary of the company. From 1973 to 1992, Jesse Hill Jr. was president and chief executive officer of Atlanta Life, becoming the company's third president and the first not to be a family member of Alonzo Herndon, Atlanta Life's founder. During Hill's tenure as chief executive, Atlanta Life experienced a significant period of growth. Total assets, revenues, profits, and shareholder value all surpassed previous levels. During the 1970s, Atlanta Life Insurance Co. was the largest privately held black business in the country, with 85 million dollars in assets. Hill and Atlanta Life Insurance Company worked to increase African American access to affordable home-mortgage financing in Georgia, Alabama, Texas, and Florida. Hill retired from Atlanta Life in 1995.  Black movement  In 1960, along with Herman J. Russell, Jesse Hill Jr. founded the black newspaper Atlanta Inquirer, the second black newspaper in Atlanta. During the 1950s and 1960s, Hill used his position of prominence in Atlanta's black business community to promote civil rights in Georgia and Alabama. In 1960 Hill, along with other young black leaders of the Atlanta Committee for Cooperative Action, including Grace Towns Hamilton and Whitney Young, produced a survey of Atlanta's black population entitled \\"A Second Look: The Negro Citizen in Atlanta.\\" This document challenged a common belief in Atlanta's white community that the city was a shining beacon for racial harmony in the South, \\"the City Too Busy to Hate.\\" As a member of the NAACP's education committee, Hill began recruiting black students to challenge segregation in Georgia's colleges and universities. He met with students Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter to discuss plans to desegregate Georgia State College (later Georgia State University). At Holmes's request, however, the plans were modified and efforts were focused instead at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens. Holmes and Hunter were ultimately the first two African American students admitted to UGA. Hill also organized successful voter registration drives in Atlanta. These efforts aided a campaign which eventually registered an estimated 50,000 new African American voters in Atlanta. Hill's company was also involved in activities to help black communities across the South. During the 1950s and 1960s, Hill raised money from employees at Atlanta Life and donated the funds to Martin Luther King Jr.'s efforts to promote civil rights. Hill also encouraged employees to donate their time in support of the civil rights movement. Atlanta Life's Montgomery office even employed Rosa Parks as a secretary during the Montgomery bus boycott, which she sparked. In 1970, as Muhammad Ali's career was on hiatus following his lawsuit against the federal government for refusing to enroll in the Army, Jesse Hill was instrumental in organizing his come-back fight in Atlanta on 26 October 1976. He used his political connections and set up the company House of Sports with Leroy Johnson and Harry Pett to organize the fight. This fight unlocked Ali's career and led to the organization of the Fight of the Century, underlining the influence power of Georgia's black politics. With Herman Russell, he bred the black \\"social worker types\\" to reach for more black representatives in local politics. This new black political class was eventually criticized as the \\"new old guard\\" since voters felt those new leaders forgot about the black cause once they had been sworn into office. In 1971, he became a partner of Maynard Jackson's law firm knowing that the young politician would soon run for the seat of mayor of Atlanta. The white community of Atlanta asked Hill to run against Jackson, but he refused. Hill ran political campaigns for Maynard Jackson, who became the first black mayor of Atlanta, as well as for congressman Andrew Young who later became United Nations ambassador. Governor Jimmy Carter selected Hill to chair the State Board of Regents in 1973. Following Carter's election as President, he chose Hill to chair the Minority Business Resource Center, a group created by Congress. Jesse Hill was the first black president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and the first black member of the Board of Directors for Rich's Department Store.  Education  Jesse Hill chaired the All-Citizens Registration Committee and helped to desegregate the Atlanta Public School system. During the 1990s, he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from his alma mater, the University of Michigan. In 2001, in recognition of contributions to the city, Butler Street in Atlanta was renamed in Hill's honor. Hill served on the boards of directors for eight major U.S. corporations, including Knight Ridder, Delta Air Lines, National Services Industries, and SunTrust, and was a founding director of MARTA, Atlanta's public transportation system. He has also served as the chairman of the board of directors for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Atlanta. He was involved in the development of wireless communications in Nigeria. Personal life Hill and his wife, Azira, have two children and several grandchildren. He was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. In Atlanta, Butler street was renamed Jesse Hill Junior drive after him.

The plot deals with prostitution. The film was first released in Italy in 1983. Plot synopsis Myst√®re is a high-class French prostitute who practices in Rome. Her friend and colleague Pamela steals a gold lighter from a German customer and hides it in her purse. The German and Pamela are mysteriously killed in rapid succession and Myst√®re is saved from an aggression only by the prompt intervention of Inspector Colt. Myst√®re and Colt come to a subtle understanding that will allow the pair to come to the fore of the international intrigue in which they find themselves involved. The German was in fact a photographer who had taken very compromising shots of an attack by the Soviet secret services on an American office in the Piazza di Spagna where a politician was assassinated. The microfilm from the camera was hidden in the lighter that ended up in Myst√®re possession. The beautiful prostitute discovers that her friend's killer, the photographer, is the head of Criminalpol, and manages to save Colt from them. Colt then kills his boss and decides to deal directly with the secret services to be able to obtain a large sum for the film and escape to make a new life with Myst√®re. An adventurous succession of events allows the inspector obtain a million dollars but the initial plan changes and Myst√®re is left behind. Myst√®re finds Colt in his golden exile in Thailand and instead of taking revenge, the couple fall in love. Not even the return of a secret agent, after the money from the film, spoils the new life they have made. Production The Vanzina brothers were inspired to make the film after seeing the 1981 French film Diva. The film is divided into chapters, starting with a prologue (the attack on the Piazza di Spagna filmed by the German photographer). The next 4 chapters represent the 4 days that followed in Rome where the events related to the microfilm in the lighter develop, and an epilogue (Myst√®re finds Colt). The latter was imposed on the authors by the producer Goffredo Lombardo. Carlo and Enrico Vanzina wanted a dry and cynical ending, but the producer opted for a happy ending. Location The film was shot in Rome including at the Hotel Sheraton, that opened that year, and the Villa Borghese underground car park. The externals of the epilogue were shot in Hong Kong.

Lack of such consent is presumed unless the operator proves the contrary. Processing of personal data for the purposes indicated above must be immediately ceased at the demand of personal data subject. 3.3 At the time of obtaining of personal data the operator is obliged, subject to request of an individual, to communicate to the latter information relating to the operator and the process of prospective processing. 3.4 If personal data is obtained not directly from a personal data subject, the operator prior to processing such information must provide the individual with the following information: 3.4.1 name and address of the operator or his representative; 3.4.2 purpose and legal grounds of personal data processing; 3.4.3 expected users of personal data; and 3.4.4 the rights of the individual in accordance with federal law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù dated 27.07.2006 No. 152-FZ. 3.5 Generally, it is prohibited to process in any way sensitive personal data of the individual, save for the cases where express written consent, containing all conditions provided for by the law, has been obtained from the individual prior to processing. 3.6 Generally, to transfer personal data outside the Russian Federation, the operator will have to make sure, prior to such transfer, that the rights of personal data subjects will enjoy adequate and sufficient protection in the country of destination. Until 1 September 2015 the position of Federal Service on Telecommunications the governmental body responsible for personal data protection was that adequate and sufficient protection exists only in those foreign states which signed and ratified Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data. Nevertheless, there are three major exceptions which permit transfer of personal data to the countries where lower or no standard of personal data protection applies, namely: * When transfer is necessary for performance of a contract to which an individual is a party * When a personal data subject gave his prior written consent, containing all conditions provided for by the law, to such transfer * When transfer is necessary for performance by the Russian Federation of its obligations under international agreement on readmission On 1 September 2015 a new \\"Article 18 (5)\\" came into effect more strictly limiting the export of data. 3.7 The Russian legislation imposes strict limitations on using of the electronic means of communication for direct marketing. Namely, express consent should be obtained from the individual before marketing communications are sent to him by email or SMS. Lack of such prior consent is presumed unless the sender proves the contrary. The law provides for immediate cessation of sending marketing communications at the individual‚Äôs short notice. It should be also noted that in Russia it is expressly prohibited to send emails or SMS messages using autodial. To send marketing communications by post, operator must obtain specific permission from the Federal Service on Telecommunications. Unfortunately the procedure of obtaining of such permission hasn‚Äôt been established yet. 3.8 Where personal data is processed it should be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed. 3.9 Personal data being processed shall enjoy confidential regime. It implies employment by the operator of sufficient technical and organisational means designed to prevent unauthorised access of any third parties to processed personal information. Procedures (including issuance of internal regulations or decrees) must be in place to regulate the process of access to such confidential information. 3.10 Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date where necessary. The operator is obliged to ensure accessibility of personal information for examination by personal data subjects at their request. In case such subjects find that this information is outdated or inadequate, the operator will be obliged to stop processing of such information until the required modifications are introduced. 3.11 Personal data should not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, which requires its destruction after such purposes have been fulfilled or in case their fulfillment is not required any more. 3.12 Personal data must be processed in accordance with the rights of personal data subjects under applicable data protection legislation. An operator will be in breach of this principle if, amongst other things, he: 3.12.1 contravenes the rights of access provisions set out in the legislation; 3.12.2 fails to comply with a request to cease processing within the time limit specified by the law or agreed on by the parties. Procedures must be in place to ensure that computer systems are configured appropriately to allow accurate recording of the giving of consents in all relevant cases, described herein. Procedures must also be in place to ensure that any notices or requests are responded to and dealt with promptly. 3.13 Appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data. Operators should consider appropriate measures to ensure data integrity (for electronic processing), including the installation of virus protection software and firewalls, adopting encryption for data transfers, using privacy enhancing technologies and making regular backups that are securely stored. For manual processing, consideration should be given to appropriate security measures, such as storage of paper records in lockable, fire-proof cabinets. 3.14 The relevant provisions require effective protection of personal data. Mandatory regulations on protection of such data are currently being developed by Federal Security Service (hereinafter, the ‚ÄúFSS‚Äù) to be issued within two months. For the moment, according to information received from FSS specialist during telephone consultation, FSS has a preliminary draft of the said regulations which may be modified as the final version of said regulations is to be issued within two months. The draft in its current version provides for protection of all personal data being transferred outside Russia in form of encryption. It is worth mentioning, that for the time being, it is practically possible to use only Russian encryption software and equipment for that purpose. Individual rights The legislation gives certain rights to personal data subjects in respect of personal data held about them. These include: 4.1 a right of access to information relating to operator and to the processed personal data; 4.2 a right to demand cessation of processing, blocking or modifying of the personal data which have been illegally obtained, are inadequate or outdated; and 4.3 a right to demand immediate cessation of processing for the purposes of direct marketing. Personal data categories The legislation describes certain personal data categories: 5.1 Public - personal data obtained only from publicly available personal data sources created in accordance with art. 8 of The Russian Federal Law on Personal Data (No. 152-FZ) 5.2 Biometric - information that characterizes the physiological and biological characteristics of a person on the basis of which it's possible to establish his personality and which are used by the personal data operator to identify the subject of the personal data. 5.3 Special - personal data relating to race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health condition, sexual life of personal data subjects. 5.4 Other - personal data that doesn't belong to any of the above categories (public, biometric, special). Notification Operators to whom Russian legislation applies are required to send notification to the territorial body of Russian Federal Service on Supervision over Mass Communications, Telecommunications and Preservation of the Cultural Heritage (hereinafter, the ‚ÄúFederal Service on Telecommunications‚Äù) for each region of Russia where he possesses personal information processing facilities. For Moscow it will be Moscow Department of the abovementioned federal service. Such notification is necessary for inclusion of the operator into specific Register and shall be made by the operators who have been processing personal information prior to enactment of the Federal law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù dated 27.07.2006 and continue to process it after its enactment prior to January 1, 2008. Those operators who haven‚Äôt been engaged in processing of personal information using their own or third party‚Äôs equipment located in Russia prior to enactment of the said law must send the notification before they actually start processing personal data. It is important that the said notification contain information provided for by the applicable legislation. Jurisdiction Scope of application of Russian Data Protection legislation: Russian laws apply when the operator uses his own or third-party data processing equipment located in Russia. As well as in cases where the data has been already transferred outside Russia, but there has been a violation of personal data subject‚Äôs rights prior to or during such transfer. If the data is transferred outside Russia duly, it will be subsequently regulated by the laws of country of destination and implications of Russian law will not apply thereto. In most cases, the Federal Service on Telecommunications only has jurisdiction in relation to data held or processed in Russia. Nevertheless, the legal implications of the Russian legislation on data protection will apply in respect of the data already transferred outside Russia in case the rights of individuals, whose personal data has been collected and processed using equipment located in Russia, have been violated prior to or during such transfer (e.g., an operator transferred personal data to a country where personal data don‚Äôt enjoy adequate protection without prior written consent of a data subject). In that case the Federal Service on Telecommunications may file lawsuits against operators to protect the rights of the personal data subjects and impose respective fines for violation of the data protection legislation.

England's King George II, for whom the colony was named, signed a charter establishing the colony and creating its governing board on July 7, 1732. His action culminated a lengthy process. Tomochichi was a Native American that resides along the Savannah River that allowed Oglethorpe to settle on the Yamacraw Bluff. The charter was granted to the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America, a group formed by James Oglethorpe. Oglethorpe envisioned the province as a location for the resettlement of English debtors and \\" worthy poor\\", although few debtors were part of the organized settlement of Georgia. Another motivation for the founding of the colony was to create a \\"buffer state\\" (border), or \\"garrison province\\" that would defend the southern part of the British colonies from Spanish Florida and French Mississippi. Oglethorpe envisioned a province populated largely by yeoman farmers who would secure the southern frontier of British America; because of this, as well as on moral grounds, the colony's regulations prohibited slavery. Oglethorpe's plan for settlement (now known as the Oglethorpe Plan) was founded on eighteenth- century country party philosophy and drew from principles of Roman colonial town design. The Georgia Charter Fleuron of the Georgia Charter The charter contained contradictions. The colonists were entitled to all the rights of Englishmen, yet there was no provision for the essential right of local government. Religious liberty was guaranteed, except for Roman Catholicism and Judaism. A group of Jews landed in Georgia without explicit permission in 1733 but were allowed to remain. The charter created a corporate body called a Trust and provided for an unspecified number of Trustees who would govern the colony from England. Seventy-one men served as Trustees during the life of the Trust. Trustees were forbidden by the charter from holding office or land in Georgia, nor were they paid. Presumably, their motives for serving were humanitarian, and their motto was Non sibi sed aliis (\\"Not for self, but for others\\"). The charter provided that the body of Trustees elect fifteen members to serve as an executive committee called the Common Council, and specified a quorum of eight to transact business. As time went on, the council frequently lacked a quorum; those present would then assume the status of the whole body of Trustees, a pragmatic solution not envisioned by the framers of the charter. Historian John McCain counted 215 meetings of the Common Council and 512 meetings of the corporation. Twelve Trustees attended the first meeting on July 20, 1732, at the Georgia office in the Old Palace Yard, conveniently close to Westminster. Committees were named to solicit contributions and interview applicants to the new colony. On November 17, 1732, seven Trustees bade farewell to Oglethorpe and the first settlers as they left from Gravesend aboard the Anne. The Trustees succeeded in obtaining ¬£10,000 from the government in 1733 and lesser amounts in subsequent years. Georgia was the only American colony that depended on Parliament's annual subsidies. The original charter specified the colony as being between the Savannah and Altamaha Rivers, up to their headwaters (the headwaters of the Altamaha are on the Ocmulgee River), and then extending westward \\"to the south seas.\\" The area within the charter had previously been part of the original grant of the Province of Carolina, which was closely linked to Georgia. South Carolina had never been able to gain control of the area, but after the Yamasee War the Georgia coast was effectively cleared of Indians, excepting a few villages of defeated Yamasee, who became known as the Yamacraw to distinguish them from the still-hostile Yamasee in Florida and among the Creek. Active trustees The most active members of the Trust, in terms of their attendance at council, corporation, or committee meetings, were, in order of frequency, James Vernon, John Perceval, Earl of Egmont, Henry L'Apostre, Samuel Smith, Thomas Tower, John LaRoche, Robert Hucks, Stephen Hales, James Oglethorpe, and Anthony Ashley Cooper, 4th Earl of Shaftesbury. The number of meetings attended ranged from Vernon's 712 to Shaftesbury's 266. Sixty-one Trustees attended fewer meetings. James Vernon, one of the original Associates of Dr. Bray and an architect of the charter, maintained an interest in Georgia throughout the life of the Trust. He arranged the Salzburger settlement and negotiated with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for missionaries. He differed from Egmont and Oglethorpe in his willingness to respond to the colonists' complaints. When Oglethorpe became preoccupied with the Spanish war, Vernon proposed the plan of dividing the colony into two provinces, Savannah and Frederica, each with a president and magistrates. The Trustees named William Stephens president in Savannah, and he served until 1751, when he was replaced by Henry Parker in the final year of the Trust's tenure. Oglethorpe neglected to name a president for Frederica, and the magistrates there were instructed to report to Stephens. The Trustees did not want to appoint a single governor because the king in council had to approve the appointment of governors, and the Trustees preferred to keep control in their hands. After Egmont's retirement in 1742, Vernon became the indispensable man. He missed only 4 of 114 meetings during the last nine years of the Trust and supervised the removal of restrictions on land tenure, rum, and slavery. Egmont, the first president of the Common Council and the dominant figure among the Trustees until his retirement, acted as Georgia's champion in Parliament. He strongly opposed Walpole's attempts to conciliate Spain at the expense of Georgia. He had to walk a careful line, however, because the Trustees depended upon Walpole for their annual subsidies. Other Trustees contributed according to their abilities. Henry L'Apostre advised on finances, Samuel Smith on religion, and Thomas Tower on legal matters, particularly on instructions to Georgia officials. Stephen Hales's closeness to the royal family and his standing as a scientist lent prestige to the body of Trustees. Shaftesbury, a political opponent of Walpole, joined the Common Council in 1733 and, except for a brief resignation, remained faithful to the end. He led the negotiations to convert Georgia to a royal colony. For the entire twenty years the Trustees employed only two staff members, Benjamin Martyn as secretary and Harman Verelst as accountant. Georgia Indians in London Tomochichi with Georgia Trustees, by William Verelst Oglethorpe returned to England in June 1734 with goodwill ambassadors in the persons of Yamacraw chief Tomochichi, Senauki, his wife, their nephew Toonahowi, and six other Lower Creek tribesmen. The Indians were regarded as celebrities, feted by the Trustees, interviewed by the king and queen, entertained by the archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace, and made available to meet the public. All but two of them posed with a large number of Trustees at the Georgia office for the painter William Verelst. One of the absent Indians died of smallpox, despite the ministrations of the eminent physician Sir Hans Sloane, and was buried by his grieving comrades in the burial plot of St. John's in Westminster. After performing their social obligations, the Indians became tourists, visiting the Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral, Oglethorpe's Westbrook Manor, and Egmont's Charlton House, and enjoying a variety of plays, from Shakespearean dramas to comic farces. Salzburgers, Moravians and Highlanders The Indians departed on October 31, 1734. With them went fifty-seven Salzburgers to join the forty-two families already in Georgia at Ebenezer. In 1734 and 1735 two groups of Moravians went to Georgia. As pacifists they opposed doing military duty and left Georgia by 1740. After delivering the Indians and Salzburgers to Georgia, Captain George Dunbar took his ship, the Prince of Wales, to Scotland. Dunbar and Hugh Mackay recruited 177 Highlanders, most of them members of Clan Chattan in Inverness- shire. In 1736 the Highlanders founded Darien on Georgia's southern boundary, the Altamaha. Dunbar subsequently served as Oglethorpe's aide in Georgia and in Oglethorpe's campaign against the Spanish in 1745. Oglethorpe went to Georgia in 1736, with the approval of his fellow Trustees, to found two new settlements on the frontiers, Frederica on St. Simons Island and Augusta at the headwaters of the Savannah River in Indian country. Both places were garrisoned by troops. In 1737 Oglethorpe returned to England to demand a regiment of regulars from a reluctant Walpole. Not only did he get his regiment and a commission as colonel, but Egmont persuaded Walpole to pay for all military expenses. Trustee legislation and reactions In 1735, the Trustees proposed three pieces of legislation to the Privy Council and had the satisfaction of securing the concurrence of king and council. An Indian act required Georgia licenses for trading west of the Savannah River. Another act banned the use of rum in Georgia. A third act outlawed slavery in Georgia. South Carolina protested the Indian act vehemently and objected to the Trustees' order to restrict the passage of rum on the Savannah River. The Board of Trade sided with South Carolina, and a compromise was reached, allowing traders with Carolina licenses to continue their traditional trade west of the Savannah River. The Trustees objected to the Board of Trade's tampering and refrained from proposing any additional legislation requiring approval of the Privy Council. Continual complaints by the colonists and the near abandonment of Georgia during the war with Spain discouraged all but the most dedicated of the Trustees. Especially embarrassing was the list of grievances presented on the floor of Parliament by Thomas Stephens, son of the Trustees' agent in Georgia, William Stephens. A committee went through the motions of looking into the complaints and then exonerated the Trustees. Stephens was made to kneel in apology on the floor of Parliament. However, the prestige of the Trustees had been wounded, and their influence in Parliament weakened. Walpole lost office in 1742, and the new administration declined the Trustees' request for funding. Egmont resigned in protest, but not all the Trustees gave up. Under the leadership of Vernon and Shaftesbury, the Trustees conciliated the administration, and the government renewed the annual subsidies until 1751, when the Trustees' request was again denied. Oglethorpe returned from Georgia in 1743 and never again showed the same enthusiasm for the work of the Trust. He disagreed with the relaxation of the ban on rum in 1742 and with the admission of slavery in 1750. He engaged in an unfortunate argument with the Trustees over expenses. The accountant claimed that he owed the Trust ¬£1,412 of funds used for military purposes for which he had been compensated. Oglethorpe countered that the Trustees owed him far more than that amount. No agreement was reached. Oglethorpe attended his last meeting on March 16, 1749. End of Trustee rule In March 1750 the Trustees called upon Georgians to elect delegates to the first representative assembly but cautioned them only to advise the Trustees, not to legislate. Augusta and Ebenezer each had two delegates, Savannah had four, and every other town and village had one. Frederica, now practically abandoned, sent no delegate. Sixteen representatives met in Savannah on January 14, 1751, and elected Francis Harris speaker. Most of the resolutions concerned improving trade. The delegates showed maturity in requesting the right to enact local legislation, and they opposed any annexation effort on the part of South Carolina. The Trustees intended to permit further assemblies, but the failure of Parliament to vote a subsidy in 1751 caused the Trustees to enter into negotiations to turn the colony over to the government a year before the charter expired. Only four members of the Trust attended the last meeting on June 23, 1752, and of the original Trustees only James Vernon persevered to the end. The earl of Halifax, the new president of the Board of Trade, secured broader powers and infused new life into the administration of the board. He regretted that the colonies had been neglected for so long, and he intended to make Georgia a model colony and an example to others. Thus Georgia passed from the control of one set of gentlemen of Parliament to another.

Its population was at first divided about exactly how to respond to revolutionary activities and heightened tensions in other provinces. When violence broke out in 1775, radical Patriots (also known as Whigs) took control of the provincial government, and drove many Loyalists out of the province. Georgia also served as the staging ground for several important raids into British-controlled Florida. Beginning of the revolution Lyman Hall was the sole Georgia delegate to attend the Continental Congress. Though Georgians opposed British trade regulations, many hesitated to join the revolutionary movement that emerged in the American colonies in the early 1770s and resulted in the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì83). The colony had prospered under royal rule, and many Georgians thought that they needed the protection of British troops against a possible Indian attack. Georgia did not send representatives to the First Continental Congress that met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1774. The Congress asked all colonies to form a group, called the Association, to ban trade with Great Britain. Georgia delegates gathered in a provincial congress in Savannah on January 18, 1775, to discuss whether to join the Association, and to elect representatives to the Second Continental Congress. Those who were elected declined to go to Philadelphia, however, because the delegates were divided on the action to be taken. St. John Parish, acting alone, sent Lyman Hall to the Second Continental Congress.Edward J. Cashin. \\"Revolutionary War in Georgia\\" (March 26, 2005). New Georgia Encyclopedia.

News of the battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts caused many Georgians who were wavering in their allegiance to join the radical movement. A group called the Sons of Liberty broke into the powder magazine in Savannah on May 11, 1775, and divided the powder with the South Carolina revolutionaries. Though Georgians continued to drink to the health of the king, they took government into their own hands when the Second Provincial Congress met in Savannah on July 4, 1775. The Congress named delegates to the Second Continental Congress, which was already sitting in Philadelphia, and adopted the Association's ban on trade with Britain. The single most important democratic action of the Congress was the establishment of local committees to enforce the Association's ban. Thus political power devolved upon artisans and farmers, considered by royal governor James Wright to be the \\"wrong sort\\" to be allowed in government. The Congress adjourned, leaving executive authority in a standing Council of Safety. Violence in the backcountry The heavy- handed tactics of the local committee in Augusta led to the first violence in the backcountry. On August 2, 1775, members of the committee confronted Thomas Brown at his residence on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River above Augusta. Brown had come to Georgia with seventy or so indentured servants in November 1774 in answer to Governor Wright's advertisement of the advantages of the newly Ceded Lands above Augusta and founded a settlement called Brownsborough. He attracted the anger of the Whigs by publicly denouncing the Association and summoning friends of the king to join a counterassociation. When he refused to swear to honor the Association, the crowd of Liberty men tortured him in various ways, scalping and fracturing his skull, burning his feet, and hauling him, unconscious, through the streets of Augusta as an object lesson to those who would denounce the Association. When he recovered, Brown retired into the Carolina backcountry, where he and other leaders enlisted hundreds of Loyalists and threatened a march on Augusta. After much marching about and some skirmishing around the town of Ninety Six, Brown and his friends heeded South Carolina governor Sir William Campbell's advice to await the arrival of the British. Brown retreated to East Florida and persuaded its governor, Patrick Tonyn, to allow him to recruit a corps of rangers who would lead Indians to fight on the frontiers in conjunction with the expected landing on the coast. Meanwhile, rumors of a British-instigated plot to enlist slaves and Indians to help defeat the American patriots alarmed Georgians and Carolinians. Though false, the rumors were generally believed, and John Stuart, the Indian Commissioner, fled in fear for his life from Charleston, South Carolina, to Florida. Battle of the Rice Boats Colonel (later General) Lachlan McIntosh British warships that arrived in the Savannah River in January 1776 caused the first crisis in Savannah. The Council of Safety, convinced that Savannah was to be the object of a British attack, placed Governor Wright under house arrest and instructed Colonel Lachlan McIntosh to take charge of the defense of the city. There followed the so- called Battle of the Rice Boats on March 2‚Äì3, 1776, when British marines seized rice-laden merchant ships in the Savannah harbor, some of which the militia burned. In fact, the object of the British fleet was the acquisition of provisions for the beleaguered army besieged in Boston. The fleet sailed off with some of the rice and with the fugitive Governor Wright and his chief councilors. In the absence of the governor, the next provincial congress met in Augusta and proceeded to draft a simple framework of government called \\"Rules and Regulations\\" that went into effect on May 1, 1776. The congress elected Archibald Bulloch president and commander in chief of militia. George Walton joined Lyman Hall and Button Gwinnett as Georgia delegates to the Philadelphia convention in time to sign the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Three invasions of Florida By August, Major General Charles Lee, military commander in the South, allowed himself to be persuaded by Georgians to stage an invasion of British East Florida. Lee had little hope of conquest, but he thought the military demonstration might impress the Indians. Unfortunately, he was recalled to the North, taking his Virginia and North Carolina troops with him, and the expedition got no farther than Sunbury, just south of Savannah, when South Carolina ordered her militia to return. Georgians under Lachlan McIntosh, who was recently promoted to brigadier general, skirmished with the Florida Rangers and their Indian allies on the Satilla River and then abandoned the southern borderlands. Congress recommended that the newly independent states adopt a permanent frame of government. Accordingly, Georgians elected delegates to a state constitutional convention that met in October 1776 in Savannah. Radical leaders of local committees dominated the convention and produced one of the most democratic constitutions of any state. The electorate included all men over twenty-one who possessed property worth ten pounds or were employed as artisans. A one- house assembly enacted legislation, and elected the governor, judges, and other officials. Georgia's constitution, adopted on February 5, 1777, created the state's first counties: Burke, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, Liberty, Richmond, and Wilkes, all named for friends of the colonies in British Parliament, except Liberty, a title that honored St. John Parish's early zeal for American rights. Button Gwinnett acted as speaker of the convention. He and his fellow radical Whigs suspected many conservative Whigs of being secret Tories. Gwinnett's arrest of George McIntosh, the brother of General Lachlan McIntosh, fueled animosity between radical and conservative Georgians. At the height of the controversy, Gwinnett decided upon an invasion of Florida. Gwinnett considered himself commander in chief of the Georgia militia and refused to cooperate with General McIntosh, who commanded the brigade of Continental soldiers. After the failure of the expedition, the two principals quarreled about which one was to blame. They fought a duel, both were wounded, and Gwinnett died. The radical Whigs raised such a cry against McIntosh that Congress transferred him out of Georgia for service under General George Washington at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The first two failures did not dissuade Georgians from a third attempt upon Florida in 1778. This time Governor John Houstoun commanded the Georgia militia, Major General Robert Howe the Continentals, and General Andrew Williamson the Carolina militia. The expedition suffered from the same lack of coordination that doomed the previous assault on the southern borderlands. Howe's regulars managed to drive Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Brown and his East Florida Rangers from Fort Tonyn on the St. Marys River. The Georgia militia skirmished with the Rangers and a company of Royal Americans on Alligator Creek. With that limited success, the invaders returned to Georgia. Other than the three abortive invasions of Florida and the patrolling of the western frontier, the Whigs accomplished little during the first three years of independence except survival. However, they gained experience in self-government and a determination not to surrender their new independence, and that was no small achievement. The Indians would have created greater havoc in the backcountry as the result of the instigations of John Stuart and Thomas Brown, but for the efforts of Continental Indian Commissioner George Galphin. Galphin used his enormous influence to persuade many of the Lower Creeks to remain neutral. Return of the British Army By 1778, the war in the North had reached a stalemate. The British high command decided to try a southern strategy. Southern governors like Sir James Wright had assured Lord George Germain, the American Secretary in Britain, that hundreds of Loyalists bided their time in the backcountry, waiting for the king's troops. General Sir Henry Clinton in New York ordered Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell to invade Georgia with 3,000 troops, and to restore the state to British rule, thus setting an example for the restoration of other former colonies. Prior to Campbell's attack upon Georgia, General Augustine Pr√©vost conducted a cattle raid into the lower Georgia counties. As a diversion, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Fuser demonstrated against Fort Morris at Sunbury. When Fuser demanded the surrender of the fort, its commander, Lieutenant Colonel John McIntosh bravely answered, \\"Come and take it!\\" Fuser withdrew and Georgia honored McIntosh as a hero. On December 28, 1778, Campbell's army landed unopposed on a bluff below Savannah, advanced through the swamps by an unguarded path, and overwhelmed General Robert Howe's defenders of Savannah. Campbell waited until January 12 for the arrival of Prevost's Royal Americans and Brown's Rangers from Florida, and on January 24 began a march with Brown's Rangers to Augusta in the backcountry. Except for a skirmish at the Burke County courthouse involving Brown's Rangers, Campbell was unopposed. Some ninety of George Galphin's slaves sought their freedom from Campbell and were escorted to Savannah. Campbell took possession of Augusta on January 31, 1779. The southern strategy seemed to be successful when 1,400 men came into Augusta to sign up in the royal militia. However, the British Indian allies were badly delayed, and on February 14 several hundred Loyalists were cut off at Kettle Creek in Wilkes County by South Carolinians under Andrew Pickens and Georgians under Elijah Clarke and John Dooly. Alarmed by the approach of 1,200 North Carolinians under General John Ashe, Campbell withdrew from Augusta on the same day as the Battle of Kettle Creek. Ashe's troops, Samuel Elbert's Georgia Continentals, and Andrew Williamson's South Carolina militia followed the retreating British. On March 3 the British, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Mark Prevost, turned upon the Americans and routed them at the Battle of Brier Creek. If Kettle Creek ensured the continued independence of upper Georgia, Brier Creek meant that the lower part of the state returned to British rule. Campbell named Prevost acting governor until Sir James Wright's arrival. Campbell then took passage for England, having succeeded in his pledge to remove a star from the American flag. With the regaining of military control, elected representative civil government was restored to the Georgia colonial Assembly through the British writs of 1779, and remained as a functioning body until the evacuation of Governor Sir James Wright in 1782. General Benjamin Lincoln marched his Continentals to Augusta to support the organization of civil government there, whereupon General Augustine Prevost threatened an attack upon Charleston, drawing Lincoln down with all haste. Whig government in Augusta On July 10, 1779, an ad hoc committee met in Augusta and appointed some of its members to a \\"Supreme Executive Council,\\" whose purpose was to run the government until January, when a full assembly could meet. The Supreme Executive Council held its first meeting on July 24, and the following month the council elected John Wereat president. Wereat, a friend of the McIntoshes, had denounced Georgia's constitution as too radical. Militia colonel George Wells, who served on the committee that drafted the constitution and acted as Gwinnett's second in the fatal duel, refused to recognize Wereat's council and called for regular elections. In October, Major General Benjamin Lincoln ordered George Walton to go to Augusta, hold an election, and create a constitutional government in order to qualify for a subsidy from the Continental Congress. Walton did so, thereby joining Wells and the radical faction. Elections were held and an assembly met in late November. They chose Walton as governor. Wereat's Supreme Executive Council refused to recognize Walton's administration, so war-ravaged Georgia endured two Whig governments in Augusta and one royal regime in Savannah at a time when it could hardly afford one government. In the most controversial action of his short-lived administration, Governor Walton dispatched a letter to Congress asking for the second removal of General Lachlan McIntosh from Georgia. McIntosh had returned to the state during the summer to take charge of Georgia's Continental forces, but he resided at the house of a suspected Tory, Andrew McLean. The Assembly passed the resolution, but the Speaker, William Glascock, left Augusta before the clerk transcribed the letter. Walton never denied signing Glascock's name, and he sent another letter under his own name. However, Wereat and other friends of McIntosh's would later carry on an acrimonious investigation of the \\"forged letter\\" incident. The radical faction dominated the new Assembly that met in January 1780. The delegates elected Richard Howley governor and delegate to Congress. The Assembly enacted legislation providing for the rapid growth of the backcountry, including a commission government for Augusta, a new town to be named Washington in Wilkes County, and generous land grants for entrepreneurs who would construct ironworks, grist mills, and sawmills. Howley and Walton traveled as delegates to Philadelphia, and George Wells, president of the executive council, acted as governor. The irascible Wells soon became embroiled in a quarrel with Major James Jackson, a friend of John Wereat's. They fought a duel, and Wells died. Thus the two leaders of the radical faction in Georgia, Gwinnett and Wells, were killed in duels. They launched Georgia, however, on a democratic course that had lasting effects on the state's history. Siege of Savannah Attack on Savannah by A. I. Keller Governor Sir James Wright returned to Georgia on July 14, 1779, and announced the restoration of Georgia to the crown, with the privilege of exemption from taxation. Thus Georgia became the first, and ultimately the only one, of the thirteen states in rebellion to be restored to royal allegiance. Governor Wright had hardly settled to his duties when on September 3, 1779, a French fleet of twenty-five ships appeared unexpectedly off the Georgia coast. Count Charles Henri d'Estaing intended to oblige George Washington by stopping off on his way back to France to recapture Savannah. He disembarked his army of 4,000-5,000 men at Beaulieu on the Vernon River and proceeded to besiege Savannah. Major General Benjamin Lincoln hurried over from South Carolina with his army to join in the siege. D'Estaing demanded the surrender of Savannah on September 16, but General Augustine Prevost asked for twenty-four hours to give an answer. During that day, Lieutenant Colonel John Maitland brought 800 British regulars in from Beaufort, South Carolina, to bolster the British defenses. Then Prevost declined to surrender. On October 9, 1779, the allies launched a grand assault upon the British lines and suffered 752 casualties, while the British defenders lost only 18 killed and 39 wounded. Count Casimir Pulaski, a Polish nobleman who had volunteered to fight for the cause of liberty, died at the head of the men he led. Sergeant William Jasper, a hero of the 1776 Battle of Sullivan's Island, also died. The battered French army withdrew to its ships, and Benjamin Lincoln's troops returned to Charleston. Fall of Charleston Encouraged by the British defense of Savannah, General Sir Henry Clinton brought his army down from New York, made Tybee Island his base, and began the siege of Charleston. Lincoln failed to escape when he might have, and surrendered the city and its defenders on May 12, 1780. Clinton then returned to New York, leaving General Lord Cornwallis in charge of the subjugation of the South. Cornwallis sent units to take command of the backcountry posts, including Augusta, Camden, and Ninety Six. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Brown assumed command in Augusta. On July 10, 1780, the Royal Council in Savannah declared that peace had been restored in Georgia, and so it seemed, with a British garrison in Savannah under Lieutenant Colonel Alured Clarke, and British posts in the backcountry. Some Whigs refused to surrender, however, and sought refuge in the mountain country. Two battles of Augusta Gangs of marauders roamed the region between Savannah and Augusta. More important, Lieutenant Colonel Elijah Clarke came down from his haven in North Carolina, rallied 600 men who had taken a recent oath of allegiance to the king, and attacked Augusta on September 14, 1780. In a desperate four-day battle Clarke besieged Brown and his Rangers and Indian allies at the Mackay House outside town. Lieutenant Colonel John Harris Cruger and his New York Loyalists from Ninety-Six came to the relief of Brown's garrison. Though tradition blames Brown for hanging thirteen prisoners, Cruger probably gave the order to carry out the punishment mandated by Cornwallis for those who took up arms after swearing allegiance to the king. Clarke beat a hasty retreat to North Carolina, hounded by Indians and Loyalists. Cornwallis dispatched a force of Loyalists under Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Ferguson to cut off Clarke's band. Instead, Clarke's friends from the mountains swarmed down under their own leaders, caught Ferguson on Kings Mountain, and scored a decisive victory on October 7, 1780. Clarke's raid upon Augusta triggered the events that led to Kings Mountain. Alarmed by the resurgence of the Whigs under leaders like Clarke, Benjamin Few, and John Twiggs, Brown constructed Fort Cornwallis on the grounds of St. Paul's Church. In April Clarke returned to the Georgia backcountry to harass Loyalists and threaten Augusta. Major General Nathanael Greene, the new Continental commander in the South, ordered General Andrew Pickens and his South Carolina militia, and Lieutenant Colonel Henry \\"Lighthorse Harry\\" Lee with his legion, to join Clarke in besieging Augusta. Lee captured valuable stores at Galphin's plantation at Silver Bluff, and with Pickens and Clark, began the siege of Augusta on May 22, 1781. In the course of a two-week battle, Lee's engineers constructed a wooden tower from which a cannon could reach the interior of Fort Cornwallis. Brown had no choice but to surrender on June 5, 1781. The capture of Augusta gave American peace negotiators in Paris reason to demand the independence of Georgia even though Savannah remained in British hands for the ensuing year. Whig government restored For the first time in more than a year, the scattered members of the legislature reassembled in Augusta on August 17 and elected Nathan Brownson governor for the remainder of the year. General Greene authorized the creation of 100 horse and 100 foot under the title of the \\"Georgia State Legion\\" with Lieutenant Colonel James Jackson in command. On January 9, 1782, Greene dispatched Brigadier General Anthony Wayne to Georgia with a regiment of dragoons. General Wayne conducted a war of attrition against the British defenders of Savannah. Andrew Pickens carried the war to the Cherokees and John Twiggs's Georgians fought against the Creeks. On January 2, 1782, the legislature elected John Martin governor. He issued a proclamation pardoning all loyalists who pledged to support independence by joining the Georgia Legion or the militia. On May 4, 1782, the legislature passed the Confiscation and Banishment Act, declaring 277 people guilty of treason, and seizing their property. The property of Loyalists who had left the state was also confiscated. Governor Wright bitterly criticized the British military for not supporting the royal cause in Georgia. On June 4, 1782, he staged an elaborate celebration in Savannah to honor the king's birthday and to keep up the spirits of Georgia Loyalists. On June 14, 1782, however, Wright received orders from General Sir Guy Carleton to evacuate Savannah. Thomas Brown had recruited a new regiment of rangers, and on May 19, skirmished with Lieutenant Colonel James Jackson's Legion in the marshes outside Savannah. At Wright's request, Brown had sent a last, desperate appeal to the Upper Creeks to come to his aid. On June 23, the noted Creek leader Emistisiguo fought through the American lines to reach Savannah. Though most of his band joined Brown, Emistisiguo was killed. Evacuation of Savannah The British evacuated Savannah on July 11, 1782. Lieutenant Colonel James Jackson had the honor of leading Wayne's victorious troops into the city. Governor Martin convened the Georgia Assembly in Savannah on July 13, 1782. As many as 2,000 white Georgians and twice that number of blacks resettled in British East Florida. About 400 whites and 5,000 blacks migrated to Jamaica, where Sir Archibald Campbell, who had restored Georgia to the crown, served as governor. The Loyalists in Florida had hardly settled to their new life when they learned that the peace treaty of 1783 returned Florida to Spain. There occurred another mass migration to the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the other islands of the West Indies, as well as to Great Britain. On January 7, 1783, the Georgia General Assembly elected Lyman Hall governor. John Twiggs, now raised to the rank of general in the Georgia militia, and Elijah Clarke continued to harass the Cherokee and Creek Indians to insure the possession of land, the great object of the revolution for many Georgians. News of the signing of the preliminary peace treaty reached Savannah in late May 1783 and caused a general celebration. The newly independent state of Georgia, though poor in every other respect, claimed a virtual empire of territory reaching to the Mississippi River, which was disputed by the Creek Indians, who actually possessed the land.

It is the western terminus of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's Framingham/Worcester commuter rail line, with inbound service to Boston, and a station along Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited passenger line. It also services Peter Pan and Greyhound intercity bus routes as well as local Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRTA) bus service.  History  The 1875-built Union Station in 1906 The current station was built in 1911 by the New York Central Railroad along the Boston and Albany Railroad Main Line, during the heyday of railroading in the United States, replacing the previous 1875 station. As a union station, it also served the Providence and Worcester Railroad (which was acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad or 'New Haven'), the Norwich and Worcester Railroad (acquired by the New York and New England Railroad), the Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad and the Boston, Barre and Gardner Railroad (which both became part of the Boston and Maine Railroad). Up to the late 1960s the New York Central ran the New England section of the Wolverine route to Chicago through southwestern Ontario and Detroit and the New England States. The daytime New York City - Maine East Wind (B&M; with the New Haven Railroad) ended in 1955. The overnight New York City - Maine State of Maine (B&M;/NH) used the routing until October 29, 1960. The last pre-Amtrak service, on April 30, 1971, was an unnamed Penn Central successor to the New England States. Passenger service to Union Station lapsed between 1971 and 1975, and the abandoned station fell into disrepair. Union Station, circa 1920Subsequently, Union Station was acquired by the Worcester Redevelopment Authority and completely renovated at a cost of $32 million. The station was restored and renovated by Finegold Alexader Architects of Boston, and re-opened in July 2000.http://faainc.com/projects/union-station-intermodal-transportation/ An intercity and local bus terminal, with five bus ports, was added at a cost of $5.2 million and opened in August 2006.Worcester, MA - Union Station/Washington Square Project Union Station's facilities include the Grand Hall, with original elliptical stained-glass ceilings, interior marble columns and mahogany wood trim, Luciano's Cotton Club, a 1920s gangster-themed restaurant, and the Union Station Parking Garage, which has 500 spaces and direct access to the station. The Cannabis Control Commission established their state headquarters in Union Station in 2019. There are proposals to extend more frequent passenger service west to Springfield. Second platform Union Station is accessible and has a single high-level side platform several cars long. It is the only station on the line (other than the three limited-service Newton stations) that can only be served by one train at a time - all other stations have two side platforms or an island platform. This limits the number of daily trains that can serve Worcester, and causes frequent cascading delays. After years of discussion about adding a second platform and extending the side platform to full length, the MBTA approved a two-year, $4 million design contract in October 2018. Design reached 30% in August 2019. The -long island platform will have an accessible footbridge at its east end, and stairs and an elevator into a converted storage room to provide direct access from the station building. A crossover east of the station will also be built. The full length of the new platform will have a canopy. Construction is estimated to cost between $40 and $48 million. , construction is expected to last from November 2020 to November 2022 if funding is found. A temporary platform east of the I-290 overpass would be used while the west half of the new platform is constructed; the west half would then be used while the east half is built. Bus connections Greyhound Bus Lines and Peter Pan Bus Lines operate intercity bus service from Worcester along major highways.

It serves as the centre of the railway's operations. Since the Foxfield Railway is a former industrial railway, there were no passenger stations on the line originally. The Foxfield Light Railway Society The society was formed in 1967 to preserve any railway artifacts irrespective of their origins and to operate them on the line that originally connected the former Foxfield Colliery in Dilhorne, Staffordshire, with the Stoke on Trent to Derby line of the former North Staffordshire Railway at Blythe Bridge. The Society became a Company, Limited by Guarantee in 1972. It was granted Charitable Status by the Inland Revenue at that time. It has no Shareholders and each Full Member has a liability limited to ¬£5. From January 2009 it has been registered with the Charity Commissioners as a Registered Charity in its own right and as a former constitution. In 1995 after 28 years of operation, the Company was awarded a Light Railway Order SI1995 No 1236 under the Light Railways Act 1896. This gave it Statuary Powers as defined in the Instrument to build and operate a railway and buildings. Before this time it had simply taken over the \\"grandfather rights\\" of its former owners. An important reference in the Order is to the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845. This empower the company to erect such buildings and structures as necessary for the operation of its line, without having to seek planning permission from the local authority. The Company has operated on a volunteer basis since 1967, but some paid staff also work. History of the line The line is standard gauge (1435mm) and was originally constructed in 1893, with left-over materials from the North Staffordshire Railway, over part of a route intended to join the market town of Cheadle (North Staffordshire) and its collieries with the North Staffordshire Stoke to Derby line at Blythe Bridge. This line was never completed over the current route and the Foxfield Colliery Company built the line itself over private land. Historically it appears that some of the line near the colliery was laid on the path of a former plateway or tramway. The line crosses two public roads, one using an under bridge, the other on the level. It was these crossings which ultimately defined that the LRO would be required in order to comply with the Transport and Works Act, 1992. The characteristic features that set this line apart from others are its many steep gradients and sharp curves. These are unique amongst heritage lines and it is these features which also provide it with unique operational difficulties and skill needs. Gradients on the line range from 1:950 to 1:19 making it one of the steepest heritage railways in the country.

After their defeat at Fontenoy in May, the Duke of Cumberland, Allied commander in Flanders, was under pressure from the Austrians to defend Brussels. He also wanted to protect the key port of Ghent, a major supply depot threatened by the French advance into West Flanders. Cumberland compromised by employing his main force to cover Brussels, while sending 4,000 men under the Hanoverian general Moltke to reinforce Ghent. On the way, it ran into a French detachment under General du Chai, positioned near the town of Melle to prevent such an attempt; the Allies were driven off with heavy losses and Ghent surrendered on 13 July. Preliminary maneuvers After the French victory at the battle of Fontenoy and the capture of the city of Tournai, Marshal Saxe began to exploit the weakness of the allies and maneuvered so as to threaten Brussels and Brabant, Ghent and Flanders forcing the Duke of Cumberland, over-all commander of the Allies, to choose which places to defend.Skrine, Francis Henry. Fontenoy and Great Britain's Share in the War of the Austrian Succession 1741‚Äì48. London, Edinburgh, 1906, p. 226. Of the allies' two major magazines, Ghent and Brussels, Ghent was of more value as the supplies there had been reserved while those in Brussels had been used. However, Cumberland decided to defend Brabant and Brussels with the field army while sending some troops to increase the garrison of Ghent and issuing orders to transport the supplies out of Ghent.Fortescue, J. W. A History of the British Army, MacMillan, London, 1899, Vol. II, p. 122. Saxe sent Du Chayla on a reconnaissance in force to Melle, a small town between Ghent and the town of Aalst. His command consisted of two infantry brigades, Normandie and Crillon, each consisting of four battalions; a detachment of Grassins, light infantry, and three brigades of cavalry: Berry, Royal √âtranger and Du Roy, some twenty four squadrons.Screen, J.O.E., The Action at Melle 9 July 1745, Society for Army Historical Research. Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research..., Volume 77, Issues 309‚Äì312, London, 1999, p. 89. There were about twenty small battalion guns and twenty pontoons in a camp being established on and around the road that ran between the town of Aalst and Ghent. Parts of the Normandie brigade, some two battalions, were dispersed in various posts along the Scheldt and the road to Ghent as was the some of Crillon. Du Chayla sent his light troops, the Grassins, towards Aalst to reconnoitre. Moltke had orders from Cumberland to throw as many troops as possible from Aalst into Ghent to reinforce the garrison. Moltke's force was made up of a brigade commanded by Brigadier Thomas Bligh of three British infantry regiments:Townshend, Charles, Townshend, Sir Charles Vere Ferrers. The military life of Field-Marshal George first marquess Townshend ... p.74, seems to indicate that there were four British regiments and includes the Welsh Fusiliers 23rd Foot. Skrine puts the 23rd already in Ghent. Most sources of the time show only 3 British regiments. the Royal Scots, or 1st Foot; Bligh's 20th Foot and Handasyde's 16th Foot;There has been some confusion as to which regiment this is as there were two Handasyde's: the 16th ‚Äì Roger Handasyde and the 31st ‚Äì William Handasyde; most cite it as the 16th. three squadrons of a British cavalry regiment, Rich's 4th Dragoons; two squadrons of Hanoverian cavalry: one of the Leib-Regiment and one of Adelebsen's Dragoons; five or six squadrons of Dutch cavalry from Slippenbach's Dragoons; and two or three squadrons of Austrian cavalry: de Ligne's and Styrum's DragoonsThe Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. XV, July, 1745, London, pp. 362‚Äì363 and some 300 Austrian Hussars.Screen, J.O.E., The Action at Melle 9 July 1745, Society for Army Historical Research.

Screen gets Cumberland's 10 squadrons by not counting any of the Austrians, which are a minimum of 4 (2 Dragoon, 2 Hussar) for a total of 14 squadrons, however, Bligh's letters give 7 to Moltke and, at least 7 or 8 (\\"five or six squadrons of the Dutch..\\") to his force in his letter from Dendermonde and 5 squadrons to Styrum and Ligne in his letter from Aalst. Furthermore, Bligh's Dendermonde letter states: \\"... with the Hanoverian squadrons that joined us that day (the 9th)...\\". 16 or 17 squadrons would seem the most likely total.

Moltke sent the Royals to drive them off and a vigorous fire-fight broke out, but without artillery the Royals were unable to dislodge de Grassin and his men. The 1st Foot then rejoined the rest of the force and it was decided by Moltke, without informing Bligh,Screen, J.O.E., The Action at Melle 9 July 1745, Society for Army Historical Research.

Du Chayla's force was fairly dispersed in various posts along the route and in the process of making camp. The twenty artillery pieces were in park along the road facing north, baggage wagons and pontoon wagons in rows behind them. A stone bridge on the road crossing the Gontrode Brook, a stream that flowed into the Scheldt, was unguarded and a walled priory flanking the road only lightly occupied. One battalion of the Normandie brigade was posted in the town of Melle another well to the west of Melle. The battalions of Crillon brigade were also dispersed around the area, some taking post or billeting in the various chateaus and farm houses with one battalion astride the road west of the bridge.Digitalisierungsprojekt Wilhelmsh√∂her Kriegskarten (WHK) Map of the Battle of Melle.

Moltke, with the Royal Scots, led the advanced guard column of about 1,700 troops consisting of some 650 infantry of the Royal Scots and about 1,050 cavalry. They crossed the bridge, charged and dispersed the Crillon battalion commencing the action at about 7 p.m.. They then rushed up the road and overran the artillery park briefly capturing the guns. However, as the guns were unlimbered in park, not for action, the Royals were unable to use them against the French. The Duc de Laval and his battalion of the Crillon brigade then came up behind the pontoons and wagons engaging the Royal Scots soon to be followed by two more battalions led by Le Marquis de Crillon .

Bligh gives the cavalry as 8 to 10 squadrons. The ground around the road was unfavorable to the cavalry of both sides and would not permit full deployment with the French firing from front and flank, so Bligh fell back to better position in a field south of the road behind the Gontrode Brook rivulet with most of his center and his left behind some woods and his right on the raised causeway on the other side from priory. This covered him from the fire of a couple of companies of French grenadiers behind the wall of the priory and gave him a defensible front of rough terrain that prevented any cavalry actions. The regiments formed a line of battle with the cavalry in support advancing on and engaging the French that came up. Du Chayla counter-attacked, perhaps now five battalions: Laval, two of Crillon and two of Normandie from Melle, about 2,000 strong, with a battery of artillery and most of the French cavalry in support. While the two sides were locked in a fire-fight, the Grassins that had been bypassed by the allies earlier in the day now arrived in Bligh's rear capturing all the baggage and supplies and cutting the line of retreat down the road to Aalst.Letter Brigadier Bligh to HRH Cumberland, 10 July 1745. Bligh reports his equipment losses and includes some casualties: 129 missing from the 20th, \\"Handysides 160 men and three officers killed and two wounded.\\" Bligh, seeing that he was now in danger of losing his whole force, withdrew at about 9 p.m., in some disorder, through the woods and fields to the south-east, staying off the road until he was near to Aalst where he arrived with considerable loss, including all the baggage.Letter Brigadier Bligh to HRH Cumberland, 10 July 1745.

In this way, the ship can operate independently in severe ice conditions without icebreaker assistance but retain better open water performance than traditional icebreaking vessels.Juurmaa, K et al.: The development of the new double acting ships for ice operation. Kvaerner Masa- Yards Arctic Technology, 2001 and 2002 . Double acting ships carrying liquid cargo are generally referred as double acting tankers. In the early 1990s Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology Centre (MARC) developed the concept for oil transportation between the Russian Arctic and Europe and the first double acting tanker, Finnish crude oil tanker Tempera, was delivered in 2002.Mastera/Tempera , Neste Oil.  History  In the early 1990s, studies conducted by Kvaerner Masa-Yards showed that the ship's open water efficiency is as important factor as its ability to operate in difficult ice conditions in oil transportation from the Russian Arctic to Europe. This was due to the fact that on a direct route 90% of the time would be spent in open water. Direct independent transportation with a vessel capable of navigating in both ice and open water was also found out to be a more economical alternative in comparison with transshipment, i.e. the use of different vessels for different parts of the journey, or normal ships relying on icebreaker assistance. Although icebreaking cargo ships had been built in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water performance and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather. However, a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance, making it unsuitable for icebreakers.Juurmaa, K et al.: New ice breaking tanker concept for the arctic (DAT) . Kvaerner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology, 1995.Kujala, P and Riska, K: Talvimerenkulku (TKK-AM-13). Department of Applied Mechanics, Helsinki University of Technology, 2010. As a result, the total efficiency of icebreaking ships is 20‚Äì40% less than that of good open water vessels of similar size mainly due to the bow form. In the late 1800s, captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. Although not known at the time, this was because the forward-facing propellers generated a lubricating water flow that lowered the ice resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice.Aker Arctic Technology Inc.: Icebreaking Supply Vessels Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg . However, as the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but in the more severe Arctic ice conditions they could not be used because the risk of the bow propellers being damaged by multi-year ice floes was too great. Furthermore, forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and they considerably increase the ship's open water resistance, making them unsuitable for merchant ships.  Development  Because of the limitations of traditional propulsion systems, the double acting ship concept wasn't seriously considered until the development of electric podded propulsion units which combine the advantages of the diesel-electric powertrain, already widely used in icebreakers, with the excellent manoeuvrability of azimuth thrusters. Initially developed as a co-operation between the multinational electrical equipment corporation ABB Group and the Finnish shipbuilder Masa-Yards in the late 1980s, the new propulsion unit became known as Azipod (a portmanteau of \\"azimuth thruster\\" and \\"podded propulsion unit\\") which is today a trademark of ABB Group. The superiority of electric podded propulsion in icebreaking ships, especially when running astern, was proved when the first propulsion pod was installed on fairway maintenance vessel Seili, owned by the Finnish Maritime Administration, in 1990. Before the conversion the ship could not break ice astern at all, but after the propeller and rudder were replaced with a 1.5 MW Azipod unit she could run astern in level ice as thick as . The vessel could also easily be steered when running astern in ice. When product tankers Uikku and Lunni were converted to Azipod propulsion in 1993 and 1994, respectively, the result was similar increase in manoeuvrability and icebreaking capability. Even though the ships were originally designed with icebreaking capability in mind, after the conversion ice resistance in level ice when running astern was 40% of that when breaking ice ahead despite the ships being equipped with an icebreaking bow and not designed to break ice astern. Model tests conducted by MARC in 1994 showed that a double acting ship equipped with an Azipod propulsion unit could break through ice ridges in continuous motion instead of ramming like conventional icebreakers. It also required less power for running in level ice than traditional designs, resulting in 40‚Äì50% reduction in ice resistance due to lubricating effect of propeller-induced water flow, more open stern design and the propellers being allowed to mill (crush) the ice. The icebreaking capability of an Azipod-equipped icebreaker operating astern in level ice was also found out to be superior to traditional icebreakers regardless of propulsion arrangement.  Double acting ships   Icebreakers and other special vessels  The first double acting icebreaking vessel, Azipod-equipped river icebreaker R√∂thelstein, was delivered in 1995. The vessel was designed to break apart ice ridges deeper than the vessel's draft when moving astern. It was followed by icebreaking platform supply vessels Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg, delivered in 1998, that were the first vessels to fully utilize the double acting ship concept by having the bow designed for operation in open water and light ice conditions. The vessels were designed to be capable of breaking level ice up to one meter in thickness when running astern and, with the help of two Azipod units, penetrate ice ridges that in the Caspian Sea sometimes reach to the seabed. The Norwegian Coast Guard operates a double acting offshore patrol vessel KV Svalbard, built in 2002 and equipped with two 5 MW Azipod propulsion units. On 9 July 2007, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had announced that Canada would be building six to eight patrol vessels based on Svalbard. However, since the announcement, the design has progressed from an Azipod-equipped double acting ship to a more traditional shaft-driven version. Icebreaking supply and standby vessel SCF Sakhalin, delivered in 2005 as FESCO Sakhalin, was the first large-scale double acting icebreaker. The vessel, propelled by two 6.5MW Azipod propulsion units, is designed to break level ice up to thick and ice ridges with a consolidated layer.FESCO Sakhalin - Icebreaking supply and standby vessel . Aker Finnyards. She has since been followed by six vessels based on the same hull form and built at the same shipyard for the offshore operations in the Sea of Okhotsk: platform supply vessels Vitus Bering in 2012, Aleksey Chirikov in 2013 and Gennadiy Nevelskoy in 2017, and standby vessels Stepan Makarov, Fedor Ushakov, and Mikhail Lazarev in 2017. The owner of these vessels, Sovcomflot, also operates three icebreaking platform supply vessels of slightly different design that are capable of breaking ice in astern direction.

In 2001 Fortum ordered two double acting Aframax tankers from Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan, to replace the company's older tankers that, because of their lower ice class, had traffic restrictions during the worst part of the winter and could not deliver their cargo all the way to the refineries in Porvoo and Naantali because they were not given icebreaker assistance. When this happened, the oil had to be transported to smaller ships of higher ice class at the edge of the ice ‚Äî a practice that was both uneconomical and hazardous. The new ships are equipped with one pulling-type 16 MW Azipod unit and have the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super. They are designed to be capable of independent navigation and icebreaking in Baltic ice conditions with a possibility to operate also in the Pechora Sea. The ships follow the double acting principle with a bulbous bow for open water performance and stern designed with icebreaking performance in mind. The first double acting tanker, Tempera, was delivered in 2002 and its sister ship, Mastera, in 2003.

Freighters  The next generation of double acting ships emerged when the Russian mining company Norilsk Nickel ordered a prototype of a series of arctic general cargo/container ships intended to replace its ageing fleet of SA-15 class cargo ships that were built in Finland in the 1980s. Unlike the tankers, the Arc7 ice class ship was designed to have excellent icebreaking capability, 2 knots in level ice with a thickness of 1.5 meters, both ahead and astern. The ship, Norilskiy Nickel, was delivered from Hietalahti shipyard in 2006 and performed beyond expectations during ice trials in the Yenisei Gulf. Four additional ships, with an option for fifth, were ordered in 2007 from Aker Yards's shipyards in Germany, with deliveries in the second half of 2008 (Monchegorsk, Zapolyarny and Talnakh) and early 2009 (Nadezdha).Norilsk Nickel: Publications , 2006-07-17. Norilsk Nickel: Norilsk Nickel completed creation of its own arctic fleet, 2009-02-26. Later an oil tanker derivative of the same design was constructed by Nordic Yards. On 22 March 2011 Gaiamare, a subsidiary of Meriaura, ordered a double acting multipurpose cargo ship designed especially for demanding projects such as transporting wind turbines to offshore installations. The new vessel, Meri, was built by STX Finland Turku shipyard and delivered in June 2012. The environmentally friendly ship, designed to run on biofuel, can also be used in oil spill cleanup ‚Äî the vessel can be equipped with skimmers and has 2,700 m3 of tanks for recovered oil. The diesel-electric propulsion with two Siemens Schottel Z-drive thrusters and two bow thrusters allows the ship to maneuver and even move sideways at low speeds, considerably increasing the oil recovery rate.STX Finland Turun telakalle erikoisalustilaus.

GHIs classify a type of global initiative, which is defined as an organized effort integrating the involvement of organizations, individuals, and stakeholders around the world to address a global issue (i.e.: climate change, human rights, etc.). Examples of GHIs are the President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and the World Bank's Multi- country AIDS Programme (MAP), all of which focus on HIV/AIDS. The Gavi (formerly the GAVI Alliance) focuses on immunization, particularly with respect to child survival. GHI Functions In terms of their institutional structure, GHIs have little in common with each other. In terms of their function ‚Äì specifically their ability to raise and disburse funds, provide resources and coordinate and/or implement disease control in multiple countries ‚Äì GHIs share some common ground, even if the mechanisms through which each of these functions is performed are different.Biesma R., Brugha R., Harmer A., Walsh A., Spicer N. and Walt G.

The Global Fund, established in 2002, and the GAVI Alliance, launched in 2000, are public-private partnerships that raise and disburse funds to treat AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and for immunization and vaccines. The World Bank is an International financial institution. It is the largest source of funding for HIV/AIDS within the United Nations system and has a portfolio of HIV/AIDS programmes dating back to 1989.By way of comparison, UNAIDS' Unified Workplan 2010/11 has a budget of $US484m over the two-year period. Of this, $US136.4m (the interagency fund), is set aside to pay for country level activities and staff In 2000, the Bank launched the first phase of its response to HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äì the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP). This came to an end in 2006 when a second phase ‚Äì Agenda for Action 2007-11 ‚Äì came into effect.Sophie Harman (2007) The World Bank: Failing the Multi-Country AIDS Program, Failing HIV/AIDS.

Political Economy of GHIs  The amount of political priority given to Global Health Initiatives varies between national and international governing powers. Though evidence shows that there exists an inequity between resource allocation for initiatives concerning issues such as child immunization, HIV/AIDS, and family planning in comparison to initiatives for high-burden disorders such as malnutrition and pneumonia, the source of this variance is unknown due to lack of systematic research pertaining to this subject. Global political priority is defined as the extent to which national and international political leaders address an issue of international concern through support in the forms of human capital, technology, and/or finances in order to aid efforts to resolve the problem. Global political priority is demonstrated through national and international leaders expressing sustained concern both privately and publicly, political systems and organizations enacting policies to help alleviate the issue, and national and international agencies providing resource levels that reflect the severity of the given crisis. The amount of attention a given global initiative receives is considerably dependent on the power and authority of actors connected to the issue, the power and impact of ideas defining and describing the issue, the power of political contexts framing the environments in which the actors operate to address the issue, as well as the weight and power of issue characteristics indicating the severity of the issue (i.e.: statistical indicators, severity metrics, efficacy of proposed interventions, etc.). Factors including objective measurability, scalability of the issue and proposed interventions, ability to track and monitor progress, risk of perceived harm, as well as simplicity and affordability of proposed solutions all contribute to the degree to which a given global initiative is likely to receive political attention. However, case studies have shown that the likelihood of global initiatives garnering public and political attention is not limited to the aforementioned factors. For example, initiatives concerning polio eradication continue to receive substantial resources in spite of the relatively small global burden of disease as compared to chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and some communicable diseases such as pneumonia which comparatively attract fewer worldwide resources irrespective of the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with such diseases. These cases highlight the need for extensive research methods and evaluative measures to assess the relative causal weights of factors used to determine how global political priority is attributed to global health initiatives. Existing debates also attribute factors such as the increasing influences of economic globalization, international organizations, and economic actors with little to no previous health remit as each contributing to the evolution of global health governance. Impact of GHIs on Country Health Systems There is much discussion about the extent to which the volume of these additional funds creates multiple effects that positively and/or negatively impact both health systems and health outcomes for specific diseases. Assessing the direct impact of GHIs on specific diseases and health systems poses challenges pertaining to the issue of attributing particular effects to individual GHIs. As such, a common response in evaluations of GHIs is to acknowledge the inherent limitations of establishing causal chains in what is a highly complex public health environment, and to base conclusions on adequacy statements resulting from trends that demonstrate substantial growth in process and impact indicators. However, existing literature argues that this approach towards evaluating GHIs can inadvertently result in overlooking the impact of social determinants on a disease, as implementers and evaluators are less likely to tackle the complexity of a disease within the larger social, political, cultural, and environmental system. Even if a GHI is effectively evaluated‚Äì perhaps showing a decrease in disease prevalence‚Äì the challenge remains of comprehensively analyzing the long-term impacts of the GHI by addressing the root social, political, or environmental causes of the disease. Accordingly, existing debates suggest that GHIs should be less concerned with the eradication of specific diseases, and should instead focus primarily on factors‚Äì such as basic living conditions, sanitation, and access to nutritious food‚Äì that are essential to delivering a sustainable heath program. Research on the effects of GHIs A small number of institutions have shaped, and continue to shape, research on GHIs. In 2003, researchers at Abt Associates devised an influential framework for understanding the system- wide effects of the Global fund which has informed much subsequent research, including their own studies of system-wide effects of the Global Fund in Benin, Ethiopia, Georgia and Malawi - often referred to as the 'SWEF' studies.Bennett S. and Fairbank A, The system-wide effects of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria: A conceptual framework, Oct 2003, Partners for Health Reformplus and Abt Associates Inc. Document summaries and links to each of the SWEF studies are accessible through the Global health Initiatives Network database Abt continues to support ongoing research on the effects of GHIs in multiple countries. The Washington-based Center for Global Development has also been very active in its analysis of GHIs, particularly PEPFAR financing. The Center's HIV/AIDS Monitor is essential reading for researchers of GHIs. With hubs in London and Dublin, the Global Health Initiatives Network (GHIN) has been coordinating and supporting research in 22 countries on the effects of GHIs on existing health systems. Knowledge of the effects of GHIs on specific diseases and on health systems comes from multiple sources.Longitudinal studies enable researchers to establish baseline data and then track and compare GHI effects on disease control or country health systems over time. In addition to Abt Associates' SWEF studies, additional early examples of this type of analysis were three-year, multi-country studies of the Global Fund in Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.Brugha et al (2005) Global Fund Tracking Study: A Cross-country Comparative Analysis, LSHTM, London. PDFs of each country study is accessible through the GHIN database In 2009, research findings were published from tracking studies in Kyrgyzstan, Peru and Ukraine that sought to identify the health effects of the Global Fund at national and sub-national levels. In contrast to longitudinal studies, multi-country analyses of GHIs can provide a ‚Äòsnapshot‚Äô of GHI effects but are often constrained by ‚Äúaggressive timelines‚Äù.Interactions between Global Health Initiatives and Health Systems: Evidence from Countries. The Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium, June 2009, p6. The Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium, for example, reported in 2009 on the effects of the Global Fund and PEPFAR on disease control and health systems, drawing on data from 20 countries.World health Organisation Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group, An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. Lancet 2009, 373:2137-69 Most GHI evaluations ‚Äì both internally and externally commissioned ‚Äì rely on this type of short-term analysis and, inevitably, there is often a trade-off between depth and breadth of reporting. Synthesis of data from multiple sources is an invaluable resource for making sense of the effects of GHIs. Early synthesis studies include a 2004 synthesis of findings on the effects of the Global Fund in four countriesBrugha et al (2004) The Global Fund: Managing Great Expectations, Lancet, 364:95-100 by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), a 2005 study by McKinsey & CompanyGlobal health Partnerships: Assessing Country Consequences, 2005, McKinsey and Co. and an assessment of the comparative advantages of the Global Fund and World Bank AIDS programs.Shakow A.

The Lancet 373, June 20th pp2137-2169 and a study by researchers from LSHTM and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The latter study - The effects of global health initiatives on country health systems: a review of the evidence from HIV/AIDS control ‚Äì reviewed the literature on the effects of the Global fund, the World Bank MAP and PEPFAR on country health systems with respect to: 1) national policy; 2) coordination and planning; 3) stakeholder involvement; 4) disbursement, absorptive capacity and management; 5) monitoring & evaluation; and 6) human resources (Table 2). Evaluations of GHIs In a comparison between the three largest donors in sponsoring efforts to win the fight against AIDS in Africa, a research study found that PEPFAR performs best in money transfer and data collection; the Global Fund outperforms in tailoring programmatic initiatives and sharing data; and MAP performs highest in collaborating with government systems, strengthening health systems, and helping to build the capacity of local recipients.Oomman, Nandini, et al. Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia. Center for Global Development, HIV/AIDS Monitor, 2007, p. xvii, Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia, www.popline.org/node/199919. Each of the four GHIs summarized has been evaluated at least once since 2005 and all four produce their own annual reports. World Bank MAP The primary purpose of the MAP initiative was to introduce a major upscaling of multi-sectoral approach to responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa by involving a multitude of stakeholders including community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), line ministries, and state governments at the highest levels. A comprehensive study of MAP programs published in 2007 reviewed whether MAP was implemented as designed, but did not evaluate MAP or assess its impact. In addition, there have been two evaluations that provide important additional insight into the effectiveness of the Bank's HIV/AIDS programmes (though not specifically MAP focused). In 2005, the Bank conducted an internal evaluation - Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistance - which found that National AIDS strategies were not always prioritised or costed. Supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E;), were weak; civil society had not been engaged; political commitment and capacity had been overestimated, and mechanisms for political mobilisation were weak; and bank research and analysis, whilst perceived to be useful, was not reaching policy makers in Africa. In 2009, a hard-hitting evaluation of the Bank‚Äôs Health, Nutrition and Population support ‚Äì Improving Effectiveness of Outcomes for the Poor in Health, Nutrition and Population ‚Äì found that a third of the Bank‚Äôs HNP lending had not performed well, and that while the performance of the Bank‚Äôs International Finance Corporation investments had improved, accountability was weak. Global Fund Unlike many implementing agencies, the Global Fund has no presence in the countries it supports; rather it is a financial mechanism which provides funding to countries in the form of grants through a Secretariat in Geneva on the competitive basis of country proposals. Special emphasis is placed on proposals demonstrating country ownership as well as those that meet other evidence-based, performance-based, and inclusivity-based criteria. A five-year, comprehensive evaluation of the Global Fund published a synthesis report in 2009 of findings from three Study areas. The Fund‚Äôs Technical Evaluation Research Group (TERG) Five Year Evaluation (5YE) of the Global Fund drew on data from 24 countries to evaluate the Fund‚Äôs organisational effectiveness and efficiency, partnership environment and impact on AIDS, TB and Malaria. The Evaluation highlighted the possible decline in HIV incidence rate in some countries, and rapid scale up of funding for HIV/AIDS, access and coverage, but also identified major gaps in support for national health information systems, and poor drug availability.Macro International Inc. 2009, The Impact of Collective Efforts on the Reduction of Disease Burden, Global Fund FiveYear Evaluation: Study Area 3, Submitted to the Global Fund, Macro International Inc., Maryland. GAVI Alliance Though GHIs have been instrumental in bringing national and international attention to crucial global health issues, existing debates suggest that they can also negatively impact country health systems. As such, disease-specific GHIs such as GAVI have worked to integrate health system strengthening (HSS) measures into programmatic implementation. However, the existing global debate questions the efficacy of HSS programs aimed at targeting technical solutions with clear measurable outcomes versus those more broadly focused on supporting holistic health systems.Katerini T. Storeng (2014) The GAVI Alliance and the ‚ÄòGates approach‚Äô to health system strengthening, Global Public Health, 9:8, 865-879, DOI: 10.1080/17441692.2014.940362 In 2008, an evaluation of GAVI‚Äôs vaccine and immunization support - Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 performance - reported increased coverage of HepB3, Hib3 and DTP3 and increased coverage in rural areas but also a lack of cost data disaggregated by vaccine that prevented GAVI from accurately evaluating the cost effectiveness of its programs and vaccines, and an ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù reliance by GAVI on the market to reduce the cost of vaccines.Chee G., Molldrem V., Hsi N. and Chankova S. (2008) Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 Performance. Abt Associates Inc. p15 The same year, a study of the financial sustainability of GAVI vaccine support - Introducing New Vaccines in the Poorest Countries: What did we learn from the GAVI Experience with - found that although GAVI funding equated to $5 per infant in developing countries per year for the period 2005-10, resource need was accelerating faster than growth in financing. Findings from two evaluations of GAVI‚Äôs support for health systems strengthening (HSS) were published in 2009. An external evaluation by HLSPGAVI Health Systems Strengthening Support Evaluation: Key Findings and Recommendations found insufficient technical support provided to countries applying for GAVI grants, an under-performing Independent Review Committee (IRC), and weaknesses in GAVI‚Äôs monitoring of grant activities. The study also found that countries were using GAVI grants for ‚Äòdownstream‚Äô short-term HSS fixes rather than ‚Äòupstream‚Äô and long-term structural reform. A study by John Snow, Inc praised the multi-year, flexible and country-driven characteristics of GAVI HSS grant funding and encouraged GAVI to continue this support. But also found weak M&E; of grant activity, low Civil Society involvement in the HSS proposal development process, unclear proposal writing guidelines, and over-reliance by countries on established development partners for assistance in implementing health system reform.Plowman B. and Abramson W. (2009) Final Synthesis Report - Health Systems Strengthening Tracking Study GAVI RFP00308. JSI Research and Training Institute, Inc. and In-Develop IPM. PEPFAR A quantitative study by Stanford University in 2009 ‚Äì The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes ‚Äì calculated a 10.5% reduction in the death rate in PEPFAR‚Äôs 12 focus countries, equating to 1.2 million lives saved at a cost of $2450 per death averted. In 2007, an evaluation of PEPFAR by the Institute of Medicine found that PEPFAR had made significant progress in reaching its targets for prevention, treatment and care but also reported that budget allocations \\"limit the Country Teams ability to harmonize PEPFARs activities with those of the partner government and other donors\\", and PEPFARs ABC (Abstinence, Be faithful, and correct and consistent Condom use) priorities \\"fragment the natural continuum of needs and services, often in ways that do not correspond with global standards\\". The PEPFAR program has brought about substantial impact in its recipient countries. The level of urgency and scale of initiatives led through the PEPFAR program were commensurate with that of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the time of implementation. Existing debates suggest that the next phase of the program consider placing emphasis on the development of knowledge surrounding HIV/AIDS programming.

The settlement allows the owner or lessee to get their instrument cluster replaced under the terms of a special coverage adjustment to their factory standard warranty. Background As early as 2005, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had received complaints concerning erratic speedometer and gauge readings from numerous makes and models of GM vehicles.National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Defects Investigation No deaths or injuries were ever attributed to the erratic gauges, but owners of the vehicles felt the problem was a safety concern. In 2007, Kevin Zwicker filed suit against General Motors in U.S. District Court in Seattle seeking three types of compensation:Seattle Times, March 2, 2007 # Replacement of all speedometers on the affected models # Reimbursement for anyone who already paid to have a defective speedometer replaced # Reimbursement for anyone who paid speeding tickets and whose auto insurance rates rose due to a defective speedometer John Hall filed a nearly identical suit in U.S. District Court in Oregon after paying the out of warranty repair cost to replace the instrument cluster in his 2003 GMC Envoy LE. Both Zwicker and Hall were represented by Beth Terrell, an attorney with the Seattle law firm of Tousley Brain Stephens. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, who decided to certify the lawsuit as a class- action. Terms * If the vehicle is within 7 years or 70,000 miles (110,000 km) of the date it was first placed in service, GM must replace the instrument panel (parts and labor) for free. * If the vehicle is within 7 years and between 70,001 miles (110,001 km) and 80,000 miles (130,000 km) of the date it was first placed in service, GM must replace the instrument panel (parts) for free. Any labor costs will be the responsibility of the vehicle owner. Owners who paid for repairs to the speedometer before the class action settlement are eligible for reimbursement under the following terms: * If the speedometer failed and the vehicle is within 7 years had less than 70,000 miles on it, upon proper proof of claim GM will reimburse the cost of repairs (parts and labor) up to the limit of what a GM dealership would have charged. * If the speedometer failed and the vehicle is within 7 years and had more than 70,000 miles but less than 80,000 miles on it, upon proper proof of claim GM will reimburse the cost of the part only (no labor).

The company maintains corporate headquarters in York and principal offices in Atlanta, London, Milan, and across Europe. Piksel formerly went by the name of KIT digital until filing for bankruptcy in April 2013. Upon emerging from bankruptcy in August 2013, the company changed its name to Piksel. History In late 2007, Kaleil Isaza Tuzman purchased a controlling interest in ROO Group and became the company's CEO and chairman of the board.\\"Roo Group: Kaleil Tuzman Named Chairman And CEO\\", PaidContent ROO Group changed its name to KIT digital in 2008 after financial restructuring of the company. KIT digital embarked on a growth by acquisition strategy and quickly acquired a number of players in the digital media IP video industry. In 2008 they acquired, Sputnik Agency, Visual Connection, Kamera and Morpheum. In 2009, Narrowstep,\\"KIT digital Acquires the Assets of Broadband TV Provider Narrowstep\\" Nunet, The FeedRoom and Juzou. KIT digital was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market in August 2009 under the ticker \\"KITD\\". The key acquisitions facilitated KIT digital to become one of the largest video software and service providers in the world. In September 2009 KIT digital moved its global headquarters from Dubai, UAE to its European head office and technical operations hub in Prague, Czech Republic citing the European zone now represented in excess of 50% of the company's revenue stream. In 2010 the company bought the Atlanta-based live event broadcaster Multicast Media Technologies and later went on to buy more broadcast and media asset management companies including Benchmark Broadcast Systems, Megahertz Broadcast Systems, Accela Communications and Brickbox Digital Media. By October that year, KIT digital was estimated to control 25% of a $500 million market for Internet video-management software. In January 2011 they spent approximately 77.2 million dollars to purchase three social software and video companies, Kewego,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/exclusive-kit-digital- acquires-kickapps-kewego-and-kyte-for-77-2-million/ KickApps, and Kyte and KickApps CEO Alex Blum was appointed to the new position of Global COO of KIT digital to manage worldwide operations.

The 2009, 2010 and 2011 years and 1Q12 and 2Q12 will be restated; KITD says investors should no longer rely upon previously issued statements for those periods. The company says an event of default exists in a secured loan facility that has 11 mln. USD outstanding; that its cash balance has dwindled to US$10.6 mln., and that cash burn is expected to continue. As a result, KIT is exploring \\"a broad set of strategic alternatives,\\" including financing deals (virtually guaranteed to be dilutive) and a sale. It's also cancelling its 2012 shareholder meeting. Shares traded more than 50% down in after hours trading. The company announced on December 10, 2012, that it has received notice from NASDAQ, because it has not yet filed 3Q results with the SEC. The company no longer complies with the continued listing requirements under Nasdaq. The NASDAQ stock market announced on December 11, 2012, that trading of NASDAQ:KITD shares was halted. KITD announced on April 16, 2013 that it would file for bankruptcy on April 24 with a debt plan supported by three of the largest shareholders.

He was apprenticed as a woodworker in the UK in 1965 at the age of 15. He moved to the US in 1984 and quickly became noted for his ability in traditional woodworking. He has and continues to teach people the craft of woodworking. He taught at the Homestead Heritage Woodworking School in Texas. During his time at the School he designed, and made with a team of craftspeople, cabinets for the White House. He started the New Legacy School of Woodworking that provides short courses. Sellers is author of Working Wood which was published in 2011 and Essential Woodworking Hand Tools which was published in 2016. He then moved to premises at the Sylva Wood Centre in Long Wittenham, near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. Recently Sellers moved to larger premises in an industrial unit in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Sellers has established a considerable worldwide presence and following on YouTube, on his blog (PaulSellers.com) and on his two websites (Common Woodworking and Woodworking Masterclasses) where he shares his long experience of woodworking with hand tools, with current and future generations. Sellers has 428,000 subscribers on YouTube as of 9th of July 2020. He experienced a formal English woodworking apprenticeship, which had a high degree of hand-tool use. One of his aims is to preserve disappearing knowledge and his experience of hand-tools. He presents an approach to woodworking that is deliberately both inclusive and affordable, favouring restoring good quality, common, affordable, long lasting, old tools. This provides an option to premium new tools or inferior, modern copies, or expensive specialist tools. His no-nonsense insights and advice carry the credibility of his 50 plus years as a Master Craftsman woodworker, working in the UK and USA. Sellers has many YouTube videos on his channel as well as a supporting website and blog. Notable episodes include several on saw sharpening from beginner to advanced, chisel preparation, a comparison/demonstration of modern bevel-edged chisels and vintage \\"pig- sticker\\" mortice chisels, \\"rag-in-a-can oiler\\", restoring planes, setting up planes, setting up and using old wooden planes and series such as building your own workbench/stool/toolchest and his series of videos showing how to make \\"Poor man's\\" versions of various tools. Sellers seeks to provide inspiration and instruction for a diverse new generation of woodworkers, of all ages, both amateur and professional. Sellers has mentioned in various contexts that he considers himself an amateur in the sense that he does this for the love of the craft, it is more than a profession to him, it is his life style and his life. Indeed, on his blog, PaulSellers.com, and elsewhere he describes himself as \\"a lifestyle woodworker\\". He is creating a woodworking knowledge base legacy for all. Sellers is noted for increasing the price of secondhand hand-tools whenever he discusses them, on his blog, or uses them, on YouTube, as more people learn how to restore, set-up and use them and appreciate them. Most notably the Cinderella of woodworking hand-tools, the router plane; once unsellable, these tools are now much sought-after and often command prices of ¬£100 or more. The humble and ubiquitous #4 plane is also once again valued and sought-after. Consequently, he can also be credited with saving many old tools from being discarded or scrapped.

Originally built in the foreign-controlled Shanghai International Settlement, it is now run by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. Throughout the first forty or so years of its life it was the largest prison in the world and earned a reputation as the \\"Alcatraz of the Orient\\". Ward Road Gaol period (1903‚Äì1941) Tilanqiao Prison was built to hold those convicted of crimes in Shanghai's International Settlement. Prior to its construction foreign convicts were held in ad hoc prisons within their consulates (or, if British, the Amoy Road Gaol) until they could be returned to their home country, and Chinese citizens were handed over to the native Chinese authorities. In 1901, however, with the growing size of the International Settlement and, in the aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion, a fear the Qing government could no longer control its citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Council drew up plans for a modern-style jail based on Singaporean and Canadian designs. Construction began at 117 Ward Road that year, with the first prisoners introduced to their cells on 18 May 1903. Originally comprising 450 cells across two four-storey blocks, the prison was expanded after the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, when the previously Chinese-run courts of the Settlement were abandoned by the Qing government and occupied by the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP). Further extensions took place in 1916 and continued until 1935 when the prison reached a grand total of some 70,000 square metres (17 acres), including six prison blocks, a juvenile block, a hospital, an administration block, workshops, a kitchen and laundry, and an execution chamber, all surrounded by a wall with guard-towers. The execution chamber is considered unique in pre-Second World War China in that it carried out death by hanging, with the body dropping through a trapdoor directly into the prison hospital's morgue. Over the years specialist rooms were added to the prison, including 'isolation rooms' with rubber wallpaper, and a secure command centre for regrouping in event of a riot. The prison population comprised a mix of Chinese and European males found guilty by the Settlement's consular courts (though some European countries preferred not to send convicts to Ward Road Gaol, instead transferring them to prisons in their home countries or other colonies). Female Chinese convicts were only interned in Ward Road between 1904 and 1906, after which they were sent to female prisons elsewhere in the province. European women were housed in a Foreign Women's Block, but this closed in 1922 and women were placed in the French Concession's prison. In 1925 a decision was made to no longer imprison Western convicts at Ward Road, instead sending them to the Settlement's Caucasian-only prison: Amoy Road Gaol. Between 1925 and 1930 Ward Road Gaol was therefore a prison predominantly housing Chinese prisoners, controlled and run by a predominantly British and Indian staff. In 1930 Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government negotiated for all male prisoners, Western or Chinese, to be sent to Ward Road Gaol and for it to be run as close to Chinese guidelines as possible. This was agreed in theory, though the British staff were unwilling to enforce Chinese discipline as provided in the guidelines, as this was considered harsh - even by the prison's own rough standards. For its existence, Ward Road Gaol has been considered one of the harshest in the world. Silence was enforced at all times and overcrowding was rife. In 1934 there were only 2925 cells between its 6000 inmates. Tuberculosis was found in nearly 65% of long-term prisoners, suicide was not uncommon, and discipline was enforced through physical punishment by use of long batons. The majority of warders were Indian Sikhs, who were generally despised by Chinese prisoners. Western prisoners were separated from the Chinese and were relatively better cared for, being given lighter duties, separate cells and softer uniforms. After 1930 they too were officially brought under the same discipline system as the Chinese, however. Wartime period (1932‚Äì1949) After the First Battle of Shanghai ended with the de facto control of Hongkou, Ward Road Gaol found itself located in the middle of the Japanese-controlled sector of the International Settlement. Again, during the hostilities of 1937, the prison was trapped between the Chinese and Japanese armies. It was accidentally shelled a number of times, with prisoners killed and guards injured. A short cease-fire allowed 500 prisoners to be released to safe areas, but the Japanese cancelled further prisoner releases after the Municipal Council stated it could not simply turn loose young offenders into a dangerous environment. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) let the Municipal Council process and detain Chinese and foreign prisoners in Ward Road until 1941, when the IJA launched its occupation of the International Settlement as the opener to the Pacific War. Taken over by the Japanese and used to hold both civil and political prisoners, the prison nonetheless retained many of its Sikh and European guards. This changed when it was turned over to the Wang Jingwei Government in 1943, and subsequently renamed Tilanqiao Prison after the surrounding district. For the rest of the war the prison was used to hold thousands of Chinese dissidents who dissented against the Nanjing government, Western prisoners of war, and some European civilians. Many prisoners were removed from the prison by the Japanese and used as forced labour. It was during the Japanese residency of the site that Ward Road saw its first and only escape, when two Americans and one British naval officer, all Allied POW's, managed to escape from the prison with Chinese assistance. In September 1944, USMC Corporal Jerold Beers Story, USN Lieutenant Commander Columbus Darwin Smith, and Commander John B. Wooley RN traveled 700 miles over seven weeks across Japanese-occupied China until they reached friendly forces. In 1945 the Axis Powers surrendered and Tilanqiao Prison was brought under the control of Chiang Kai-shek 's Kuomintang government. The KMT used the prison to detain several hundred Japanese war criminals and a number of Chinese who had been part of Wang Jingwei's government. In 1947 the first trials of these criminals were held. Thirteen Chinese hanjian prisoners being executed inside the prison's walls. In 1948, the underground Communist Party member Wang Xiaohe was executed by the Guomindang after a show trial. The execution took place in the prison yard by firing squad rather than in the execution chamber. Modern period (1950-) With the victory of the Communists (PRC) in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Shanghai's Tilanqiao Prison was brought under the control of the Municipal Military Control Commission and renamed the Shanghai People's Prison. In 1951 it was turned over to the civil Public Security Bureau and again renamed; this time to Shanghai Prison. It continued under this name until 1995 when it was named Shanghai Tilanqiao Prison. Today Tilanqiao Prison is one of China's largest and most (in)famous prisons, often held and reported as a model prison by the PRC state. Nevertheless, human rights groups and Western governments argue the prison continues to engage in torture, deprivation and cruelty. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment toward high-profile prisoners such as Mao Hengfeng have been used to highlight apparent abuses at the prison.

It is set in ancient Canaan and Egypt at the time of the Biblical Flood and rooted in the story of Noah's Ark. It is the first book of a series sometimes called the Egyptian trilogy, followed by The Shadow on the Sun (1970) and The Bright and Morning Star (1972). Harris won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Macmillan published the first US edition in 1969. The Moon in the Cloud was adapted for television in 1978. Plot summary When the Lord God decides to send a flood, he instructs Noah to build an Ark and save his family and the animals. Noah gives his reprobate son Ham the responsibility of collecting two cats from Kemi, the Black Land (Egypt), and two lions, but Ham passes the task to his neighbour Reuben by promising to persuade Noah to let Reuben and his wife on the Ark. Reuben travels to Kemi with his camel Anak, his cat Cefalu and his dog Benoni. In the desert they are captured by the High Priest of Sekhmet, who is impressed by Cefalu's sacred heritage. He houses the cat in the Temple of Sekhmet in Kemi's capital Men-nofer, where Cefalu falls in love with the resident temple cat Meluseth. Reuben is presented as a slave to the music- loving King, who becomes his friend. However, he despairs of returning home until a 'supernatural' display arranged by the High Priest of Ptah backfires. Panic and rioting in the streets give Reuben a chance to escape and rescue his animals. Meluseth joins them. On the way back, Cefalu persuades the lion Aryeh to come to the Ark. They meet Thamar, who has camped in the desert to escape the attentions of Ham and has meanwhile rescued a lost lion cub. They return home with the two cats and the two lions only to encounter treachery from Ham. However, a providential accident secures them a place of safety just as the rain begins to fall.

At that time Upper and Lower Egypt had long been united with Men-nofer as the capital. The Flood is not fixed in historical time, and its being placed here tends to confirm the suspicion of some of the characters that it will be a merely local affair. The author cites several scholarly sources on Egypt and says that she has tried to avoid slips in the historical background, but \\"if there are some, I shall make the cowardly excuse that most writers on ancient Egypt blandly disagree on detail, right down to the spelling of names\\".Mollie Hunter, \\"Author's Note\\", The Moon in the Cloud, p. 7. Literary significance and reception A review in the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books of March 1973 refers to the \\"sophisticated humor\\" of the novel,Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books: Electronic Edition. while another review of a later book by the author calls The Moon in the Cloud a \\"magical children's classic\\".The Independent on Books for Children. John Rowe Townsend in a discussion of created worlds says the author \\"created an Ancient Egypt that (it seems safe to say) never was... Talking animals are the least of the improbabilities.\\" (However, it should be explained that the 'speech' of the animals is intended only as a representation of animal communication, which Reuben understands ‚Äì these are not talking animals in the Narnian sense.) Townsend clearly appreciates the humour of the book and its sequels, referring particularly to the \\"delicate irreverence\\" with which the story of Noah's Ark is presented.John Rowe Townsend, Written for Children: An Outline of English- language Children's Literature, third revised edition, Penguin, 1987, p. 238.

It closed in 1998 and re-opened in 1999 under the management of Haven Holidays who renamed it Craig Tara. Butlins Butlins Ayr seen in 1984, The outdoor pool was demolished in the 1990s During the Second World War the Admiralty, who had already taken over his camp at Filey, asked Billy Butlin to construct two new camps; one in North Wales and the other in Scotland. Butlin found on the coast neighbouring the Heads of Ayr and opened a camp in 1940. Butlin took back ownership of the camp from the Admiralty after the war, and in 1947 Butlins Ayr was opened to the public after some reconstruction work. Heads of Ayr holiday camp contained all of the tried and tested Butlins ingredients: the famous Butlins Redcoats, a funfair, early morning wake up, a dining hall (with the cheers going up when a waitress dropped a plate), indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a ballroom, a boating lake, tennis courts, a sports field (for the three legged and egg & spoon races and the donkey derby), table tennis and snooker tables, an amusement arcade, a medical centre, a theatre, arcades of shops, a chairlift system and a miniature railway. In 1987 a ¬£25 million investment programme was announced. Work began in 1988 with ¬£12 million used to construct a new swimming pool and upgrade the accommodation. A further ¬£13 million investment followed over the next five years. Once the renovations were completed the camp was renamed Wonderwest World. Heads of Ayr Hotel In 1947 Butlin began work on a hotel on the site which shared the camp's resources. It was completed in 1948 and opened as the Heads of Ayr hotel. The hotel continued to operate until the 1970s when it was closed and demolished. Railway station On 17 May 1947 a railway station was opened for the use of the camp and the nearby hotel,Butt (1995), p.116 shortly before nationalisation and the formation of British Rail. It was closed again on 16 September 1968. Haven Holidays Craig Tara, seen in 2006. The building on the right is the main reception building. In 1999 the camp became part of Haven Holidays along with the Pwllheli camp as part of an internal reorganisation within Bourne Leisure who owned both Butlins and Haven. Since being taken over by Haven Holidays it has been renamed Craig Tara and the focus of operations has been transformed from predominantly chalet accommodation to mostly static caravan accommodation. Stephen McKerron On 17 September 1988, 5 year old Stephen McKerron vanished from the camp whilst on holiday with his aunt and uncle. This led to the largest ever missing child hunt by Scottish Police, as 200 officers searched the camp and a six mile (10 km) radius from the camp. On Sunday 2 October Stephen's body was found outside the search area by Lady MacLehose, the wife of retired diplomat and former Governor of Hong Kong Lord MacLehose of Beoch, who lived nearby.

Denham Springs High School is a part of the Livingston Parish School System and was founded in 1897 as a school for the residents of Denham Springs, a city located in Livingston Parish. The school is located on Louisiana Highway 16, adjacent to Denham Springs Freshman High. The school's location makes it prone to flooding. This was the case when flooding devastated the area in 2016, and resulted in students having to travel to nearby Live Oak High School for classes. Denham Springs High School is a public high school and has open enrollment. The school also consistently ranks high on reports by the Louisiana Department of Education. In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report rankings, Denham Springs High School ranked 43 on the \\"Louisiana's Best High Schools\\" list. Denham Springs High School is a member of the Louisiana High School Athletic Association and offers a wide variety of sports and programs. Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. History Denham Springs High School was founded in 1897 for the residents of Denham Springs. The school was built to serve the larger city of Denham Springs so that students would not have to travel as far to attend the Live Oak school that was built two years earlier in 1895. Livingston Parish Public Schools desegregated following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish Board.United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board. 14 Aug. 1970. Open Jurist. The effects of desegregation were largely felt by those at the once all-white Denham Springs High School. The West Livingston School, the only school in the Parish to serve African Americans, saw a large percentage of its students attend Denham Springs High School after desegregation. African American students were harassed by their white students while teachers looked on indifferently. To make matters worse, West Livingston High School was the heart of the African American community in Denham Springs at the time, and after integration, the school system let the school fall into disrepair. As the City of Denham Springs continued to grow in the later half of the 20th century, officials at Denham Springs High School looked for ways to continue housing students. On May 8th, 1997, a student caused a fire that destroyed the administrative building and damaged others {{Cite web |url=https://www.livingstonparishnews.com/the-making-of-an- activist/article_9fb34a2a-a792-508c-9c44-1fa616d4baa7.html|, leading to many classrooms continuing in temporary buildings. By 1998, most of the damage was repaired and a new office building was constructed facing the front of the school in 1999. One of the first measures to ease student flow and improve student success was the addition of Denham Springs Freshman High School in 1998 as a separate school; having previously been managed as one school. The school has since grown to become the second largest high school in the state of Louisiana. The Great Flood of 2016 devastated the Denham Springs community. Denham Springs High School was one of the three schools that received substantial damage from the flood. As a result of the damages, Denham Springs High School was not able to return to class at their normal campus when classes resumed a month after the flooding event, so students had to travel to Live Oak High School where they attended classes in the afternoon, 40 minutes after the students of Live Oak had their classes.Vinsanau, Michael. \\"Livingston Parish schools begin sharing facilities on first day back since flood\\". WBRZ. Retrieved 2019-06-12. Although the school received substantial damage, it was not declared a total loss by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As a result, the school system was only able to repair the damages while also making minor improvements. There was no work done to prevent future damages from flooding, so the school continued to see issues in 2017 after a heavy rain event.  Enrollment  Denham Springs High School is a public high school with no admissions requirements. Enrollment is open to residents that make up the Denham Springs and Juban communities.

His first was described by Fanny Burney as a \\"vile poem\\" as it revealed that she had written the novel, Evelina. Life Huddesford was baptized at St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford, on 7 December 1749. His father, also George Huddesford, was the president of Trinity College. He attended Winchester College and Trinity College, Oxford. His elder brother, William, was to become a leading creator of the Ashmolean Museum. Huddesford left his father's college and became a fellow of New College in 1771. Huddesford resigned the fellowship as a result of his marriage a year later. It was said that Huddesford had married in haste and unwisely driven by youthful enthusiasm for his prospective wife. Mr Huddesford and Mr Bampfylde (about 1778) Huddesford was an amateur painter and was a student of Joshua Reynolds after he left Oxford. Huddesford was able to have several paintings exhibited at the Royal Academy before 1775. He had carried out several paintings in oil, including a full-length portrait of George Lee, the Earl of Lichfield. Joshua Reynolds in turn captured Huddesford in a painting that Huddesford had commissioned,W. P. Courtney, ‚ÄòHuddesford, George (bap. 1749, d. 1809)‚Äô, rev. S. C.

His satire 'Warley, A Satire' was published anonymously in 1778 and was dedicated to Joshua Reynolds.

Other satirical poems followed with \\"the French\\" and rigged elections as targets of his wordplay. One later work was a collection of poetry by old fellow Winchester College students which was called the \\"Wiccamical Chaplet\\". In 1791, Huddesford wrote a comic verse anonymously on the subject of the death of Thomas Warton (the younger) who had been Professor of poetry in Oxford, and a friend to Samuel Johnson, Reynolds and Edmund Burke. This large poem compares Warton to a college cat and it is titled, \\"Monody on the Death of Dick, an Academical Cat.\\" The poem is littered with clever puns and allusions.Monody on the Death of Dick, an Academical Cat, Rev G. Huddesford, 1791, accessed February 2010 The painting of him with John Bampfylde shows the two of them admiring a portrait of Thomas Warton who was master of Winchester College. Huddesford and Bampfylde were close friends, but their relationship was destroyed when Bampfylde was arrested for breaking windows in order to further his affection for the niece of Reynolds.

The Council demanded South Africa cease the attacks and respect Angola's sovereignty and territorial integrity, noting that Angola has the right of self-defense to defend its territory and is entitled to compensation for the attacks. The resolution demanded that South Africa withdraw immediately all its military forces from Angola. It also condemned South Africa for using occupied Namibia (then South West Africa) as a springboard for the attacks, urging all member states to implement the arms embargo imposed in Resolution 418 (1977) on South Africa. Finally, the commission established in Resolution 571 (1985) consisting of Australia, Egypt and Peru was required to assess the damage caused by the recent attack.

Bus services  The bus services are provided by Etxebarribus, a municipal bus service managed by the Etxebarri city hall. The metro station is the starting point of the two lines of the service; line 1 connects the station with the neighbourhood of Santa Marina, crossing the main urban area of the city, while line 2 joins the metro station with the Legizamon area.Etxebarribus line map by the Etxebarri City Hall  Future  The original project of the line 5 of the metro network was unveiled in 2008, with the final project presented in 2010. It involved the creation of a new underground line between the cities of Etxebarri and Galdakao, ultimately connecting with the Galdakao-Usansolo hospital. This original proyect determined the Etxebarri station to be the head of the new line, where it would connect with the existing two lines of the system. The economic crisis that has since affected the region has delayed the project and altered some aspects of it. In May 2018, the Basque Nationalist Party and the Socialist Party of the Basque Country presented a new proposal which suggested the possibility of taking advantage of the existing overground rail infrastructure between Etxebarri and Galdakao currently managed by Euskotren Trena in place of the original underground project.

Background Shane Carwin, who won the Interim Heavyweight Championship by defeating Frank Mir at UFC 111, faced current heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar. The two were originally set to face each other at UFC 106, then UFC 108, before Carwin won the interim heavyweight championship, but Lesnar pulled out of the fight both times due to an illness (diverticulitis) that kept him from training. Cheick Kongo was scheduled to face Roy Nelson, but a back injury sidelined Kongo. Nelson fought Junior dos Santos at UFC 117. Alessio Sakara was set to fight Nate Marquardt, but Sakara pulled out of the bout after the death of his father. Jacob Volkmann was scheduled to fight Paul Kelly as one of the preliminary fights, but Kelly reportedly had to pull out of the July 3 fight due to visa issues. The bout was rescheduled for UFC Live: Jones vs. Matyushenko the next month. Also, UFC newcomer Ricardo Romero was scheduled to fight Steve Cantwell after Cantwell's recent medical ban ended. However, the fight was cancelled for unknown reasons and Cantwell was replaced by UFC returnee Seth Petruzelli.

On June 22, 2010, Wanderlei Silva had to withdraw from his co-main event fight against Yoshihiro Akiyama due to three broken ribs and an injured right knee. Akiyama was then matched against Chris Leben. The bout between Kendall Grove and Goran Reljic was originally slated for the live prelims show on Spike TV. However, it was later demoted and replaced by Seth Petruzelli vs. Ricardo Romero because of Grove's criticism of the Spike TV network and The Ultimate Fighter television show.

It lies between the towns of Bevern in the southwest and Golmbach and Stadtoldendorf in the east. To the west flows the River Weser. A section of the B 64 federal road runs along the southern part of the Burgberg, linking Holzminden with Negenborn.  Sights  Telegraph Station The ruined walls of the former castle of Everstein may be seen on the twin peaks of the Gro√üer Everstein () and Kleiner Everstein. The tower of a former royal Prussian optical telegraph station, no. 28, part of the telegraph line from Berlin to Koblenz, can be seen on the central part of the ridge. Remains of the building foundations for the station have also survived. The tower is not open to the public. An information board describes the history of the optical telegraph. On the steep northern slopes of the Burgberg lies the Frauenschuhfl√§che (\\"Lady's Slipper Field\\"), a relic of the time when the slopes of the Burgberg were used to graze sheep and goats. The grazing of animals led to the creation of many areas of semi-dry grassland on which a specialised flora developed. These grasslands, with just a few sparse trees and juniper bushes, became favourite habitats for the Lady's slipper orchid, hence the field's name, as well as the fringed gentian, meadow clary and wild majoram.

To prevent acid from flowing backwards, the lower part of the swallowing tube (esophagus) has a valve which closes after food passes through. In some individuals, this valve becomes incompetent and acid goes up into the esophagus. Reflux episodes often occur at night and one may develop a bitter taste in the mouth. The throat can be severely irritated when acid touches the vocal cords and can lead to spasms of coughing.

History Andrew Peterson on the farm in 1885 Andrew Peterson (Anders Pettersson) was born October 20, 1818 at V√§stra Ryd parish in Ydre h√§rad, √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden. He died March 31, 1898 in Clearwater Lake, Carver County, Minnesota. He emigrated from Rydsn√§s, Sweden to American in 1850. With his sister and fourteen other emigrants, they arrived in Boston on July 2, 1850. He arrived in Burlington, Iowa about four weeks later and lived there for four years. He later moved to Minnesota in 1855, claiming near the southeastern shore of Lake Waconia. He kept a series of daily diaries and ledgers dating from 1850 until a few days until his death in 1898. Peterson's diary was donated by his family to the Minnesota Historical Society in 1939. These writings provided inspiration for Vilhelm Moberg's novels The Emigrants, Unto a Good Land, The Settlers, and The Last Letter Home, although they were set in Chisago County, Minnesota. While Andrew Peterson is not familiar to many Americans, his story is well known in Sweden. The Andrew Peterson Society was established in Sweden in 2003. In 2007 a tour group came from Sweden to visit the farm. The Carver County Historical Society restored the granary on the farmstead in 2006 with help from Swedish carpenters, and began restoration on the north barn in 2010. A musical called Andrew Peterson: The Genuine Pioneer Story had great success in Sweden in 2012. Note This article contains information obtained from the Swedish Wikipedia article Andrew Peterson.

She meets a nice and concerned Judge Gray, who believes the relative, a shiftless drunkard, to be unsuitable. He keeps the girl for a while at his place, where she befriends his teenage son, Reggie. Marjorie is eventually sent to an orphanage, but does not stay there long, since a wealthy family adopts her. The parents have just lost their own little girl and dote on Marjorie, but their teenage son becomes highly jealous of his new sister. His unpleasant behaviour results in Marjorie having an accident, and consequently she loses her memory and goes missing. An old beggar finds her and looks after her. The beggar turns out to have selfish motives, though. When Marjorie recovers, she is taken out to beg by the beggar because people more willingly give money to children.

It explores the multiplicity of expressions of African American identity.Riggs' Eloquent Last Plea for Tolerance - SFGate Overview Black Is...Black Ain't is an exploration and comprehensive commentary of the Black experience in America. Riggs establishes that there is no singular definition of what it means \\"to be Black.\\" The very form and content illustrate Blackness in its multiplicities. The film presents a plethora of black identities disallowing for generalization or stereotyping of the larger Black community. Riggs explores a diverse range of topics including the history, and rise of African American, patriarchal structure and its effects on the perception of Black families, men and women today. Riggs uses his grandmother's gumbo as a metaphor for the rich diversity of Black identities. The metaphor takes a traditional, archetypal black symbol and changes the interpretation. Gumbo is made of anything and everything, and as the camera moves close to the pot, the viewer can sense that the dish is made of different, clashing ingredients. The gumbo alludes to the diverse black community, symbolizing unity, communion, and inclusiveness. The film traverses the country interviewing African Americans young and old, rich and poor, Northern and Southern, rural and urban, gay and straight, as they discuss the numerous, often contested definitions of Blackness. Riggs mixes performances by choreographer Bill T. Jones and poet Essex Hemphill with commentary by noted activist Angela Y. Davis, and cultural critics bell hooks, Cornel West, Michele Wallace, Barbara Smith and Maulana Karenga to create a flavorful stew of personal testimony, music, and history. While Black Is...Black Ain't looks at Black diversity, many speakers express the pain of having been silenced or excluded because they were perceived as \\"not Black enough\\" or conversely \\"too Black.\\" Black Is...Black Ain't also provides a critique of sexism, patriarchy, homophobia, colorism and cultural nationalism in the family, church and other Black institutions. The film also discusses black ancestry, various origins of black people, and ultimately the displacement of black people. Riggs shows a wide array of people within the Black Diaspora. By doing so, he exhibits how diverse blackness is, contradicting societies homogenization of black people. Riggs demonstrates the many ways in which blackness can manifest and validates the intersectional identities black people hold that are systemically erased. The LGBTQ community is often left out of discourses about blackness, but Riggs makes it a point to include them as a central through-line of his narrative. His documentary style videography using talking heads literally works to bring LGBTQ people to the forefront in the film to represent themselves rather than excluding or alienating them as a subgroup of the black community. Overall, the film touches on various topics relating to the black community, but the overarching theme is that across the concept of blackness‚Äî in all its versatility and multiplicity‚Äî solidarity in that identity collectively outweighs the differences within the community.Slant Magazine Style The form of this documentary is different from the traditional documentary in the sense that the director inserts himself into the film. Riggs, himself is a participant in the film. He is shown, in a race against time to finish the film, struggling with his precarious health and mortality. There are interviews with him while he is in the hospital, and even the opening scene of the film is a shot of himself in the woods. Riggs died of AIDS in April 1994 at the age of 37 before the film was completed. Adhering to Riggs‚Äô notes, his colleagues on the production team, Producer Nicole Atkinson and Co- Director/Editor Christian Badgely, completed the film with Signifyin' Works, the non-profit production company that Marlon created in 1991 to produce his work.California Newsreel - Film and Video for Social Change Since 1968 Reception Black Is‚Ä¶Black Ain‚Äôt won the Filmmakers‚Äô Trophy at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the International Documentary Association.All-inclusive \\"Black Is . . .

Early life  A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Davis is the oldest of four children. Davis was 19 when his father died; he inherited his father's public relations firm and dropped out of college.  Career   Early career  In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Davis was majority partner in Tulsa, Oklahoma advertising agency Davis & Nauser (with partner Jeffery Nauser), where his client list included just one political candidate, his uncle, then Tulsa mayoral candidate and current U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe. Davis left for California when Oklahoma's economy suffered from the collapse of the local oil industry. He founded and leads Strategic Perception, an advertising firm based in Hollywood. Political ads He created the Celebrity ad for presidential candidate John McCain and the Demon Sheep video for California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina. Davis was described as \\"the most creative person in the business\\" by Republican media consultant Mark McKinnon. His political clients have included President George W. Bush, presidential candidates Dan Quayle, John McCain, Jon Huntsman and John Kasich. Senators Jim Inhofe, John Cornyn, Lamar Alexander, John McCain, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Chuck Grassley, David Perdue, John Kennedy, Ben Sasse, Elizabeth Dole and Paul Coverdell. Also governors Sonny Perdue, Rick Snyder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Ernie Fletcher. His long-shot gubernatorial campaign for Sonny Perdue in Georgia featured a video of a giant rat rampaging Georgia. The rat portrayed the current, popular governor Roy Barnes. The video is credited as starting the movement toward viral videos in politics. Perdue beat Barnes handily, in spite of being outspent more than seven to one. A similar campaign for now- Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan featured the unusual Davis slogan, ‚ÄúOne Tough Nerd.‚Äù The slogan caught on across the state helping propel the unknown Snyder past several statewide office holders into a primary win without a runoff, then the general election. He created a well-known 2010 ad for U.S. Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell which featured her declaring she was \\"not a witch\\", in response to the re-airing of past statements made by her about her interactions with non-Christian religious practices. O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs witch statements had become a staple of late night comedy programs, including Saturday Night Live, before Davis was hired. In February 2012, Davis authored a controversial ad for Representative Pete Hoekstra for his Senate campaign against incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow. The ad attacked Stabenow as Debbie \\"Spend-it-now\\" and showed an Asian woman riding a bicycle in a rice paddy thanking Stabenow (in broken English) for enriching the Chinese economy at the expense of the U.S. Republican strategist Mike Murphy tweeted that the ad was \\"really, really dumb,\\" while Stabenow called it \\"shocking\\" and \\"nasty.\\" Hoekstra denied that the ad was insensitive to Chinese Americans and was meant to focus on Stabenow's voting record. Within two weeks, the Hoekstra campaign removed the video from his campaign website and YouTube account. Other clients of Davis include George W. Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Obama document  In 2012, Davis‚Äô firm prepared a 57-page plan (commissioned by billionaire Joe Ricketts) for a $10 million campaign attempting to defeat the re-election of President Obama. It partially recycled points of criticism against Obama from the 2008 presidential campaign, including his relationship with Obama‚Äôs reverend, Jeremiah Wright. The proposal, titled, The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good, was initially approved by the Ricketts' Ending Spending Action Fund. A copy of the proposal document was released by a person unconnected to the ad campaign to The New York Times, after which it was roundly lambasted in external commentary. Ricketts then disavowed commissioning the plan. Although Davis' agency had gone at least as far as contacting Larry Elder to join the project, no ads were ever aired. Ricketts issued a statement disavowing the ad campaign hours after it was publicized by the New York Times.

The idea that opium has had a direct effect on works of romantic poetry is still under debate; however, the literary criticism that has emerged throughout the years suggests very compelling ideas about opium and its impact on Romantic texts. Usually these criticisms tend to focus on poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas De Quincey and George Crabbe. Overview The Romantic era in Britain was not only a time of growth for literature and poetry, but additionally a time of increased opium use. Interspersed among importation of opium from the Middle and Far East countries, Britain itself produced a meager amount of opium and utilized it, at least initially, as medicine and also as an ingredient in patent medicines to treat a variety of ailments and diseases. Given the euphoric and psychologically reinforcing properties of opium, users eventually began consuming it for recreation instead of therapeutic purposes. Its hypothesized effects on visions have been discussed in many theories, one of which was M. H. Abrams', who claims that opium opened up a creative channel, while another was Elisabeth Schneider's argument stating that opium did not inspire visions, but only a daydream-like trance, and Alethea Hayter's position that opium's influences were a combination of the previous two claims.Milligan, 4 Opium during the Romantic Era Opium and the Orient The fascination and experimentation with opium occurred partially because of its connections to the oriental tales such as Purchas his Pilgrimage, Travels through Persia, and Memoires du Baron de Tott, sur les Turcs et les Tartares (\\"Baron de Tott's memoires - on the Turks and the Tartars\\"), in which opium use was emphatically featured.Milligan, 20 In the eighteenth century, opium was primarily imported to Britain from countries like Persia, Egypt, Smyrna, and the Levant areas.Crumpe, 44 Opium imports from Turkey dominated in Britain which accounted for 80-90% of the share brought in during the majority of the nineteenth century. Although most of the opium came from the Orient, attempts were made to grow opium in England as an \\"agricultural improvement.\\"Berridge, 11 For a while, opium was used as a currency for trading activities with China, because while other nations had to pay great amounts of silver for tea, England used its opium trade through India, combined with cotton, as a bargaining chip for imports.The Times, 1789, 2 As importation increased, many patent opium products appeared and were sold in general stores as well as apothecaries.Jay, 66 These patent medicines included Godfrey's Cordial, Dalby's Carminative, McMunn's Elixir, Batley's Sedative Solution, and Mother Bailey's Quieting Syrup.Hayter, 31 The First Opium War occurred between 1839 and 1842 when Britain realized that opium grown in India could be sold in China for a profit, and their army forced the Emperor to sign a treaty allowing free trade, which had been initially prohibited for opium.Jay, 70 Medical uses and effects Samuel Taylor Coleridge at age 42, engraving by Samuel Cousins from a portrait by Washington Allston. Digitally restored. The Swiss alchemist and physician Paracelsus (1493-1541) is often credited as the first to create a tincture of opium. In the 17th century, the English physician Thomas Browne conducted experiments upon the dosage of opium on various animals.The Works of Thomas Browne ed. Simon Wilkins. pub. 1852 Browne's contemporary, the physician Thomas Sydenham (1624‚Äì89) the so-called 'Father of British medicine' declared - Among the remedies which has pleased the Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium .Opium by Thomas M. Santella pub. 2007 Infobase Publishing In the 1730s Dr. Charles Alston in one of his papers describes the biology or botany of the poppy plant, and the experiments he conducted with it on animals. One section of his paper describes how opium was believed to treat pain, cause sleep, increase perspiration, raise the spirits, and relax the muscles. With these things in mind, it was recommended for pain and any sort of irritation to the nerves or motions of spirits.Alston, 119-120 Opium became a popular \\"aspirin-like\\" product of the early nineteenth century. George Crabbe was prescribed opium in 1790 to relieve pain, and he continued to use it for the rest of his life. At the time of George Crabbe's first prescription, the East India Company began hiring Indian Villages to cultivate large quantities of opium.Murray, Christopher John. \\"Drugs and Addiction.\\" Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760-1850, Volume 1. Ed. Fitzroy Dearborn. New York, Moew York. Taylor and Francis Group, 2004. P. 297. Medicinally, it had been used as a reliable cure since the beginning of the medical field.Jay, 52 William Cullen and John Brown, two well-known physicians at the time, claimed it cured things such as typhus, cancer, cholera, rheumatism, smallpox, malaria, venereal disease, hysteria, and gout in the eighteenth century.Hayter, 29 However, some individuals recognized the dangers that opium held. Some wrote into newspapers, such as The Times, and emphasized the dangers of giving a child medication such as the \\"Syrup of Poppies\\" or other potent medications, which contained an unspecified amount of opium known to be dangerous to give to infants.The Times 1828, 7 A deeper medical analysis revealed that opium created and uplifted spirit and happy disposition, which was then followed by symptoms of a very opposite effect which includes the mind \\"becoming gradually dull and languid, the body averse to motion, little affected by customary impressions, and inclined to sleep\\". Following a larger dose, \\"all these symptoms continue to increase; and tremors, convulsions, vertigo, stupor, insensibility, and deprivation of muscular action appear\\". Regardless of the mixed reviews in the public sphere, during the time of increasing imports and the unconcern of doctors (especially demonstrated by certain journals documenting how to cultivate the poppy plant and create opium),Anderson, 1792 there were more hard drugs in England than any time before or any time that followed.Jay, 68 Eventually, the drug moved beyond medicinal use as its imaginative powers attracted attention‚Äîthe descriptions accompanying the effects of opium moved from drowsy effects to those of its power over the imagination and thought process.Jay, 56 This was especially true within the circle of Romantic poets, specifically Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas De Quincey, who suffered from addiction to opium. Influence on literary creation Direct inspiration M. H. Abrams argued that opium users during the Romantic era became \\"inspired to ecstasies\\"Abrams, x when experiencing opium's effects. It was not assumed that poetry was created during the opium-induced stupor, but that the images that were experienced provided the raw material of the poem, and the poet had to create a surrounding framework to support it. Abrams writes how opium-using poets, \\"utilized the imagery from these dreams in his literary creations, and sometimes, under the direct inspiration of opium, achieved his best writing.\\"Abrams, ix The vividness of the sensory items, the feeling of persecution for eternity, or even the misguided sense of time found within the works of some poets indicates the influences of opium on their dreams and subsequent poems that they built around their dreams. A poet who did not use opium could not gain access to the planet opened solely by the symptoms of using. This unfamiliar realm, known only to users, according to M. H. Abrams, supplied the material for some of the Romantic poet's best and most influential writing.Abrams, ix-60 Opium debunked Another direction, more recently postulated by Elisabeth Schneider and in opposition to Abrams, utilizes evidence based on medical and textual evidence. Her idea supposes that the Romantic poet's mind was not affected by opium as it was initially believed to be by critics. While earlier views embodied the idea that opium- induced dreams inspired the production of poetry that was otherwise inaccessible, Schneider's view suggests that literary critics and some physicians who have not specifically studied opiates have an inadequate account of the effects of opium. This occurs partly from a lag in time, but also because of the fallibility of early medical writing on opium. Most of the medical writing on opium, up until the 1920s, was based upon accounts from De Quincey in Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, Coleridge, or from other users. Schneider writes \\"The relaxation of tension and conflict, accompanied by a sense of pleasant ease, occasionally helps to release for a time the neurotic person‚Äôs natural powers of though or imagination or (rarely) of action, though it does not give him powers that he did not have or change the character of his normal powers.\\"Schneider, 40 Research has suggested that heavy doses of opium in addicts does result in a lengthy day-dream like trance (often reaching what opiate users describe as a \\"nod\\", when the user's mind enters a space between waking thought and sleep), and that the euphoria it produces, according to Schneider, merely frees the creativity naturally found within the poet.Schneider, 1-377 Opium, real images, and dreaming as a channel A recent argument put forward by Alethea Hayter suggests that opium opens up the individual's mind toward recollecting the raw materials found within one's own life and the dreams, reveries, or hypnagogic visions, and the results are then translated into art. In essence, she states, \\"the action of opium may reveal some of the semi-conscious processes by which literature begins to be written\\"Hayter, 334‚Äîi.e., the act of dreaming (stimulated by opium) crystallizes the past into patterns reflecting truths, and these truths are what inspire the Romantic poetry created by opium users. Everyone is exposed to these everyday images, but opium add a further dimension to those images. Hayter specifies that while opium may enhance these images into a creative piece of text, ironically it also robs the individual of the power to make use of them, because the images are not easily recalled and recorded when sober. The necessary tools to create work like that of the opium-fuelled Romantic poets therefore must include not only the ability to daydream under the influence of the drug, but also the necessity of being able to communicate those visions on paper later.Hayter, 19-341 Hayter's view falls between the two previous literary critiques of opium use during the Romantic era.Hayter, 14 Literary users and their creations Thomas de Quincey from the frontispiece of De Quincey's Revolt of the Tartars by Charles Sears Baldwin. Typical use and dependence within the middle-class were not confined to the literary circle, although the records of famous users are more readily available.Berridge, 58 It has been proven or suggested through letters and notebooks that George Crabbe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey, Lord Byron, John Keats, and Percy Shelley imbibed on opium, whether for medicinal or recreational uses. In fact, all of the Romantic poets, with the exception of William Wordsworth, appear to have used it at some point. For example, Byron's wife discovered that he had a phial of the Black Drop. Individuals such as Crabbe, Coleridge, De Quincey, Byron, or Keats were most likely even given it as a child to treat some sort of physical ailment.Hayter, 30-31 Coleridge Coleridge began using opium in 1791 to relieve rheumatism,Murray, Christopher John. \\"Drugs and Addiction.\\" Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760-1850, Volume 1. Ed. Fitzroy Dearborn. New York, Moew York. Taylor and Francis Group, 2004. P. 267-269. but later he believed that opium made his body harmonize with his soul. He was said to have written in a letter to his brother George Coleridge, ‚ÄúLaudanum gave me repose, not sleep; but, you, I believe, know how divine that repose is, what a spot of enchantment, a green spot of fountain and flowers and trees in the very heart of a waste of sands!‚ÄùLetters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 240 There has been much controversy debating if his poems Kubla Khan and Rime of the Ancient Mariner were the results of opium vision. Percy Shelley Percy Shelley was said by scholars to have used opium to alter his state of thinking and free his mind. To \\"dampen his nerves\\",Singer, Katherine. \\"Stoned Shelley: Revolutionary Tactics and Women under the Influence.\\" Studies in Romanticism. Trustees of Boston University, Winter 2009. Vol. 48. Issue 4. pp. 687‚Äì707. Shelley took laudanum, according to letters he wrote, as well as biographies. When Shelley secretively began to become romantically involved with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, he started to carry a flask with laudanum in it around to calm his nerves. After Shelley was banned from seeing Mary, he reportedly ran into her house and gave her laudanum, waving a pistol in the air and shouting, \\"By this you can escape Tyranny. They wish to separate us, my beloved, but death shall unite us.\\" Shelley believed that opium allowed the individual to question societal norms and beliefs while allowing for ideas of radical social change to form. Shelley reportedly used laudanum in a suicide attempt, taking it to free as well as harm himself. Shelley believed opium created confusion for him between cause and effect, as well as between memory and forgetfulness. Shelley began experiencing body spasms and upon visiting his new doctor, Andrea Vacca Berlinghieri, he was warned to stop taking laudanum. Shelley did not heed the doctor's warning and continued to have spasms, haunting dreams, and confusions about reality. Opium use catalyzed Shelley's creativity, but conversely it also detrimentally affected his mental health and well-being. De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium- Eater De Quincey started using opium as a reliever for a toothache in 1804, and his book, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, was the first documentation of an opium addict to be published. He focused on the pleasures and the pains along with its influence on his works. His book was often accused of encouraging individuals to try opium and was blamed when they subsequently suffered from its side effects or addiction.Hayter, 106 With the ability to purchase laudanum easily from many street vendors, de Quincey was quoted, saying, \\"happiness might now be bought for a penny.\\" With respect to literary triumphs, De Quincey notes in Confessions of an English Opium-Eater how the increased activity in the brain because of opium increased his ability to create new things out of raw material.De Quincey, 76 De Quincey notes the oscillation of symptoms between dreams (which he claims to be a source of his intense suffering)De Quincey, 109 and nightmares, and the reader recognizes the grip opium addiction has on de Quincey and possibly other users at the time. Through Thomas de Quincey's trips to a surreal world made possible by the consumption of opium he was able to discover methods of psychoanalysis that Sigmund Freud formally introduced more than half a century later.

Due to a builder's strike during construction, many aesthetic and basic design features were omitted. Since that time such amenities as floor tile, paint, carpet, and electrical outlets have been added. Astoria schools were awarded a Technology Grant for Economically Challenged Schools which allowed the district to inform the community and involve community members in academic planning. The school purchased new computers and software, as well as wired the building and started training the staff in computer skills.

Biography Hamilton is the daughter of a Jamaican mother and Kenyan father, although both families trace their roots back to Scotland. The first decade of her life was spent in the Scottish Highlands,The Scotsman, Most Eligible Women from Scotland article. Between stints abroad, Hamilton attended Gordonstoun School, near Elgin in Morayshire, Scotland, to which she was awarded a music scholarship aged 12. She went on to study viola at Napier University in Edinburgh, and then won another scholarship to read viola performance at the Birmingham Conservatoire, in the city where she is based.

Simmy Richman from the Independent on Sunday wrote of Gown: \\"In a world of La Roux and Lady Gaga, this is an unashamedly grown-up record that dares to step out of the boxes we have reserved for our female singer-songwriters\\". In January 2011 a Special Edition version of Gown was released featuring additional tracks, an expanded booklet and revised artwork.

In 2011 Hamilton played on the main stage at TEDGlobal as well as several festivals and smaller solo shows. In 2012 following a significant uplift in her social media following, Hamilton launched a headlining tour entitled 'Always Heading West' with her band. The tour took in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, London and Falmouth in the UK and Milan and Rome in Italy. In 2014 Hamilton took over Durham Cathedral to create \\"Fractal Sparks\\", a one-off son et lumiere previewing some new work to appear on forthcoming 2nd album 'Fractals'. The show featured brass from The Band of the Royal Corps of Signals and 28 metre high projections of fire, waves and other natural phenomena. This was followed by theatre shows in London, Lincoln and a small tour of Canada. Work with the Airpiano In April 2010, Hamilton revealed she was the first artist in the world to be working with a prototype Airpiano, a non-contact electronic instrument being developed by Berlin-based inventor Omer Yosha. Hamilton had been looking for a way to recreate some of the intricate textures from Gown live without resorting to backing tracks, and had stumbled upon Yosha demonstrating a very early version on YouTube. She travelled to Berlin to meet Yosha and collect a prototype instrument from him which he'd made specially for her to experiment with it and give feedback to Yosha. The result was a short film entitled 'A New Instrument' about Hamiton's trip to Berlin and her resultant work with the instrument. The film received over 30,000 views on YouTube in the first three weeks, and was eventually syndicated by over 200 technology and music websites worldwide. In September 2010 she appeared live with the Airpiano at the Apple Store on Regent Street in London, assisted by Gown producer Jon Cotton and bassplayer Chaz West, to demonstrate and talk about her work with the instrument. 2011/12 appearances with the Airpiano included playing on BBC World Service's 'Click' January special to several million listeners, appearing on BBC Radio 4's Loose Ends, on Channel 5's Gadget Show and in the UK's Wired Magazine., and finally on the main stage at TEDGlobal 2011. Films As well as the Airpiano film 'A New Instrument', Hamilton has created a series of films to accompany Gown. These serve as both EPKs (electronic press kits) for industry use, and as visual extensions of Gown in their own right. The first EPK film (now renamed Gown Film 1) was released as a teaser in December 2008, several months before Gown itself was released. It opens with a quote from Scott Matthews, followed by a succession of footage shot herself in Slovenia, Italy, France and the UK while on tour, set to the song \\"There It Is\\" from Gown. The second half of the EPK is a live performance of the song \\"Liathach\\", which was shot in a gatehouse in Birmingham, the home of artist and furniture designer Chris Eckersley. This features metal birdhouses made by Eckersley who after viewing the footage revealed that his inspiration for the birdhouses was in fact a videoThe Byrds' Mr Tambourine Man, footage from 1965, available on YouTube. by the 1960s group The Byrds which looked uncannily similar. Later in the song the footage cuts to another live performance shot in Teatro Circolo Fratellanza in Casnigo near Bergamo, Italy.

The second EPK film (aka Gown Film 2) was released in September 2009.

It focuses exclusively on comedic films written and directed by women. Begun in 2005, it is held yearly in the summer months and brings together female writers and directors for a weekend of screenings, readings and events with the aim of fostering greater opportunity for women as the creators of film content. The festival has film and screenplay competitions for both feature-length and short films. Projects can be narrative or documentary. In addition, the festival offers continuing support to festival filmmakers and writers through its Legacy Program, a series of initiatives encouraging alumnae to create and screen new work. History Broad Humor was conceived in 2005 by filmmaker Susan diRende in response to the absence of women from a series of prominent forums for film industry recognition from awards such as the Oscars to film festivals such as the Los Angeles Film Festival, and in response to the low rate of employment of women directors in film and television.Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film The festival came into being as a grass-roots effort and was named one of five top niche film festivals by MovieMaker Magazine in its first year. The festival showcases work in which all the generative artists are female. Writing and directing must be done exclusively by women. Submissions for the festival come primarily from the United States and Canada, though submissions have been received from Europe, Asia and Australia as well. The festival has been invited twice to Italy, screening a Broads Abroad program in Rome in 2007 Where Magazine, January 2007, Roma and again in 2008 to the launch of the Tuscany Tourism Office programs for women, Benvenute in Toscana. In 2014, Michelle Clay stepped into the position of Executive Director and senior programming for the festival.

Originally called the Galveston, she was rechristened in honor of Branch Tanner Archer, a diplomat of the Republic of Texas. She was the last ship of the Texas Navy to be delivered under a contract with the shipbuilding firm Schott and Whitney. She was constructed in Baltimore and was delivered on April 25, 1840.

The most recent revision of the military doctrine was approved in 2014. Numerous successive revisions of military doctrine have been promulgated since 1990. These have included the military doctrines of May 1992 (in draft form), November 1993, and January 2000, as well as the two National Security Concepts of December 1997 and October 1999. Military doctrine in the Russian sense, however, extends beyond discussion of potential threats. In Christopher Donnelly's words, it forms part of \\"a set of views, accepted in a country at a given time, which cover the aims and character of possible war, the preparations of the country and its armed forces for such war, and the methods of waging it.\\" 1992 draft  The 1992 draft doctrine showed that first Russian thoughts on external threats were little more than a replica of Soviet thinking. The document stated that while the threat of a world war had declined significantly, the 'sources of military danger' in international relations remained the same as under the USSR. The first of those \\"sources of military danger\\" was given as: \\"the eagerness of single States or coalitions of states to dominate in the world community or in individual regions, and their predilection for settling matters in dispute by military means\\". There could be little doubt that the General Staff, who produced the paper, had the United States and NATO in mind when they wrote this. As slightly further down, it was stated that Russia did not regard any state or coalition as an enemy, a contraction had been introduced between the old and the new, evolving security environment. 'Powerful groupings of armed forces' near Russia's borders, the military build-up of 'certain states', international terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction were also mentioned. Russia also subtlety rescinded its nuclear no first use commitment by indicating that conventional attacks on nuclear weapons, power plants, 'and other potentially dangerous facilities' (presumably chemical or biological sites) would be regarded as the first use of weapons of mass destruction. 1993 Military Doctrine The Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR (as it was then) refused to approve the 1992 draft. A new military doctrine only entered into force in November 1993, and was not made fully public; the summary released covered 21 of the 23 pages of the document. No reason was given for the only-partial release of the text, and this gave rise to fears that the Russian Government and/or its military wished to conceal controversial or discreditable intentions. The summary released showed major differences from the external threats thinking of the 1992 draft. Two main threads showed through the list. Firstly was the remaining threat from the West, exemplified by worries over expansion of military blocs and violation of arms accords, as well as with interference with Russians abroad. The no-first-use commitment of nuclear weapons was dropped. Secondly, newer dangers were acknowledged; nearby internal wars, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and terrorism. In keeping with its emphasis on the threat of regional conflicts, the doctrine called for Russian armed forces that were smaller, lighter, and more mobile, with a higher degree of professionalism and with greater rapid deployment capability. Such change proved extremely difficult to achieve. 2000 Military Doctrine Both in the 1992 draft and in the 1993 official document, a distinction had been drawn between sources of external military danger and immediate military threats. This distinction disappeared in the most recent doctrinal statement, which was first publicised in draft form in October 1999, and then finally approved by Presidential decree in late April 2000.Text of Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, approved by a presidential decree dated 21 April 2000, via BBC Monitoring Service, Caversham Park, Reading. While numerous changes were made to the document between its draft stage and final form, the section on external military threats remained virtually the same. The first threat is seen as territorial claims upon the Russian Federation and interference in Russian domestic affairs, language drawn directly from the 1993 external dangers section. Secondly mentioned was disregard for Russian concerns in international conflict resolution, and opposition to strengthening Russia as one centre of a multipolar world. The multipolarity reference echos deleted sections from the 1999 draft, where two contradictory tendencies were set out: at one end, a trend toward a unipolar world based on the domination of one superpower - clearly the United States - and the military resolution of key problems, and at the other, a tendency toward the formation of a multipolar world, based on the rule of international law and the equal rights of people and nations. 2010 Military Doctrine Russia's 2010 military doctrine defines itself as strictly defensive. Note: the same URL is used for various revisions with different presidential decree dates. The doctrine points out 11 actions seen as constituting \\"external dangers\\" (, , dangers) to the Russian Federation which include: * striving to give NATO forces global functions, moving NATO infrastructure closer to Russia's borders * attempt to destabilize the situation in various states and regions and undermine strategic stability * deployment of foreign military contingents in countries and waters adjacent to Russia and its allies * deployment of strategic anti-missile defense systems, undermining global stability, and violating the established nuclear balance of forces, the militarization of space, and deployment of non-nuclear precision weapons; * territorial claims against Russia and its allies and interference in internal affairs * spread of weapons of mass destruction, missiles and missile technology, increase in the number of nuclear states * violation by some states of international agreements and non-compliance with previously concluded arms limitation and reduction treaties * use of military force in adjacent states in violation of the UN Charter and other international legal norms * presence of sources and escalation of military conflict in territories adjacent to Russia and its allies * spread of international terrorism * occurrence of sources of inter-ethnic (inter-faith) tensions, activity of international armed radical groups in areas adjacent to Russia and its allies, growth of separatism and forcible extremism in various regions of the world It also lists five actions seen as constituting military threats: * a sharpening of the military-political situation and creation of conditions for the use of military force * hindrance of the working of the state and military command and control system, interference in the functioning of its strategic nuclear forces, missile attack warning systems, space monitoring systems, nuclear warhead storage facilities, nuclear power and other potentially dangerous facilities * creation and training of illegal armed formations and their activity on Russian territory or that of its allies * demonstration of force in the course of conducting exercises in states adjacent to Russia or its allies with provocative intent * activation of military forces in various states with the conduct of partial or full mobilization and transition to wartime footing Under the new doctrine, Russia continues to develop and modernize its nuclear capability. \\"Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.\\" Most military analysts believe that, in this case, Russia would pursue an 'escalate to de-escalate‚Äô strategy, initiating limited nuclear exchange to bring adversaries to the negotiating table. Russia will also threaten nuclear conflict to discourage initial escalation of any major conventional conflict. 2014 military doctrine A more recent revision of the military doctrine was promulgated on 26 December 2014.

Founded by Robert Tonner in 1991, Tonner Doll designs and markets original doll lines as well as a number of licensed dolls for movies such as Harry Potter, Spider-Man 3, and Twilight. Its original products include the Tyler Wentworth, Kitty Collier and Antoinette series. History Tonner Doll Company, Inc. was founded in 1991 by Robert Tonner under the original name Robert Tonner Doll Designs (RTDD). Originally the company had only three employees: Tonner, his partner Harris Safier, and a part-time seamstress. In February 1991, RTDD made its public debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York City. Multi-jointed porcelain fashion dolls and jointed porcelain child dolls were displayed at the fair in limited editions ranging in price from $650 to $1500. Through the marketing of Safier, newly hired publicist Rebecca Plasker, along with Robert Tonner's quality of designs, RTDD saw exponential growth in its first year. By the end of 1992 RTDD was well on its way to becoming a prosperous enterprise. However, the massive demand would be overwhelming for the very small RTDD and only a fraction of the original orders would be filled. In 1995, Tonner Doll gained licensing rights for the recreation of the 1950s paper doll Betsy McCall, for reintroduction to the collectors market. To keep the cost down, Tonner decided to produce the doll in China. Made from vinyl, the Betsy McCall license was one of the initial mainstream commercial successes of the company. Over the coming years, RTDD began to grow the size of its staff to accommodate the rising demand. This growth would lead the company to be renamed the Tonner Doll Company; a move that Tonner felt reflected the growth of an independent artist driven company to what was becoming a professional business. By the year 2000, Tonner Doll employed 24 people including designers, marketers, and various sales and administrative staff. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, 2018, the Tonner Doll website, doll hospital, phone number, and e-mails were all shuttered. Yes, Tonner Doll has closed up shop and has receded into a remembrance of the doll world‚Äôs glorious, ever-expanding days. According to Robert, it was not an easy decision to make. He wrote to me and other collectors and friends about this difficult business move: ‚ÄúI was lucky enough to start Tonner Doll at a point when it seemed that everyone was collecting, making, buying, or selling dolls. At the same time, the Far East was willing and eager to produce whatever we wanted at a price that couldn‚Äôt be beat. High demand and inexpensive, quality production led to the golden age of the collectible dolls and the great success for Tonner Doll.‚Äù Licensing rights Tonner Doll has the licensing rights to design and develop dolls based on many American television, cinema, comic book, and video game franchises. Since the 1995 issue of the Betsy McCall doll, Tonner Doll has gained the rights and recreated doll designs for movies such as 1997's Titanic (Kate Winslet), and 1999's Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (Natalie Portman).

They gained exclusive rights to Bernard Lipfert's 1928 Patsy doll, Patsyette. Effanbee also had the rights to reproduce fashion dolls licensed by Tribune Media like the Brenda Starr, Girl Reporter series, and the comic strip, Little Orphan Annie. For the first few years after the buyout the Effanbee remained an independent subsidiary of Tonner Doll, however today the two have become a conglomerate run under a singular management.

He made the first survey and map of Yerba Buena (which later was named San Francisco) in 1839. He worked for John Sutter and later moved to San Jose. He was a man of many talents‚Äîhe spoke multiple languages, played the violin, and was an artist.Jean Jacques Vioget (1799 - 1855) Life Born in Combremont-le-Petit, Switzerland on April 22, 1794, the son of Jean Pierre Vioget and Jeanne Suzanne Meister (or Meystre). He was baptized on 4 May 1794 in the church of Combremont-le -Petit. His baptism record reveals the name of \\"Jean Jacob Vioget\\". He joined Napoleon's army in the fourth Swiss Regiment ( source SHD register 23 YC 179) at the age of 19 in November 1813. He enlisted the \\"Battalion of Stoffel\\" (Register of the Battalion of Stoffel, page 49, Service historique de la Defense SHD, chateau de Vincennes, Paris- France, register 23 YC 180) in April 1815, and was hurt during the battle of Wavre in Belgium. He was later apprenticed to a French naval engineer. In the 1820s he served in the Brazilian navy, rising to the rank of captain, and engaging in the maritime trade in South America. During the early 1830s he was captain of a bark, Delmire, trading along the coast of Peru and Ecuador. Vioget first arrived in San Francisco, then known as Yerba Buena, in 1837, when only two homes stood in the village - those of Jacob P. Leese and William A. Richardson. It was at this time that Vioget made a watercolor of the San Francisco Bay, which hung in the cabin of his ship for the next two years. He returned to Yerba Buena in 1839. In 1839 Governor Juan B. Alvarado ordered a survey of Yerba Buena, and the alcalde, Francisco Guerrero, employed Vioget to do the work. Plan of Yerba Buena by Jean Jacques Vioget Vioget's survey covered the area that is now San Francisco's Financial District and featured a grid made of trapezoidal blocks.Mick Sinclair, 2004,San Francisco: a cultural and literary history, Signal Books, In 1840, on a third of a block on Clay Street that Vioget received as payment for his work, he built Vioget House, which also had a saloon and billiard parlor. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the house was renamed Portsmouth House in honor of the USS Portsmouth. Vioget became a leading saloon-keeper and merchant in the city, and also continued to offer his services as a surveyor. Vioget first went to work for fellow countryman John Sutter, surveying Sutter's Sacramento-area land grants in 1841 and 1843. Vioget also served as a witness to Sutter's purchase of Fort Ross from the Russians in December 1841. Vioget was also Sutter's agent in San Francisco. In 1844, Governor Manuel Micheltorena granted Vioget Rancho Blucher. After his marriage to Maria Montero Benarides de Vasques in 1847, Vioget sold Rancho Blucher to Captain Stephen Smith, grantee of Rancho Bodega directly to the north. Vioget spent his last years in San Jose, where he died in 1855 and is buried.

History The University of Baeza was established in 1538 by a papal bull of Paul III. Its first rector was Saint John of Avila.Jos√© Biedma, Juan de √Åvila y la Universidad de Baeza, cibernous.com. Accessed online 2010-02-05.After successfully fending off an attempt in 1585 by the Augustinians to establish a rival university, in 1630, Pope Urban VIII granted it the status of a pontifical university, upon the demise of the university in nearby Ja√©n. The curriculum included liberal arts, medicine, and theology. Founded by notary Rodrigo L√≥pez, a relative of Pope Paul III, the school had important early participation from so-called New Christians‚Äîbourgeois Jews who had converted to Christianity rather than leave Spain‚Äîas well as from the Jesuits and the Carmelites; Saint John of the Cross participated in prayer seminars there. In terms of the battles over theology, the University of Baeza in its early years was distinctly on the modernizing side. Between its alumbrado mysticism and the Jewish ancestry of many of its faculty (including rector John of Avila), the university aroused the suspicions of the Spanish Inquisition. Many of its most popular faculty faced the Inquisition. While Hern√°n N√∫√±ez, Hernando de Herrera, Diego P√©rez de Valdivia and Bernardino de Carleval all escaped any formal conviction, the Inquisition effectively ended all of their careers, as they spent large portions of their lives entangled in its processes. Bernardino de Carleval was forced to formally recant a statement that the Jews were not responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus. Eventually, both the city and university went into a long decline, as did all urban settlements in the province of Ja√©n. The province increasingly became a rural backwater, a pattern that continued until quite recent times. The local aristocracy became absentees, at court in Madrid or living in other major Spanish cities, investing their wealth there rather than in Ja√©n and Baeza; the textile industry that had been the basis of local wealth went into a particular decline. Teaching at the university ossified, and an 1807 decree abolished the university. There was a brief, and rather weak, revival in 1815, followed by the definitive abolition of the university in 1824. In 1979, university-level education in Baeza was revived with the establishment of a \\"summer university\\", originally affiliated with the University of Granada and, since 1994, with the International University of Andalusia. The program is now known as the Antonio Machado Summer University, after the Spanish poet who lived for a time in the city.Ley 4/1994, de 12 de abril, de creaci√≥n de la Universidad Internacional de Andaluc√≠a.

It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on July 21, 1978 and to the National Register of Historic Places on May 17, 1984. History The two-story frame house was built by Jefferson Franklin Jackson in 1853. Jackson served as a United States Attorney for northern and central Alabama. He died during the Civil War years. His wife subsequently remarried to Thomas H. Watts, Governor of Alabama from 1863 to 1865. Descendants of the family owned the house into the 20th century and it remained a residence until 1943. The house was purchased in 1943 by the Montgomery City Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, an African American organization comprising twenty-five adult clubs and fifteen youth clubs, for use as a meeting place. The Montgomery City Federation had been formed in 1939 with a goal of promoting positive citizenship. The house became known as the Community House and was used as a Girl Scouts headquarters, a social and civic center, and, in December 1948, the first Montgomery library open to African Americans. Significantly, the house was used to host meetings of the Women's Political Council. They were the first group to officially call for a boycott of the racially segregated Montgomery bus system, leading to the Montgomery bus boycott.

While not reliably resistant to the explosive shells of opposing artillery, Mougin turrets remained active through 1940, when they engaged German and Italian forces during the Battle of France and the Italian invasion of France. The turrets were used at twenty-two forts of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system built in the 1870s. The Mougin turret was named for its designer, Commandant Mougin, who developed the first turret in 1875. The turret consists of two 155mm guns under a bowl-shaped armor shield, sunk into the ground and surrounded by a thick concrete apron that protected the multi- level traverse and loading facilities below. The turret is distinguished from naval turrets by the absence of protruding barrels. Two oval ports show just the muzzles of the guns. By contrast with naval practice, in which guns pivot in elevation on trunnions near their breeches, their muzzles and barrels protruding and moving in an arc, the Mougin turret's guns pivot at their muzzles, the barrel, gun carriage and breech ends rising and falling within the turret. This reduces the chances of enemy fire hitting the guns, a small risk on a moving ship, but significant for a fixed fortification. When the turret was under fire it moved the gun apertures away from the incoming fire, returning fire while rotating without pausing, when contact was made on the correct target azimuth. Description The visible portion of the turret was in diameter, in cast and rolled iron of four segments thick, with a fifth casting forming the thick top. The rotating gun and turret assembly weighed 160 tons, rotating on a circular rail around a hydraulically supported pivot. The movement of the turret initially required three teams of six men. After 1901 steam engines were installed to replace men. A full revolution took about two minutes, enough time to reload before the target azimuth was obtained again. Elevation varied from -5 degrees to +20 degrees. Mougin guns had a maximum range of about . The guns themselves were made by de Bange. 25 turrets were built at a cost of 205,000 francs each, primarily at Commentry near Montlu√ßon. Mougin Casemate A variant on the Mougin turret is the Mougin casemate, which employs the 155mm Model 1877 gun on a hydraulic traversing carriage within an armored concrete casemate. The casemate has exceptionally low overhead clearance, resulting in a low profile above the ground. The gun can be traversed over a 60 degree arc, and can be elevated between -5 degrees and +20 degrees. This narrow range limits the gun to direct fire with a range of , as most indirect fire requires greater elevation. The firing port measures by , and can be blocked with a thick counterweighted armored shield when not firing. An interlock prevents firing while the shield is in the way. The gun's muzzle remains behind the movable shield and is not visible from the outside. The shielding around the firing chamber is a mixture of masonry, concrete, steel armor and earth shielding. The limited angle of fire, coupled with problems of noise and ventilation, limited installations to ten locations. None were ever fired in action, and most were removed for scrap by the Germans in 1943, or by the French Army after the war. Trials The Mougin turret (top) and its German counterpart, as used during the Cotroceni tests A comparative evaluation between French Mougin turrets with de Bange guns and German Schumann-Gruson turrets with Krupp guns took place at Bucharest in 1883‚Äì84 under the supervision of Belgian General Henri Alexis Brialmont, who was then overseeing the design of the fortifications of Bucharest. The trials at Cotroceni revealed that the French turrets were more reliable, and had a higher rate of fire, but the German guns were more accurate. The French armor proved to be less durable under fire as well. Installations The first two Mougin turrets were installed at the Fort de Giromagny on the eastern defensive curtain of France near Belfort. Surviving Mougin turrets may be found at Fort de Saint-Cyr (guns missing), Fort de Villey-le-Sec, Fort de Vaujours (guns missing), Fort de Frouard, Fort de Liouville, Fort de Corbas, Fort Suchet (two turrets, one with guns, the other turret's guns removed to Villey-le-Sec), Fort de Domont (guns missing), and Fort de Stains (guns missing). Casemates Surviving Mougin casemates exist at Fort du Mont Bart (gun missing, replica in place), Fort de Cond√©-sur- Aisne (gun remains, training mechanism missing), Fort de Joux (two casemates, guns and mounts missing), Fort T√™te de Chien (gun missing), Fort des Ayvelles (destroyed) and the Batterie de l'Eperon (two casemates, parts of the mounting remain).

It also has locations in Baton Rouge and Detroit.Education students from Concordia University Ann Arbor teach through volunteering By Meredith Bruckner - Community News Producer of All About Ann Arbor The Southern District of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod founded the organization with financial support coming from the LCMS Worldrelief/Humancare, Laborers for Christ and the Orphan Grain Train. Camp Restore's facilities include: a mobile food preparation unit‚Äîdonated by Tyson Foods‚Äîfor over 300 people, showers, air-conditioned living space, bunk style beds and RV support. The housing serves as a base of operations for volunteers as they rebuild and restore the homes of people in the surrounding community. In 2006, over 300 homes had been assigned for these added to the restoration queue. A typical volunteer spends about a week at the camp and spends the vast majority of each day renovating homes and church buildings.Ross, Paula LCMS volunteer camp opens in New Orleans 02/04/2010 To date, the camp has served to accommodate over 3,500 volunteers who repaired the homes of over 200 families and the churches of three congregations. The organization also maintains a secondary goal of Christian ministry to those affected by the crisis and to improving the community through various projects. Many of the volunteers consist of members of other churches who travel to New Orleans as part of a group missions trip. The volunteers are provided accommodation at the camp while they serve as the labor force that rebuilds the community.DaveM 13 Lutheran Churches from Northwest Suburbs Send Mission Team to New Orleans In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama. Over one million households were displaced and over 250,000 homes destroyed. People from all over gave millions of dollars, and millions of volunteers traveled to the Gulf Coast to help those in need. Volunteer camps and tent cities sprung up along the coast to house and equip volunteer crews for ‚Äúmucking‚Äù and ‚Äúgutting‚Äù houses. The gargantuan task of rebuilding followed. In the days immediately after Hurricane Katrina, a relief team of talented people, a number of whom had been displaced by the storm, was assembled to plan the response of the Southern District Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod [LCMS]. Southern District President Kurtis Schultz asked Pastor David Lewis to serve as response coordinator. The Southern District Relief Team was established and the coordination of efforts and resources began to form with the purpose: ‚ÄúTo bring hope, healing, and recovery to our workers, our churches and schools, our members and our neighbors.‚Äù The efforts in the initial six months following the storm were immense. Assistance, encouragement and hands-on help were received from around the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod and beyond. Thousands of volunteers came to serve and millions of dollars were contributed to relief efforts. The scope of the effort was necessarily broad. This substantial response includes a huge volunteer-management effort, supplying salary support and counseling to affected church-workers, providing member- support activities, starting a community-development ministry, and giving ministry and facility grants to congregations. Three volunteer camps were established in cooperation with Lutheran Disaster Response and the Southern District LCMS: Camp Biloxi at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Biloxi, Mississippi, Camp Atonement at Atonement Lutheran Church in Metairie, Louisiana, and Camp Hope at Lamb of God Lutheran Church in Slidell, Louisiana. In addition to these camps, many other Lutheran congregations in the affected area have hosted volunteers and been instrumental in the relief effort. In the summer of 2006, plans were made to open Camp Restore in New Orleans on the once-flooded campus of Prince of Peace Lutheran Church and School. Laborers for Christ [LFC] (a ministry of Lutheran Church Extension Fund) began the process of renovating the campus and converting it into a volunteer construction camp. In August 2006 Rev. David Buss was appointed director of the Disaster Relief Team, replacing Lewis, who resumed his calling to plant a church in Northern Mississippi. Camp Restore was opened in October 2006 with Pastor Ed Brashier as camp director. Designed to accommodate up to 300 volunteers, Camp Restore is equipped with a large RV trailer park, indoor showers, air conditioning, and a portable restaurant kitchen custom-built on a semi trailer by Orphan Grain Train. In September 2007, RAI Ministries assumed operation of the volunteer hospitality operations of Camp Biloxi and assumed full operation of the camp in April 2008. RAI Ministries grew further with the 2007 Recovery Plan entitled ‚ÄúSpirit Kindle.‚Äù Subsidiary divisions were formed in order to achieve specific ministry initiatives. Those objectives were: further developing Christian outreach in time of disaster (REinstitute); networking churches for ministry and community development (LINCNewOrleans); and continuing to distribute resources to affected churches (Ministry Recovery). In August 2008 the Southern District granted complete legal separation to RAI Ministries, which now operates as an independent 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization. This was immediately followed by a figuratively and literally turbulent time as Hurricane Gustav hit the Louisiana coast while a major organizational restructuring was taking place. RAI emerged from the fall of 2008 with a renewed focus on three functions: housing volunteers at Camp Biloxi and Camp Restore; equipping and empowering them to restore faith, home and community; and providing case management support to ensure that Katrina survivors‚Äô needs were met as effectively as possible. By 2010 RAI‚Äôs volunteer camps had hosted over 30,000 volunteers and managed construction efforts to complete over 6,000 projects (2,750+ major home repairs and 4,000+ minor home repairs and other projects). Additionally, three churches and one school facility were restored. Over 1,000 cases were managed through grant contracts in both Louisiana and Mississippi. For the individual, the recovery process has had many obstacles: obstinate insurance companies, unscrupulous contractors, material shortages and endless government bureaucracy, just to name a few. Estimates place the recovery effort at taking a decade or longer. Thousands of homeowners continue the slow and often agonizing process of rebuilding. On top of the homes still needing repair, many community services and organizations dependent on volunteers remain hard-hit as well. Mindful of the continuing need, RAI Ministries began a three-year transformation in 2008 from a short-term disaster-relief organization to an ongoing, sustainable ministry that continues to connect volunteers from around the nation with opportunities to help restore faith, home and community in the Name of Jesus. As grant-based case management programs were brought to completion and Camp Biloxi was phased out, in 2010 organizational focus turned to continuing work through Camp Restore in New Orleans. Pastor David Goodine accepted the call to become the next executive director of RAI Ministries, and Buss transferred his leadership duties to Goodine in August 2010.

Academia Born in Molln, Austria, Stanzel finished his degree with Herbert Koziol in Graz. After his habilitation in 1955 he was professor in G√∂ttingen. In 1959 he was offered a position as professor (Ordinariat) in Erlangen. In 1962 he succeeded Koziol in Graz. Today he is a professor emeritus of English literature at the Karl- Franzens-Universit√§t Graz. Scholarship Since the 1950s Stanzel worked on an analytical topology for the description of the narrative mode, also often called \\"narrative situation\\" or \\"point of view\\" of narrative texts. Despite much criticism, his typological circle of three narrative situations is still taught in introductions to German literary studies at German universities (e. g. the introductions of the famous literary scholar Ansgar N√ºnning). Since the late 1990s, there is a stronger competition by the narrative model of the French narratologist G√©rard Genette in Germany. Stanzel's typological circle featuring \\"three typical narrative situations\\", which describes various possibilities of structuring the mediacity of narrative, is based on three elements. These are \\"mode\\", \\"person\\" and \\"perspective\\", which can be divided further into the oppositions \\"narrator/reflector\\", \\"first person/third person\\" and \\"internal perspective/external perspective\\". Thus, Stanzel distinguishes three narrative situations: The \\"authorial narrative situation\\" is characterised by the dominance of the external perspective. In the \\"First- person narrative situation\\", the events are related by a \\"narrating I\\" who takes part in the action in the fictional world as a character or as the \\"experiencing I\\". \\"The figural narrative situation\\" is marked by the dominance of the reflector mode, restricting to a factual representation or using internal focalisation to create the impression of immediacy.N√ºnning, Ansgar and Vera.

San Luis Rey is along the San Luis Rey River, northeast of downtown Oceanside. San Luis Rey has a post office with ZIP code 92068, which opened in 1861.ZIP Code Lookup History The area that is now known as San Luis Rey was originally home to Pay√≥mkawichum, or the Luise√±o. The Pay√≥mkawichum had a village of 5,000 people which was called Quechla. The community was named for Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, established in 1798, which is located near the geographic center of the neighborhood. The population of Quechla dropped down to 3,000 people soon after the establishment of the Mission due to diseases brought by the Spanish. This Mission at one point covered 950,000 acres and was tended by the Luiseno Indians, who were forcibly moved onto the Mission to work under the Spanish. Due to the extensive and long-lived influence of the Spanish and later the Mexican government, local architecture has taken on a noticeable Spanish and Mexican feel. The neighborhood also includes the Heritage Park Village and museum, which was the center of town for the city of Oceanside for a time. The Lilac Fire broke out on December 7, 2017, severely damaging the 240-acre San Luis Rey Downs horse-training facility and killing 46 horses.  Native American culture  The original residents of the valley now called San Luis Rey were Luise√±o Indians, also known as the San Luis Rey Band of the Luise√±o Indians. Although in other parts of the United States Native Americans were allowed to live autonomously on reservations, such an arrangement was denied to the Luise√±o Indians because the settlers wanted to keep the land for farming and ranching. Native Americans were granted US citizenship in 1924. Since 1996 the band hosts an annual inter-tribal powwow on the San Luis Rey Mission grounds, which is open to the public and presents Native American arts, crafts, food and dancing. On November 28, in honor of National Native American Heritage Month, the San Luis Rey city Council acknowledged the Mission Indians at its council meeting.

Article appeared in msnbc.com, 14 August 2005. Founded in 1974,http://lancsindustries.com/about.html Lancs Industries is headquartered, and has a facility in Kirkland, WA, with a field office in Warwick, RI, and provides products for both public and private entities such as, Naval shipyards, nuclear power plants, and Department of Energy lab facilities. History Lancs Industries was founded by Graham Hollingsworth. As a native of Lancashire, England, Hollingsworth was an employee of British Aircraft Corporation working as an aeronautical engineer who came to the United States in 1966 for an engineering exchange program with Boeing Aircraft. Choosing to remain in the U.S. as a Boeing employee after the exchange period ended, he worked on the Supersonic Transport (SST) program in the Seattle metropolitan area. This program was terminated and Hollingsworth ultimately left Boeing in 1974. Hollingsworth launched Lancs Industries in 1974, as a sign-making company serving the industrial safety market. Projects for Mare Island Naval Shipyard eventually led to the company's expansion into fabricating plastic barriers, containments, and protective gear using radio-frequency (RF) heat sealing technology. As the U.S. Nuclear Navy expanded throughout the 1970s, the need increased for radiological safety items used in construction and maintenance of nuclear-powered ships at Naval shipyards. Lancs worked closely with the Reactor Plant Services (RPS) group at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, designing, fabricating, and supplying these items. The use of lead wool radiation shielding and heat-sealed plastics for contamination control in commercial nuclear power plants took a dramatic upswing in 1979 as a result of the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. This led to the hiring of Ron Therrien from Electric Boat's RPS in 1983 to address the expanded market for Lancs products in all electrical utility-owned nuclear plants located in North America. As the Cold War progressed toward the eventual termination of the nuclear weapons program in 1989, the Nuclear Weapons Production Complex operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, consisting of many National laboratories and production facilities, was quickly transformed into a series of radiological decommissioning, decontamination, and remediation projects. These activities ignited a large and continuing demand for supplies and equipment needed to protect human workers from ionizing radiation and prevent the spread of radioactive contamination when dealing with radioactive waste operations. Personal protective equipment and clothing, containment tents, glovebags, drum liners, covers, flexible sleeving and sheeting, all became instrumental in performing this hazardous waste cleanup work. By the year 2001, Lancs had grown in size and reputation to the point that Hollingsworth decided to sell the company. The company was acquired in early 2002 by Tim Wiest, a former Naval officer in the nuclear power program and telecom industry executive. Under his direction, the company has continued to expand and address a wider set of customer needs with increased responsiveness and sophistication. Buoyed by an increase in spending in the nuclear power field, Lancs Industries posted record revenue for the company in 2009.http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2010/03/29/story7.html?surround=etf&ana;=e_article&b;=1269835200^3101011 Puget Sound Business Journal article on growth of nuclear power Company owner Tim Wiest expected a strong year in 2010 due to stimulus money and increased demand. \\"It's good to see the optimism for this industry,\\" He said.http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2010/03/29/story7.html?surround=etf&ana;=e_article&b;=1269835200^3101011 Puget Sound Business Journal article on growth of nuclear power Lancs Industries is a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Association.http://www.nuclearsuppliers.org/members/ NSA Members list Principles Many industries involve activities that expose workers to potential hazards. Physical hazards such as falling or fire, biological hazards such as infectious pathogens or disease, and material hazards such as chemicals or toxic carcinogens, must all be addressed by taking appropriate measures to reduce the risk of harm or injury to workers. The guiding principle is to keep this risk \\"as low as reasonably achievable\\" (ALARA). The ALARA principle is applied throughout the nuclear industry and environments involving radiological exposure, often driven by the field of Health Physics and common sense. While personnel exposure and dose limits are often explicitly set by a given institution, the methods of controlling exposure to minimize dose within those limits are left to the ALARA practices, which can be quite different from place to place. The Health Physics professionals often have Lancs Industries manufacture items according to the specific ALARA approach for their institution. The practice of ALARA can generally be considered a cost-benefit tradeoff. The selection of particular methods to control exposure involves optimizing the marginal cost of a given approach with the resulting benefit or reduction in overall dose. If the additional protection provided by an item reduces exposure risk by an amount that is judged to be beneficial compared to the additional cost of materials or labor required for that approach, then it will be reasonable to employ that approach. This is the essence of ALARA. Methods Loose radioactive particles can be found throughout a radiological work facility. Barriers made of flexible materials help to confine the spread of this contamination and to protect workers from exposure. Barriers can be in the form of different configurations such as, sleeving, glovebags, containment tents, catch containments, bags, covers and protective clothing. Sleeving provided on rolls is often cut to length and used to cover radioactive material to prevent the spread of contamination during handling. Typically made of PVC or Polyurethane film formed into a flexible tube, sleeving can cover pipes, hoses, and cables to provide a protective layer. To handle odd-sized objects, adequately sized sleeving is opened so an object can be inserted into the tube which is then twisted to enclose the item at both ends. Tape can be used to secure the twists in place, and then cut free for handling. This is commonly referred to as \\"horsetailing\\". Glovebags help to confine contamination at the source, limiting the spread to the space inside the glovebag. Glovebag chambers can be fabricated in limitless shapes and sizes, forming a barrier to enclose a workspace. With attached glovesleeves that allow access for handling, transfer ports to move objects into and out of the chamber, and service sleeves for tooling and ventilation, glovebags can be made to accommodate a wide range of operations on hazardous material without directly touching the items.

Prerequisites to improve  A single surgery requires the participation and collaboration of multiple parties: patient, surgeon, support staff (such as anesthesiologist), and device representative. Coordinating and confirming these parties is the responsibility of the surgical administrator's office. Surgery scheduling, therefore, may be implemented based on software resources that is readily available to schedulers and administrators from production and other service industry in a surgical practice. However the prerequisite is some standard in the applied surgery procedures, that provides time estimates for the operation in the surgery theatre and for the respective preparations before and after the invention in each patient's case.  US approaches to improve with healthcare administrators  As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the Federal government set aside over $20 billion of stimulus money to promote healthcare IT solutions. These funds were for \\"meaningful use\\" situations that included electronic health records (EHR) and other means to make healthcare more efficient, competitive, and affordable.\\"Included in the $787 billion ARRA is approximately $20 billion in funding for healthcare IT, including incentive payments to physicians who implement and use eligible electronic medical records systems under the conditions laid out in the law.\\", Government Technology News Report, March 4, 2009.

The current intention for retrospective statistical purposes does not prevent from perspective application for management purposes. However the adoption for the entire location requires mirroring the team set-ups and the local resources as available. Respective modeling of standard surgical intervention is required to compose the model for sequencing several cases and respective intervention in one shift of a team.  Legacy approaches for sole work positions  The first type of solution to be offered to the healthcare IT world was the traditional, legacy software system.\\"Legacy Systems\\" These applications, often part of a larger enterprise system, allow schedulers to use email and contact management processes. The surgical scheduling software is installed on a specific computer and is available to one or more users within the practice.  Server based solutions and web based solutions  Server based solutions may be seen as an intermediate step to allow surgical schedulers to tap into the power and convenience of the World Wide Web. These software as a service (SaaS) solutions are hosted on servers accessible via the Internet.\\"Software as a Service\\" The data and capabilities of the software are easily manageable from standard Internet connections or wireless devices such as laptops or smartphones. However minimum data security is not available for free with such approaches.  Adoption in the US  \\"Meaningful use\\" has resulted in a drastic increase in Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems being implemented in surgical practices across the US. Many of these systems have various features that help automate some tasks involved in the surgical scheduling process. However, EHR systems are not surgical scheduling solutions. They are primarily designed to manage the clinical data for surgery. There are very few dedicated surgical scheduling software vendors in the US.  Consolidation  Surgical scheduling software and online surgical scheduling tools have revolutionized the way surgical cases are managed. Schedulers can now instantly send case details to every participant on their list. The software enables recipients to respond with the touch of a button and perform other functions such as adding the schedule to their calendars. What used to take hours or days on the fax machine and phone now takes mere seconds.Stead, William W. and Lin, Herbert S. \\"Encourage initiatives to empower iterative process improvement and small-scale optimization‚Ä¶ these initiatives should also provide support for clinicians to work with computer science and IT experts to design prototype applications to support their improvement efforts.\\", Computational Technology for Effective Health Care.

Etymology , from Latin, , from ablative case of initium \\"entrance, beginning\\", related to verb inire \\"to go into, enter upon, begin\\". Uses Ab initio (abbreviation: ab init.) is used in several contexts, including the following: Law In law, ab initio refers to something being the case from the start or from the instant of the act rather than from when the court declared it so. For instance, the term \\"void ab initio\\" means \\"to be treated as invalid from the outset.\\" E.g., in many jurisdictions, if a person signs a contract under duress, that contract is treated as being \\"void ab initio\\". Typically, documents or acts which are void ab initio cannot be fixed and if a jurisdiction, a document or an act is so declared at law to be void ab initio, the parties are returned to their respective positions that they were at the beginning of the event. \\"Void ab initio\\" is often contrasted with \\"voidable\\", such documents which become void only as of the date of the judicial declaration to that effect. An insurer facing a claim from an insured who had deceived the insurer on a material fact would claim that the insurance contract was void ab initio; it was null and void from the beginning and that since there was no legally enforceable contract, the insurer ought not to have to pay. Science and engineering In general, a calculation is said to be ab initio (or \\"from first principles\\") if it relies on basic and established laws of nature without additional assumptions or special models. For example, an ab initio calculation of the properties of liquid water might start with the properties of the constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms and the laws of electrostatics and quantum mechanics. From these basics, the properties of isolated individual water molecules would be derived, followed by computations of the interactions of larger and larger groups of water molecules, until the bulk properties of water had been determined. *Documentation of a process is said to be ab initio (or from scratch, or from the ground up) if the documentation shows how to set up and complete the process from basic materials (to which a competent practitioner is expected to have access) without prior special preparation. * In nuclear physics, the mass-energy of different nuclei can be determined with ab initio methods by solving the Schr√∂dinger equation over all particles. * Likewise in chemistry, this refers to ab initio quantum chemistry methods. * In biophysics, this refers to a method for the prediction of protein structures in protein folding. * In bioinformatics, ab initio (or de novo) methods make predictions about biological features using only a computational model without extrinsic comparison to existing data. * In aviation, this refers to the very first stage of flight training. Other uses * In literature, a story told ab initio is told from the beginning. This is as opposed to in medias res (in the middle of the story). * In learning a subject or foreign language, ab initio refers to study without previous knowledge or assumptions.

The foundation was founded in New York City in 2007 by Patrick Donohue, whose daughter, Sarah Jane, was violently shaken by her baby nurse when she was five days old, causing a severe brain injury. The mission of the Sarah Jane Brain Foundation is to advance knowledge of the brain, to prevent brain injury in childhood, and to care for those who suffer such injury. One of its primary goals is to fully fund and implement the National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan (PABI Plan), which seeks to create a system of care accessible to all children and young adults with a pediatric acquired brain injury in the United States. Founding Sarah Jane Donohue was five days old when she was shaken violently by her baby nurse, resulting in two broken collarbones, four broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury resulting in the loss of more than 60% of the rear cortex of her brain. Her nurse pleaded guilty to child abuse and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and her story captured the national media, including NBC‚Äôs Today Show, CNN, Good Morning America, two New York Post articles, New York Daily News, and The New York Times. After Sarah Jane‚Äôs injury, her father, Patrick Donohue, began laying the groundwork for what would become the Sarah Jane Brain Foundation by creating a website and posting Sarah Jane‚Äôs updates online for family and friends about her progress. They received tens of thousands of messages and prayers for Sarah Jane from all over the world when the story became front page news. With the goal of streamlining and standardizing the system of care for pediatric acquired brain injury in mind, Donohue not only posted his daughter‚Äôs records online, but soon moved on to Phase 2 of the Sarah Jane Brain Project: the establishment of a National Advisory Board of professional and family experts in the field of pediatric acquired brain injury. More than 75 of the SFJF's initial National Advisory Board members met in New York from January 8‚Äì10, 2009 to draft the National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan (National PABI Plan) to develop a seamless, standardized, evidence-based system of care, accessible for every family in the United States affected by this injury. The plan recognizes the multiple needs of these patients and families by designating seven categories of care: 1) Prevention 2) Acute Care 3) Reintegration 4) Adult Transition 5) Mild TBI 6) Rural/Telehealth and 7) The Virtual Center of Excellence. Letter to President Obama On January 20, 2009, Patrick Donohue sent the first letter to newly inaugurated President Barack Obama calling on him to address the leading cause of death and disability for children and young adults in the United States, Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury. In the letter, Donohue shared the story of his daughter Sarah Jane‚Äôs injury, outlined the need for a National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan, and asked the President and his administration for their cooperation in passing and implementing this plan. Apple \\"Baby Shaker\\" app In April 2009 a controversial app for the iPhone called ‚ÄúBaby Shaker\\" was released, and the same day discovered by Jennipher Dickens, a mother of a child who had been shaken at 7 weeks old by his then 21-year-old biological father. The child's mother later became a full-time volunteer for the Sarah Jane Brain Foundation. The app worked by shaking the iPhone until a pair of thick red Xs appeared over each eye of a baby drawn in black and white. The app was added to and then pulled from Apple‚Äôs App Store after protests about the program's offensive nature. Marilyn Barr, founder of the National Center of Shaken Baby Syndrome and board member of the Sarah Jane Brain Foundation‚Äôs Advisory Board commented ‚ÄúNot only are they making fun of Shaken Baby Syndrome but they are actually encouraging it. This is absolutely terrible.‚Äù Patrick Donohue sent an email of strong complaint to Apple‚Äôs CEO Steve Jobs and several Vice Presidents. After initially offering no comment, Apple finally apologized and removed the app. The Sarah Jane Brain Foundation joined forces with Prevent Child Abuse America, the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome and two of America‚Äôs leading doctors who are experts in the prevention of Abusive Head Trauma (Shaken Baby Syndrome) and announced a joint effort with Soma Creates, a developer of iPhone based toys, to create applications to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome. American PABI Heroes Tour The American PABI Heroes Tour was a 12-city, 11,000 mile nationwide tour to raise awareness for Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury and promote local philanthropy through music. In most of the cities, a panel of experts about PABI were assembled to discuss the challenges for families and professionals and in most of the cities local musicians competed. One winner was chosen from each city to participate in the Grand Finale at Webster Hall in New York City. The tour was hosted by recording artist Kristy Kay, the voice of Barbie. At the Finale ZC Flawless a Drum Line from Chicago, IL was declared the winner of the 2009 American PABI Heroes Tour. Introduction of HCR 198 On October 13, 2009, United States Representative G.K. Butterfield (NC-1), along with over 40 bi-partisan original co-sponsors, introduced H. Con. Res. 198 during the 111th Congress. In this resolution, Congress endorses the National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan (PABI Plan) as the best plan to prevent, identify and treat all acquired brain injuries from birth until 25 years of age and encourages federal, state and local governments to implement it. The non- binding Resolution eventually secured more than 110 co-sponsors from both parties and across the nation, creating a broad base of support for the National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan Act, which was introduced in July 2011. Zackery Lystedt Brain Project Zackery Lystedt is a former youth football player who, in 2006, spent 31 days in a coma following a brain injury sustained during a middle school football game. Lystedt, then 13, returned to the field after banging his helmet hard on the ground, and collapsed into his father‚Äôs arms following the game as a result of his injuries. Lystedt spent the next month in a coma, and was unable to speak for nine months, unable to move for thirteen months. Lystedt‚Äôs story inspired Washington state lawmakers to enact legislation in his name protecting student-athletes from repeated brain trauma. SJBF founder, Patrick Donohue, testified at the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary hearing entitled ‚ÄúHead and Other Injuries in Youth, High School, College and Professional Football‚Äù on Monday, February 1, 2010, in Houston, Texas. He described the upcoming Super Bowl week announcement about the Zackery Lystedt Brain Project. The Zackery Lystedt Brain Project was announced at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine on February 3, 2010. The Zackery Lystedt Brain Project is a joint initiative between the American College of Sports Medicine and the Sarah Jane Brain Foundation which advocates for the passage of youth sports concussion legislation in all 50 states to protect student-athletes from concussions and other brain injuries during training, practice and competition. State bills are expected to be modeled after Washington‚Äôs ‚ÄúZack Lystedt Law‚Äù which mandates the removal from play for any athlete suspected of a concussion during play, with medical clearance needed before an athlete is able to return to play, as well as provides education and treatment guidelines for coaches, athletic trainers, players and parents. To date, 49 states have passed such legislation Sarah Jane's visit to the White House Sarah Jane Donohue, her father, and other members of the SJBF International Advisory Board, discussed Sarah Jane's letter to President Barack Obama at an early-afternoon press conference on Monday, July 26, 2010. The letter was later hand-delivered to President Obama at the 20th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act celebration at a White House celebration held that evening. The letter proposed a White House Summit hosted by President Obama to begin implementing the National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan and asked the President for his support of H. Con. Res. 198. National PABI Plan Tour The Sarah Jane Brain Foundation launched the ‚Äú2011 National Pediatric Brain Injury Plan Tour‚Äù during NHL All Star Weekend in North Carolina with a presentation about the PABI Plan at East Carolina University. This was the first of over 70 events in a six-month tour that covered over 30 states. The tour sponsored by Easton- Bell Sports, focused on two types of presentations. The first was a presentation for high school students which focused on sports concussions. The second type of presentation focused around the PABI Plan and was intended for people in the medical profession. Introduction of PABI Plan Act (HR 2600) On July 20, 2011, the National Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury Plan Act (National PABI Plan Act) was introduced to Congress as HR 2600 by Rep. Leonard Lance (R, NJ-7) with 50 original bi-partisan co-sponsors. The bill would provide $2.9 billion in federal funding across all 52 PABI Plan-designated State Lead Centers to implement the PABI Plan over the course of seven years. All funds would be drawn from the discretionary budget of the Department of Health and Human Services, thereby adding no additional monies to the national debt. The legislation has more than 110 co-sponsors, including conservative members of Congress such as Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN) as well as the liberal members such as Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-WI Additionally, more than 35 professional and advocacy organizations have endorsed and/or provided letters of support for the legislation including many national sports organizations. This was announced on March 1, 2012, during a press conference with Rep. Lance. The legislation has also garnered editorial support from The South Bend Tribune, Ventura County (CA) Star, and The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, WA, as well as a published op-ed in the Milford (MA) Daily News and coverage by the Deseret News, Utah‚Äôs oldest daily newspaper.  The International Academy of Hope (iHOPE)  The International Academy of Hope ‚Äì NYC (iHOPE-NYC) is a highly specialized brain injury school in New York City founded by Patrick Donohue in September 2013. It meets a significant and unmet need in our NYC community, while also serving as a world-class model of best practices and high tech solutions in the delivery of educational brain injury services. The school raises the bar for standards of care by promulgating best practices, supporting innovative treatments, and sharing knowledge through both on-site and remotely delivered training. After an initial period, the model will be replicated in other major metropolitan areas of the country and around the world. There is no established leader in the educational landscape for children and youth with brain injury, and the International Academy of Hope is poised to step into this void, offering leadership, sharing its expertise, and dramatically improving the outcomes for the many American youth and others worldwide affected by brain injury and other brain-based disorders. The mission of iHOPE is to transform the manner in which educational services are delivered to students with brain injuries in this country and abroad and to be the worldwide leader in advancing evidence-based services to these students. The school‚Äôs vision is to create the best brain injury schools in the world. It will serve as the exemplar, pilot program and change agent for modeling best educational practices. iHOPE will be a core beneficiary of the research promulgated through the PABI Plan, and will spur the migration of promising research and treatment into evidence-based educational practices. It will also provide leadership beyond the boundaries of its doors through advanced tele- education and tele-training programming. iHOPE‚Äôs program description consists of a variety of services to meet the needs of the children, which includes the Academic Curriculum, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech and Language Therapy, AAC Systems, Vision, and Conductive Education. The school opens its doors at 7:30 a.m. every morning to allow students to arrive early and have their breakfast. The school is open until 5:00 p.m. every day to allow all of the related services to be provided in one location and based upon the time of the day that is most appropriate for the student. This also allows for the students to return home around the same time as many parents/caregivers are returning from work. This eliminates the need for parents/caregivers to find highly specialized babysitting for a couple of hours each day while coordinating any additional related services the student may need. Daily schedules are highly individualized based on the needs of each student in attendance at iHOPE-NYC, and according to their Individualized Education Plan (IEP); therefore, no student‚Äôs schedule looks alike.

It was produced by Mel Gibson's Icon Entertainment and starring Chris Marquette, E. Quincy Sloan, Brooke Nevin, Kinsey Packard, Deborah Geffner and Ray Wise. It was filmed in Bulgaria. Plot Cooper (Chris Marquette) is a slacker and he works as a telemarketer. On a Friday, he turns up late for work and is promptly fired by his boss, Maureen (Deborah Geffner). He is fired for coming late, driving customers away, and fooling around in the office. Shortly after, an extremely loud sound is heard and Cooper faints with pained expressions on his face. Cooper wakes up a few days later, only to find himself nauseous, weak and covered in webbing (cocooned) in his office. As Cooper struggles out of the cocoon, he is attacked by a big, beetle-like, bug. He fights the bug away and helps his boss Maureen out of a cocoon. Maureen regains consciousness and realizes that her daughter, Sara (Brooke Nevin) was waiting for her outside the office. Cooper and Maureen go outside to check on Sara, who is unconscious and trapped inside a cocoon in her car. As Cooper is helping Sara out of the cocoon, Maureen is attacked and captured by a large, wasp-like creature. Other bugs surround them and they use Sara's car alarm to distract the bugs and escape to a restaurant. There they revive Cindy (Kinsey Packard), Hugo (E. Quincy Sloan), Hugo's father Albert (Wesley Thompson), Leechee (Linda Park), Roger (Bru Muller), PJ (Vlado Mihailov) and a Cop (Todd Jenson). PJ and Roger decide to escape in Roger's truck against the advice of others. They are attacked by the bugs and in the chaos PJ, Roger and the cop are killed. Albert is stung by a bug, while Cooper saves Cindy from being crushed by Roger's runaway truck, with the rest of the group deciding to stay indoors. Leechee and the group make their way to roof of a building and see a group of the wasps flying toward them. The group then realize that the bugs are blind and they use sound to track their victims, as the wasps did not attack them. They use a radio to lure a bug in a storage closet and milk it to identify the contents of its venom. Leechee analyses the venom and realizes that it contains sedatives and some proteins. They decide to go to the nearest military airbase at Gibson the next day and decide to camp for the night in the same building. They also see the bug hive, which is emitting red colored gas. The next day, the group leave the building to make their way to Cooper's dad, while Leechee decides to stay behind to help revive more people and to study the bugs. The rest of the group sets off and goes to Hugo's and Albert's house first. Albert's wife seems to have died of natural causes. They next go to Cindy's brother, Chad's (Mike Straub) house. Cindy finds her sister-in-law Susan (Daniela Tonova) cocooned and she revives her. They also find Chad, who has mutated into a large spider-like creature because of a giant wasp sting. Chad is collecting cocooned humans and he attacks the group, killing Susan, knocking out Sara, impaling Cooper when he tries to save Cindy and is finally killed by Hugo and Albert. They camp for the night at Chad's house and Sara patches up Cooper. Cindy wants Cooper to ditch the group and come with her but Cooper is in love with Sara and he turns down the offer. The next day they decide to go to Cooper's dad, Ethan's (Ray Wise) house. Ethan is a former military personnel who has weapons and a bunker at his house. Sara informs Cooper that she intends to go to the bug hive to find her mother. Cooper tries to convince her to come with him to a military airbase but she doesn't agree. They come across a few flying bugs and hide under a bridge. Cindy sees Cooper and Sara holding hands, becomes furious, and shouts to attract the bugs towards the group. Albert shoots Cindy to save the group but Sara is captured by the bugs. Finally the group reaches Ethan's house and Albert turns into a mutant, similar to Chad. Hugo shoots his father to save himself, Ethan, and Cooper. Cooper tries to convince Ethan to help him save Sara but when he fails he leaves Ethan and Hugo behind. Cooper is captured by another group and they lock him up in a prison cell in an abandoned police station. There he meets a Puerto Rican man, who tells him that he was part of Leechee's group and that he thinks the others died in the explosion caused by the flammable red colored gas released by the bugs and the nest. Hugo and Ethan are captured by the same group. It is revealed that Ethan has been stung by a wasp and the Puerto Rican man turns into a mutant. Ethan uses the distraction to kill the members of the enemy group and save Cooper and Hugo. Meanwhile, Sara wakes up in the bug hive and comes across the queen consuming cocooned humans. Ethan, Hugo and Cooper reach the hive. Ethan hand-cuffs Cooper to a tree and hits Hugo in the head. He leaves the keys so that Cooper and Hugo can escape. Ethan enters the hive alone to destroy it and he comes across Sara. Sara offers to take Ethan to the queen. Ethan and Sara are then attacked by the queen. Hugo and Cooper enter the bug hive, arriving in time to help Sara and Ethan. The group begin to attack the queen with their weapons. This only angers the queen, who begins to wail loudly. As the group cower in pain at the volume of the wail, Hugo, who was unable to hear the wail as he had lost his hearing, throws the explosives into queens mouth. Ethan asks Sara, Cooper and Hugo to escape from the bug hive while he triggers the explosive. But soon after, Ethan turns into a mutant. Cooper takes the remote from his father and triggers the explosive, obliterating the nest and the insects inside. The film ends with Cooper, Sara and Hugo turning toward the sound of a large rumbling. The source of this rumbling is not specified as the film then turns to black in a cliffhanger. The rumbling is suggested to be either the insects returning or the Army finally arriving to deal with the infestation.

The film is also known as Joseph Sold by His Brothers, Joseph and His Brethren (American DVD box title) and Sold into Egypt in the United Kingdom. It was the last film of Belinda Lee.  Plot summary  Joseph, son of Israel (Jacob) and Rachel, lived in the land of Canaan with eleven brothers and one sister. He was Rachel's firstborn and Israel's eleventh son. Of all the sons, Joseph was loved by his father the most. Israel even arrayed Joseph with a \\"long coat of many colors\\".Another possible translation is \\"coat with long sleeves\\" - see \\"A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature\\", 1903. Israel's favoritism toward Joseph caused his half brothers to hate him, and when Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain. Then, all of the grain bundles that had been prepared by the brothers gathered around Joseph's bundle and bowed down to it. In the second dream, the sun (father), the moon (mother) and eleven stars (brothers) bowed down to Joseph himself. When he told these two dreams to his brothers, they despised him for the implications that the family would be bowing down to Joseph. They became jealous that their father would even ponder over Joseph's words concerning these dreams. () They saw their chance when they were feeding the flocks, the brothers saw Joseph from afar and plotted to kill him. They turned on him and stripped him of the coat his father made for him, and threw him into a pit. As they pondered what to do with Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan of Ishmaelites coming out of Gilead, carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, for trade. Judah, the strongest, thought twice about killing Joseph and proposed that he be sold. The traders paid twenty pieces of silver for Joseph, and the brothers took Joseph's coat back to Jacob, who was lied to and told that Joseph had been killed by wild animals. Potiphar's house The Biblical story is clear Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers led by Judah, \\"Come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites\\" there\\" (). In Egypt, Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard \\"bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there\\" (). While serving in Potiphar's household, Yahweh was with Joseph so that he prospered in everything he did. Joseph found favor in the sight of Potiphar and so he became his personal servant. Then Joseph was promoted to oversee Potiphar's entire household as a superintendent. After some time, Potiphar's wife began to desire Joseph and sought to have an affair with him. Despite her persistence, he refused to have sexual intercourse with her for fear of sinning against God. After some days of begging for him, she grabbed him by his cloak, but he escaped from her leaving his garment behind. Angered by his running away from her, she took his garment and made a false claim against him by charging that he tried have sexual intercourse with her. This resulted in Joseph being thrown into prison ().Josephus claims that Potiphar basically fell for his wife's crocodile tears even though he couldn't believe that Joseph was capable of \\"making sport\\" of his wife (Josephus, The Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, 4.1‚Äì5). Joseph in prison The warden put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners, and soon afterward Pharaoh's chief cup bearer and chief baker, who had offended the Pharaoh, were thrown into the prison. They both had dreams, and they asked Joseph to help interpret them. The chief cup bearer had held a vine in his hand, with three branches that brought forth grapes; he took them to Pharaoh and put them in his cup. The chief baker had three baskets of bread on his head, intended for Pharaoh, but some birds came along and ate the bread. Joseph told them that within three days the chief cup bearer would be reinstated but the chief baker would be hanged. Joseph requested the cup bearer to mention him to Pharaoh and secure his release from prison, but the cup bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph. After Joseph was in prison for two more years, Pharaoh had two dreams which disturbed him. He dreamt of seven lean cows which rose out of the river and devoured seven fat cows; and, of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. Pharaoh's wise men were unable to interpret these dreams, but the chief cup bearer remembered Joseph and spoke of his skill to Pharaoh. Joseph was called for, and interpreted the dreams as foretelling that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine, and advised Pharaoh to store surplus grain during the years of abundance. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations \\"from all over the earth\\" came to Egypt to buy bread as this nation was the only Kingdom prepared for the seven-year drought. Brothers sent to Egypt In the second year of famine, Joseph's half brothers were sent to Egypt, by their father Israel, to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him to be their brother Joseph. However, Joseph did recognize them and did not receive them kindly, rather he disguised himself and spoke to them in the Egyptian language using an interpreter. He did not speak at all to them in his native tongue, Hebrew. After questioning them as to where they came from, he accused them of being spies. They pleaded with him that their only purpose was to buy grain for their family in the land of Canaan. After they mentioned that they had left a younger brother at home, the Vizier (Joseph) demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This brother was Joseph's blood brother, Benjamin. He placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. Joseph sent the brothers back with food but kept one brother, and the remaining brothers returned to their father in Canaan, and told him all that had transpired in Egypt. They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men. After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah's persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution. Upon their return to Egypt, the brothers were afraid because of the returned money in their money sacks. Then when they get there Joseph reveals to them that he is in fact their brother, Joseph. Then he has their father Jacob brought so they are all reunited in Egypt.

The first hotel was built in 1880 by George W. Marshall (1838-1917) and his partner John B. Goff and was located just west of confluence of the Firehole River and Nez Perce Creek. A second hotel, the Firehole Hotel, was built in 1884 in partnership with George Graham Henderson very near the present day Nez Perce Picnic area. The hotels operated for eleven years under various ownership ceasing operation in 1891. By 1895, all the structures except a few cabins associated with the two hotels had been razed. 1880-1884 George W. Marshall George Marshall had a U.S. government mail contract to carry mail from Virginia City, Montana to Mammoth Hot Springs in 1879. It was cancelled at the end of that year. The route from Virginia City to Mammoth took Marshall over the Madison Plateau on the Old Fountain Pack Trail (abandoned today). This trail passed right by the confluence of the Firehole River and Nez Perce Creek on its way to Mammoth. Upon losing his mail contract, Marshall chose to build a cabin on the Firehole River with the aim of servicing visitors to the park. In the 1881 season, there were six rooms in the hotel, a lounge, a dining room, a kitchen and quarters for the Marshalls. There were two guest rooms. An 1881 visitor described the hotel thus: 1885 In May 1885, Marshall (age 39) and his wife Sarah decided to sell out. With four children having spent four seasons, including four winters in Yellowstone, he sold his interest in the hotel to his partner George Graham Henderson. Henderson had partnered with Henry Klamer, the son-in-law of George L. Henderson (no relation) the owner of the Cottage Hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs. Klamer would later be the owner of the Old Faithful store that is now known as the Lower Hamilton Store. Once Henderson and Klamer owned the property, they renamed it The Firehole Hotel. 1886-1891 In 1886, through a series of ownership transfers, the hotel became the property of the Yellowstone Park Association, owned by Charles Gibson. The Association was becoming the preeminent concessionaire in the park at the time. They were building the Mammoth Hotel (completed in 1886), operated tent hotels at Norris and Canyon, and eventually completed the first Canyon Hotel in 1890. Park visitation was increasing every year and these hotels‚ÄîMammoth and Canyon were setting a new standard; one that Marshall's could not meet. In 1886, the U.S. Army took charge of Yellowstone, and then military superintendent Captain Moses Harris began a campaign to rid the park of this particular hotel. In official reports he wrote: Unfavorable accounts from visitors such as this one did not help the hotel: The location of Marshall's was fully a away from the nearest geysers and plans were being made for bigger and better hotels at Lake Hotel and at the Fountain Paint Pots. Army administration of the park had allowed significant improvement of the park's road system and travel time between attractions were significantly shorter than a decade previous. The Yellowstone Park Association constructed the significantly larger and more luxurious Fountain Hotel very near Fountain Paint Pots in 1890 and opened it in the spring of 1891. By June 1891, all the old Marshall or Firehole Hotel properties had been vacated and operations transferred to the Fountain Hotel. The Fountain Hotel operated until 1916. Most of the older Marshall buildings were burned in 1891, but a few survived until 1895 when the Firehole Hotel itself was razed. Notable visitors and events Firehole Hotel, 1885 * In September 1885, the son of General Oliver O. Howard of the Nez Perce War of 1877, 19-year-old John Howard was visiting the park with his brother James, General Howard, his wife and John's fiancee, a Miss Chase. During their stay at Marshall's, James and John got in a very heated argument over Miss Chase. After another argument with Miss Chase herself, John Howard attempted suicide by shooting himself in the chest. He survived and convalesced in the hotel, but the incident made two separate editions of the Livingston Enterprise. * Known to have stayed at the hotel in 1881 were Wyoming Territorial Governor John W. Hoyt and then Senator Benjamin Harrison (later the 23rd President of the United States). * Sarah and George Marshall's fourth child Rosa Park Marshall was born at the hotel on January 31, 1881. Rosa Marshall is purportedly the first white child born in the park. Northern Pacific Railway surveyors working is North Dakota in 1882 named Rosa Lake , a small lake near Cavalier, ND in her honor. * During the 1884 season, noted naturalist, George Bird Grinnell visited Marshall's and later wrote the following in Forest and Stream about the site as he approached from the west: * In 1886, Charles Warren Stoddard Mattie Culver grave One of the few marked graves in Yellowstone outside of the Mammoth Hot Springs area is that of Mattie S. Culver, age 30, who died of tuberculosis at the hotel on March 2, 1889. Mrs. Culver was the wife of the hotel's winter keeper, E. C. Culver. Because of frozen ground at the time, Culver's body was stored in two end-to- end barrels outside the hotel until spring. Adelaide Child, the wife of the Yellowstone Park Improvement Company president Harry W. Child, ensured a proper burial, memorial and fenced in tombstone near the hotel. The grave is visible today a few west of the Nez Perce Picnic Area.

Cab locations On steam locomotives, the cab is normally located to the rear of the firebox, although steam locomotives have sometimes been constructed in a cab forward or camelback configuration. The cab, or crew or driver's compartment of a diesel or electric locomotive will usually be found either inside a cabin attached to a hood unit or cowl unit locomotive, or forming one of the structural elements of a cab unit locomotive. The former arrangement is now the norm in North America for all types of diesel or electric locomotives. In Europe, most modern locomotives are cab units with two cabs, one at each end. However, the locomotives powering some high speed European trains are normally cab units with one cab, and European shunting locomotives are usually hood units. On self-propelled rail vehicles, the cab may be at one or both ends. Typical features In addition to the locomotive controls, a cab will typically be fitted with windshields, rectangular side windows, crew seats, heating, and sometimes radios, air conditioning and toilets. Different types of locomotive cabs are: * Boxcab * Steeplecab *Turret * Hood unit * Cowl unit Historical development The earliest locomotives, such as Stephenson's Rocket, had no cab; the locomotive controls and a footplate for the crew were simply left open to the elements. However, to protect locomotive crews against adverse weather conditions, locomotives gradually came to be equipped with a roof and protective walls, and the expression \\"cab\\" refers to the cabin created by such an arrangement. By about 1850, high speed Crampton locomotives operating in Europe already had a much needed windshield giving some protection to the footplate area. Some other early locomotives were even fitted with a cab as part of a rebuilding program, an example being the locomotive John Bull. In Germany, the locomotive cab was introduced by the Saxon railway director and writer Max Maria von Weber. However, until 1950 the railway directorates of the German-speaking countries continued to believe that a standing posture was essential to maximise crew vigilance. Steam locomotive drivers, who had to lean out of their cabs for better visibility, therefore frequently developed occupational diseases, along with rheumatism, and electric locomotive drivers suffered from wear to the knees. This unsatisfactory situation changed‚Äîwith few exceptions‚Äîonly with the construction of the German standard electric locomotives, which for the first time were equipped with crew seats. Meanwhile, the maintenance of crew vigilance became possible by technical means through the use of Sifa devices.

Situated at the point where Avery's Trace crossed the river, the fort provided an important stopover for migrants and merchants travelling from the Knoxville area to the Nashville area in the 1790s.Benjamin Nance, Fort Blount. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 5 February 2010. After the fort was abandoned around 1800, the community of Williamsburg developed on the site and served as county seat for the newly formed Jackson County from 1807 and 1819. The fort and now vanished village sites were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Constructed in 1788, Avery's Trace crossed the Cumberland River at a natural river ford known as \\"Crossing of the Cumberland,\\" where sandbars made it possible to wade across for much of the year. A ferry was established in 1791, and the following year a blockhouse was built on the river's east bank. In 1794, a larger fort was constructed on the west bank of the river opposite the ferry. Eventually named for Southwest Territory governor William Blount, the fort was garrisoned by militia and later by U.S. Army regulars until it was closed in 1798.Smith (2000), p. 1. Excavations conducted by the Tennessee Division of Archaeology between 1989 and 1994 revealed the fort's location and provided evidence of its shape. Location The Fort Blount site is on an embankment overlooking the west side of the Cumberland River about above the mouth of the river. (This section of the river is now part of Cordell Hull Lake). The embankment is at the eastern end of a peninsula created by a narrow turn in the river called Smith's Bend. Smith's Bend Road, which intersects Tennessee State Highway 53 in the Gladdis community west of Gainesboro, traverses the peninsula and provides the chief road access to the area. The old Williamsburg community was near the Williams Cemetery, which contains the graves of early settler Sampson Williams and his wife, Margaret. It was about southwest of Fort Blount.For the site's plan, see Smith (2000), p. 87. The Fort Blount Ferry was near the end of Smith's Bend Road, which it connected to the Flynn Creek community across the river. Most of Smith's Bend is still private farmland, though the Army Corps of Engineers, which built Cordell Hull Dam, manages several recreational areas along the peninsula's lakeshore. History Fort Blount Late-19th century map showing Fort Blount in relation to Bledsoe's Station and other 18th-century outposts in Tennessee's Upper Cumberland region In 1788, the governor of North Carolina commissioned the construction of a road to connect the Washington District of what is now East Tennessee with the Mero District in Middle Tennessee, to make it easier for travellers to cross the rugged Cumberland Plateau region. Known as Avery's Trace, the road crossed the Cumberland River at the natural ford known as the \\"Crossing of the Cumberland\\", which then was at the eastern edge of Sumner County.Smith (2000), pp. 11-19, 35. In 1791, Sampson Williams (1762-1841), an early Nashville pioneer and sheriff of Davidson County, was granted the right to operate a ferry at this spot.Smith (2000), pp. 38-49. The grave of Sampson Williams (1762-1841), near the Fort Blount site The influx of settlers to Middle Tennessee after the American Revolution agitated tensions between the Native Americans and white settlers, and Indian attacks rose sharply. A series of small forts, called \\"stations,\\" were built throughout Middle Tennessee during the 1780s and 1790s. In 1792, Governor William Blount instructed Sampson Williams to raise a militia force and built a blockhouse at the Crossing of the Cumberland. The blockhouse was completed in late 1792 or early 1793, possibly with help from a detachment led by Major Hugh Beard, and was sometimes called \\"Beard's blockhouse.\\" Williams was commissioned a lieutenant and commanded the garrison, which consisted of a handful of local volunteer militiamen. In 1794, Secretary of War Henry Knox-- who believed blockhouses were inadequate protection-- suggested that Governor Blount replace the blockhouse with a strong stockade. The new fort was completed in 1794 and was called \\"Fort Blount\\". Sampson Williams, who had established a tavern at the ferry, provided provisions for the fort's garrison. The original militia garrison was commanded by William Gillespie for most of 1795 and by Oliver Williams (Sampson's brother) in 1796. After Tennessee became a state in 1796, Governor John Sevier discharged the militia garrison, and the following year a company of U. S. regulars commanded by Captain William Rickard took charge of the post. The garrison, which guarded the supply lines, was there only a few months. By February 1798, Fort Blount was abandoned.Smith (2000), pp. 58-65. In 1796, French botanist Andr√© Michaux was staying at Fort Blount when he discovered the rare American yellowwood tree in the surrounding forests.Jill Thomas, Michaux's Discovery Marked. The Cookeville Herald-Citizen, 24 April 2005. Retrieved: 4 February 2010. The following year, future French King Louis-Philippe passed through Fort Blount, and reported it was being modified or replaced. In 1802, Michaux's son, Fran√ßois Andr√© Michaux (1770-1855), travelling with prominent early Middle Tennessean Moses Fiske, stayed at the Williams' tavern. He reported that Fort Blount had been demolished. Williamsburg The site of Williamsburg, looking toward what was once the jail and courthouse After the closure of the fort, Sampson Williams purchased most of the property and adjacent land, establishing a sizeable plantation. In 1800, the \\"Fort Blount\\" post office opened with Williams as post master. Until 1805, Williams' land was part of Smith County, and the Smith County court convened at Williams' tavern several times. In 1805, the county boundaries were redrawn, and the Williams plantation was now in Jackson County. In 1806, the Tennessee legislature authorized the purchase of of the Williams farm to create a county seat. The town was incorporated as \\"Williamsburg\\" the following year.Smith (2000), pp. 65-69. Besides the courthouse and jail, completed in 1808, Williamsburg included a hotel, a general store, and at least five houses, reached by the Fort Blount ferry. Residents in eastern Jackson County complained that the courthouse was too far away, requiring them to make a 2-day round trip. In 1818, Jackson County voters moved the seat to a more central location and the town of Gainesboro was established.M. J. Tanse, Jackson County, Tennessee (M. J. Tanse, 1989), p. 17. Williamsburg was de- incorporated in 1820. Later history View of the Cumberland River at the former site of Fort Blount Ferry After the county seat's removal, Sampson Williams purchased the old courthouse, which he modified as an elaborate residence. He continued to operate an inn and ferry, and his plantation grew to several hundred acres and worked by 20 or 30 slaves. After his death in 1841, his son-in-law Andrew McClellan inherited the plantation. On McClellan's death in 1850, the plantation was placed in a trust for McClellan's children. They sold the land to John Pruett in 1869, and when Pruett died 10 years later, it passed to his daughter Sallie and son-in-law James Fox. It remained in the Fox family until the mid-20th century. The Fox house, which appears on a 1931 map of the area, may have been on the site of the old courthouse. The Fort Blount Ferry operated until 1974.Tanse (1989), p. 33-35. In the early 1960s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the area for the construction of Cordell Hull Dam (located several miles downstream near Carthage). Using old maps and land grant boundaries, the Corps identified a plot believed to have been the site of Fort Blount and Williamsburg, and in 1974 placed this plot on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Fort Blount- Williamsburg site.\\" Later research and excavations conducted by the Tennessee Division of Archaeology, however, placed both Fort Blount and Williamsburg just outside the listing's boundaries. Archaeological investigations Layout of Fort Blount, as determined by the 1989-1994 excavations Between 1989 and 1994, Samuel Smith of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology led a team that conducted extensive excavations of the Fort Blount-Williamsburg site, designated 40JK125. The excavations, which focused primarily on the fort itself, uncovered the remains of a prehistoric structure, three structures likely associated with Fort Blount, and several thousand artifacts. Their findings were published in 2000. The largest structural remnant found by excavators, known as \\"Building 1,\\" consisted of a by limestone foundation that once supported a wooden structure. Excavators determined this structure to be a blockhouse, based on its size, square shape, and the design of contemporary blockhouses. Just west of Building 1 was \\"Building 2,\\" only a few remains of which survived, most notably a chimney. Although its purpose is indeterminable, excavators suggested it may have been a kitchen. Slightly northeast of Building 1 was \\"Building 3,\\" which had a foundation that measured by . The remains of two hearths and evidence that a wooden structure hung over one of the hearths suggest that this was a smokehouse.Smith (2000), pp. 110-122. Spanish coins found near the Fort Blount-Williamsburg sites (Gene Smith collection) Evidence for an outer wall surrounding all three structures was provided by postholes and vegetation lines. Four postholes aligned with the chimney wall of Building 2 may be remains of the western wall,Smith (2000), pp. 114, 131. and a noticeable vegetation line to the north of the structures may have been caused by what was once the fort's northern wall.Smith (2000), p. 104. The southern wall was indicated by three aligned postholes, one of which was relatively large and may have been one side of the fort's gate.Smith (2000), p. 127. The eastern wall was less apparent, but may have been aligned with the smokehouse's eastern wall. If conjecture regarding these findings is correct, the fort had dimensions of by .Smith (2000), p. 132. Prehistoric artifacts indicate the site was used as early as the Paleo- Indian period, and used extensively during the Middle Woodland period (c. 500 BC - 500 AD).Michael Moore, \\"An Analysis of Prehistoric Artifacts Recovered During the 1989-1994 Excavations at the Fort Blount Site, Jackson County, Tennessee.\\" An Archaeological Interpretation of the Site of Fort Blount, a 1790s Territorial Militia and Federal Military Post, Jackson County, Tennessee (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Department of Conservation, Division of Archaeology, 2000), pp. 344. Most of the site's historic-period artifacts consisted of the remains of glass containers and tableware. A number of Spanish coins-- which were common on the Tennessee frontier-- were recovered at the site, including one dating to 1781.Smith (2000), p. 239. Gun parts and ammunition were scant, but included lead balls, leadshot, and gunflints and flintlock parts.Smith (2000), p. 209. A pewter button found in Building 1's cellar dates to 1800 or later, and indicates that the fort likely stood until at least 1800.Smith (2000), p. 238. Excavators uncovered at least three items that were used specifically on soldiers' uniforms in the 1790s.Smith (2000), p. 284.
