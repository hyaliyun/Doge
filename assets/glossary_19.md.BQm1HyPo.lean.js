Her work lives in numerous private collections throughout the United States and Europe. Her work is included in the Elizabeth A.

Her work is in many private collections in the United States as well as Europe. Recently her work was included into the Elizabeth A.

She makes collages, oil paintings and cameos, which are also oil on canvas but their distinct shape references the Victorian era. In addition to making collages, her figurative oil paintings emulate collage because the subjects appear to be cut from the surface. The independent, yet sensual, female figure is often the central focus in Nehrbass' work. Her Cameos are inspired by Margaret Atwood's book, The Penelopiad, and a Victorian obsession with sex and death.

Overview  Founded in 1967, the distinctive feature of the Caja de Ingenieros cooperative model is that the partner is both client and owner of the entity. Clients have to join one of two cooperatives: Usuarios de Caja de Ingenieros or Caja de Ingenieros. Caja de Ingenieros acts as the parent company of the Caja de Ingenieros Group, which includes: * Caja de Ingenieros Gesti√≥n (fund management company) * Caixa de Ingenieros Vida y Pensiones (insurance, reinsurance and pension fund management company) * Caja de Ingenieros Banca-Seguros (insurance operator) * Caja de Ingenieros Foundation (CSR tool) * Ingenium Shopping (consumer cooperative) * Norbolsa (a company specializing in stock exchange brokerage and value-added financial services). In February 2011 Caja de Ingenieros founded the Caja de Ingenieros Foundation with the purpose of promoting its corporate social responsibility activities. It is a private and non-profit institution that emerged from the transformation of the former Socio-Cultural and Technological Association of Engineers. The Foundation intends to optimize the efficiency of the resources for the promotion of engineering and activities of cultural, social, environmental, beneficial-assistance, professional and technological interest. The social help includes donation of 2 million euros for projects, 105 scholarships and prizes, educational courses for unemployed people, training for members, etc. Politics During the 2017‚Äì18 Spanish constitutional crisis, Caja de Ingenieros and Caixa Guissona were the only banks that did not relocate their nominal headquarters out of Catalonia.C√≥mo es la Caja de Ingenieros, la cooperativa vinculada al 'proc√©s' que ha dado la hipoteca a Pablo Iglesias e Irene Montero , Manuel Guti√©rrez, El Mundo, 18 May 2018.

World Prodigy, a long ship operated by Ballard Shipping under the Greek flag, was inbound to Providence and Tiverton, Rhode Island when at about 16:40 local time she ran aground on Brenton Reef, about offshore from Brenton Point State Park, after passing the wrong side of a buoy marking the channel. She had a cargo of about 8.1 million gallons of fuel oil. The grounding damaged four of the ship's eight cargo compartments; early reports indicated that as much as a million gallons of oil had spilled, but later estimates put the total at about 300,000 gallons. Oil covered about 50 square miles and washed up on shore, but due to its low viscosity and choppy seas that broke up the slick it evaporated fairly quickly. The Coast Guard estimated that the cleanup cost about $2 million. The collision damaged the hull of World Prodigy in two places, but she was floated off the reef in early July and repaired at a shipyard in New York City. After the collision, World Prodigy's captain, Iakovos Georgudis, was charged with two violations of the Clean Water Act and Ballard Shipping with one. Both the captain and company pleaded guilty; Ballard paid $1 million and Georgudis $10,000 in fines. In December 1990, the National Transportation Safety Board released the results of their investigation of the spill, finding that Captain Georgudis had been suffering from sleep deprivation and was distracted by working on paperwork at the time of the collision. World Prodigy, having arrived at the mouth of the bay earlier than planned, had not taken on a harbor pilot, and shortly before she ran aground, Captain Georgudis had sent both his first officer and watchman away from the bridge to work on other tasks, which the NTSB judged left the ship \\"without a qualified deck watch officer for several minutes prior to the grounding.\\" References Narragansett Bay 1989 Oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill ","title":"1989 Narragansett Bay oil spill"},{"id":"53464269","text":"Davon Montel Godchaux (born November 11, 1994) is an American football nose tackle for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL).

The two grave markers for Col. Jonathan Buck Colonel Buck was a justice of the peace and is the subject of a legend that holds that he ordered a witch put to death by burning, and this witch put a curse on his tomb. There is a monument to Col. Buck erected in the Bucksport Cemetery in 1870 which bears a stain roughly in the shape of a woman's lower leg. According to the legend, the stain is the leg and foot of the witch, and that the mark has reappeared whenever the tombstone has been replaced.Legends of Jonathan Buck Jonathan Buck left Haverhill when his request to build a shipyard on the Merrimack River was denied and instead he was offered privileges on a tributary on another side of his land. Since Buck did not own the land on the opposite side of the brook, he saw no ability to thrive as a shipbuilder in Haverhill. In 1775 Buck was appointed by the Massachusetts Provincial Congress as Colonel in the 5th Regiment of the District of Maine Militia in Lincoln County and placed in charge of Fort Pownall located at the mouth of the Penobscot River. He was one of the leaders of the Penobscot Expedition in July-August, 1779, a major loss for the colonial forces. After this, Buck trekked back to Haverhill to be with his sons, and did not return to Maine until 1783.

He spent 20 years with the National Park Service, as Curator of the Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site in Ganado, Arizona, archaeologist at the Chaco Center in Albuquerque, and Regional Curator for the Southwest Regional Office of the National Park Service at Santa Fe. After retirement, he co-founded the [Navajo Studies Conference] with Charlotte Frisbie in 1986. He remained active in research and helping others until his death.

Upon graduating from high school in 1945, he was drafted and served two years in the Army. Brugge used the G.I. and attended University of New Mexico. After 3 years, he earned a BA in anthropology (1950). Following graduation, he was involved in seasonal ranger work, archaeological surveys, and excavations, and establishing with a friend the Ayani Trading Company. Dave moved to Gallup, where he drove trucks for the Gallup Field Office delivering food for the Navajo Commodity Program. In 1953, he worked for the new Unitarian Service Committee‚Äôs Gallup Indian Community Center. At the Center, he met Ruth Sherlog and they married in 1959. Employed by Navajo In 1958, he was hired by the Tribal Research Section of the Navajo Tribe, where he assembled documentation for the Navajo Tribe's case before the U.S. Land Claims Commission. He researched the Navajo claim to their traditional lands by using anthropology, Navajo oral tradition, written sources and archaeology research. Along with Lee J. Correll, Editha L. Watson and others, Brugge assembled a comprehensive Navajo bibliography published by the Navajo Tribe. He conducted extensive research to document every mention of Navajo in the Catholic Church Records of New Mexico between 1694-1875. This is a primary document for studies about Indian slavery in the Southwest. Brugge did extensive research about early Navajo sites, oral tradition and written records for the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act. Brugge was unhappy with the outcome and wrote \\"The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute: An American Tragedy\\" in 1994. Employed by National Parks Brugge worked for the National Park Service in 1953 as a seasonal ranger at El Morro National Monument. In 1968 he began his full-time career in the Park Service as Curator for the Navajo Lands Group. He was the first curator of the Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site (five years).

First published in the United Kingdom in 2003 by Orion Publishing Group, the book examines police corruption within the Metropolitan Police Service and South Eastern Regional Crime Squad‚Äîwith particular focus on the 1990s and early 2000s‚Äîand the establishment and activities of the force's anti-corruption \\"Ghost Squad\\". Its publication led to a 4-year legal case resulting in a landmark ruling in English defamation law. Libel case Following publication, McLagan and Orion were sued for libel by Michael Charman, a former detective constable with the Flying Squad who had been \\"required to resign\\" from the Metropolitan Police for \\"discreditable conduct\\". Charman alleged that the book libelled him by \\"suggesting that there were 'cogent grounds' of suspecting him of being involved in corruption.\\" In seeking to have Charman's claim for damages dismissed, the author and publisher cited the \\"Reynolds defence\\" of qualified privilege, which protected publication of an allegation if it was made in the public interest and satisfied the test of responsible journalism. In June 2006, at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Mr Justice Grey ruled that the book \\"did not pass all the necessary tests of \\"responsible journalism\\" and was not entitled to protection\\" of qualified privilege. Following the reaffirmation of the Reynolds defence in Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl in October 2006, in which the Law Lords sitting in the House of Lords determined that libel judges in the lower courts had been interpreting the criteria too strictly, McLagan and Orion appealed their case. On 11 October 2007, Lord Justice Ward, Lord Justice Sedley and Lord Justice Hooper, sitting in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, allowed the appeal and dismissed Charman's claim for damages‚Äîthe first time that the Reynolds defence had succeeded in the publication of a book. In their ruling, the judges said they were satisfied that the book was a piece of responsible journalism, that McLagan had taken steps to verify the story and that \\"as a result of his honesty, his expertise on the subject, his careful research and his painstaking evaluation of a mass of material, the book was protected.\\" Caroline Kean, McLagan's solicitor, called the ruling \\"ground-breaking and momentous\\", and said: \\"This is an unambiguous confirmation by the Court of Appeal that Reynolds is alive and kicking. It is not limited to newspapers, it means all media and there is no time constraint. It applies equally to a book and, by analogy, it will apply to a film or a TV programme, providing it is something of proper public interest and a journalist has done his very best to act in the course of responsible journalism.\\" References 2003 non-fiction books British non-fiction books Corruption in the United Kingdom Law enforcement scandals Non-fiction crime books Police misconduct in the United Kingdom English non-fiction books ","title":"Bent Coppers"},{"id":"53464418","text":"Zacharovanyi Krai National Nature Park () (meaning: \\"Enchanted Land\\") is one of the National Parks in Ukraine, located in Zakarpattia Oblast in the country's southwest.

Remezov joined the Red Army in 1918 and fought in the Russian Civil War as a junior commander. After the war, he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy and went on to command the 45th Rifle Division in 1937. Remezov commanded several military districts between 1938 and 1940. After Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Remezov briefly commanded 20th Army and subsequently took command of the 13th Army in Belarus on 8 July after its previous commander was mortally wounded. While leading a counterattack four days later, Remezov was severely wounded. After recovering in September, he took command of the North Caucasus Military District and then the new 56th Army in October 1941 which he led in the Battle of Rostov in November 1941. This was his last front-line command; in January 1942 Remezov was transferred to command the South Ural Military District. In April of that year he took command of the 45th Army, which he led for the remainder of the war in rear-security duties. Postwar, he became head of the faculty of the Frunze Military Academy, deputy head of the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy, and assistant commander for military educational institutions of the Moscow Military District, before retiring in 1959.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Remezov was born on 7 June 1896 in Kasli, Perm Governorate. He joined the Red Army in 1918. In 1919, he graduated from the Vyatka Infantry Command Courses. Remezov graduated from the Komintern Higher Tactical Infantry School for Red Army officers in 1921. He fought on the Russian Civil War's Eastern Front against the White Army of Kolchak, commanding a company and a battalion. Remezov transferred to command a separate battalion in the 9th Army's 33rd Kuban Rifle Division on the Southern Front, fighting against the White Army of Wrangel. He later fought in the suppression of an uprising in Vitebsk Governorate.  Interwar  After the end of the war, Remezov became assistant chief of a rifle division's Operations staff department, and later a senior assistant chief. He subsequently became chief of staff of a rifle regiment. In 1930, he became head of a staff department in the Volga Military District and in April 1931 commander of a rifle regiment. In July 1937, he was appointed commander of the 45th Rifle Division. In July 1938, Remezov was promoted to command the new Zhitomir Army Group, and in July 1939, he became commander of the Transbaikal Military District. Remezov took command of the Oryol Military District in July 1940.  World War II  After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, between late June and early July, Remezov temporarily commanded the new 20th Army, formed in the Oryol Military District. On 8 July, he took command of the 13th Army after its previous commander, Pyotr Filatov, was mortally wounded. The 13th Army fought in defensive battles on the Western Front against German troops from the 3rd Panzer Group in the Minsk Fortified Area. Under attack from superior forces, the army was forced to withdraw to the Berezina River around Borisov, and then to the Dnieper, where the army defended the line from Kopys to Novy Bykhov. From 10 July, the army fought in the Battle of Smolensk. On 12 July, he was severely wounded while personally leading a counterattack against the advancing XXIV Army Corps, and was replaced by Vasily Gerasimenko. After recovering, Remezov took command of the North Caucasus Military District on 4 September, leading it until 18 October. During this time, several cavalry divisions were formed in the district. He was transferred to command the 56th Army (initially a separate army) in late October. The army was tasked with defending Rostov-on-Don from the north and northwest. When the German troops broke through, the army's troops were forced to retreat across the Don River. On 23 November, the army became part of the Transcaucasian Front. During the subsequent Rostov Offensive, the 9th and 56th Armies recaptured Rostov. At the end of November the army was transferred to the Southern Front. In mid- December, the army advanced to the Mius River north of Taganrog, where it switched to the defensive and fought in positional battles. In January 1942, Remezov was transferred to command the South Ural Military District. During his tenure in command of the district, he organized new and reserve units to be transferred to the active army on the frontlines, and new training units and schools were created. From April 1942 to the end of the war, Remezov led the 45th Army of the Transcaucasian Front, which covered the Turkish border and protected communications in Iran. On 22 February 1943, he was awarded the Order of Lenin.Order of Lenin award list, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru  Postwar  After the end of the war, the 45th Army was withdrawn from Iran and disbanded.

Mall was granted a fellowship for the Department of Pathology at the Johns Hopkins University and after positions at other universities, later returned to be the head of the first Anatomy Department at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. There, he reformed the field of anatomy and its educational curriculum. Mall was the founder and the first chief of the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution for Science. He later donated his collection of human embryos that he started as a postgraduate student to the Carnegie Institution for Science.  Biography  = Early life = Franklin Mall was born to German immigrants Franz Mall and Louise Christine Miller, on a farm in Belle Plaine, Iowa. At the age of ten, Mall's mother died, and his stepmother showed no affection towards him. Mall was unhappy in his childhood, and he had little opportunity to challenge his intellect both at home and in school. Mall later met John McCarthy, a teacher at the local academy who greatly impacted Mall's learning experience and life. Mall, in a personal correspondence, wrote that while he hated history as a child, Mr. McCarthy \\"showed [him] he liked it.\\" In addition, Mall had the support of his father who recognized the importance of education. With this newfound appreciation of academic pursuit, Mall was able to attain higher education. = Education = Mall was accepted into the Department of Medicine at the University of Michigan, the school where his family physician had received his training. During his time at Ann Arbor, Mall was drawn to three of his professors: Corydon Ford, Victor Vaughn, and Henry Sewall. Mall was impressed by their pedagogical approach and their extensive knowledge in their respective fields. Their lectures were factual and objective; in addition, laboratory experiments were assigned to reinforce the knowledge that students had gained from lecture. Mall also noted that the majority of the students in his class favored rote memorization as a means to academic success. This was in contrast to his own preference for critical thinking and reasoning, a difference that emerged in his subsequent educational reforms. Mall graduated in June 1883 and went to Germany to further his education in 1884. He spent his first year abroad in Heidelberg to study ophthalmology. In Germany, Mall found his peers to be especially driven and better educated; they were independently planning their future studies. Mall heavily valued the freedom of choice and the liberty afforded to him while studying in Germany. In 1885, Mall went to Leipzig to begin his career in research under the guidance of Wilhelm His. Mall's first project resulted in evidence that contradicted his mentor's position on the origin of the thymus, concluding that it develops from the endoderm instead of the ectoderm. His later revisited the issue and acknowledged the validity of Mall's work. During his time with His, Mall also started a collection of human embryos that he would continue to expand for the rest of his career. With His' recommendation, Mall moved to Carl Ludwig's laboratory later that year, where he was assigned to study the blood vessels and lymphatics of the intestinal villus. Under Ludwig's tutelage, Mall learned methods of injecting blood vessels and lymphatics. Mall took apart the layers of the intestine to examine the blood supply of each layer and the organ as a whole. Using this knowledge, he constructed a model that demonstrated the circulatory relationship in the intestinal organ; he simplified the pattern of blood vessels into a five-ordered model that could be generalized to circulation in all organs. Mall's strong relationships with his mentors grew his curiosity and his affinity to scientific research. He later spread his focus on laboratory research to the American education system. = Personal life = As described by a student, Mall was modest and shy on outward appearance. He was cheerful and known to have a good sense of humor among his friends. Mall was deeply immersed in his research, heavily focused on solving any complications that were presented during the course of his work. Often deep in thought, Mall would sometimes be seen wandering around the hospital building and the city of Baltimore. Otherwise, he was known to be engrossed with work for long periods in his laboratory. Mall first met Mabel Glover while teaching his first class at Johns Hopkins. They got married in 1894 and had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Louise Mall. Mall fell ill after complications from a second operation for the removal of gallstones. He died while being treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in November 1917.  Career  = Early career = In 1886, Mall returned to the United States to undertake a fellowship in pathology at the Johns Hopkins University. Training under William H. Welch, Mall studied the anatomy of the intestine and stomach. He also expressed interest in bacteriology and connective tissue, discovering the ability of certain bacteria to digest connective tissue. Mall's collaboration with William Halstead on connective tissue led to the development of a new method of surgical suturing for the intestine. In 1888, Mall became a professor of Pathology. After a three year stay in Baltimore, Mall accepted an offer from Stanley Hall for the position of adjunct professor of anatomy at Clark University. While at Clark, Mall used the Born wax-plate method to create the first model of a human embryo in the United States. Furthermore, Mall discovered the vasomotor nerves of the portal vein and founded an embryological research program at the university. In 1892, Mall followed Charles Otis Whitman to Chicago, becoming the professor of Anatomy at the University of Chicago. After a year in Chicago, Mall accepted a professorship at the then newly opened Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. = Return to Johns Hopkins University = Accepting a personal request from William H. Welch, Mall returned to Baltimore in 1893 and set up the Department of Anatomy at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Mall became the first professor of Anatomy, continuing his research on organ structure and embryology. Mall was also given the freedom to run the department and teach according to his ideals of medical education; his focus on explorative learning led him to set up a dissection teaching laboratory that was conveniently located close to the neighborhood abattoir. During his tenure, Mall advanced the methods and conditions employed to preserve biological material. Prior to Mall's exploits, medical schools would only conduct dissections in cold weather to stymie the decomposition of cadavers. Through experimentation on dog cadavers, Mall developed a method of embalming and cold storage that enhanced the preservation of human cadavers and other biological samples. This method subsequently spread to other medical schools and rendered previous practices obsolete. = Educational reforms = As chair of the Department of Anatomy, Mall criticized the existing anatomy curriculum at Johns Hopkins and was especially particular about the lack of practical work such as dissection. Mall introduced a revised curriculum that rarely involved lecture; instead, he believed that self-directed learning, facilitated by practical experience, was optimal. Mall emphasized a strong grounding in human anatomy that would be instrumental in solving pressing anatomical issues. Mall's students would study using primarily the cadavers, textbooks, and models provided. In addition, instructors (himself included) were always present to assist the students during their practical work. His training produced several accomplished biologists, such as Florence R. Sabin and George L. Streeter. However, one of Mall's students, Simon Flexner, noted that Mall's pedagogical approach could not always replicate the same results elsewhere. The available study guides and the competence of the instructors were found to be essential to the success of Mall's curriculum. One of Mall's other goals was to raise the prestige of anatomists and the study of anatomy in America. During his tenure, anatomy was deemed as a basic science, a prerequisite for entering the highly respected surgical field. Mall's convictions led him to expand the anatomical curricula to include histology, histogenesis, and embryology. The collective research spearheaded by Mall and his coworkers at the Department of Anatomy demonstrated an impact comparable to that of the surgical field. Mall's call for educational reform extended beyond anatomy to medical education in general. Mall argued that the largest obstacle was the professors and practitioners themselves, many of whom were involved in private practice. This, coupled with the lack of regulation of tenure faculty meant that students had greatly diminished learning opportunities. Mall was a strong critic of private practice, and felt strongly for the concept of a full-time faculty. Mall often argued with William Osler as a result of their contrasting opinions. He supported the ideals of William H. Welch, Abraham Flexner, and John D. Rockefeller in their bid for the reform of medical education. However, Mall defended the importance of research, criticizing the implementation of policies that established full-time teaching faculty, treating their classroom obligations as an obstacle to scientific advancement.  Embryology  = Contributions to embryology = Mall started his collection of human embryos in 1887 while working under William H. Welch at the Johns Hopkins University. The collection continued to grow while working with Wilhelm His, further expanding after his return to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In his 1917 paper studying abnormal embryo and fetus growth, Mall reported that his collection consisted of approximately 2000 embryos, growing quickly at the rate of about 400 a year. Mall's collection became the foundation of the Carnegie Collection and his embryos were extensively used in scientific papers and reviews. Before founding the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution, Mall looked for ways to standardize the study of human embryology. In collaboration with Franz Keibel, Mall published the Manual of Human Embryology in 1912. The book described the piecewise development of the human body from the embryo and compiled substantial knowledge from the available scientific literature. Mall was also the first person to stage human embryos using photographs of their external structure, first grouping 226 human embryos into 14 stages. This was then expanded to 23 stages by Mall's successor, George L. Streeter. These 23 stages are the standard for the study of embryology and the Carnegie Collection of Embryos. = Department of Embryology = Mall advocated strongly for the establishment of a specialized embryological institution. In a proposal to the Carnegie Institute for Science, Mall noted the sluggish advancements in anatomy and embryology compared to astronomy. This was despite the greater number of faculty and additional resources present within the biological fields. Mall championed the recruitment of scientific talents and the conducive organization of research institutes to efficiently conduct research. In addition, Mall described the institute as a catalyst for the consolidation of embryonic collections which were scattered, poorly maintained, and possessed insufficient detail at that time. Mall laid out several key requirements for this specialized institution. Firstly, it would require a large embryo collection for research. Subsequently, this collection would have to be staged to furnish a more complete understanding of embryonic development in humans. Secondly, the institution would have to be in a large city with a significant medical establishment, such as Berlin, Boston, or Baltimore. This would allow the institution to work closely with gynecologists and private practitioners to expand the collection. Lastly, Mall hoped that the institution would be located in a hub of medical activity where research and medical breakthroughs were continually occurring. In early 1913, Mall received a preliminary grant of $6000 from the Carnegie Institute for Science to organize a broad-spectrum lab addressing scientific problems of varying disciplines. The nature of the work was intentionally designed to be impossible to achieve without collaboration; this was to demonstrate the validity of Mall's argument for an entire Department of Embryology. In the next year, Mall recruited four researchers and many other skilled technicians, modelers, and artists from Europe and the United States to carry out the process of staging the embryos. This group of researchers eventually became the basis of the Department of Embryology. By the end of 1914, Mall successfully obtained a $15,000 grant to found and chair the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, that was to be housed in the Johns Hopkins University campus. He served as its first Director, assisted by George Linius Streeter, who took over the Directorship on mall's death.  Scientific research  In his 1905 publication in the American Journal of Anatomy, Mall was the first to show that both the main arteries and the primary veins of the embryo pig could be reached by via the delivery of India Ink directly into the blood vessels of the liver. In 1907, Mall identified a precursor of the internal jugular vein in the head, naming it as the anterior cardinal vein. In addition, Mall showed that the anterior cardinal vein was implicated in the formation of dural sinuses. In a 1910 article entitled \\"Determination of the age of human embryos and fetuses\\" in the Manual of Human Embryology, Mall demonstrated that the nascent atrium of the heart could be identified based on the close proximity of endothelium to the heart muscle. This is in contrast to the significant distance observed between the endothelium and the heart muscle in other localities in the embryonic heart. In 1913, Mall developed an empirical method for calculating the age of a human fetus. Namely, the age of an embryo could be obtained by: Embryo Age (days) = sqrt of total foetal length in cm X 100)  Publications     Franklin P. Mall, Franz Keibel (1910).

This particular work, executed in about 1623 to 1625, now hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts. The narrative is taken from the deuterocanonical Book of Judith, in which Judith seduces and then murders the general Holofernes. This precise moment illustrates the maidservant Abra wrapping the severed head in a bag, moments after the murder, while Judith keeps watch. The other three paintings are now shown in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, and the Musee de la Castre, Cannes. The 2001 exhibition catalogue on Artemisia Gentileschi and her father Orazio remarked that \\"the painting is generally recognized as Artemisia's finest work\\".. Others have concurred, and the art historian Letizia Treves concluded that with this painting \\"Artemisia rightly takes her place among the leading artists of the Italian Baroque.\\"  Provenance  The painting was in possession of Prince Brancaccio in 1952, where it was co-owned by Alessandro Morandotti of Rome, Italy, and Adolph Loewi of New York. The whereabouts regarding ownership before this time are unknown. It was then purchased by Leslie H. Green in the same year of 1952 and gifted to the Detroit Institute of Arts in Michigan.  Dating and Attribution  This painting is attributed to Artemisia due to her adoption of Caravaggesque technique and composition. Despite following the works of their contemporary Caravaggio, Artemisia and her father developed their own independent styles. The explicit nature of the artist's interpretation has led writers to believe that there is a deeper meaning behind Artemisia's Judith, drawing back to the rape trial against Agostino Tassi. Identification with the protagonist of the painting is also believed to be an indicator of ownership. The precise date of execution is up for debate, since Artemisia had been traveling around Italy at this time.  Artistic background  Gentileschi was trained to compose still life paintings and portraits, which was common for female artists of the time. Apart from this, she also developed an interest in historical compositions that derived from both biblical and mythological stories. Women artists were limited to particular categories of art to paint from because they were deemed appropriate by societal expectations of the era. Gentileschi was educated by her father, among other artists, to produce these portraits, still lifes, and history paintings. It was frowned upon for women to study the anatomical structures of nude models, especially as a virtuous unmarried woman. Susan Dixon notes that historians have analyzed Gentileschi's works that emphasize the naked female form, building on the idea that the female artist may have used her own body as a reference in the mirror.Dixon, Susan M.; Cavazzini, Patrizia (2008). \\"Artemisia in Her Father's House\\". Italian Baroque Art. Blackwell Publisher. pp. 98‚Äì112. . It has been considered that the gender- based limitations of her Roman hometown, along with the absence of a mother for the majority of her life, assisted in Gentileschi's interest and focus on powerful female figures.Cropper, Elizabeth (Winter 1989). \\"Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art. by Mary D. Garrard\\". Renaissance Quarterly. The University of Chicago Press. 42 (4): 864‚Äì866. ‚Äì via JSTOR. Speculation from Elizabeth Cropper asserts that Gentileschi painted the feminine figures in a more heroic lighting, attributing characteristics of tragedy and sadness to these women, while also justifying their actions from an ethical standpoint. This representation of women in positions of power communicated Gentileschi's endorsement of female strength and potential.Garrard, Mary D. (1989). Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art. New Jersey: Princeton University Press. . To the knowledge of historians, Gentileschi's patrons were all male. According to a string of Venetian poems that were sent to Gentileschi in 1627, those that followed the artist and purchased her work did so because she was female. Even though her figures were painted in the nude, contemporary critics expressed that there was more of a sensual wonder related to her womanly traits as an artist. After practicing and honing her artistic abilities for only three years, Gentileschi's father Orazio described his daughter's talent as having superseded the level of the masters. Others who were very close to her, like academician Joachim von Sandrart, commended her work from which exuded \\"knowledge and rationality\\", traits that were not normally connected to women of the time.  Visual Analysis  Judith Slaying Holofernes by Adam Elsheimer, c.1601‚Äì1603 The Temptation of St. Francis by Simon Vouet, 1624 Much like her father, Gentileschi's style in the formative years of her career followed that of Caravaggio, mirroring his methods of dark shadows and overall execution. The artist utilized dramatic forms of chiaroscuro, most notably across Judith's half-lit face, her hand shielding the glow of the candle. Jesse M. Locker expresses this particular painting's definitive qualities that quintessentially represent the dramatization within baroque art. Vivid tones of color, ranging from Judith's golden dress to the deep crimson curtain, contribute to an elemental component that is unique to Gentileschi's style, unlike Caravaggio.Richardson, E. P. (1952‚Äì1953). \\"A Masterpiece of Baroque Drama\\". Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts. The University of Chicago Press. 32 (4): 81‚Äì83 ‚Äì via JSTOR. The shadow cast on Judith's face resembles a crescent moon which is a symbol of Artemis, a reoccurring connection the artist made between the female figures. Artemisia's Judith is always seen with a weapon at the ready. Gentileschi painted the figures and components of the composition with a strong sense of realism. Art historian Mary Garrard attributes this detailed attention to the influence of the Caravaggesque style. The dramatic lighting, playing with the limited glow from the candle and dense shadows, builds tension in the scene. The style of this composition is compared to Adam Elsheimer's Judith Slaying Holofernes, with the tenebristic lighting from the single candle and the drapery at the top corner of the canvas. The dramatically shadowed crossing of Judith's arms connects to the manner and style of Simon Vouet's Temptation of St. Francis, along with the theme of sexual power. There is still much debate over the specific date in which this painting was created, however most scholars secure it within the mid-1620s. = The Story of Judith and Holofernes = This Jewish narrative begins with the attempted siege of Bethulia, an Israelite city, by the Assyrian army, conquering their way to Jerusalem. Judith, a widow living in Bethulia, offers herself up in order to combat the surrender of her people. Accompanied by her maidservant Abra, Judith accepts an invitation to a secluded feast from the Assyrian general Holofernes. His desire to lay with Judith, upon donning her finest garments, along with the large consumption of alcohol ultimately lead to his demise. Once asleep in his bed chamber, Judith arms herself and has Abra keep watch outside. The Hebrew heroine beheads Holofernes and brings the severed head to her people, where they rejoice over her victory. News travels through the ranks of Holofernes' death, leading to the Assyrian army's defeat at the hands of the Bethulians.  History of Judith in Art  Pendentive ‚Äì Judith and Holofernes by Michelangelo, 1509 The notion of Judith's attempt at seducing Holofernes was not something the early Christian Church deemed appropriate. Religious interpretations instead relayed that God enhanced her beauty without interfering with her innocence as a woman, which led to the increased imagery that connected her to the Virgin Mary. In the Middle Ages, Judith was often cast in the same light as the Virgin, comparing their similar triumphs of beheading characters that represented evil‚ÄîHolofernes and the devil, respectively. Steering away from an all-encompassing approach to story-telling, Renaissance art marked the beginning of focusing entirely on the suspenseful moments of Judith's tale, particularly when Holofernes is beheaded. A prime example of this is Michelangelo's pendentive of Judith in the Sistine Chapel. Mythological symbols have been implemented in the decoration of Judith's armor, referencing the female war/hunting figures of Artemis, Athena and the Amazons. Donatello is most well-known for this application, but the tradition is connected to other artists, like Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo, Andrea Mantegna, Giorgio Vasari, Caravaggio and Artemisia Gentileschi. It is speculated by art historian Mary Garrard that Judith served as a righteous symbol from which people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries looked to in religious and political situations. During the Counter-Reformation, Catholics saw Judith's conquest of Holofernes as their battle and victory over Protestantism, specifically Truth over Heresy.  Interpretations  Women depicted in these biblical times traditionally wore sandals or were barefoot, as opposed to Judith's attire in this painting. Judith, being clad in armor with heavy shoes‚Äîtypically seen on a warrior or a member of the military‚Äîalters the perception of power coming from a source that is usually associated with the sensuous form. Art historians Keith Christiansen and Judith Walker argue that the gauntlet in her hand aims to emphasize the symbolic act of a military champion's defeat and loss of power. This notion is also addressed in regards to Judith, a young widowed woman, being the one to strip Holofernes of his heroic attributes. Holofernes' attraction to Judith, which ultimately leads to a calamitous case of deception and violence, almost mirrors the events of Gentileschi's own life. The symbolic nature and personification of the characters in the biblical story, however, are opposite to the true proceedings of the artist. Art historian E. P. Richardson points out that this painting might serve as somewhat of a self-portrait, as Judith's maidservant possesses physical qualities that match those of Gentileschi, herself. From the analysis of Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, the interpretation of Judith under Artemisia serves as an indicator of the female hero no longer painted in the righteous light of God. = Mary Garrard = In her book, Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art, art historian Mary D. Garrard notes that Gentileschi's depiction of female figures places them in a more heroic lighting. Garrard notes the symbolism that writers have attributed to Judith beheading Holofernes, believing it to be Artemisia's version of retaliation from her personal life. The aftermath of the rape trial involving her father's friend Agostino Tassi, as well as the opinions of those that challenged her virtue, may have influenced her style and content. Having said this, Garrard believes the meaning behind Gentileschi and Judith is much more complex. This inclusion of self-portraiture was common among a wide range of artists, like Titian, Michelangelo, and even Caravaggio. Garrard infers that men feared Gentileschi's series of Judith beheading Holofernes because it brought to life the notion of a woman taking control and ruling over a man. The author analyzes that Artemisia may have also integrated some characteristics of herself into Judith's maidservant, Abra, whose supportive appearance diverges from the unfaithfulness of Gentileschi's former friend, Tuzia. Garrard concludes that the symbolic differences between Judith and Abra connect to the past and present iterations of the artist, herself. Through this, Gentileschi painted a more complex description of the biblical heroine and her loyal companion, in order to, in Garrard's mind, break them free from confining stereotypes.

Adrien became tired and stopped fishing because his line was tangled. He sat down on a nearby rock, then left the lakeshore to play a short distance away. He then wandered away from his father, his two older brothers, and a friend of his father into a wooded area. The father after noticing that Adrien was missing, sent Adrien's eldest brother Lee McNaughton to the car to search for him. When Lee didn't find Adrien a search was sent out to find him. Hours later when Adrien was not found, the police were contacted. At the time of his disappearance he was wearing a blue nylon parka jacket, an orange striped shirt, brown shorts, and boots with rubber soles. Investigation A massive search was conducted to find McNaughton as thousands of volunteers led by the armed forces searched the area where Adrien had gone missing. While extensive searching was conducted, no clue to his whereabouts was found. Aftermath In 2009 with the use of new digital technology, his parents hoped to find him as an adult. Also in 2009 when Adrien's parents were contacted by the Toronto Sun, his mother declined to be interviewed and referred questions to the police. A CBC original podcast called Someone Knows Something investigated Adrien McNaughton's disappearance, beginning in 2015. The show is hosted, written and produced by award-winning Canadian filmmaker David Ridgen, and its first episodes were released in March 2016. On April 23, 2016, as part of the investigation for SKS, five highly trained volunteers conducted a search dive of Holmes Lake, looking for the remains of McNaughton, after four separate cadaver dogs indicated that they were detecting human remains in the area. A tooth-like object and small piece of rubber that may have belonged to a shoe were uncovered under eight feet of water. The tooth-like object when examined by the police was found not to be human.

He accompanied William III to England in the 1688 Glorious Revolution and served as Member of Parliament and Governor for Berwick-upon-Tweed from 1689‚Äì1690. In April 1690, he was appointed Colonel of Babingtons Regiment, later the 6th Foot, which was sent to Ireland. He fought at The Boyne in July and died of disease before the end of 1690. Life Bolam Parish Church; Babington's first wife Katherine was excommunicated for having the priest pulled from his pulpit. Philip Babington was born in 1632, eldest of seven surviving children of William Babington (died 1648) and Elizabeth Helmes. His family had long-standing links with Northumberland ; during the 1642‚Äì1646 First English Civil War, his father was county commissioner under the Militia Ordinance and a Colonel in the New Model Army. Philip attended Christ Church, Oxford in 1650 and later studied law at Gray's Inn, London; in 1662, he married Katherine, widow of George Fenwick, MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed and daughter of Arthur Hesilrige, one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest sparked the Civil Wars. He and Katherine had a son, also called Philip, before her death in 1670; in 1679, he married Anne Webb, daughter of William Webb, headmaster of Berwick School. Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632‚Äì1690) After his death in Ireland, she received a small pension from the government; in 1707, she was still being paid an annual pension of ¬£100. Career Setting near Battle of Dalnaspidal, 1654; Babington's first major military action Babington's military career began in 1654 when he was part of the Protectorate army that ended Glencairn's rising at the Battle of Dalnaspidal. When the 1660 Restoration returned Charles II to the throne, he was a Captain in the Northumberland Militia. Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632‚Äì1690) Katherine's father Sir Arthur escaped execution by the new regime but was held in the Tower of London, where he died in January 1661. Shortly after his marriage, Babington moved to Harnham Hall, near Bolam, Northumberland; he and his wife were both Puritans and in 1666, Katherine was excommunicated by the Church of England for pulling the Bolam parish priest from his pulpit in protest at his sermons. As a result, she was denied churchyard burial when she died in September 1670 and Babington instead built her a tomb in the grounds of Harnham Hall, which still exists. Battle of Saint-Denis (1678), last battle of the Franco-Dutch War; Babington was wounded and taken prisoner In 1674, Harnham Hall was leased to William Veitch (1640‚Äì1722), a Scottish Presbyterian radical outlawed from Scotland for his involvement in the 1666 Pentland Rising. Babington resumed his military career by joining the Scots Brigade, a mercenary unit in the Dutch Republic whose origins went back to the 1580s. Despite the name, it normally contained three Scots and three English regiments; the latter were withdrawn when England allied with France in the 1672‚Äì1678 Franco-Dutch War but restored after the 1674 Treaty of Westminster ended their involvement. By 1674, the remaining regiments had lost much of their national identity and a deliberate policy was adopted to re-establish them as English and Scottish units. Babington was appointed Captain in one of the restored English regiments, which eventually became the 6th Foot or the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was promoted Major after the Battle of Cassel in 1677, then wounded and taken prisoner at Saint- Denis in 1678. Released when the Treaties of Nijmegen ended the Franco-Dutch War in August, in 1682 he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the English regiment commanded by Sir Henry Belasyse. At this time, his former tenant William Veitch joined the group of English and Scots exiles in Holland, one of whom was the Earl of Argyll; when James II became King in 1685, Veitch reappeared in Northumberland, recruiting for the proposed Monmouth Rebellion in South-West England and Argyll's Rising in Scotland. Gardner, Veitch, William Babington's connection with Veitch meant that when William of Orange, later William III of England sent the Brigade to England to suppress these revolts, James demanded his dismissal. William refused, although he agreed to remove him from command of English troops; he described him as 'a very prudent and honourable man, and assuredly a very brave and excellent officer ‚Äì even one of the best who have served me here of his nation.' Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632‚Äì1690) In the event, the Brigade arrived after the rebellions had been crushed and returned to the Netherlands in August without seeing any fighting. Battle of the Boyne, July 1690 In early 1688, James demanded the repatriation of the entire Brigade; William refused to comply but used the opportunity to remove officers of doubtful loyalty. For reasons that are unclear, Sir Henry Bellasyse returned to England in April 1688 and Babington replaced him as Colonel. His unit formed part of the army that accompanied William to England in the Glorious Revolution of November 1688; en route, a ship carrying four of its companies was captured but the soldiers released after James went into exile. Columbine's regiment of foot Babington was appointed Governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed and elected to the Convention Parliament as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed. Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632‚Äì1690) In 1690, his regiment was transferred from the Dutch to the English military establishment, with its seniority backdated to 1685. It was now listed as 'Babington's Regiment' or simply 'Babingtons;' at this time, regiments were considered the personal property of their Colonel and carried their name, which changed when transferred to another. In April 1690, his unit joined the army led by Frederick Schomberg fighting the Jacobites in the 1689‚Äì1691 Williamite War in Ireland. Three companies were detached to garrison Charlemont Fort after its capture in May, while the rest fought at the Battle of the Boyne in July, suffering heavy casualties. Following the battle, Babington's was part of a detachment commanded by Lieutenant-General James Douglas that unsuccessfully attempted to capture the Jacobite-held town of Athlone. These minor operations continued and Babington died of disease in Ireland shortly before the end of 1690. References Sources * Cannon, Richard (1839).

Location The Gurupa v√°rzea ecoregion is named after the Ilha Grande de Gurup√°, an alluvial island in the mouth of the Amazon. The v√°rzea extends along the lower Amazon River from the mouth of the Tapaj√≥s down to the mouth of the Xingu River. It has an area of . The Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests lie to the south and the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests to the north. The Monte Alegre v√°rzea is upstream and the Maraj√≥ v√°rzea is downstream along the Amazon. Physical In this region the whitewater Amazon is fed by the blackwater Xing√∫, Jari, and Tapaj√≥s rivers. Elevations are no more than . The Gurupa v√°rzea contains floodplains along the river that are affected by daily Atlantic Ocean tidal fluctuations and seasonal flooding. At the height of the rainy season when the Amazon is in full flood water levels may fluctuate by in a tidal period as the river water is dammed by the rising ocean tide. Outside the rainy season fluctuations may still be from in a tidal period. The region contains a complex maze of channels and sedimentary islands. The soil is made up of sediments carried from the eastern Andes by the rivers during the present Holocene epoch. The river sediments form levees along the margin of the river, behind which are areas of savanna on clay soil and open lakes. Both the savanna and the lakes flood daily, and the lakes grow much larger at the height of the flood season. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoon rainfall. Temperatures are fairly steady throughout the year, ranging from with an average of . Mean annual precipitation is about , with rainfall varying from in October to in April. =Flora= The levees hold tropical rainforest with a height of around . Behind them the ecoregion holds a distinctive form of v√°rzea that is mostly savanna rather than dense rainforest. The clay soil supports robust savanna known as canarana. The rich sediments make the v√°rzea very fertile compared to the terra firme land further from the river. The vegetation stabilizes the soil and is home to a very diverse population of aquatic mammals and freshwater fish. The flooded savanna holds large grasses such as Echinochloa polystachya, Echinochloa spectabilis, Hymenachne amplexicaulis, Hymenachne donacifolia, Leersia hexandra, Paspalum platyaxix, Luziola spruceana, Panicum elephantipes, Paspalum fasciculatum and several Oryza species. Some of the grasses also grow on former channels of the river. Among the grasses there are sedges such as Scirpus cubensis, Cyperus luzulae, Cyperus ferax and Scleria geniculata. The areas of transition between the forest and river hold shrubs and small vines that include Artemisia artemisiifolia, Ipomoea carnea, Polygonum punctatusm, Justicia obtusifolia, Alternanthera philoxeroides, Capironia fistulosa, Sesbania exasperata, Mimosa pigra, Montrichardia linifolia, Clamatis aculeata, Senna reticulata, Phaseolus lineatus, Rhabdadenia macrostoma and Clitonia triquetum. The forest holds larger trees such as Hura crepitans, Triplaris surinamensis, Calycophyllum spruceanum, Cedrela oderata, Pseudobombax munguba, Virola surinamensis and Ceiba pentandra. A variety of trees produce fleshy fruit that supports species of fruit eating primates, bats and fish that enter the forest when it is flooded. These include yellow mombim (Spondias mombim), buriti palm (Mauritia flexuosa), a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea), socor√≥ (Mouriri ulei) and tarum√£ (Vitex cymosa). =Fauna= This ecoregion hosts 148 mammal species including ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajou (Potos flavus), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), red-faced spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) and Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus). Endemic mammals include red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), bare- eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus), red-bellied titi (Callicebus moloch), silvery marmoset (Mico argentatus), black dwarf porcupine (Coendou nycthemera), red acouchi (Myoprocta acouchy), white-faced spiny tree-rat (Echimys chrysurus), giant tree rat (Toromys grandis), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) and several species of bat. Endangered mammals include the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 558 bird species have been recorded, including herons and egrets (genera Egretta and Ardea), whistling duck (subfamily Dendrocygninae), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca) ibis (Theristicus species), roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis), eared dove (Zenaida auriculata), crimson topaz (Topaza pella),scaled spinetail (Cranioleuca muelleri) and spectacled thrush (Turdus nudigenis). Endangered birds include the scaled spinetail (Cranioleuca muelleri), green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis) The waters are home to many fish and turtles, including Arrau turtle (Podocnemis expansa). The largest fish include pacu (genera Metynnis and Mylossoma), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) and sardinha (Triportheus angulatus). Other fish include piranha (genus Serrasalmus), discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus), cichlids, characins (family Anostomidae), tetras (genera Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon), and catfish (families Aspredinidae, Callichthyidae, Doradidae and Loricariidae). =Status= As of 2017 the World Wildlife Fund classed the ecoregion as \\"Critical/Endangered\\". Human activities in the ecoregion include fishing, subsistence agriculture, selective logging and cattle or water buffalo ranching. The small-scale farmers typically practice diverse agriculture that depends on the forest and does not degrade the land. In the past, large scale production of jute damaged the environment, and mechanized rice production continues today. Elsewhere large areas of natural forest along the Amazon banks have been cleared and the savanna converted to pasturage. Most of the commercially value timber species such as Virola surinamensis and Ceiba pentandra have been harvested. The remaining forest is mostly secondary growth, either managed or unmanaged. Urban sprawl in the city of Monte Alegre has also affected the ecoregion.

He is the Chief Executive of ICCE Ltd., Director of Research at Growth Coaching International, Managing Director of Growth Coaching UK and Professor of Coaching and Positive Psychology at the University of East London. As author, he is best known for his best-selling book An Introduction to Coaching Skills: A Practical Guide. He is also the editor-in-chief of Coaching: An International Journal of Theory, Research and Practice.  Biography  Christian van Nieuwerburgh was born to a Belgian father and a Japanese mother in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1971, thereafter spending his formative years there. While living in Beirut, van Nieuwerburgh attended the American Community School and later completed a BA and MA in English Literature at the American University of Beirut. At the time of his studies, he worked as an English Literature teacher at both secondary school and university level, took up jobs in journalism and translating, and supported the family's Japanese restaurant business. Later on, he moved on to work in the sales and marketing industry. In 1997, van Nieuwerburgh moved to the United Kingdom with his wife and son in order to obtain a PhD in English from the University of Birmingham, where his thesis was titled \\"Representations of Politically Empowered Women on the Elizabethan Stage\\". While working on his PhD, he worked various jobs, including at Waterstones and the Royal Shakespeare Company. He completed his PhD in 2007. In 2012, he completed an MSc in Psychology at the University of East London.  Coaching career  In 2002, van Nieuwerburgh started working at the Warwickshire County Council as Deputy Head of Service, a position he held for 9 years until 2011. In his role, he provided training and professional development services to West Midlands schools and colleges. He took up the role of Executive Coach for the West Midlands Councils in September 2008, holding the role until for 6 years until 2014. Since 2009, van Nieuwerburgh has spent half of his time working as an academic in coaching psychology. From September 2009 to August 2015, van Nieuwerburgh held the position of Senior Lecturer in Coaching Psychology at the University of East London. He later took up the role of Associate Professor of Coaching at the Centre for Coaching and Behavioural Change within the Henley Business School. He returned to the University of East London Stratford Campus as Professor of Coaching and Positive Psychology in April 2017. The other half of van Nieuwerburgh's time has been spent developing his own business - he is the Chief Executive of ICCE Ltd. (International Centre for Coaching in Education), which he established to support \\"the development of coaching initiatives in educational settings globally.\\" He has been holding the roles of Director of Research at Growth Coaching International and Managing Director of Growth Coaching UK since June 2014. In the past, he worked as a Consultant for AQR International. = Beliefs on coaching = In many of his books, van Nieuwerburgh acknowledges the wide range of definitions of coaching. At the same time, based on experience and research of literature, he posits that coaching: * is a structured conversation that takes place between two people; * aims to support a sustainable change in behaviours or ways of thinking; * focuses on learning and development. Van Nieuwerburgh suggests that being a successful coach requires being well-versed in the conversational process and having the necessary skills, such as the ability to actively listen, ask thought- provoking questions, summarise the learning experience, and give and receive feedback. He also maintains that adopting coaching as a \\"way of being\\" is essential, and is developed when the coach is able to reflect on their own experience and practice coaching. = Coaching in education = Van Nieuwerburgh is renowned for his thought leadership in coaching in educational settings. Throughout his academic career, he has explored the purpose of coaching in education, its transformational effects on educational experiences, and how it can be applied in schools and in higher education. Van Nieuwerburgh has suggested that coaching supports the notion that learning should be personalised, and encourage both the student and the teacher to develop throughout the learning experience. For students, opportunities for coaching include collaborating with fellow students to improve grades and skills, both academic and social. For teachers and administrators, coaching can help with transitions into new roles. Coaching is also used to support improvement in teaching skills and enhance performance in education institutions. In 2010-2011, van Nieurwerburgh, together with colleagues from the University of Kent and University of East London, carried out a pilot project at the Sittingbourne Community College, where half of the 1,000 students were deemed to experience barriers to learning for various reasons. Van Nieuwerburgh et al. aimed to raise attainment by delivering coaching training to students over sixteen years old, supported their \\"interim reflective practice coaching sessions\\", and assisted in evaluating the project. In June 2017, van Nieuwerburgh and executive coach John Campbell are scheduled to publish their book titled \\"The Leader's Guide to Coaching in Schools\\", which will provide a step-by-step model for delivering relationship- driven coaching in education.  Personal life  Van Nieuwerburgh is married and has one son. He has noted that his hobbies include traveling and motorcycle riding. He has also expressed an interest in writing fiction and a goal to travel long distances on his motorcycle.  Bibliography  = Academic publications = * Van Nieuwerburgh, C. (2010).

The open source code is maintained by the Dragonchain Foundation. The commercial blockchain platform is maintained by the commercial entity named The Dragon Company. Dragonchain is a public/private hybrid blockchain platform that allows integration with other blockchain protocols, legacy systems, oracles, and API's. Developers can use existing smart contracts from the library or write their own smart contracts to build (decentralized) blockchain applications in known languages. In 2020, Medek Health launched Covid SafePass with the City of Apopka, using Dragonchain blockchain solutions in line with the FDA guidance on Digital Health Policies and Public Health Solutions for COVID-19.[https://orlando- politics.com/2020/05/07/medek-health-city-of-apopka-launching-covid-safepass/ Medek Health, City of Apopka Launching Covid SafePass Hybrid architecture There are various different types30-31 May 2018, Blockchain technology and market transparency, Pavel Ciaian, Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Seville, Spain of blockchain networks. Including but not limited to public, private and consortium blockchains. Both public and private blockchains have their own benefits and pain points. Dragonchain's hybrid architectureDragonchain Architecture documentation allows to keep sensitive business logic private, while also having control over what data can immutably be recorded on public blockchains. The Interchain patent allows for interoperability with other blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead of recording all sensitive information on public blockchains, it only takes the hash of the private transaction and Interchains with both Dragonchain community nodes and blockchains like Bitcoin. In the case of Bitcoin the biggest benefit for this use case is its global hash power, resistance against 51% attacks, the immutability and decentralization. Hybrid blockchains are used by entities that need the benefits of both the public and private approach, using Interchain interoperability solutions between legacy systems and other blockchains, both public, private, consortium and permissioned. Private, public, consortium and permissioned blockchains all have their own setbacks and benefits. Entities that do not want to expose sensitive business data to the internet are limited to private blockchains. And entities looking for no access restrictions at all can leverage the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain. The hybrid blockchain ensures sensitive business data stays private on business nodes. While also allowing to validate the hash of the private transactions through consensus algorithms. And even completely decentralized public checkpoints on networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Through Interchain the hash of a private transaction can be placed on the Bitcoin blockchain or any other public blockchain such as Ethereum. This allows to utilize the benefits of blockchains that are focused on specific use cases such as quantum resistant blockchains. This will protect against quantum attacks,Breaking Bitcoin With a Quantum ComputerBlockchain Is Especially at Risk for Quantum Attacks, Scientists Warn although such attack never was successful yet. =Dragon Net= Dragon Net is Dragonchain's scalable and hybrid approach to achieve consensus. It is using independent verification nodes provided by the Dragonchain community and external partners. Verification nodes serve the purpose of verifying blocks from business nodes that contains the hashes of the businesses private transactions, thus not exposing sensitive business logic. Unlike other blockchain platforms, there is no mainnet. Each application or node is its own blockchain, allowing more flexibility and scalability. =Consensus= Consensus is achieved through automated verification from a wide range of entities through Dragonchain's so called 5 Level Spectrum of Trust.Dragonchain Architecture Every Dragonchain that is spun up by a user is at each level is its own non-homogenous or heterogeneous blockchain. This means that all the blockchains and nodes do not all contain exactly the same information. This prevents network congestion as seen with Cryptokitties during the cryptocurrency bubble in 2017. This new approach allows for scalability that is limited to the clouds limit, which is theoretically unbounded as the cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or other) can scale up infinitely by demand. =Private business Node= Contains all sensitive data and business logic. This is the enterprises or businesses own private blockchain and the location for placement and integration of \\"real world\\" value in the form of transactions and business logic. This information is configured by the business or blockchain user and executed by a blockchain node. =L2 Nodes: Validates the blocks, headers, and signatures= Level 2 nodes are the first check of validity for blocks and their individual transactions from the private business nodes. Which can be done without exposing the actual data or business logic. Rules such as minimum amount of validity verification through L2 Nodes can be defined by enterprises. =L3 Nodes: Network diversity for L2 validations= Level 3 nodes check the diversity of a transaction's Level 2 verification. This level of consensus will ensure that transactions are validated by a sufficient amount of distributed sources. This also provides control and measurement of network effect. And provides distributed security, as an attacker would be required to attack multiple organizations and data centers in order to tamper with these transactions. =L4 Nodes: Serves as a Notary function= A level 4 node provides a notary functionality to the consensus process. Level 4 nodes are hosted by external partners and cryptographically signs any verification record it receives from the Level 3 nodes. = L5 Nodes: Public checkpoint = Level 5 nodes are the final gateway between the Dragonchain platform and other blockchains. After a transaction has successfully passed Level 5 verification, it can finally be hosted on a public chain like ETH, ETC, NEO, or BTC using Interchain. General Data Protection Regulation By nature public blockchains are not compliant with EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union, known as GDPR. In many use cases however there is a need to decentralize blockchain transactions without exposing PII or sensitive business logic. Dragonchain's serverless hybrid blockchain architecture is a solution for various pain points both public and private blockchains have by nature. Not only can the entity choose what data can be private or public. They can also choose in which global region they store both public and private information. With multicloud capabilities, not limited to one cloud provider such as AWS, data that is required to be stored and validated in China only remains in China. And data that is required to be stored and validated within the European Union only remains in the European Union. This is in addition to only exposing the hash of transactions in a global decentralized manner, unless explicitly permitted otherwise. Proof of existence Hybrid blockchain platforms are able to use public blockchains for proof of existence. Dragonchain refers to this as public checkpoints. Ensuring ultimate, decentralized and immutable proof that certain events have occurred. Which can not be done by using private, permissioned or consortium blockchains without interoperability characteristics. Bitcoin is unmatched in terms of global hash power, making it very expensive and unlikely to perform a 51% attack. Thus using Bitcoin for strong transactional proof for the hash of their private business data transactions give it the immutable aspect, making it impossible to tamper with transactions that already occurred.  History  Earliest public documentation of the so-called Disney Private Blockchain Platform dates back to 2014. In June 2016 over 20 use casesDisney Dragonchain - Blockchain use cases that have been explored inside Disney were sharedBlockhain Use Case List/Disney with the World Wide Web Consortium, its blockchain community group. In October 2016 the platform is released as open- source software under the Apache 2.0 license and was mentioned as one of Disney's best open source releases.Disneys best releases may be its open source tools In January 2017 The Dragonchain Foundation was founded, which is a non-profit organization created to maintain the open source code. Joe Roets is the Founder and CEO and has build the commercial Dragonchain entity on top of the open source code, which is now known as the current blockchain company named Dragonchain. Roets was asked by DisneyJoe Roets, CEO of Dragonchain, with over 20 years of software experience through a phone call to develop the architecture from scratch and moved him and his family to Seattle, WA. In 2017 Dragonchain conducted a token saleDisney spinout Dragonchain pursues initial coin offering to build out new blockchain technology that raised as much as $13 million.Disney's Dragonchain announces ICO On February 23, 2018 the Nasdaq listed enterprise Fluent, formerly known as Cogint,Cogint, Inc. Announces Corporate Name Change to Fluent, Inc.The company rebrands following its successful emergence as a standalone company acquired a minority interest in Dragonchain.cogint Subsidiary Acquires Minority Interest in Dragonchain =Tokenized Micro-license= Dragonchain has their own utility token which is a tokenized micro-license (TML), known as Dragonchain, ticker DRGN or referred to as Dragons. They were distributed to token sale participants. The current circulating supply is 238.421.940 DRGN. While the total supply ever available is 433.494.437 DRGN, which is a prime number. The Tokenized Micro-licenses are used throughout the platform and ecosystem. It is a new form of software licensing that can be applied in different ways. Community holders of the Dragon tokens all have a Dragon Days of Slumber Score (DDSS). DDSS determines the user's access to specific features within the Dragonchain ecosystem. It takes into account both the Dragon balance and length of time each Dragon is held. The number of Dragons held, multiplied by the number of days held is how the Dragon Days of Slumber Score is calculated. It is a new form of a tokenized loyalty system based on blockchain. Some of the features include access to the blockchain platform and smart contract library, permission to run L2, L3 or L4 nodes to validate enterprise blocks or voting rights to startup ideas and projects. L2, L3 and L4 nodes are run by the Dragonchain community and selected partners, who are rewarded proportionally, based on the amount of DDSS they have applied to each specific node. An orders of magnitude increase in traffic can be handled by existing network nodes which will earn directly proportional to the increase. Charging for software licenses began in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The original software licensing models such as Microsoft Windows 3.1 or Adobe Photoshop 7.0 serve different purposes. They hold a key that gives access to the software. It comes at a one-time fixed price that includes minor updates, bug fixes and ownership. Yet does not allow to stay updated with new versions without buying it. In the 1990s and 2000s the subscription based licensing became more popular. This is where consumers started paying on a time-base for access to the software. Popular models like this in 2019 are Spotify and Netflix. This allows for access to the most updated versions of software and comes with updates in place, lowering maintenance costs for both the consumers and the vendor. One downside is that consumers end up paying even when they are not using it, unless they pause or cancel their subscription. Dragonchain's patentedTokenized Micro-License Tokenized Micro-License was created to allow a new model for software access. It allows local holding of licenses like early models, but also allows decentralized hosting of the service. And standardized many flexible forms of redemption via software access or execution. Some of the key principles are that the tokens license term interact at every use, execution or access with complimentary license terms embedded in to every service. This creates a flexible framing work for software licensing innovation. For vendors it allows flexible updates, including the terms on blockchain, and consumers do not pay for software that is not being used. Meaning the inevitable passing of time does not penalize existing customers.

The bomb killed two teenagers Geraldine O'Reilly (15) and Patrick Stanely (16). Nobody claimed responsibility for the bombing but security services believe the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) carried out the attack. The attack happened just a few weeks after two people were killed and 127 injured when two car bombs exploded in the centre of Dublin, Republic of Ireland on 1 December 1972. On the same day as the Belturbet bombing, two other bombs exploded in border counties, the first in Clones, County Monaghan which injured two people and the second in Pettigo in County Donegal which caused no deaths or injuries. The three bombs all exploded within 30 minutes of each other. Background The Troubles broke out in August 1969 after the Battle of the Bogside and the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. Republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional IRA and Official IRA waged military campaigns against the Northern Ireland state and British state forces and Loyalist paramilitaries such as the UVF and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) waged a campaign against the Irish nationalist community and IRA members. From early on in the conflict, violence spilled over into the Republic of Ireland with the UVF planting bombs to sabotage services. The first bomb attack by the UVF in the Republic of Ireland happened at Radio Telefis √âireann (RT√â) headquarters in Donnybrook on 5 August 1969. On 19 October 1969, a loyalist bomb intended for the hydroelectric power station near Ballyshannon, County Donegal, exploded prematurely, injuring 45-year old UVF member Thomas McDowell, who died two days later. In December 1969 the UVF exploded another bomb outside the Garda central detective bureau in Dublin. The nearby telephone exchange headquarters was suspected to have been the bombers' target. In February 1971 the Wolfe Tone statue at St. Stephen‚Äôs Green was destroyed by a Loyalist bomb. Bombing On the night of Thursday 28 December at around 10.30 pm the second in a series of three co-ordinated bombs exploded in a red Ford Escort car at Butler Street, Belturbet, County Cavan; the bomb exploded outside the post office in the main street. Two teenagers, Gerladine O'Reilly who was a local girl, aged 15 and Paddy Stanley, aged 16 from Clara, County Offaly, were killed in the bombing. Eight others were seriously injured in the bomb attack. The bomb was estimated to have contained 100 lb of explosives. The cost of the damage from the bombing was estimated at ¬£200,000; twenty-three houses and fourteen cars in Butler Street were damaged by the force of the blast. Pieces of the bomb car were recovered from a 100-yard radius of the bomb site. Patrick Stanley had been making a phone call in a nearby kiosk when the bomb went off. Geraldine O'Reilly, who was on her Christmas holidays from school, was across the road in Slowey's chip shop waiting to be served when the bomb exploded, where she suffered massive head injuries from flying shrapnel and died instantly. Geraldine's brother, Anthony, had been waiting for her outside in his car when the bomb went off; he was seriously injured in the blast. His car was parked just 10 feet from the site of the car bomb. Earlier that night a bomb exploded in a blue Morris 1100 car on Fermanagh Street, Clones, County Monaghan at 10.01 pm seriously injuring two men. A third bomb exploded outside the licensed premises of Hugh Britton at Mullnagoad, in Pettigo, County Donegal. No one was injured but the pub was extensively damaged from the bombing. The cars used in the attacks had been stolen earlier on that same day in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh and all three bombs were in a radius of 20 miles from Enniskillen. The car used in the Belturbet bombing had been driven across the border through the unapproved Aghalane crossing at around 9.00 pm to avoid possibly being confronted by Irish security services. Aftermath Loyalist paramilitary attacks in the Republic of Ireland continued throughout much of the 1970s. Just three weeks later on 20 January 1973 a UVF car bomb exploded in Dublin city, killing one man and injuring fifteen other people. This was the fourth bomb attack in the Republic and third in Dublin within the space of two months. On 17 May 1974, three car bombs exploded in Dublin and a fourth outside a pub in Monaghan in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. 34 people all of whom were civilians were killed in the attacks and around 300 people injured making it the most deadly day of the conflict. On 29 November 1975 two bombs exploded at Dublin airport, killing one person and injuring ten others. On 19 December 1975 a Loyalist car bomb exploded in the border town of Dundalk in County Louth killing two people and injuring 20. Later that same day another Loyalist gang killed three more people in a gun and bomb attack in an Armagh pub. Nobody was convicted for any of the Loyalist bombings in the Republic of Ireland. An award-winning documentary on the atrocity, The Forgotten bomb, was made by Fran McNulty; it featured interviews with the families and locals who remembered the bombing. The programme was broadcast on Shannonside Northern Sound Radio. The journalist won the best regional journalist award in the ESB media awards in 2004 for the programme. Both parents of Patrick Stanley featured in the documentary. The brother of Geraldine O'Reilly, Anthony, who was serious injured in the attack, also featured. A specially sculptured monument was erected in early 2007 on the site of the bomb, dedicated to these two victims.https://www.rte.ie/amp/1028097/ Cavan County Council have erected a monument to commemorate their deaths at the site of the bombing. Several memorial services have been held at the monument. The 30th anniversary of the tragedy heard the father of Patrick Stanley, Joe, make a speech at the site, weeks after the death of Patrick's mother.

It will make use of a SpaceX Starship on a private spaceflight flying a single circumlunar trajectory around the Moon. The passengers will be Maezawa, several artists, and one or two crew members. The project was unveiled in September 2018 and the flight is expected to occur no earlier than 2023. The project objective is to have six to eight accomplished artists travel with Maezawa for free around the Moon on a six-day tour. Maezawa expects the experience of space tourism will inspire the accompanying artists in the creation of new art. The art would be exhibited some time after returning to Earth to help promote peace across the world. Maezawa had previously contracted in 2017 with SpaceX for a lunar flyby in a much smaller Dragon 2 spacecraft launched by a Falcon Heavy launch vehicle which would have carried only two passengers. According to a SpaceX announcement in early 2018, the Falcon Heavy plan was shelved in light of the development of Starship. , Starship is in development. The crewed flight will not take place until after Starship is thoroughly tested and after an uncrewed circumlunar test flight.  History  On February 27, 2017, SpaceX announced that they were planning to fly two space tourists on a free-return trajectory around the Moon, now known to be billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, and one friend.How SpaceX's 1st Passenger Flight Around the Moon with Yusaku Maezawa Will Work. Tariq Malik, Space.com. 18 September 2018. This mission, which would have launched in late 2018, was planned to use the Crew Dragon 2 capsule already developed under contract for NASA's Commercial Crew Program and launched via a Falcon Heavy rocket. As well as being a source of income for the company, any mission would serve as technology development for SpaceX's further plans to colonize Mars. At the time of the 2017 announcement, the Crew Dragon 2 capsule was still under development and the Falcon Heavy had yet to fly. Industry analysts noted that the schedule proposed by SpaceX might be too ambitious, as the capsule was expected to need modifications to handle differences in flight profile between the proposed lunar flight and its main use for crew transfer to space stations orbiting Earth. In February 2018, SpaceX announced it no longer had plans to certify the Falcon Heavy for human spaceflight and that lunar missions would be carried out with the BFR system (now called Starship). Then, on September 14, 2018, SpaceX announced that the previously contracted passenger would be launched aboard the BFR/Starship to flyby the Moon in 2023. Starship will have a pressurized volume of , large common areas, central storage, a galley, and a solar storm shelter.

In the video, Maezawa officially invites Chazelle to come with him on his #dearMoon project, making Chazelle the first person to be publicly invited to go. However, Chazelle answered that he had to think about it and discuss it with his wife.

It referred to the prohibition of dancing in all New York City spaces open to the public selling food and/or drink unless they had obtained a cabaret license. It prohibited \\"musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement\\" without a license. Critics argued that the license was expensive and difficult to obtain and that enforcement was arbitrary and weaponized against marginalized groups, but proponents insisted that the law minimized noise complaints. According to the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, > A Cabaret License is required for any business that sells food and / or > beverages to the public and allows patron dancing in a room, place, or > space.  History  The New York City Cabaret Law was passed in 1926, during the Harlem Renaissance. An attorney and professor challenging the cabaret law wrote that the law originally targeted jazz clubs in Harlem and the social mixing of races, but a historian of the period rejects the view and said there is \\"little evidence\\" for that to be the case. In proposing the law, the Committee on Local Laws argued that \\"there has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgement of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check- rein applied a little bit.\\"Proceedings of Bd. of Aldermen Mun. Assembly of City of New York, Recommendation No. 10, Dec. 7, 1926, at 572 In referring to \\"running wild,\\" the 1926 Committee may have been alluding to the popular 1920s song \\"Runnin' Wild\\", which popularized the Charleston dance. From 1940 to 1967, the New York Police Department issued regulations requiring musicians and other employees in cabarets to obtain a New York City Cabaret Card, and musicians such as Chet Baker, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and Billie Holiday had their right to perform suspended. In 1971, the Cabaret Law was modified to exempt musical performance \\"by not more than three persons playing piano, organ, accordion or guitar or any stringed instrument,\\" which disproportionately affected jazz since drums, reeds, and horns were not allowed, as was stated in the Chiasson I case and the Chevigny book. The so- called three-musician rule was not found in the original 1926 text of the bill. Throughout its history, the law was selectively enforced with its most notable enforcer, former mayor Rudy Giuliani, resurrecting the dormant rule as part of his implementation of broken windows policing to fine and shut down perceived nuisance bars in the late 1990s.  Cabaret licensing  All applicants for a cabaret license had to be fingerprinted; to provide extensive financial records; to meet specific zoning, surveillance, physical security, fire, building, electrical, health, and record keeping requirements; and to pay the fees associated with each compliance. In 2016, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs claimed there were then 118 cabaret licenses in a city of 25,100 licensed food service establishments.  Criticism and challenges  The law was heavily criticized both by the general public and from within city government. The limits on types of instruments were ruled unconstitutional in Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, 132 Misc.2d 640 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1986), and the three-musician limit was found to be unconstitutional in a later decision in the same case in Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, 138 Misc.2d 394 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1988). Although the code was change to reflect the ruling as to types of instrument, the text to reflect the elimination of the three-musician limit was not corrected in the text of the Administrative Code. A broader challenge to the Cabaret Law and New York City's Zoning Resolution under the New York State Constitution was rejected in John Festa v. New York City Department of Consumer Affair, 12 Misc. 3d 466 (Sup. Ct. NY County 2006), but the court urged legislative review of the law and concluded, \\"Surely, the Big Apple is big enough to find a way to let people dance.\\" In 2015, Brooklyn attorney and bar owner Andrew Muchmore filed a still-ongoing case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the law, claiming it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. The Muchmore case challenged the Cabaret Law but not New York City's Zoning Resolution. Repeal In 2017, Dance Liberation Network was formed, co-founded by Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson of Discwoman. They began the 'Let NYC Dance' movement to campaign for the repeal of the law. In June, New York City Councilmember Rafael Espinal introduced a bill for the full repeal of the regulation. It was passed 44-1 by the City Council on October 31, 2017. However, a venue can still be fined or closed by the city, as the law still requires the venue to be located in a zone that allows dancing.

She was born on (23 February 1958) in Kolkata and studied in Lucknow before moving to Mumbai with her parents. She was cast in Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa (1972) after meeting an assistant to director Satyen Bose at a party. She subsequently played in the hit movies Kora Kagaz (1974), Chalte Chalte (1976) and Dildaar (1977).

Nazneen was signed for two more films to be directed by Satyen Bose but they were never made. But working under the veteran director did help her a lot. Satyen Bose also wanted Nazneen to have a screen name. He had suggested Suparna, and then somebody suggested Sonali. However, she chose to be herself, Nazneen. In 1974 she acted in Kora Kagaz, which won her critical acclaim. In the film she played Jaya Bachchan's sister.

The division was first formed as the 33rd Rifle Division in March 1919 on the Southern Front and became the 33rd Kuban Rifle Division in December 1919. From June 1920 the division fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In September 1920, the units from the 33rd and other divisions became part of the new Kuban Cavalry Division, which soon became the 5th Kuban Cavalry Division.  History  = Astrakhan, Donbass battles, and attack on Moscow = Denikin's Moscow Offensive, 8th Army positions are in the center near Voronezh The division was formed by an order of the 11th Army dated 20 March 1919 from units of the 1st Rifle Division of the 12th Army, which had been formed in October 1918 as the Astrakhan Rifle Division. The division participated in the defense of Astrakhan until May 1919. The 33rd became part of the 11th Army upon its formation and was commanded by Pavel Kuzmich Marmuzov. In May, Mikhail Lewandowski took command of the division. Between May and June, the division fought in defensive battles for control of the Donbass. In June, the division became part of the 8th Army. After the Donbass fighting, White Army commander Anton Denikin ordered an attack on Moscow in the Moscow Directive. Initially successful, the White offensive forced the 8th Army, including the 33rd, and other Red units to retreat, but was stopped by Bolshevik resistance by the beginning of August. = August Offensive and Voronezh-Kastornensk Offensive = The 33rd Division fought in the subsequent Red August Offensive between 14 August and 12 September. During the offensive, the 33rd participated in battles in the area of Chertkovo, Kantemirovka, and Pavlovsk. The August Offensive failed to halt the Volunteer Army's advance, and the Don Army captured Voronezh. To halt the Don Army, the 8th Army and other units launched the Voronezh-Kastornensk Offensive. During the offensive, which resulted in the defeat of the Don Army, the 33rd captured the key rail station of Liski and fought in the advance of the 8th Army to the Don. = Operations in the Donbass = Between 20 November and 8 December, the 33rd fought in the Khopyor-Don Operation, during which it participated in the attack on Rossosh. From 24 November to 12 December, the division as part of 8th Army fought in the Kharkov Operation, during which the 33rd advanced on Starobilsk and captured Ostrogozhsk and Shebekino. On 2 December, the division was redesignated as the 33rd Kuban Rifle Division. On 18 December, the Donbass Offensive, began, with the objective of retaking the Donbass. During the offensive, the 33rd Division fought in the attack from the Bilolutsk area along the Aidar River, the recapture of Lugansk, the advance on the Petropavlovka-Ivanovka area, and the capture of Kartushino. = North Caucasus Advance = The Donbass Offensive succeeded, and the advance of the 8th Army continued in the Rostov-Novocherkassk Operation from 3 to 10 January 1920. The 33rd attacked from the Diakovo area towards Rostov and conducted a meeting engagement with elements of the White Consolidated Cavalry Corps in the area of Generalsky Most, then participated in the capture of Rostov on 7 January. Between 17 January and 6 February, the division fought in the Don‚ÄìManych Operation, fighting in the area of Starocherkasskaya, Aksayskaya, Manychskaya, and Zlodeiskaya. The division then fought in the Tikhoretsk Operation from 14 February to 2 March, during which a White counterattack briefly recaptured Rostov, which was retaken by the 8th Army on 23 February. In March, the division became part of the 9th Army. Lewandowski was promoted to command the 9th Army, and division commissar Oscar Stigga took command. From 3 to 27 March, the division fought in the Kuban-Novorossiysk Offensive, during which it advanced towards Timagievskaya, Medvedovskaya, and Abinsk. The 33rd fought in the capture of Novorossiysk, which resulted in the evacuation of the remnants of the Don Army and the Volunteer Army. During March and April, the division participated in mopping-up operations against remaining scattered White troops in the Maykop area, and the Stanitsas of Kamennomostnaya and Andryukovskaya, among others. During April and May, the division was part of the 10th Army. The division then became part of the 9th Kuban Army for the remainder of May. = Polish-Soviet War = Battle of Warsaw before the Polish counterattack, 15th Army positions are northwest of the city In June 1920, the division was transferred to become part of August Kork's 15th Army, fighting in the Polish-Soviet War. Between 4 and 23 July, the division fought in the July Offensive, during which it fought in the offensive on Grodno, fighting near Glubokoye and Molodechno, and the crossing of the Neman. From 23 July to 25 August, the division fought in the Battle of Warsaw, during which it participated in battles on the Narew, and the advance on Wyszk√≥w and P≈Ço≈Ñsk. On 15 August, a Polish cavalry raid led by Aleksander Karnicki cut the communications between the 15th Army and the neighboring 4th Army, and captured the town of Ciechan√≥w, the 4th Army's headquarters. Kork sent in the 33rd, in reserve at the time, and it reoccupied Ciechan√≥w after the Polish withdrew. On the next day, the Polish troops launched an unsuccessful counterattack, and the 33rd, reinforced by two Cossack regiments, attacked and destroyed a battalion of the Polish 18th Infantry Division. The Polish counterattack that began on 16 August finally broke through the Soviet lines and forced the division, along with the rest of the 15th Army, into a disorganized retreat. Around seven eighths of the Kuban Division retreated into East Prussia, where it was interned alongside much of the 15th Army. Division commander Stigga spent two months in internment, and was replaced in command by N.A. Shabanov. The 33rd was withdrawn back to Lida for reorganization in early September. By an order of the 15th Army dated 4 September 1920, the cavalry brigades of the 33rd and other divisions were used to form the new Kuban Cavalry Division, which soon became the 5th Kuban Cavalry Division.

The Four Great Kings of the Saigon criminal underworld at the time referred to the four most powerful mobsters in the city, immortalized by the saying: 1st) ƒê·∫°i Cathay, 2nd) Hu·ª≥nh T·ª≥, 3rd) Ng√¥ VƒÉn C√°i, 4th) Ba Th·∫ø.  Early life  Dai Cathay was born in 1940 as the son of L√™ VƒÉn C·ª±, who was a gangster in the market area of C·∫ßu Mu·ªëi. After 1945, Dai's father became a revolutionary and joined the B√¨nh Xuy√™n army to fight against the French, where his father served under his leader Ba D∆∞∆°ng. In 1946, his father was captured and exiled to C√¥n ƒê·∫£o prison, where he later died. After his father's death, ƒê·∫°i's mother eventually married a gambler who was also a drug addict. The family then moved to ƒê·ªó Th√†nh Nh√¢n street, located within the fourth district, which at the time was flooded with people who had quit the countryside to the city, and was also known as the place where many of the mobsters in Saigon went to run their illegal operations, making the area a hotbed for the ‚Äúblack society‚Äù of Saigon. On top of that, Cathay was treated badly by his stepfather. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of school and became a shoe shiner and sold newspapers at the Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© and C√¥ng L√Ω crossroads (now Nam K·ª≥ Kh·ªüi Nghƒ©a) in order to survive. In the area where ƒê·∫°i was selling newspapers, there was also a cinema named Cathay, with the streets around it being a common fighting grounds for the local street boys. ƒê·∫°i fought many times on this street, and was rumored to have never lost a fight, gaining him his namesake ‚Äúƒê·∫°i Cathay of Nguyen Cong Tru street‚Äù. As a youth wandering around the markets of Saigon in the 4th ward, ƒê·∫°i was known for stealing melons and bananas from the local produce, which he would then share with the many local street kids that he had befriended. Eventually, ƒê·∫°i gained a following of street youths around him, but unlike many other gang leaders, ƒê·∫°i was well known for his generosity and looking out for his street brothers and sisters, always keeping as little to himself as possible while sharing the rest with his gang; he also never punished members who didn‚Äôt bring in enough money to the gang, a trait uncommon for gang leaders. It was through this that ƒê·∫°i earned the respect of his fellow peers as the size of his gathering grew. However, ƒê·∫°i and his gang were constantly involved in bloody fights with rival gang factions. On one occasion, while in the second district, because ƒê·∫°i refused to name members of his gang that had been involved in a fight, a group of uniformed police officers forced him to kneel on the ground and swallow a live cockroach in front of his crew, which Cathay vomited in disgust. Despite that, he still would not incriminate his fellow brothers and sisters. In face of such stubbornness, the police sent ƒê·∫°i to the Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c Juvenile Reformatory. These reformatory facilities‚Äô sole purpose however was to house kids until they became old enough to be conscripted into the military, earning them a reputation as a \\"birthplace of thugs\\". It was in these halls that Cathay later befriended some of his later comrades that would assist him during his reign of Saigon. After leaving the reformatory, Cathay returned to his old haunt near the Cathay theatre and re-established his old order. ƒê·∫°i would proceed to later lead his gang through several clashes with the other gangs in the neighborhood that had taken control during his absence, particularly against B√© B√∫n's gang as Cathay later seized control over much of the 4th district, defeating all of his major rivals. By the early 1960s, at the age of 20, ƒê·∫°i Cathay was quickly becoming a notorious gangster in Saigon; ƒê·∫°i was in control of nearly all the illicit establishments, such as prostitution houses, drug dens and night clubs in the first and third districts of Saigon. He was also becoming a familiar face around these establishments and befriended engineers, doctors and artists such as Dzach Buu, Dzi Buu and Hoang Sayonara, who would later help craft ƒê·∫°i's business strategy by advising him to open casinos. At around the same time, ƒê·∫°i began to exploit the often corrupt officials of the Saigon government by means of bribery; he was allowed to open many casinos in district 1 of Saigon, and in return, the city officials received monthly payments, which allowed ƒê·∫°i to ever increase his profits and control over the illegal activities in the city.  Clash with T√≠n M√£ N√†m  As ƒê·∫°i sought to increase and expand his criminal rackets, he eventually began to venture some of his activities into the seemingly impenetrable fifth district, Ch·ª£ L·ªõn, which was under the control of T√≠n M√£ N√†m, an infamous mob leader at the time of ethnic Hoa descent who was the leader of the Chinese mafia in Ch·ª£ L·ªõn. T√≠n M√£ N√†m had the physical appearance of a dharmapala, had years of training in Shaolin Kung Fu and Choy Li Fut, and his nickname ng·ª±a ƒëi√™n literally meant the ‚ÄúMad Horse‚Äù. He was known as H·ªìng Tr∆∞·ª£ng within the Triad, second only to their leader, Ho√†ng Long (Yellow Dragon), who was the leader of all the Hoa gangs in Ch·ª£ L·ªõn. The clash between ƒê·∫°i Cathay's gang and T√≠n M√£ N√†m's had been taking place over the course of many years. At the beginning of 1964, ƒê·∫°i, followed by Ba Th·∫ø and L√¢m ƒê√†o Gi√† brought two cars and a dozen motorbikes with the markings Goebel, Push, Brumi, Ishia carrying two people per motorbike. The gang then suddenly brought out knives, swords, sticks, bayonets and simultaneously attacked the roadside shops in the Great World district. After a moment of shock, T√≠n M√£ N√†m's gang calmed down, began shouting and ran into the bars to arm themselves with knives, swords, and nunchakus in which afterwards they then hid and counterattacked. ƒê·∫°i Cathay's gang was severely beaten and bloodied, and thus was forced to flee from the scene. In addition, L√¢m ƒê√†o Gi√†, one of ƒê·∫°i's followers during the battle was wounded and lost one of his fingers, which later earned him the nickname ‚ÄúNine Fingers‚Äù. However, because of the gang battle, many people began to avoid T√≠n M√£ N√†m's establishments and casinos. With his business rapidly declining, T√≠n M√£ N√†m was desperate and so he asked to meet ƒê·∫°i Cathay at ƒê·ªìng Kh√°nh restaurant in order to negotiate. As a result of the negotiation, T√≠n M√£ N√†m and the Chinese gangs in Ch·ª£ L·ªõn ceded away the entire areas from between Nancy market and District 1, allowing ƒê·∫°i to open more casinos and run a monopoly on illicit activities within those regions.  Becoming ‚ÄúNumber One‚Äù of the Four Great Kings  At that time, besides ƒê·∫°i, in Saigon, there were also three major mobsters or ‚Äúkings‚Äù; Hu·ª≥nh T·ª≥, Ng√¥ VƒÉn C√°i and Ba Th·∫ø. The three mobsters were not pleased with ƒê·∫°i Cathay's rapid expansion in Saigon, so they decided to try to take down ƒê·∫°i in an ambush. ƒê·∫°i Cathay fell prey to their planned ambush where five swordsmen each pulled out their swords and rushed him. ƒê·∫°i miraculously managed to survive the attack. With his wounds still unhealed, and with a single knife in hand, ƒê·∫°i in turn sought after the five men that had attacked him in order to wash away his hatred. All five of the swordsmen were later hunted down and wounded by ƒê·∫°i. After these bloody payments, ƒê·∫°i became the number one of the ‚ÄúFour Great Kings‚Äù of the Saigon underworld, giving way to the famous saying: ƒê·∫°i - T·ª≥ - C√°i - Th·∫ø, the names of the four mobsters or ‚Äúkings‚Äù who ruled Saigon.  Disappearance/death  In November 1966, ƒê·∫°i Cathay was arrested and placed in Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc prison after being accused of having masterminded Tr·∫ßn Kim Chi's death when Tr·∫ßn Kim Chi, a subordinate general of Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan, was killed when a truck that was loaded with wood drove straight into his car. As a result, Kim Chi's general, Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan had ƒê·∫°i Cathay arrested on ‚Äúspecial treaty‚Äù charges. On the 28th of that November, ƒê·∫°i was placed in a C47 aircraft for transportation to the prison in Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc island. In 1967, ƒê·∫°i hatched a plan where he had his wife bribe the guards so that he could escape from the prison. On January 7, ƒê·∫°i and his men escaped from the camp, but when he passed through the front gate, the alarmed sound, alerting the guards surrounding the prison. Discovered, ƒê·∫°i was chased to the North part of the island, but the guards never found him and he was never heard from again. As a result of his mysterious death or disappearance, two main theories emerged to explain how ƒê·∫°i could have met his end: * Theory 1: ƒê·∫°i Cathay and his men were shot dead on the night of January 7 after they were discovered by a platoon. * Theory 2: ƒê·∫°i Cathay and his men were captured by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, and when ƒê·∫°i and his men tried to escape, they were shot dead. Lieutenant Tr·∫ßn T·ª≠ Thanh later boasted to several reporters in several newspapers before 1975 that he was the one who shot and killed ƒê·∫°i Cathay.  Anecdotes and legacy  *When general Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ asked for ƒê·∫°i to become his personal bodyguard, he responded that: -‚ÄúWherever I go I have escorts, if I were to escort you, sir, my bodyguards would be unemployed.‚Äù *With captain Tr·∫ßn Kim Chi, the chief of the Republic of Vietnam National Police, one evening, ƒê·∫°i Cathay had paid for the Paramouth restaurant's services and specially invited Tr·∫ßn Kim Chi to the banquet. ƒê·∫°i Cathay then said: -‚ÄúIf you, captain, pardon some of my brothers who were arrested, then we will be forever indebted to you.‚Äù Tr·∫ßn Kim Chi responded, ‚ÄúEating is eating, working is working. If you invited me to this banquet to do bargain, then I decline.‚Äù -\\"Oh no no,\\" ƒê·∫°i Cathay softly replied, \\"if you do not accept then it is fine. Still, today you were invited here to let us enjoy ourselves. Please captain, this whole restaurant tonight is here just to serve us, so don't be worried about anything.\\" Author Duy√™n Anh, after hearing ƒê·∫°i Cathay speak about his life as a gangster, and about the bloody battles out on the streets, decided to write the novel titled ‚Äúƒêi·ªáu ru n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øt‚Äù, translated to English as ‚ÄúTale of One Teardrop‚Äù which became famous in Vietnam. The protagonist of the novel was Tr·∫ßn ƒê·∫°i, who is the character prototype of ƒê·∫°i Cathay. While reading the book, ƒê·∫°i Cathay pleasantly enjoyed the first part of the novel, with much of it being based on his own real life events. However, at the end of the novel, when the main character Tr·∫ßn ƒê·∫°i lies dying on the fence, ƒê·∫°i seethed with rage, shouting: -‚ÄúThat damn Duy√™n Anh, how dare he play with me. I loved a woman so much that I got killed and had my body dried up on a fence? (To his men) Go find and cut off his testicles and give them to me!‚Äù Upon hearing the news, Duy√™n Anh fled to ƒê√† L·∫°t to hide until the end of 1966, when ƒê·∫°i Cathay was arrested by police and sent to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc island, in which only then did Anh dare to return to Saigon.  Cinematography  Duy√™n Anh's novel ‚Äúƒêi·ªáu ru n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øt\\" (Tale of One Teardrop) was based on the life of ƒê·∫°i Cathay, and the novel was later adapted into a film by the same name directed by L√™ Ho√†ng Hoa and was acted by two famous Vietnamese actors at the time Tr·∫ßn Quang and Thanh Nga.

In 1973 this house was the scene of the massacre of 7 Hanafi Muslims by members of the Nation of Islam. It was the largest murder that had ever been committed in Washington, D.C. The brick home continued to be the headquarters of the Hanafi group, and during the 1977 Washington, D.C. attack and hostage taking spokesman Abdul Azziz (35), son-in-law of the group's leader Hanafi Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, stood on the lawn and told journalists that, \\"Heads will be chopped off, a killing room will be set up at B'nai B'rith and heads will be thrown out of windows,\\" unless all demands being made by armed hostage takers at a downtown office building were met. A plaque on the building in the 1970s read: Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. History of the house Until 1969, this \\"Tudor mansion\\" was the home of Thomas A. and Edith B. Cannon, founders of the Washington, D.C. \\"landmark\\" Cannon Steakhouse. The three-story \\"plush\\" residence was purchased in 1971 by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for $78,000,Center in a Storm, Sports Illustrated, 19 February, Peter Carry who donated it for use as the headquarters of the Hanafi Madh‚ÄêHab in November 1972. Many years later, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar recalled that in the summer of 1970, when he was a rookie with the Milwaukee Bucks still known by his birth name, Lew Alcindor, and was new to Islam, Khaalis had expressed an interest in establishing a Hanafi community in Washington. Jabbar located the \\"three story\\" house \\"in an interracial section of Washington; its price was $80,000. I put up the down payment and opened the building to the community. It was a mosque, home, community center, and everybody used it.\\" The property was listed as the Hanafi American Mussulman's Rifle and Pistol Club. Jabbar and his wife Habiba were married by Khaalis at the Hanafi Center, and bought a handsome Tudor- style home a few blocks away where they lived; they continued to have close ties with the center in that period. During the period when it was Hanafi headquarters, 30 people lived in this single-family house. The 2015 Ward 4 Heritage guide states the group of homes of which this house forms part, were \\"impressive homes and subdivisions along 16th Street now inhabited by upper and middle income black professional families ‚Äì doctors, judges, attorneys, educators, politicians ‚Äì (that) became known as Washington‚Äôs 'Gold Coast.' Together with the ‚ÄúPlatinum Coast‚Äù, the communities of North Portal Estates and Colonial Village, this area of the ward was characterized by some as the 'bastion of black bourgeoisie.'\\" Newsday described the Shepherd Park neighborhood where the house is located as \\"upper-middle class and largely black.\\" The Washington Post described the neighborhood at the time of the murders as an area where \\"houses sit back from the sidewalk, good-sized solid houses of brick and stone, with enough lawn for a lengthy bout with a mower. There are built-in greenhouses, curving stairways, columns....\\" an area where \\"Jews, white Christians and blacks\\" lived side by side in a neighborhood that \\"has made something of a career of preserving religious and racial calm.\\" The Hanafi Madh‚ÄêHab house is situated next door to a large Orthodox synagogue, Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue, and across 16th Street from Congregation Tiferet Israel.Landrac, Shira Destinie Jones.

Two adults and a child were shot to death, 4 other children were drowned whose ages ranged from 9 days to 10 years old. Two others were severely injured. Four men from the Nation of Islam Mosque No. 12 were accused of the crime. =Impact= After the 1973 murders, \\"The azaleas were cut down and cleared away. Hedges, shrubbery, anything that might hide an intruder - were leveled until a bare expanse of gravel had replaced the garden. The windows were barred; a spotlight shone on the front steps. And Hanafi guards, armed with machetes and long Japanese swords, began a night-and-day vigil outside the Khaalis house. Every time a neighbor passed the Hanafi house the guards were there, pacing, walking steadily down the gravel field and back again. In winter they put on overcoats and warm hats and kept pacing. It made many neighbors uneasy.\\" Newsday described the conversion of the \\"large brick and fieldstone Tudor house\\" into a \\"fortress;\\" basement windows had been bricked over and iron bars sealed other windows. Khaalis's son-in-law, Abdul Aziz, boasted about the explosives inside to a reporter, claiming that \\"If people want to storm this house, that's it for the house.\\" Aziz asserted that \\"This is a Holy War in the sense that Allah tells you through the Koran... it seeks vengeance.\\" 1977 hostage crisis Khaalis' goal in attacking and taking hostages at Washington, D.C.'s John A. Wilson City Hall, the national B'nai B'rith headquarters, and the Islamic Center of Washington was to force the federal government to turn custody of the five black Muslims convicted in the 1973 murders at 7700 16th St. over to him for purposes of exacting revenge. He had been \\"stockpiling\\" weapons in the house on 16th street as he planned the attack. During the 1977 Washington hostage taking, The Washington Post described the building as \\"an armed camp\\" and wrote that \\"around the clock, at least one sentry armed with what appeared from the street to be a rifle, paced back and forth in front of half a dozen tall flagpoles.\\" People also reported \\"machete practice sessions on the lawn.\\" Members of the sect gave interviews from this house during the hostage taking. Amina Khaalis, a survivor of the 1973 massacre and daughter of sect leader Khaalis, said in a telephone interview that, \\"We obey the laws of the country. As long as it doesn't contradict with our Muslim law. Muslim law comes first.\\" And, \\"we're ready to fight to the death also, in this house,\\" she said. \\"And if it means us fighting to the death also, so be it. Babies and all.\\" Her husband Abdul Aziz, who walked out onto the lawn to speak with the press, said, \\"Allah tells you that by the way of the Holy Koran, when you are persecuted, you retaliable . . . It's a war against . . . the enemies of Islam.\\" The militant Jewish Defense League threatened to hold a demonstration at the house during the hostage crisis. Khadyja Khaalis, wife of the sect leader, held a press conference on the steps of the house after the hostages were released, in which she declared that ‚ÄúWe Hanafi Mussulmans throughout America say to the Zionist Jew‚Äêcontrolled J.D.L. and all Zionist Jews and their allies that they will write their own epitaph in self‚Äêdestruction and the blood of their people, as we fear Allah, nothing else.

The site is referred to as a cromlech by analogy with similar monuments in Western Europe, but it is the only structure of its kind known in the country. Description The site is situated on a low ridge-top above the left bank of the Arda river. It is enclosed on all sides and isolated from external influences. The circle consists of vertical, roughly-shaped, blocks of local hard volcanic rock (rhyodacite). The blocks are trapezoidal in shape, and are approximately 1.2 to 1.5 metres tall, and around 0.9 to 1.2 metres wide at the base, and 0.4 to 0.6 metres thick. Nine blocks still stand and three are now fallen. The vertical blocks are spaced at regular intervals, with smaller stones placed horizontally between them. The circle has an internal diameter of about 10 metres. There is an entrance on the southeast side. There are two smaller structures in the vicinity. One is a 3-metre-wide oval enclosure constructed out of stones located around 15 metres southeast of the cromlech. The other is a slightly larger oval enclosure of the same type, with a diameter of about 6 metres, located around 19 metres south of the cromlech. Excavations The site was discovered and excavated by Georgi Nehrizov in around 1998‚Äì1999. The excavations uncovered decorated pottery, as well as bronze artefacts (a fibula and a pin). These date the construction of the cromlech to the second phase of the Early Iron Age (8th‚Äì6th centuries BC). The two stone enclosures were in use around the same time, and finds of burnt human bone suggest a funereal use. The site continued in use into the late Iron Age.

It was released on IOS on June 22, 2016 by Perchang Games.  Gameplay  In Perchang the player is tasked with getting a certain number of balls from a designated starting point to go into a funnel located somewhere else in the environment to complete a level. The player must get the required number of balls into the funnel in a certain time limit to complete the level. In most levels the path between the start and end points is like Rube Goldberg machine with elements (environmental objects) such as magnets and flippers that need to be properly operated to get the balls to the funnel. The environmental objects are colored red or blue. Tapping the red button activates the objects colored red and tapping the blue button activates the objects colored blue. The player can change the color of the environmental objects which is done by tapping on the object (if the object was red it will become blue and vice versa). As the player progresses through the levels new elements are introduced such as magnets, flippers, fans, portals and more. The game has 60 levels, with 50 being regular levels (arranged in 10 areas) and 10 being bonus levels unlocked by getting a gold metal (done by completing the level in a certain amount of time or less) on all levels in an area. On October 27, 2016, a black mode was added with new zero g levels.  Reception  Perchang got mostly positive reviews. 148 Apps called the game a \\"beautifully minimalist puzzle game\\" and rated it 4 stars out of 5. A reviewer at Pocket Tactics said that the game \\"reminds me surprisingly strongly of playing Angry Birds\\". They gave the game 3 out of 5 stars saying that it was \\"attractive and engaging to think about, less enjoyable for which to perfect solutions\\". Apple'N'Apps gave the game a score of 4.0 out 5 praising that the game \\"combines thought and timing skill\\", has \\"varied contraptions\\", and has a \\"high quality design\\" while criticizing the fact that \\"some levels can be tedious\\" and \\"solutions can also drag out a bit\\". TouchArcade called the game like \\"Marble Madness meets Lemmings\\". The game also reached the Top Charts for paid apps in the US and UK App Stores (it was in #3 position on July 5, 2016).

Contributors throughout the run of the publication included Joyce Kozloff, Lil Picard, Miriam Schapiro, Sylvia Sleigh, Joan Snyder, Nancy Spero and May Stevens, many of whom were also affiliated with the feminist collective and journal Heresies. = Cynthia Navaretta = Navaretta (1923 - 2020) was a founding member of the Women's Caucus for Art, the Coalition of Women's Arts Organizations, and Women in the Arts in 1972. In addition to founding Women Artists Newsletter, she also established Midmarch Arts Press, which published dozens of books including Navaretta's Guide to Women's Art Organizations and Directory for the Arts (Midmarch Arts Press, 1979). She has edited several volumes of women in the arts and maintains a major archive of women artists in the U.S. since the later 1960s. The archive, housed at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art, includes press releases, exhibition and events announcements, catalogs, posters, and newspaper clippings regarding women artists and organizations. Photographs are of women's organizations, events and artists including Faith Ringgold, Susan Schwalb, Lowery Simms, Sari Dienes, Judy Seigel, Audrey Flack, and June Wayne, among others.

Introduction  Mega-Merger was developed by Robert Gray Gallager at MIT in 1983. It applies a distributed divide and conquer approach mixed with a rank-based conquer strategy. The algorithm is usually presented through a village-city analogy. Each node in the graph indicates a village, while the edges that connect them are the roads and a rooted spanning tree in a sub-graph is a city. The whole graph is then a mega-city. Mega-Merger pushes villages to bind together to form cities according to each other's rank and edges. Cities are then formed by alliances or by conquering/absorption.  Pre-requisites  Mega-Merger builds a minimum spanning tree over connected graphs provided: * Total reliability: No message is lost in transmission. * UI (unique initiator): A single node starts the protocol. * Bi-directional communications channels: Each edge is bi- directional, communications can travel in both directions. No further restrictions are necessary.  Algorithm  The algorithm assigns to each village a name and a rank, the former usually unique. The latter states the number of friendly mergers that the city has gone through, and the larger it is, the more powerful a city is considered. Moreover, to each edge is assigned a weight: each village/city C has a minimum-weight edge e_{merge}(C, C') also called merge link, that is the edge whose traversal has minimum cost. The algorithm proceeds in consecutive stages until a mega-city is formed. Each city C computes its own merge link and sends a request for merging across e_{merge}(C, C'). The request is handled by C' in the following ways: # Friendly merge: rank(C) = rank(C') land e_{merge}(C, C') = e_{merge}(C', C): If the cities share the same merge link and have same rank, a friendly merge occurs, and the two cities merge into one. A new name is picked for the newly created city, a ruling village is picked and the path from the previous ruler to the node in the merge link is re-oriented such that it leads to the new leader. The new city also has its rank increased by one. Notice as this is the only way two cities can increase each other's rank. # Absorption: rank(C) < rank(C'): If the requesting city has a lower rank, the city in the receiving end enacts an absorption process: C is absorbed like in the friendly merge, but loses its name and the resulting city has the rank of C'. # Suspension: rank(C) = rank(C') land e_{merge}(C, C') eq e_{merge}(C', C) lor rank(C) > rank(C'): In such cases C' freezes the request: it waits to either be absorbed by rule 2 or to merge and increase its rank above the one of C in order to be able to enact rule 1 and absorb C.  Outside messages  No nodes in the graph have a list of villages belonging to their village, hence each time a city wants to look for edges leading outside of it, it has to adopt an ask- reply protocol. The city ruler sends a broadcast message through its spanning tree, and each node x receiving it sends requests to its neighbors, excluding the edges to its child(ren) and parent. The response protocol is as follows: * x.city = y.city: clearly the edge is an intra-edge in C. x and y exchange negative responses. * x.city eq y.city land x.rank < y.rank: x is asking to a city of higher rank. By rule 2 we can assert that no absorption occurs, and y indeed belongs to another city. * x.city eq y.city land x.rank > y.rank: in this case y will delay the answer as by rule 3.  Properties  Mega- Merger holds several properties: * Monotonic rank: Each city C, mega-city excluded, will eventually rise in rank. By rule 1 C could friendly merge, raising its rank by 1; by rule 2 and 3 C will have a merge link (by hypothesis C is not the mega-city) it will either ask a higher-rank city C', getting absorbed and increasing its rank, or wait until C' reaches its level and operate a friendly merge. * rank(C) = K implies C geq 2^k: we have a level increase each time a friendly merge is operated. We compute by induction: on the base case, rank(C) = 0, exactly one village is in C. On the inductive case, two cities C', C s.t. rank(C') = rank(C) = k operate a friendly merge, hence C'-C = C' + C = 2^k + 2^k = 2^{k+1} by inductive hypothesis. * max{rank(C)} leq log n: by the previous rule cities are built up on an exponential base 2, hence the inverse log_{2} n. * Deadlock prevention: Mega- Merger doesn't incur in any deadlock. As shown by rule 3 a city C can wait for a lower-rank city to answer on merge link e: in order to incur in a deadlock such city C' would have to wait on C, and C on C, and so on until a cycle is detected on C^n waiting on C on a merge link e'. But by hypothesis e is the merge-link of C, hence such chain cannot exist. The other deadlock-inducing situation is a request from C to C' where C' has a different merge link than C. Still, as shown by monotonic rank either C' will grow its rank to absorb C, or will consume all its merge links to be the only city in the graph with C. Trivially in such case the two merge links would coincide and C' would be forced into absorption by rule 2.  Termination  Termination is granted by deadlock prevention and total reliability.  Cost  The cost analysis has two components, the stage-cost and the stage upper-bound. A city C enacts a stage by requesting a merge link from its villages and applying one of the above rules according to the desired situation. We can divide this stage in five steps: # Broadcast request for merge link to the leq n nodes in the tree. # Each node forwards an outside? message to its leq n neighbors and waits for their leq n answers. # The nodes then send the answers back to the city ruler by convergecast for a total of leq n messages. # The root then decides on a merge link and sends a message to the elected node. Trivially this message will need to travel height(Tree) leq n nodes. These five phases of request, outside discovery, communication and delivery have a total cost of n + 2n + n + n leq 5n. As for the wasted messages in the outside? between internal nodes, each node x has at most deg(x) - 2 internal edges, or deg(x) - 1 if x is a leaf, for a total of 2m - n wasted internal messages. Now for the number of stages. By the previously presented property on the cities size, each city of level k has geq 2^k, hence the largest reachable rank is log_2{n}. Since cities can merge/be absorbed only once per stage, we have a total of 2m + n + 5n log{n}total messages.  Correctness  Mega-Merger creates a minimum spanning tree by merging sub-trees through the minimum cost path, i.e. the merge link. By definition of minimum spanning tree, a minimum spanning tree is a set of minimum spanning trees connected through minimum- cost paths. By construction Mega-Merger forwards a request through its merge- link, and that sooner or later that edge is going to be part of the tree by deadlock prevention.

Through his mother, Flavia Sabina, a cousin of the Roman emperors Titus and Domitian, his connections enabled him to hold a series of civil and military imperial appointments. He was suffect consul in the nundinium of May to August 114 as the colleague of Gaius Clodius Nummus.Dated by a military diploma. Evgeni I. Paunov and Margaret M.

Sopses is known primarily from an inscription found in Pisidian Antioch.  Life  According to Ronald Syme, he acquired his unusual cognomen Sospes (\\"safe and sound\\") most probably from an event during his childhood.Syme, \\"The Enigmatic Sospes\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 67 (1977), p. 44 His father Lucius Caesennius Paetus, consul in 61, had been surprised by the Parthian advance in the Roman‚ÄìParthian War. While retreating before the enemy, Paetus had sent his wife and Lucius Caesennius (Syme estimates he was four years of age at the time) to safety in the fortress of Arsamosata; for a while the Parthians besieged the fortress.Tacitus, Annales, xv.10.3; 13.1. \\"An event in the life of a man or a family may be visibly commemorated by the choice of a cognomen,\\" Syme observes. Sospes was the son of Paetus and Flavia, and the brother of Lucius Junius Caesennius Paetus, consul in 79.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", p. 45 His senatorial career likely began in his teens as one of the tresviri aere argento auro flando feriundo, the most prestigious of the four boards comprising the vigintivirate. Membership in this board was usually allocated to patricians or young men with powerful patrons; as nephew of the late Vespasian, he likely fell into the latter category.The role of the office itself is discussed by J. R. Jones, \\"Mint Magistrates in the Early Roman Empire\\", Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, No. 17 (1970), pp. 70‚Äì78. The role of the vigintivirate in a senatorial career is discussed by A.R. Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 4‚Äì8 This was followed by Sospes serving as military tribune of the Legio XXII Primigenia which was stationed in Pannonia at the time; while serving as a junior officer in the legion, Sospes \\"received the decorations appropriate to a legate of praetorian rank, expedit(ione) Suebic(a) et Sarm(atica).\\"Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", p. 38 Syme explains he earned these dona militaria from actions in Domitian's campaigns in Pannonia around 92, in response to the Sarmatians and Suebi having invaded that province and destroying Legio XXI Rapax.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 38f This period of military service was followed by his election as the quaestor assigned to the province of Creta et Cyrene. Upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Sospes would be enrolled in the Senate.Richard Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), p. 16 He returned to Rome, where he held two more of the traditional Republican magistracies: curule aedile, and praetor. Roman provinces of Asia Minor, around AD 100 After completing his year as praetor, Sospes was then appointed to two civilian offices: praefectus frumenti dandi, the officer in charge of the Roman alimentum; and curator coloniarum et municipiorum, the equivalent of the governor of Roman Italy. Syme notes these last two offices are \\"something of a surprise\\": the first was not normally held by \\"men who achieve eminence in war or peace\\", while the second is otherwise not attested before the reign of Trajan.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 42f Then a further surprise: the inscription from Pisidian Antioch records he was made legatus Augustus pro praetorus (or governor) of a series of districts ‚Äì Galatia, Pisidia, Phrygia, Lycaonia, Isauria, Paphlagonia, and other districts. Syme provides a possible solution to this puzzle: he notes that the governor of Cappadocia, Lucius Antistius Rusticus, died in office in AD 94; he proposes that on the death of Rusticus that the province was temporarily divided between the two legionary legates, with Sospes, legate of Legio XIII Gemina, assuming control of Galatia and the neighboring districts, while the other assumed responsibility for the parts of Cappadocia bordering Armenia and Parthia. When Rome was able to send a consular replacement ‚Äì Titus Pomponius Bassus, who arrived the next year ‚Äì the two legionary legates returned to their regular responsibilities.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 39‚Äì42 \\"After military laurels in Pannonia and the governorship of Galatia, Sospes could look forward with rational confidence to a consulship in 97 or 98,\\" Syme observes. \\"Fortune turned against, with Domitian assassinated in September of 96 and Trajan adopted by Nerva eleven months later.\\"Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 43f As a relative of a hated ruler, Sospes lost his privileged position. It was not until 114 that Sospes was awarded the consulship by the emperor Trajan. Syme speculates that this achievement was \\"not unalloyed bliss\\": Lucius Caesennius Sospes held the fasces the same year that Trajan marched into Armenia, and the first place he occupied was Arsamosata, where his father had surrendered to the Parthians in AD 62.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 46f  Family  It is not known whether Sospes was married, or who his spouse may have been.

It was situated 20 km outside Rome, in the Alban Hills, in the ancient territory of Ager Albanus (from the legendary Latin city of Alba Longa). Today the remains of the villa are located mostly within the estate of the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo, and the rest in the towns of Castel Gandolfo and Albano Laziale. The Villa Barberini gardens are open to visitors. Castel Gandolfo and the site of Domitian's Villa History The legendary capital of the Latin League, Alba Longa, was believed to have been founded by the son of Aeneas, Ascanius, around the ancient volcanic crater filled by Lake Albano. But there is no agreement among scholars about the exact location of the ancient city and no archaeological traces. Alba Longa was completely destroyed in the 6th c. BC, and Latium vetus annexed to Rome. With progressive Roman expansion, the Alban Hills became home to numerous patrician suburban villas. In particular the remains of two large villas on the Via Appia Antica, one attributed to Publius Clodius PulcherGiuseppe Lugli, Le antiche ville dei Colli Albani prima dell'occupazione domizianea, Roma, Loescher, 1915 pp. 15-32 and the other to Pompey have been found.Lugli 1915, pp. 33-47 In addition various Republican-era villas nestled on the banks of the lake and beyond. All these properties eventually became, in one way or another, imperial property: by the time of Augustus, the extraordinary concentration of villas gave birth to the term Albanum Caesari. The first imperial villa estate was inhabited by Tiberius, then Caligula and Nero.Antonio Nibby, vol. I, in Analisi storico-topografico-antiquaria della carta de' dintorni di Roma, II¬™ ed., Roma, Tipografia delle Belle Arti, 1848, pp. 546. =The works of Domitian= The first emperors probably contented themselves to live in the most sumptuous existing villas, namely that of Clodius in Herculanum (today in the garden of the Villa Santa Caterina of the Pontifical North American College) and that of Pompeo Albano (now in the municipal public park of Villa Doria). Remains of Villa of Pompey, Villa Doria Domitian, who settled there on a permanent basis, decided to build a new main complex to the villa in the most panoramic position towards both the sea and the lake, and featuring lavish new structures such as a racecourse and theatre. Probably the project was entrusted to Rabirius, architect of the Palace of Domitian on the Palatine. The villa came to occupy six square kilometres according to the calculations of Giuseppe Lugli. Martial mentions the villa as one of Domitian's favoured resorts.Martial V 1.1. [cf. IV 1.5] Suetonius says Domitian had a passion for archery which he practised thereSuetonius, Domitianus, 19 and Pliny suggests he held boating parties on the lake.Pliny ib. 82. 1-4 On the death of Domitian the villa was rarely used by his imperial successors. Some modifications are dated to the second century and in particular to the eras of Trajan and Hadrian. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the emperor Hadrian stayed there waiting for the completion of his Villa Adriana in Tivoli, while Marcus Aurelius lived there a few days using the villa as a refuge during the riots that took place in 175 AD. Description The villa was built on the rim of the ancient volcanic crater filled by Lake Albano (between 100,000 and 5,000 years ago). For this reason, given the uneven ground, the villa was built on three terraces. The terrace structure is not uncommon for Roman villas in the hills: for example the nearby villa in Frascati, the so-called villa of Lucullus, later belonging to Flavia gens, built in terraces on the slope of Tusculum facing Rome: the vast terrace now houses virtually all the historic centre of Frascati. The terraces of the villa of Domitian are narrow and about 500 m long. A fourth (highest) level lies on the plane of the Appian Way. The palace proper stood on the third terrace from the top, in the present church of St. Francis of Assisi and the adjoining building of Propaganda Fide. North of it there was the second terrace, which had a panoramic view of the lake (east) and the sea (west). Finally, on the lower terrace were the Hippodrome and the entrances to the villa. There are also isolated structures connected with the Domitian Villa: the nymphaeum and the docks on the lake shore, the hillside terrace, cisterns and the three aqueducts from Palazzolo, the access road network, the nymphaeum of the Rotunda in the centre of Albano converted into a Catholic church. It was also felt until the beginning of the twentieth century that the Albano Roman amphitheatre was connected to the villa. Today it is not possible to calculate precisely the extent of the imperial properties in this area which certainly included most of today's municipalities of Castel Gandolfo and Albano Laziale. Quite possibly it extended north to at least Bovillae (XIII milestone of Appia Antica), in the south up to Aricia (XVI mile). Also the villa attributed to Pompey was incorporated, the remains of which are now included within the residential area of Villa Doria at Albano. Other remains of a villa of Tiberian age, but inhabited until the fifth century, have been found to the southwest in Cavallacci, at the ring road of Albano. To the east, however, probably the imperial possessions included the entire Lake Albano with the many villas built in the Republican era on the crater (the so-called Augusto Palazzolo, one attributed to Seneca not far away, and others between Marino and Castel Gandolfo). It is not impossible that even the lake of Nemi was part of Albanum Caesare, as Julius Caesar had built a villa in the area, identified as remains at Monte Gentile. In the opinion of Lugli under Domitian the various villas in the imperial property were brought together in one single property. =The palace= The palace had three stories, as shown by the remains of a staircase seen from Lugli. All the walls are made of brickwork reinforced every 80 cm: it does not appear to have used opus reticulatum suggesting a 1st c. AD or later date. The complete reconstruction of the building plan was made by Pietro Rosa. The building was structured around three courtyards, called \\"atria\\" by Rosa. This feature allowed Lugli to recognise the analogy with the complex of Domitian's palace on the Palatine in Rome. It was based on three open spaces: triclinium, peristyle and tablinum. The baths were recognised thanks to the abundance of clay pipes etc. The spa area is located in the righthand central atrium, probably the ancient peristyle. =The second level= Lakeview terrace Avenue of the Nymphaea A hundred metres from the palace in one of the nineteenth-century villas are the remains of a terrace overlooking the lake. Only two walls of substructure are spaced from one another by 15 m. The fact that these structures are in opus reticulatum suggests that this is an early villa, dating from the late Republican era, embedded in the structure of the later villa. Probably between the two walls was a road leading down to the lake shore. The lakeside terrace is accessed through a tunnel dug into the lava rock, cyclopean work whose only purpose was to allow the emperor to climb the gentle slope of the hill to see the lake below. In 1910 the tunnel was cleared from the earth that had filled over the centuries, but since it ended outside the papal property it was closed at the villa Barberini wall. The tunnel is 100 m long and has a single skylight, around the middle. The height of the entrance on the side of Villa Barberini is 2.40 m. The outlet on the side of the lake below was tracked down by Lugli in the wall of the terrace which includes a large brickwork arch 3.75 m wide. Cryptoporticus of Villa of Domitian The Avenue of the Nymphaea This construction is connected to the theatre by a long north-south avenue with four side niches identified by archaeologists as nymphaea. The first nymphaeum from the south is rectangular, 6.20 m deep and has thirteen niches in the walls; the second and the fourth, semicircular, are 2.60 m and 6.85 m wide and have seven niches; the third, rectangular, is 5.50 m with thirteen niches, like the first. In some places wall plaster remains (often 3 cm thick) and even, at least at the time of Lugli, traces of colour. The Cryptoporticus of the Villa Domitiana in the Garden of Villa Barberini The Cryptoporticus The cryptoporticus was used to build up and support the front of the terrace above which ran the avenue of the nymphaea and forecourt of the theatre. Although now very truncated it still has a length of 120 m. At 7.45 m wide, it is probably the largest known cryptoporticus in any villa around Rome, certainly dwarfing any of those of the Villa Adriana at Tivoli. The vaulted ceiling was coffered in stucco of which few traces remain. The east side is carved in part from the rock itself, while the west is pierced by windows providing light: Lugli noted with admiration how each window corresponds to a niche on the other side. At the north end was the statue of Polyphemus found in the Bergantino nymphaeum on the shore of the lake. Various access routes from the Appian Way to the villa converged towards this cryptoporticus and therefore it was a sort of long covered entrance. The theatre Detail of the stucco reliefs in the theatre The theatre is one of the most significant buildings of the villa, with its extraordinary relief panels in the hall of the auditorium. It is the only building to be investigated recently.Hesburg 1978/80: Hesburg H. Von. ¬´ Zur Datierung des Theaters in der Domitiansvilla von Castel Gandolfo : Archeologia Laziale 4 (1981). pp. 176-80 The auditorium was built against the hill, while the orchestra and the stage were on the floor of the second terrace. It was built according to all the criteria of the acoustics of the time, pointing to the west to avoid the interference of the turbulent winds of the north and south. The orchestra's radius to the first seat was of 5.90 m, just 20 Roman feet: therefore Lugli was able to calculate that the total radius of the semicircle of the theatre was 25 m. The first excavation of the theatre was in 1657 by Leonardo Agostini for Cardinal Barberini. Lugli began studying theatre in 1914 and adjourned his studies in 1918 after the refurbishment of the Villa Barberini brought to light other ruins; in particular, another part of the auditorium hall with other stucco panels was discovered in 1917. The theatre is notable for stucco decorations in perspective, similar to painting of the fourth style. It is a frieze consisting of thirteen panels depicting themes related to theatre and one of the most important testimonies to the Flavians, like the paintings of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some rooms date back to the age of Hadrian, which witness the continuity of use at least until completion of Villa Adriana in Tivoli. =The \\"Hippodrome\\"= The hippodrome is on the third terrace and is a large north- south space 75 m wide bounded by brick walls. It was not possible to establish the length because the wall to the south is not known. The north wall forms a semi-circle and at the centre of this semicircle was a fountain, 7.1 m long and 2.3 wide, decorated with stucco.Lugli 1920, pp. 64-66 However it has been shown to be a garden from the water cisterns and decoration, similar to that of Domitian's palace on the Palatine.ALBANUM AND THE VILLAS OF DOMITIAN; Robin DARWALL-SMITH; p. 150 Under the substructures is a cistern 41 m long. Not far from the structures were found a number of areas of equal width of 4.20 m long and 2.95 m, set against the foundation wall of the second shelf, under the cryptoporticus. =Remains on the shore of the lake= The Nymphaea The two nymphaea (Doric and Bergantino) on the shore of the lake are fascinating and mysterious structures. The Doric nymphaeum was probably rediscovered in 1723, since it is in a memoire of Francesco de Ficoroni (the discoverer of the famous Cista Ficoroni). =The Doric nymphaeum= The Doric Nymphaeum The beautiful Doric nymphaeum on the descent from Castel Gandolfo towards the lake is dated to the Republican age. It has similarities to that at Caffarella. The function of this structure remains obscure but the nymphaeum was a Doric temple perhaps built on the site of ancient Alba Longa. The nymphaeum is a rectangular space of 11 x 6 m with the barrel-vaulted ceiling reaching a height of 8 m, and with niches arranged in two rows. The order of the first floor columns is Doric (hence the name of the fountain), that of the second Ionic. At the centre in front of the entrance is an arch leading into a natural cave, probably an ancient spring. Many scholars believe that it could be the ‚Äúsacella‚Äù (sacrarium) described by Cicero and built by Clodius on the ruins of the ancient Alba Longa. The Nymphaeum is faced with opus reticulatum. There used to be spectacular water works with larger and smaller waterfalls and channels fed with water from one of the aqueducts and from a series of cisterns and pipes installed behind the central back wall. =The Bergantino nymphaeum= On the western shore of Lake Albano, 2 km after the Doric nymphaeum is a circular cave of 17 m diameter. A pool is in the middle of the cave, and the floor was completely covered with mosaics, of which a few fragments remain. Various parts of sculptural groups found in the nymphaeum are now kept at the Pontifical Palace in Castel Gandolfo The Bergantino nymphaeum The docks The first comprehensive study on the docks and neighbouring buildings was completed in 1919 by Lugli and Thomas Ashby. The two eminent scholars explored the lake not only on foot, sometimes wading into the water, but also by aerial survey on board an airship.Lugli 1921 , pp. 17-18 Their conclusion was that the shore was a collection of docks of several private villas or structures of different ages. In particular, the docks are concentrated on the western and eastern shore, while similar structures are not present on the southern bank or to the north. The eastern shore begins at the town of Cantone and ends in the locality of Acqua Acetosa. Here Lugli and Ashby found remains of three adjacent villas dating back to the first century, each with its direct flight of steps to the lake. The western shore starts at the junction of the 140 road to the beach at Castel Gandolfo and continues to the Bergantino nymphaeum at the rowing stadium for the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. On this stretch are the most monumental remains including a cryptoporticus probably related to a villa, and a structure known as a beacon or lighthouse. The first part of the shore at the Doric nymphaeum is dated to the late Republican era, and one or two villas can be recognised which were subsequently incorporated into the Domitian complex. =The rotonda= The Rotonda in Santa Maria della Rotonda This unique building has a cylindrical plan within a cube, similar but smaller to the Pantheon in Rome, also replicating the oculus (central hole).Giuseppe Lugli, La \\"Rotonda\\" di Albano, in Il tempio di Santa Maria della Rotonda , p. 67, Albano Laziale 1972. Its diameter is 16 m and the whole structure is made of opus mixtum. It is unclear why Domitian had this built so far from the residential complex of his villa. In the past it was believed to be a temple dedicated to Minerva and the Sun and the Moon, but Lugli objected that its plan was not of a typical Roman temple, and he therefore believed it was an isolated nymphaeum, a view shared by many today.Pino Chiarucci, La civilt√† laziale e gli insediamenti albani in particolare, in Atti del corso di archeologia tenutosi presso il Museo civico di Albano Laziale nel 1982-1983, pp. 58-59 In the Severan era this structure was incorporated into the perimeter wall of the Castra Albana and adapted for bathing by legionaries: to this phase belong the floor mosaics and the rectangular entrance front. Probably between the ninth and tenth century it was converted into a place of worship, and received the Eastern image of the Madonna dating from the 6th - 7th century. =Water supply= The aqueducts The complex of Domitian's Villa is supplied from the southeast by four aqueducts coming from sources located between the towns of Palazzolo and Malafitto. In many places, ancient aqueducts still feed modern ones or have been in use until a few decades ago. The most ancient aqueduct is the \\"Hundred Mouths\\" so named because it collects water from springs scattered over an area of about 150 m between the towns of Palazzolo and Malafitto; its course is a wide tunnel 1.65 m high that runs along the ridge of the lake to the Colle dei Cappuccini, which it crosses via a tunnel about 500 m long. The tunnelling work was so demanding that the builders wrongly made a reverse slope for about 100 m which they had to fix by raising the aqueduct floor with bricks.Lugli 1918 , pp. 30-33 The aqueduct disappears at the height of the old town of Albano, about 3 m below the ground in Piazza San Paolo. It is very likely that this served originally the villa of Pompey. In the Severan age it must have also served the Castra Albana as the great \\"Cisternoni\\" of the thermae are adjacent to the Rotunda and the Baths of Caracalla. Two aqueducts have sources near Malafitto, called \\"high\\" and \\"low Malafitto\\" depending on the height at which they run. The high Malafitto aqueduct is the only one of the four definitely attributable to the Domitian era. The aqueduct had to serve the whole of the villa building, and to maintain a high flow, the builders had to follow a rather tortuous path through the woods of Selvotta. Finally the aqueduct passed under the Colle dei Cappuccini and ran in a section parallel to the other two aqueducts. In 1904 the last part of the aqueduct was found at the cemetery of Albano, about 2.50 m below the surface today. From there, the tunnel emptied into the great cistern of the villa under the seat of Propaganda Fide. The tunnels not carved into the rock are made of opus reticulatum. The channel is approximately 60 cm wide and about 1.60 m tall. Along the route were found 53 circular wells, the deepest of which is 53 m. The low Malafitto has more opus reticulatum and different channel dimensions that suggest a period immediately subsequent to the Flavian, presumably Trajan or Hadrian. Its route runs almost parallel to the others to the cemetery of Albano but then heads towards the current town of Castel Gandolfo and it seems certain that it leads to the large Torlonia cistern in the dell'Ercolano area. Lugli ruled it out as a service aqueduct of the oldest villa of Clodius but considers it possible that the route may have been rearranged and extended to the Torlonia cistern in the second century to serve the new part of the imperial possessions. He also believes that there was a direct water supply arm to the Roman amphitheatre of Albano Laziale, built with the construction of the Castra Albana. Finally, the aqueduct of Aqua Augusta was identified in 1872 by Giovanni Battista de Rossi due to five memorial stones found in different properties between the Fields of Hannibal at Rocca di Papa, and the slopes of Monte Cavo. The only possible hypothesis is that it served the Roman villa identified on the shores of Lake Albano in Palazzolo, attributed to Augustus by the 19th c. archaeologists. =The garrison= Later history =Abandonment= The African Emperor Septimius Severus built the grandiose structures of the garrison of Castra Albana in 197 AD on the edge of the imperial properties for his loyal veterans of Legio II Parthica. However, decline of the villa also began at this time. The Parthian legionaries and their families established around the camp began to plunder the villa structures in order to use the material for new construction, thus giving rise to the village that would later become Albano Laziale. A second town developed on the northern edge of the imperial properties: in the Middle Ages it was called Cuccurutus and gave rise to the village Castel Gandolfo. The Liber Pontificalis records the donation of virtually all imperial property, and much of the surrounding area, to the cathedral of St. John the Baptist (identified with the Cathedral of Albano, now named after the martyr Saint Pancras), made under Pope Sylvester I (314 - 335 AD) by Emperor Constantine I. We do not know if this donation was real or not, but certainly the imperial villa of Albanum was abandoned. Around the tenth century an ancient nymphaeum of the villa, integrated in the Severan era with the thermal baths of Castra Albana, was consecrated to religious use as sanctuary of Santa Maria della Rotonda, today a revered place of worship of Albano, and known as \\"la Rotonda\\". The villa became the quarry of marble and building materials, similar to that of other ancient buildings: we know for sure that its marbles were used to build and coat the Cathedral of Orvieto in the fourteenth century. The then feudal lords, the Savelli, gave permission to dismantle the facilities of the villa in 1321: the destruction lasted 36 days. The documents of the time outline a real business behind the dismantling of these monuments: Rodolfo Lanciani drew inspiration from these careful studies of smoke to obtain an exemplum on the reuse of the immense marble and stone material of ancient monuments of Rome and its surroundings. =Rediscovery= Giuseppe Lugli (1890 - 1967) was an eminent Italian archaeologist of the twentieth century. He graduated in 1913 with a thesis on the Alban villa of Domitian, and subsequently enriched, corrected and completed his studies about until 1922, publishing four volumes which, with his topographic surveys, are still the main source of information on the villa. In 1919 he made the first archaeological survey aboard the airship \\"Roma \\", accompanied by the director of the British School of Rome, Thomas Ashby. Pope Urban VIII ( 1623 - 1644 ) was the first pontiff to holiday in Castel Gandolfo, the Papal Palace; his nephew Taddeo Barberini bought the villa in 1631 which had belonged to Scipione Visconti, and which contained the most significant contents of Domitian's Villa. The most striking views of the ruins overgrown by vegetation, such as the cryptoporticus and nymphaeum, were described by scholars and diarists from the 15th c. onwards and reproduced in engravings and paintings. In 1929 the Lateran Treaty recognised the 55 hectares of the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo between the extraterritorial zone of the Holy See in Italy: most of the ruins of the villa became part of the Vatican City State, thanks to the sale of Villa Barberini to the Holy See, historically linked to the papal complex, but until then alien to it. The Pontifical Villas were subjected to a radical reorganization at the behest of Pope Pius XI and even the archaeological inventories, such as the cryptoporticus and the road of the nymphaeum, were cleaned and incorporated.

The subject is the life and music of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (ca.1525-1594), a famous Italian Renaissance composer of sacred music. He is the best-known 16th-century composer of the Roman School. Filmed in March 2009 on locations mainly in and around L'Aquila and Rome, most of the ancient buildings and historical interiors in the city of L'Aquila were destroyed by the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, only a few days after the end of shooting. Palestrina‚Äôs music in the film is directed by Flavio Colusso and the Roman Ensemble Seicentonovecento. The film was also titled The Liberation of Music or Die Befreiung der Musik when released in Germany. Plot ‚ÄúTo achieve artistic and economic independence, Palestrina works with great diplomacy in the shadow of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. Despite strict ecclesiastical rules, he succeeds in modernizing music.‚Äù press communication Arte: Palestrina - F√ºrst der Musik The film starts with the death of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina in 1594. Afterwards his son, Iginio, some of his students and colleagues, members of the Cappella Giulia (Julian Chapel) at St. Peter's Basilica, and also members of the Roman clergy give their personal statements or testimony on Palestrina‚Äôs life and career: from his childhood, when he is trained as a choir-boy in the circle of the \\"Roman School\\" of polyphony founded by Costanzo Festa, to the peak of his career, when the plague and an influenza epidemic take away his two oldest sons and his wife. These testimonies reveal Palestrina as a typical Renaissance artist who takes his destiny into his own hands and maintains his artistic independence in the middle of the greedy Roman clergy, who are more interested in secular politics than in the spirituality of music. He developed a new style in polyphonic art, the genus novus with a balance between word and sound, in which all voices are separate and independent from each other. Palestrina finally liberates music from the word. In this style he composes the famous Missa Papae Marcelli, which, after the Council of Trent, becomes the model for sacred music. After having lost his two sons and his wife, the testimonies reveal with the wink of an eye, that Palestrina, instead of taking holy orders, decided to marry a very rich widow, enabling him to afford the publication of all his scores. In this way his work would never be forgotten. Palestrina‚Äôs music is presented in the film by the Roman ‚ÄòEnsemble Seicentonovecento‚Äô, conducted by maestro Flavio Colusso.

The region was catalogued in 1959 in the extended seconded edition of the Sharpless catalogue. This area is part of the Canis Major OB1 Association, and is a very active area of new star formation. Studies in 1988 found that the bright star illuminating the nebula was 8th magnitude HD 53623 / HIP 34178 with spectral class B1II/III. Later in 2004 it was shown that there was embedded a cold but massive Young Stellar Object or YSO within Sh2-297 near the edge of one of the dark rifts. This object has been observed in the far-infrared, but it is so deeply embedded in an interstellar cloud that it is undetectable in shorter wavelength observations such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), leading it to be originally named \\"Unidentified young stellar object 1\\" or UYSO-1. It was further revealed that this unseen stellar source produces a carbon monoxide (CO) bipolar outflow with a total mass of solar masses, while the surrounding extended envelope weighs ‚Äì.

GuzmanRalph C. Guzm√°n (1924-October 10, 1985, born Rafael Cortez Guzm√°n) served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of Latin America in the Carter Administration and was one of the nation's leading Latino educators. He co-founded the Oakes College at the University of California at Santa Cruz and later was appointed Provost at UCSC's Merrill College. Guzm√°n played an influential role in the early years of the Chicano Movement, and was a key figure in the Mexican-American community nationwide. During his time in the State Department, he was responsible for formulating and implementing much of the nation's policy in Central and South America.  Early life and education  Born in Moroleon, Guanajuato in 1924, Rafael Cortez Guzm√°n immigrated to the U.S. as a child during the Depression, and worked for several years with his family in the fields of the Southwest before settling in East Los Angeles. He served in the Merchant Marines and Navy during World War II, participating in the final assault on Okinawa, and returned to complete an A.A. at East Los Angeles Junior College under the G.I. Bill in 1949. After the war, he enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, where he earned bachelor's (1958) and master's (1960) degrees in political science. In 1955 he was named director of the Alianza Hispano-Americana's (a Mexican American fraternal insurance society) newly founded civil rights department, where he cultivated his skill in developing community support organizations. Along with Fred Ross Sr. and Congressman Edward R. Roybal, Guzm√°n assisted in the founding of the Community Service Organization in the Los Angeles area. Following three years spent serving as Associate Director of the Peace Corps contingents in Venezuela and Peru, Guzm√°n returned to Los Angeles and became one of the few Chicano graduate students (and first to receive a Ph.D. in political science) at UCLA. There, while completing his studies, he was appointed a director of the Mexican-American Study Project, and helped develop The Mexican Americans: Our Second Minority (NY, 1970).  Research and Legacy  Dr. Guzm√°n's research, put forth in The Mexican Americans: Our Second Minority, was essential to the Chicano Anti-Vietnam Movement. His researched showed that disproportionate numbers of Latino Americans were dying in the war. Guzman drew his conclusions from US military records and the surnames of the casualties, identifying Spanish surnames as Latinos. Recently, Pomona College historian Tomas Summer Sandoval revisited Guzman's work using more thoroughly tested surnames lists and confirmed Guzm√°n's conclusions. In the 2015 PBS documentary On Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam, which examines the Latino experience during the Vietnam War, Sandoval says in an interview, \\"The Chicano Anti Vietnam War Movement does not exist without the research of Ralph Guzman. He is the verifiable proof of their common sense understanding that this war was disproportionately affecting our community.\\"On Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam. Dir. Myl√©ne Moreno.

The Air Force wanted to create a faster plane for spying than the U-2. = Overview = In 1956, Pratt and Whitney along with the United States Air Force decided to buy a 10 square mile piece of land in Western Palm Beach County.  Security  At the time, the western part of Palm Beach County was sparsely populated. Authorities said it was a fertilizer producing town to cover up the operation so that residents would not be suspicious. The name Apix meant Air Products Inc, Experimental. There was also commercial protection to make sure that potential speculators and buyers stayed clear. Land nearby was also platted and had a census marker. Pratt & Whitney bought 9,000 acres near what would today be the J.W. Corbett Wildlife Refuge. For buyers to not know it was United Aircraft (now United Technologies) a third party had bought a ranch and gave it to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission which then was given to the U.S. Air Force.  Testing  The project's main goal was to test liquid hydrogen as a fuel source for rockets which had been in interest of the United States government since the late 1940s. Apix was part of what was called Project Suntan that was carried out in extreme secrecy from 1956‚Äì1958. The plant could liquefy Hydrogen at approximately rate of a half a ton a day, costing $6.2 million a day ($53,580,135.23 in 2017) and would be transported in an underground pipeline to a testing facility. A second plant was built in 1959 and had a capacity of 30 tons and cost about $27 million. In February 1959 the managers had decided that transporting liquid hydrogen in the underground pipeline took too much energy and decided to close it. Instead, they decided to ship hydrogen in insulated tanks on the Beeline Highway.

After World War II, Telakowska joined the Communist government in Poland, creating the Bureau of Supervision of Aesthetic Production (Biuro Nadzoru Estetyki Producji, known as BNEP) in 1946. As the head of BNEP, she commissioned artists (including some from ≈ÅAD) to design many mass-produced Polish goods, under the BNEP motto of \\"Beauty is for everyday and for everybody.\\" In her role, Telakowska protected and sponsored modernist artists. Some artists were suspicious of collaborating with the Communist government during a time of continued political conflict. Ultimately, BNEP shut down, as the value of artist designs was not convincing enough to factory owners. Telakowska went on to found Warsaw's Institute of Industrial Design (Instytut Wzornictwa Przemyslowego, or IWP) in 1950 and served as its first director.

The last Laird of the Hamiltons of Grange, who held the title from 1774 until his death in 1837, was Alexander Hamilton's first cousin, also named Alexander. James Alexander Hamilton was born in Ayrshire, Scotland in 1718. He was the fourth son of Laird Alexander Hamilton of Grange. His mother, Elizabeth Pollock, was the eldest daughter of Sir Robert Pollock, 1st Baronet of Pollock. With little prospect of an inheritance in Scotland, James moved to the West Indies to become a merchant and businessman on the island of Saint Kitts. He and Rachel Faucette (who was of English and French descent), became the parents, out of wedlock, of Alexander Hamilton and his older brother James Hamilton Jr. Alexander Hamilton moved in October 1772 to the Thirteen Colonies (later the United States) to earn an education. He later became the aide-de-camp to General George Washington and first Secretary of the Treasury. He married Elizabeth Schuyler, who was the daughter of Philip Schuyler and Catherine Van Rensselaer, both members of prominent Dutch-American families, the Schuyler and Van Rensselaer families. Elizabeth and Alexander Hamilton were married on December 14, 1780, at the Schuyler Mansion in Albany, New York. They went on to have eight children, thus establishing the Hamilton family in the United States.

Kourosh Zaim (; born May 17, 1939) is an Iranian author, inventor, engineer, translator, and nonviolent political activist. He was born in Kashan, Iran, on May 17, 1939. A vocal advocate of secular democracy and human rights since youth, Kourosh rose to prominence as a political analyst and Secretary to the Leadership Committee of Iran‚Äôs National Front party, or Jebhe Melli, Iran's largest pro-democracy political organization. Membership in Jebhe Melli has been illegal since 1981. As of 2017, Kourosh is incarcerated in Iran as a political prisoner. He was last arrested on July 16, 2016 for charges of \\"undermining the Islamic Republic\\" and \\"promoting anti-regime activity\\", and is currently serving a four-year prison term in Evin Prison, the sixth time he has been imprisoned for his views since Iran's Islamic Revolution. Much of his time as a political prisoner has been spent in solitary confinement. He has been represented in the past by human rights attorneys Nasrin Sotoudeh and Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi. He is currently being represented by Giti Pourfazel, a well-known human rights lawyer currently planning her immanent retirement due to \\"years of state harassment and threats.\\" Family Kourosh was born in Kashan, Iran, on May 17, 1939, to mother Khanoum Khanima Assadi and father Javad Zaim (deceased), a businessman and political activist. Kourosh is the oldest of four siblings: Soudabeh, Siamak and Bahram. Kourosh's mother is from the Naraghi family, a line of influential Shi'ite clerics. Kourosh‚Äôs great-grandfather Mahmud Zaim was Kashan's largest tobacco cultivator. In 1891, Mahmud organized a rebellion with Iran's other two major tobacco growers, in which they burned their entire crop of tobacco in defiance of the shah's tobacco trade concession to Great Britain. This forced Iran's top cleric, Mirzaye Shirazi, to sign a fatwa against the agreement, which helped foment a people's movement against the trade agreement that came to be called the Tobacco Protest. The Shah was forced to cancel the trade agreement the following year. The Tobacco Protest was the first nationwide rebellion in Iran's modern history. Many scholars believe it to be the moment Iranians realized they could oust foreign exploiters through solidarity which later led to the Persian Constitutional Revolution a few years later.Keddie, Nikki. Religion and Rebellion in Iran: The Tobacco Protest of 1891-92. Frank Cass, 1966, p. 65 Kourosh Zaim's uncle, activist during Constitutional Revolution, PM, exiled, poisoned. Kourosh‚Äôs great uncle, Seyed Hassan i Zaim, a political activist during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905‚Äì07), member of Iran's 4th, 5th, and 6th post-revolutionary Parliaments (1921‚Äì25) and Speaker for the Minority Faction, undertook to impeach Reza Shah for totalitarian rule. He was threatened with execution and fled to Europe, where he spent the next 17 years in exile. In 1946, in partnership with Mohammad Mosaddegh, Hassan returned to Iran to create a new minority faction in the parliament. He was elected from his home city of Kashan, but the night after the election results had been announced, an envoy from the Shah came to him posing as a congratulator and offered coffee to him. He was declared dead and buried the next day after the examining coroner reported that his eyes and fingers were still moving and that he should be taken to a hospital. Kourosh Zaim's younger brother. Communist rebel leader and strategist. Imprisoned in Iran with promise and sentence not be executed. Executed. Siamak Zaim, the older of Kourosh's two younger brothers, was a famous leftist and communist thinker who escaped Iran during the Islamic Revolution and fled to Berkeley, California, U.S., where he founded the Communist Party of Iran of the U.S. In early 1982, he snuck back into Iran and became a leader of the 1982 Amol uprising. The revolt was considered an existential threat by the new revolutionary government, and the town was surrounded and all the rebels captured or killed. For being unarmed himself and for actions displaying a desire to protect innocent life and to end the firefight, the Revolutionary Government granted him a prison sentence rather than immediate execution. He was held incommunicado for two years in Evin Prison and then executed by firing squad anyway in 1984. Kourosh's youngest brother, Bahram Zaim, was falsely arrested for being at a movie theater that was taken over by mujahideen fighters. Iran's Revolutionary Guard assumed Bahram was a mujahideen fighter, and imprisoned him for four and a half years. Kourosh was married twice: to an American in 1975, bearing two sons; and to an Iranian in 1985, also bearing two sons. The eldest of these four brothers, Turaj, escaped to the United States during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and is an American artist and activist. In 2009, Turaj focused his activism around his father, whose plight is emblematic of many of Iran's imprisoned and persecuted human rights activists. Scholarship Kourosh has authored many books, translated numerous texts from English into Persian, and published many articles and interviews on both scientific and political topics; including the works of Stephen Hawking and Karl Popper. He taught mathematics at Chicago Technical College (1968‚Äì1970) and advised Business Administration PhD students at Tehran University (2005‚Äì2008). Kourosh has also argued many times for the preservation of ancient Iranian heritage sites, as well as other UNESCO world heritage sites. Prior to his most recent imprisonment, he was advancing his Theory of Fundamental Digital Particles to European researchers of the Higgs boson particle.Kourosh Zaim. \\"The Digital Elementary Particle,\\" Open Science Journal of Modern Physics.

Retrieved . It is a non-invasive, scientific technique with a degree of sensitivity and a neuro-psychological method of interrogation which is also referred to as 'brain fingerprinting'.  History  The methodology was developed by Champadi Raman Mukundan (C. R. Mukundan), a Neuroscientist, former Professor & Head of Clinical Psychology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Bangalore, India), while he worked as a Research Consultant to TIFAC-DFS Project on 'Normative Data for Brain Electrical Activation Profiling'. His works are based on research that was also formerly pursued by other scientists at American universities, including J. Peter Rosenfeld, Lawrence Farwell and Emanuel Donchin.  Principle  The human brain receives millions of arrays of signals in different modalities, all through the waking periods. These signals are classified and stored in terms of their relationship perceived as function of experience and available knowledge base of an individual, as well as new relationship produced through sequential processing. The process of encoding happens primarily when the individual directly participates in an activity or experiences it. It is considered secondary, when the information is obtained from a secondary source viz. books, conversations, hearsay etc. in which there is no primary experiential component and the brain deals mainly with conceptual aspects. Primary encoding is deep seated and has specific source memory in terms of time and space of occurrence of experience, as individual himself/herself has shared or participated in the experience/act/event at certain time in his/her life at a certain place. It is found that when the brain of an individual is activated by a piece of information of an event in which he/she has taken part, the brain of the individual will respond differently from that of a person who has received the same information from secondary sources (non- experiential). BEOSP is based on this principle, thereby intending to demonstrate that the suspect who have primary encoded information of those who have participated in the suspected events will show responses indicating firsthand (personally acquired) knowledge of the event.  Procedure  # Pretest interview with the suspect in BEOSP # The suspect is acquainted with BEOSP test procedure # Informed consent is obtained Ideally, no questions are to be asked while conducting the test; rather, the subject is simply provided with the probable events/scenarios in the aftermath of which, the results are analyzed to verify if the brain produces any experiential knowledge, which is essentially the recognition of events disclosed. This way, all fundamental rights are protected, as neither there are no questions that are being asked or any answers reciprocated.  Applications  University of Pennsylvania conducted a research along with the Brigham & Women's Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts), Children's Hospital Boston & the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany which determined that Gamma Oscillations in the brain could help distinguish false memories from the real ones. Their analysis concluded that in the retrieval of truthful memories, as compared to false, human brain creates an extremely distinct pattern of gamma oscillations, indicating a recognition of context based information associated with a prior experience.

Originally built during the California Gold Rush, the bridge was located on the O'Byrne's Ferry road between Chinese Camp and Copperopolis. Until the mid-20th century, it was one of the last remaining covered bridges in the state; the bridge was destroyed in 1957 (after an unsuccessful attempt to move it) to make way for the construction of Tulloch Dam. History The bridge was named after the P. O. Byrne ferry which operated on the Stanislaus River as early as 1849 to service gold seekers in the area.http://www.calaverashistory.org/post/obyrnes-and-central-ferry At that time, the crossing locale was known as Waterville and, later, Poker Flat. Bret Harte's The Outcasts of Poker Flat is said to be written of this site. Patrick (or Peter; it is not known which, as he signed all stock certificates as P. O. Byrne) O. Byrne established a river crossing ferry here and determined that there was much future economic prosperity to be gained and chartered the Stanislaus Central Bridge Company that was to erect a steel suspension bridge crossing the Stanislaus River and later to be reached by a railroad from Stockton. Originally a chain cable suspension bridge with a plank floor, it was completed in the spring of 1853 and was to be opened to the public as a toll bridge. Before opening, the bridge was determined to be structurally lacking and requiring additional anchor chains. Nonetheless, a team of oxen and wagon crossed before the official opening of the new bridge and collapsed it. Byrne went on to other endeavors including selling a venture known as the Sacramento Railroad Company to again give railroad access to the gold country with commissioners such as former California Governor Peter Burnett and J. H. Haggin besides P. O. Byrne. It appears that nothing ever came from that speculative opportunity. Nonetheless, the bridge was rebuilt in 1856 by the Table Mountain Bridge Company. This bridge was much stronger, but was destroyed in the Great Flood of 1862, and a new covered cantilever bridge of Howe truss type and reinforced by an auxiliary arch was built that same year.http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_acc14706-13ae-11e5-b42a-e36a376840af.html Built and run by the Union Bridge Company, a corporation with headquarters at Sonora. Joseph Aldridge of Green Springs was the toll bridge keeper early on into the 1870s, and Joe Pardies profitably operated the toll bridge for many years.http://www.sierranevadageotourism.org/content/obyrnes-ferry-bridge- no-281-california-historical-landmark/siec3db261e97288d82a Fred Burnham, was largely responsible for the Byrne's Ferry bridge being purchased by the counties. In the late 1880s and early 1890s, Burnham was a cattleman in the region and during his annual summer trips into the mountains for better feed he drove his cattle across the bridge at a cost of $25 or $30 for the herd. Because he was dissatisfied with the condition of the bridge, and because he disliked paying the toll fee, Burnham circulated a petition for the bridge to be purchased by the two counties and to be made a free bridge. In 1902, the petition passed and the counties of Calaveras and Tuolumne purchased the bridge for $4,000 and the toll was discontinued. It is claimed that the Californio bandit Tiburcio Vasquez held up the stage running between Chinese Camp and Copperopolis nearby. Wells Fargo posted a reward for his arrest and conviction and a posse was formed at Poker Flat which then crossed the Byrne's Ferry bridge in pursuit of the bandit. Vasquez escaped only to be captured later in San Jose and hanged not long after. Demolition and replacement The Tri-Dam project and the Tulloch Reservoir eventually ended the story of the covered bridge.http://www.calaverashistory.org/article/historical- overview-lake-tulloch-area When filled to capacity, the reservoir backs river water up the canyon for seven miles and forms a large lake that covers the O'Byrne's Bridge site to a depth of eighty feet. In 1957, as the reservoir began to fill, the directors of the two irrigation districts studied the possibility of either burning the bridge where it stood or simply cutting it free from its moorings. But the Calaveras and Tuolumne County Historical Societies and the Copperopolis Community Club, assisted by the Native Sons of the Golden West and many other statewide groups, took an interest in saving the bridge. They started what was known as a \\"DOLLAR\\" campaign to cover the cost of preserving the bridge as a future landmark; estimated at the time to be about $9,000. A plan was developed to move the bridge down-stream to a lagoon created by the reservoir where it could span an inlet and once again become a tourist attraction. The California State Parks Commission endorsed the proposal and a Tuolumne County rancher agreed to donate the property upon which the bridge could be located. However, such plans failed to materialize. On the morning of October 21, 1957, the Calaveras and Tuolumne County supervisors sold the bridge at auction. Several attempts were made to blast the bridge from its supports using dynamite, but the charges were insufficient. As the water rose, the bridge eventually gave up its supports but by then it was partially submerged. Unable to save the bridge, the structure was dismantled and some of the lumber was used to build the nearby resorts. About 3,000 feet upstream from where the old covered bridge stood, a new concrete and steel bridge was built in 1958 at a cost of $458,355.

It was the final battle in the (AKA Sunderkrieg). It was a decisive victory for the Alliance, who were subsequently able to impose their demands through the Treaty of Templin (24/25 November 1317). Background The immediate cause of conflict was a dispute over succession to the Lordship of Stargard following the death in 1314 of Beatrix of Brandenburg, wife of Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg (nicknamed \\"The Lion\\"). Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal (nicknamed \\"The Great\\"), demanded the return of what he considered a fief of Brandenburg, which Beatrix had possessed only as part of her dowry (). Henry countered by calling for military assistance from his allieswho included King Erik of Denmark, John of Werle, and other North German princesand by invading Brandenburg. Waldemar assembled his forces at the walled city of Gransee to oppose them. The battle Waldemar's forces consisted largely of knights in armour; Henry's of foot soldiers. It was conventional military wisdom in those days that heavy cavalry hopelessly outclassed light infantry. (Subsequent patriotic accounts from Mecklenburg even suggested that the Alliance was outnumbered four to one.) On John's advice, the Alliance decided on a surprise attack. Passing through a forest (remnants of which still exist as the Unterbusch), they crossed the M√ºhlenflie√ü near Schulzendorf. (The M√ºhlenflie√ü was a millstream which powered the watermill at Rauschendorf.)This Rauschendorf may be the same place as modern , even though that place is first documented only in 1524. According to the chroniclers, it was the foot soldiers who won the day. The knights, fighting on foot, were immobile and vulnerable.The chroniclers refer to the knights being \\"lifted out of the saddle\\". The result of the battle makes it seem more likely that surprise was complete, and that the Brandenburgers were caught unprepared in their camp. The battle swayed to and fro for several hours, and resembled a massacre.If the chroniclers can be believed. Henry caught an axe blow to the helmet in the initial phase of the battle, and had to be supported from the field; but later returned to fight with undiminished vigour. Seven counts on the Brandenburg side, including Albrecht V of Wernigerode and the Count of Mansfeld, were taken prisoner. Waldemar himself only escaped because other nobles, including von Manseld and Wedigo von Plotho, fought to give him the opportunity. Waldemar and his retinue retreated in some disorder to Gransee, said by Fontane to have been the strongest place in the . On the Alliance side, John III, Count of Holstein-Pl√∂n was captured. Aftermath The victorious Alliance withdrew to Buchholz by way of Rheinsberg and Wesenberg, and celebrated their victory. The two sides now began to negotiate, at first in Zehdenick. The captured noblemen were important bargaining counters. Under the Treaty of Templin, Waldemar was forced to agree to cede Starburg to Mecklenburg. Waldemar died in 1319. His cousin, Henry II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, died in 1320, at the age of 12 or 13. The claims of the House of Ascania to the Margraviate of Brandenburg and its possessions (including Starburg) thereupon became extinct, and the quarrel was never revived. Modern times On 30 July 2016, near the 700th anniversary of the battle, the municipal councils of Gransee, Sonnenberg and Schulzendorf, together with the Stargarder Burgverein, dedicated a memorial to the battle. It consists of a plaque which includes a panorama of the battlefield, and historical information by Carsten Dr√§ger, local historian, and by Frank Sa√ü, head of the Stargarden Castle museum.

She produced and directed HBO's Emmy nominated documentary, Larry Kramer in Love & Anger, which was featured at the Sundance Film Festival. Her works have been exhibited internationally in festivals, museums and on television. She was an early pioneer in documenting the AIDS crisis. As the founder of the Multimedia Unit at Gay Men's Health Crisis, she created the television series Living with AIDS. She was a founding member of DIVA TV (a video affinity group of ACT UP) and a member of the Testing The Limits Video Collective. Education Jean Carlomusto graduated from Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park, Queens, New York, in 1977. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Film from C.W. Post in 1981. She earned her M.P.S. in Interactive Telecommunications from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. Career Carlomusto has played a major role in media production for AIDS activists groups. Her AIDS activist work began in 1986, while working as a teaching assistant at New York University, assisting student teams in a class making educational videos for local organizations. When Joey Leonte from the Gay Men's Health Crisis came to her class to request a video, and none of the students wanted to work with him, the shame of her class' reaction drove Carlomusto to volunteer for the Gay Men's Health Crisis to increase awareness about AIDS and build empathy for those with the illnessSchulman, Sarah.

Retrieved from http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/carlomusto.pdf. She began as the projectionist for their safe sex workshops, then left her teaching job at NYU to start up the Multimedia Production Unit in order to produce a weekly television program called Living with AIDS. This was the longest running of the Gay Men's Health Crisis television series, with guest videographers including Marina Alvarez, Sarah Cawley, Ronald Dodd, Andres J. Figueroa, Laura Ganis, Alexandra Juhasz, Ray Navarro, Steven Okazaki, Catherine Saalfield, Kristin Thomas, and Paul Zakrzewski. These videographers not only made safe sex videos and educational films for healthy living with AIDS, but also gathered oral histories and interviews from diverse group of people suffering from the disease. Carlomusto was part of the Woman's affinity group of ACT UP that focused on bringing visibility to how AIDS impacted women. In 1988, in response to an article by Dr Robert Gould in Cosmopolitan Magazine which said that straight women did not have to worry about AIDS, the Woman's Affinity group, including Rebecca Cole, Maxine Wolfe, Maria Maggenti and Denise Ribble, and Carlomusto organized a direct action against Cosmopolitan Magazine. They interviewed the author of that article, psychiatrist Robert Gould, who had made uninformed statements about women and AIDSSchulman, Sara. (2008, June 30). Interview with Rebecca Cole.

In February 1987, Testing the Limits Collective founders Gregg Bordowitz and David Meieran filmed the first ACT UP demonstration at Wall Street. They met Jean Carlomusto at this demonstration, who was taping it for Living with AIDS. The filmmakers built up a rapport because they were among the few people at the event with non-professional video equipment. Carlomusto subsequently joined Testing the Limits Collective. Bordowitz and Meieran contacted Hilery Kipness who worked with Downtown Community Television, along with Sandra Elgear and Robyn Hutt from the Whitney program, and together they formed the Testing the Limits collective. This collective created Testing the Limits: New York City, the first direct action AIDS activist video. After working on this film together, Bordowitz joined Carlomusto at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, working together on the Living with AIDS series from 1988 to 1994. Carlomusto, Bordowitz, Catherine Saalfield, Ray Navarro, Ellen Spiro, Costa Pappas, Robert Beck, Rob Kurilla, and George Plagianos went on to form DIVA TV in 1989. Standing for \\"Damned Interfering Video Activists\\", DIVA TV was an affinity group of ACT UP that created short direct action videos at demonstrations, as well as 160 video programs for public access television channels, including the weekly series \\"AIDS Community Television\\" from 1991 to 1996, and the weekly call-in public access series \\"ACT UP Live\\" from 1994 to 1996. Carlomusto participated in the creation of several early DIVA TV videos: Target City Hall, Like a Prayer (1991) and Pride. In 1991, Jean Carlomusto joined Fierce Pussy, a lesbian art collective that produced AIDS-related art and media for ACT UP. In particular, Carlomusto focused on media geared toward lesbians to increase their awareness about the disease. The cumulative work that Carlomusto had done throughout her AIDS activist career helped her produce independent documentaries on the topics of AIDS, lesbians, and LGBT history and culture. Her best known work include the documentaries L is for the Way You Look (1991); Shatzi is Dying (2000); Sex in an Epidemic (2011), and Larry Kramer: In Love and Anger (2015). Independent from her AIDS work, Carlomusto created the personal documentary To Catch a Glimpse (2007), which investigates the mysterious death of her grandmother. Some of Carlomusto's work is now permanently housed in museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and has been exhibited in California, Sweden, and South Africa. Jean Carlomusto is currently director of the Television Center and professor in the Communication and Film Department at LIU Post Long Island University in Brookville, New York. Personal life Carlomusto identifies as an Italian- American lesbian from a working-class background. She is a senior student at the Village Zendo in New York City.

It is at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 7552 is about 75,000 light years across. It forms with three other spiral galaxies the Grus Quartet.  Observation history  NGC 7552 was originally discovered and reported in 1826 by James Dunlop and John Herschel added it in the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters as number 3977. However, Lewis Swift reported the galaxy independently in on October 22, 1897, at right ascention 9 arcseconds off the location of the galaxy and was included in Index Catalogue as IC 5294.  Structure  NGC 7552 is a barred spiral galaxy, with two spiral arms forming an outer pseudo-ring. The galaxy is seen nearly face on, at an inclination of ‚àº 28¬∞. The one arm is more prominent and the less prominent arm shows no clear continuation with the bar. The bar is dusty, and four huge HII regions are detected in it. The disk features numerous scattered HII regions in an asymmetric pattern. The total infrared luminosity of the galaxy is , and thus is categorised as a luminous infrared galaxy. = Starburst ring = In 1994, Forbes et al. observed a partial starburst ring with 1 kpc radius at Br-gamma with various hot spots. They also detected a small-scale molecular bar and a large reservoir of molecular material, however, no evidence of current activity was detected at the nucleus. The ring is more than 100 parsec wide. The ring is brighter north of the nucleus and there is inhabited by the younger star populations. Brandl et al. detected in near- and mid-infrared nine prominent structures within the ring they identified as star clusters with stellar ages ranging between 5.5 Myr and 6.3 Myr. These clusters account for the 75% of the bolometric luminosity of the starburst ring, with total luminosity of the clusters 2.1 √ó 1010 L‚äô. Numerous supernova remnants have been observed in the ring. Further observations of the galaxy in radio waves showed that NGC 7552 contains three star forming rings of radii 1.0 kpc, 1.9 kpc, and 3.4 kpc as observed by the Very Large Array at 46.9 MHz and the Australia Telescope Compact Array.  Galaxy group  NGC 7552 belongs in NGC 7582 group, also known as Grus group. Others members of the group include the spiral galaxies of NGC 7599, NGC 7590, NGC 7582, which along with NGC 7552 form the Grus Quartet. A large tidal extension of HI reaches from NGC 7582 to NGC 7552, which is indicative of interactions between the group members, yet NGC 7552 hasn't highly disturbed morphology.

She acted in local theatre in Denver, Colorado, and on Broadway, and also co-produced plays in Denver, New York City, and London. She succeeded her father, Frederick Gilmer Bonfils, as manager of The Denver Post in 1933, and eventually became president of the company. Lacking heirs, she invested her fortune into providing for the city of Denver and the state of Colorado, supporting the Belle Bonfils Blood Bank, the Bonfils Memorial Theatre, the University of Denver, the Denver Zoo, the Dumb Friends League, churches, and synagogues. Her estate endowed the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985 and the Colorado Performing Arts Hall of Fame in 1999. Early life and family Helen Gilmer Bonfils was born in Peekskill, New York to American newspaper publisher Frederick Gilmer Bonfils and his wife Belle Barton Bonfils. She and her older sister, Mary Madeline (\\"May\\") Bonfils (1883‚Äì1962), had a strict Catholic upbringing. In 1894 the family moved to Kansas where Frederick ran legal lotteries, and in 1895 to Denver, where Frederick and his partner Harry H. Tammen bought a newspaper that they renamed The Denver Post. In Denver, the Bonfils girls attended an elite private girls' school. Helen attended finishing school at the National Park Seminary in Forest Glen, Maryland. Frederick kept a tight rein on his daughters, forbidding them to date and warning them that \\"the boys were only out for their money\\". Helen became the \\"favored daughter\\" after May eloped at age 21 with a non-Catholic salesman, a move that estranged May from her family for decades. Upon their father's death in 1933, Helen, who still lived at home, received $14 million from his estate. She received another $10 million bequest in 1935 upon the death of her mother, plus newspaper stock and possession of the family's Humboldt Street mansion. May received only a $25,000 annual allowance from a trust, and sued her sister over her mother's estate. After a pitched, three-year legal battle, May was awarded $5 million cash from her mother's estate, some cash from her father's estate, 15% of the Denver Post stock, and additional real estate. The court case divided the sisters even further and they cut off all communication with each other. The Denver Post In 1933 Bonfils assumed the management of The Denver Post and served as secretary-treasurer of the corporation. Her flair for the theatrical extended to her ordering two dozen yellow roses to be placed in the lobby of The Denver Post to welcome her arrival; she drove to the building in a Pierce-Arrow touring car bearing the Colorado license plate \\"#1\\". In 1934 she introduced a free summer series of Broadway plays and light opera staged outdoors at the Cheesman Park Pavilion under the auspices of The Denver Post. Starring Broadway performers in the lead roles and local players in lesser parts, these performances attracted up to 20,000 people per performance, and were staged every year until Bonfil's death in 1972. In 1946 she hired a new editor, Palmer Hoyt, to give the paper more journalistic integrity. In 1966 she became president of the paper and asked Donald Seawell, a theatrical producer whom she had met on Broadway, to move to Denver and become chairman and publisher. Theatrical career Elitch Theatre Bonfils' first love was the theatre. She acted with the Elitch Stock Theatre, helped organize and performed in the Civic Theatre at the University of Denver, performed at the Bonfils Memorial Theatre, and also acted on Broadway under the stage name Gertrude Barton (her mother's maiden name). With her first husband, George Somnes, she co-produced plays in Denver and in New York City through the Bonfils & Somnes Producing Co. Among their hit productions were The Greatest Show on Earth (1938), in which Helen also performed. After Somnes' death in 1956, Helen co-produced plays on Broadway and in London with actress Haila Stoddard and Donald Seawell under Bonard Productions, and co-produced Broadway plays with Seawell under Bonfils-Seawell Enterprises. The latter partnership produced the successful Broadway musical Sail Away (1962), The Hollow Crown (1963), The Last Analysis (1964), and Sleuth, which won the 1971 Tony Award. Marriages Wood‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìBonfils House in 2009 Bonfils met English actor and theatrical producer George Somnes when he was hired by the Elitch Theatre in 1936. They married that year, when Bonfils was 47. The couple ‚Äì always referred to as \\"Helen Bonfils and George Somnes\\" ‚Äì bought a condominium at River House in New York City and resided in Denver at the Humboldt Street mansion. In 1948 Helen sold the mansion to the Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary and purchased the Wood‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìBonfils House, a French Mediterranean Revival mansion at 707 Washington Street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver. The couple's amicable personal and professional partnership ended with Somnes' death in February 1956 due to liver failure. Craving companionship, Helen turned to her chauffeur, Edward Michael \\"Tiger Mike\\" Davis. She married him in April 1959 at the age of 69; he was 28. Bonfils sued for divorce in December 1971 after 12 years of marriage, possibly to preempt any claim Davis might have to her estate. The divorce was granted on the grounds of cruelty. Bonfils retained the rights to her name, and Davis received the Wood‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìBonfils House, $1.6 million in promissory notes, and $50,000 cash. Philanthropy Bonfils Memorial Theatre Denver Center for the Performing Arts Lacking heirs, Bonfils invested her fortune into supporting culture, arts, healthcare, education, and humanitarian causes in Denver and the state of Colorado. She inherited the presidency of the philanthropic Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation after her father's death and between 1936 and 1973 distributed nearly $11 million. This included the Belle Bonfils Blood Bank, established in 1943 in memory of her mother. The blood bank eventually became self-supporting; as of 2004, the Bonfils Blood Center serves 115 Colorado hospitals and healthcare centers and has an operating budget of $57.8 million. Helen further established the Bonfils Tumor Clinic in her father's memory, finished and furnished the Holy Ghost Catholic Church at a cost of $1.2 million, and helped construct the Nurses' Home at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. In 1953 she dedicated the 550-seat Bonfils Memorial Theatre at 1475 Elizabeth Street, corner East Colfax Avenue, in memory of both her parents. As the headquarters for the Denver Civic Theatre, the $1.25 million theatre hosted plays, operas, concerts, lectures, films, and television shows. Helen acted there on numerous occasions. Considered \\"one of the country's most successful community theaters\\", it closed in 1986 and was converted into a Tattered Cover bookstore in 2006. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Bonfils also supported the University of Denver, the Central City Opera, the Denver Symphony Orchestra, the Denver Zoo, the Dumb Friends League animal shelter, the Denver Community Chest/United Way, and many churches and synagogues. In 1948 alone, the Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation distributed more than $1.4 million to churches of different denominations. Helen also underwrote college scholarships for men and women totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Upon her death in 1972, both the Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation and the Helen G. Bonfils Foundation ceased acting as private charities and diverted all funds to a permanent endowment for the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. Donald Seawell became chairman of the board of the new foundation and guided the expansion of the Denver Performing Arts Complex. By the 1990s, the downtown complex had grown to four square blocks and encompassed eight theatres with capacity seating for 9,000. Later years Bonfils became embroiled in a drawn-out legal battle in her later years. In 1960 her sister May sold her Denver Post stock to newspaper baron Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. on the condition that the stock could never be resold to Helen. With this stake in the company, Newhouse attempted to take over the paper, and Helen sued him. The court case dragged on for 12 years and concluded six months after Helen's death, when an appeals court overruled the district court's ruling and prevented Newhouse from taking over the paper. However, the $5 million spent on attorney fees drained the newspaper's coffers and in 1980 The Denver Post was sold to the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company. Bonfils was hospitalized for the last six years of her life at Saint Joseph Hospital, where she and her entourage occupied the entire top floor. She died on June 6, 1972, at the age of 82. She was buried in the Bonfils family vault at the Fairmount Mausoleum alongside her parents and first husband Somnes. Her sister May, who had predeceased her in 1962, was entombed in her own mausoleum a short distance away from the rest of the family. Posthumous Bonfils was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. She was named to the inaugural class of the Colorado Performing Arts Hall of Fame in 1999. Bonfils' life and work were recounted in two biographies published after her death. They were: High Altitude Attitudes: Six Savvy Colorado Women by Marilyn Griggs Riley (Big Earth Publishing, 2006) and Papa's Girl: The Fascinating World of Helen Bonfils by Eva Hodges Watt (Western Reflections Publishing Co., 2007). A stage play, The Bonfils Girl by Mike Broemmel and Seth Holley, premiered in Denver, Colorado, in 2016. It stars Cathy Washburn in the title role and is directed by Rich Beall.

The treaty allowed both parties to search vessels of the other for on-board slaves. Among other things, the treaty established two Mixed Commission Courts, one with a seat in Freetown, Sierra Leone and another in Paramaribo, Suriname, which had the power to sentence slavers. The treaty was amended and provided with additional articles by treaties concluded on 31 December 1822, 25 January 1823, 7 February 1837 and 31 August 1848.  Background  In June 1814, William I of the Netherlands, who had been proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813 and would become King of the Netherlands on 16 March 1815, forbade Dutch participation in the slave trade by sovereign decree. That was endorsed by the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815. It is often argued that William I forbade the slave trade under British pressure, as his return to the Netherlands had not been possible without British support. By abolishing slave trade, William I hoped to regain the Dutch colonies now under British control. That objective was, for the most part, achieved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. In May 1818, a comprehensive treaty was concluded between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which allowed the Royal Navy and the Royal Netherlands Navy to inspect vessels they suspected of carrying slaves. If slaves were indeed found on board, both navies were allowed to detain the crew and bring them before one of the Mixed Courts of Justice.  Mixed Commission Courts  The Mixed Commission Court in Freetown sentenced in total 22 Dutch vessels during its existence between 1819 and 1862. The Mixed Commission Court in Paramaribo sentenced only one vessel during its existence between 1819 and 1845, namely, the Nueve of Snauw in 1823.

Uninhabited since the 15th century, recent excavations have revealed it once held a sanctuary dedicated to Apollo in the late Hellenistic period. Description The island which lies 280 metres from the shore of western Cyprus has been uninhabited since the 14th or 15th century. It has an area of 26000 square metres and rises 21.65 metres from sea level. Geologically the island consists of a hard calcarenite crust of Pleistocene marine terraces overlying a soft marl core. The toponym \\"Holy Island\\" is an ancient one. Pliny speaks of an island called \\"Hiera,\\" near Paphos, and Strabo mentions a place called \\"Hierocepis\\" nearby Paphos and Akamas. It is likely that the name refers to the Apollo sanctuary that stood there in the 1st century BC. Excavations The island was first excavated in 1982 by Sophocles Hadjisavvas following a proposal to build a hotel on the island. He quickly established the presence of Hellenistic remains on the island, which halted all further attempts to build on the island. In 1989, Joan Breton Connelly from New York University heard about the work and impressed by the range of the material joined the excavations which have continued since then. The excavations have established three periods of occupation on Yeronisos. Early Chalcolithic (3800 BC), late Hellenistic (80-30 BC), and Byzantine (6th-7th century and 13th century). The most intense of this activity is the late Hellenistic period at a time when Cleopatra ruled Cyprus. Artefacts include coins, pottery, glass, and inscriptions. Limestone amulets, identical to those used in Cypriot sanctuaries of Apollo, point to ritual activity and the worship of Apollo. The island was apparently abandoned following a devastating earthquake in 1st century BC/AD. Low-level activity on the island begins again in the 6th century AD. when a reservoir and animal shelters were built.

The project was announced by La Concha owner Lorenzo Doumani in February 2004. The 42-story condominium tower was to be accompanied by Hilton's Conrad Las Vegas, a Conrad-branded, 37-story hotel that would operate in a separate high-rise building on the same property. The project was initially expected to open in February 2006. In 2005, the project was redesigned to combine the Majestic and the Conrad into a single tower. Later that year, a new two-tower design was announced as a result of rising construction costs, which made the previous one-tower design financially impossible. In 2006, it was announced that the project would again consist of a single tower, with the top 10 floors to be occupied by The Waldorf-Astoria Residences. In 2007, Majestic Resorts filed a request for arbitration against Hilton after the company pulled out of the project. The undeveloped property was sold that year for $180 million. In 2019, Doumani received county approval to build a new version of Majestic Las Vegas on the former site of the nearby Clarion Hotel and Casino, which he had imploded four years earlier. This version of Majestic Las Vegas would be a 45-story, non-gaming hotel with 720 rooms. The project would cost $850 million and stand 620 feet, and would be located near the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking is expected for 2020, with completion expected in 2023. History In 2001, the 5.4-acre site occupied by the La Concha Motel on the Las Vegas Strip ‚Äì south of the Riviera hotel and casino ‚Äì was approved for a 520-foot hotel tower, as well as a 645-foot condominium tower that would include a shopping mall. The property was owned by Lorenzo Doumani, whose family had owned the motel since its opening in 1961. Doumani was also the chief executive officer of a Las Vegas film company known as Majestic Entertainment. Demolition of the La Concha began in December 2003, to make room on the property for a new project that would replace it. =Announcement= On February 18, 2004, Doumani and Hilton Hotels Corporation announced plans for a $250 million joint project for the property that would consist of the Majestic Resort and Residences ‚Äì a $150 million, 42-story condominium tower ‚Äì and the Conrad Las Vegas, a $100 million, 37-story all- suite hotel. Both towers would feature an Art Deco appearance. The Conrad Las Vegas would be the third Conrad-branded hotel property to be built in the United States. Hilton stated that there were no plans to add a casino onto the property because of a lack of adequate room for one. The hotel would be aimed primarily at business travelers, while also including amenities such as a spa, a fitness center, and a heated Olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool. The hotel suites were to be an average size of , the largest in Las Vegas. The Majestic would be the second-tallest structure in Las Vegas, behind the Stratosphere tower. Although the Majestic would have fewer floors than other resort towers in Las Vegas, several of those floors would have rooms that would be taller than the standard size. Condominium units would range from to , with prices between $850,000 and $3 million. The Majestic would be the first condominium project to be located on the Las Vegas Strip, and would also be accessible from Paradise Road. The project would include the Majestic Court and Marketplace, consisting of of restaurants and shops that would be located on three floors. The project would also include a four-story, 574-space parking garage. A sales office for Majestic was expected to open in late February 2004. The Majestic Las Vegas was to include either 144 condominium units, or 378, while the Conrad Las Vegas would include either 442 rooms, or 378 as well. Lorenzo Doumani also announced that his father, Ed Doumani, would serve as construction manager on the project. Other members of the Doumani family were also partners in the project. The property, occupied by the remaining structures of the La Concha, was expected to be cleared by July 4, 2004, with construction scheduled to begin in November or December 2004. At the time, discussions were underway to choose a contractor. Negotiations were also being held with the Las Vegas Monorail Company to develop a track that would allow the monorail to pass through the new project. An adjacent Peppermill restaurant south of the property was to remain open during the construction. The project was expected to open in February 2006. =Postponements and redesigns= By April 2005, plans for a second tower on the property were cancelled because of a dispute regarding an adjacent condominium project by a different development company, which caused investors to become unsure about the Majestic/Conrad project. The project was redesigned to include only one tower on the property that would combine the Conrad hotel and Majestic condominium units. The La Concha's shell-shaped lobby, the only structure on the property that was not demolished, was converted into a sales office for Majestic. In June 2005, sales for Majestic were put on hold because of rising construction costs. In September 2005, Lorenzo Doumani announced plans for a redesigned two-tower version of Majestic Las Vegas, which was the result of heightened construction costs that had increased 15 percent in the previous 12 months, making it financially impossible to build the project as previously planned. Doumani stated that building one tower would cost $520 million, compared to $600 million for the construction of two towers. In addition, Doumani announced that condominium prices would be raised $200,000 to help finance the project. With the redesign, a 60-story tower would be used for the Conrad Hotel, with 500 suites, while the condominium tower would be approximately 40 stories and would include 560 units. Plans for the redesigned project were to be finalized in early October 2005. Lorenzo Doumani said he was in the process of locating a contractor for the project, after previously signing with a contractor twice that ultimately became too expensive. Groundbreaking was planned for spring or early summer 2006, with construction of the two towers expected to take 22 months. The Doumanis had wanted to use the La Concha's shell-shaped lobby as the entrance to Majestic Las Vegas' shops or to a club. However, the lobby could not be worked into the design. Construction was on hold as of November 2005. In October 2006, it was announced that the project would consist of a single 654-foot tower that would contain the Conrad Las Vegas and the condominiums, while the top 10 floors would be occupied by The Waldorf=Astoria Residences. Construction was scheduled to begin in April 2007, with completion in 2009. In August 2007, Lorenzo Doumani announced that the project was on hold; he later stated that after Hilton was sold to The Blackstone Group in 2007, the company pulled out of the project. In October 2007, the Doumani family sold the undeveloped property to an affiliate of Triple Five Nevada Development Corporation, a real estate development company. The property sold for $180 million, which amounted to a near-record of $33.1 million per acre, and was later put up for sale in 2014, at a price of $16 million per acre. Triple Five still owned the undeveloped site as of 2019. =Majestic/Hilton lawsuits= In 2007, Majestic Resorts filed a request for arbitration, alleging that Hilton broke its 2004 management agreement to join the design, development and construction of the project by pulling out of it. A three-member arbitration panel rejected Majestic's claim and ordered the company to pay Hilton $834,734 to cover attorney fees, as well as an additional $319,817 in costs. Majestic alleged that one member of the panel, Richard Chernick, was biased because of his previous association with the attorney that represented Hilton in the case. The matter had been raised by Majestic prior to the panel's decision, but Chernick declined to excuse himself from the case, and the company withdrew its objection to his presence prior to the decision. Majestic appealed the case to a District Court judge, who ruled in favor of Hilton. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Nevada upheld the decision. In September 2011, Hilton filed a lawsuit against Majestic Resorts and the Doumani family to obtain the $1.1 million from the arbitration case, which the company had yet to receive despite the family's $180 million sale of the property. Hilton alleged that in October 2007, after selling the property, Majestic distributed $169 million to its shareholders ‚Äì members of the Doumani family ‚Äì leaving the company with $355,000 in cash assets. According to the lawsuit, Lorenzo Doumani later distributed $200,000 to himself. Hilton alleged that such transfers of money were fraudulent and were intended to \\"hinder, delay and/or defraud Hilton.\\" Lorenzo Doumani said he would fight the lawsuit. Other legal challenges =Conrad name= On April 11, 2005, a lawsuit was filed against Hilton by the Conrad Hotel, a two-story 30-room hotel in downtown Las Vegas that opened in 1969. The owners of the Conrad Hotel said that Hilton's new hotel was causing confusion among customers; that three letters were sent to executives of the Conrad Hotels brand and were ignored; and that Hilton knew of the Conrad Hotel's existence since April 2, 2004. Hilton filed a counterclaim on May 25, 2005, believing that the hotel did not have the exclusive right to use the name. Hilton also denied the assertion of customer confusion between the two properties. =Icon lawsuits= By April 2005, the Doumanis had concerns that a newly proposed neighboring condominium project to the south, which would be known as Icon and would include two 48-story towers, would overshadow the Majestic/Conrad project and would block its views. The Doumanis also had concerns about traffic flow. The Related Companies, the developer of Icon, held 12 meetings with the Doumanis to devise solutions for the family's concerns. Lorenzo Doumani had previously asked The Related Companies to redesign the back (north) side of their second Icon tower to resemble its front side, so that residents of Majestic would not have to face the Icon tower's brick wall. Doumani later asked the developer to rotate their Icon towers 20 degrees to avoid obstructing the views for Majestic's residents, stating, \\"It won't cost them millions of dollars. They'll spend more on legal fees fighting us than they would just being good neighbors at the end of the day.\\" When the Las Vegas County Commission approved the Icon project in April 2005, Lorenzo Doumani said he would sue The Related Companies. Doumani said that investors became unsure about the project because of the dispute, resulting in the brief cancellation of a second tower on the property. Doumani later said that the lawsuit primarily related to a disagreement regarding access corridors, as well as proposed garbage and loading docks that would be located near the Majestic's pool. Doumani dropped the lawsuit in September 2005, after The Related Companies agreed to relocate the docks. A separate lawsuit had also been filed against The Related Company by Doumani, and was related to an easement that he believed would intrude on his property, although he and the company were discussing a solution. The Icon project was ultimately cancelled. 2019 proposal In May 2019, Doumani received county approval to build Majestic Las Vegas on the former six-acre site of the nearby Clarion Hotel and Casino, which he had imploded four years earlier. For the Majestic project, Doumani spent a year trying to obtain height approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before he could get county approval. This version of Majestic Las Vegas would be a 45-story, non-gaming hotel with 720 rooms, medical offices, and 10 floors of convention space. The resort would also feature six restaurants and a medical wellness spa. The spa would give physical examinations and help people improve their lifestyles. The top of the resort would contain 30 corporate sky suites. Doumani hoped for Majestic Las Vegas to become the most high-end resort in the United States. The project would cost $850 million and stand 620 feet. It would be located at 305 Convention Center Drive, near the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking is expected for April or May 2020, with completion expected in the first quarter of 2023.

Early life and education  Even at the age of five of six, Robert Mars was experimenting with collage and pop-based themes that would inspire him throughout his career. He is a graduate of Parsons School of Design, New York City. Before committing to being a full-time artist, Mars started out as a graphic designer in New York City and then design director for fashion brands. After spending most of his life in New York City, Mars lived on the west coast in Los Angeles from 1996 to 2001 and in Portland from 2001 to 2005 before returning to east coast to fiercely pursue fine art. Career Mars' artwork is exhibited worldwide including museum collections in Munich, Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Laguna Beach, Paris, Aspen and Naples. Mars' latest solo exhibition in 2016 was at the Evansville Museum of Arts in Indiana, where he will also be an artist in residence and guest lecturer. Alongside Damien Hirst, Mars' artwork was selected for the Absolut Vodka Blank campaign. His largest monumental piece to date was acquired by Philip Morris/Altria for their corporate headquarters in Virginia. In 2015, Mars was chosen for the cover of Neiman Marcus' May Book. Also in the same year, Coca-Cola purchased several existing works and ordered commissions for a world tour celebrating their centennial anniversary of their trademark bottle shape in which Mars debuted his Coca- Cola Popforms. Robert Mars artworks are also in the institutional collections of Coral Springs Museum of Art, International Museum of Collage and New Bedford Art Museum, as well as in the corporate collections of Microsoft, adidas, Nike, Inc., Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Oceania Cruises, Prps, and Monopol Hotel Collection in St. Moritz. Publications In 2017, Mars attained critical recognition from Donald Kuspit, Bruce Helander, and Eleanor Heartney. DTR Modern Galleries produced a publication of a fresh collection of works by Mars along with essays by those aforementioned scholars in Futurelics: Robert Mars Past is Present. * Essays by Eleanor Heartney, Bruce Helander and Donald Kuspit. Styles and techniques From his studio in Connecticut, Robert Mars archives the nostalgia of idealistic Americana culture. In the styles of Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg, Mars explores the mementos of the past, present, and future packaged in layers of resin. With a background in graphic design, Mars uses Xerox transfers of iconic images of celebrities or tokens as the focal point, and then creates a branded paper ecosystem of archived magazines, newspapers, and advertisements that he photocopies, layers with paint, and cements with resin. Mars' style evokes a vintage quality, distressed but bold, that hangs on to a fading era. The artworks are homages to an era after the Great Depression and World War II. The era hosted people such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean, Audrey Hepburn, Jackie Kennedy and Elvis Presley that Mars captures in his artworks as ambassadors of better times. More recently, Mars has also included fashion models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell in his works, as well as Martin Luther King Jr., and tributes to Basquiat. Mars also explores consumerism and branding that is part of the celebrity culture of today. Besides the exploration of collages, Robert Mars has developed unique forms of art from contemporary quilts that merges old-school patterns with pop art to more recently his Futurelic Popforms, a collection of 2D and 3D Americana relics that Mars has updated for the millennials.

The Harbor Defenses of New Bedford was a United States Army Coast Artillery Corps harbor defense command. It coordinated the coast defenses of New Bedford, Massachusetts and the nearby Cape Cod Canal from 1900 to 1950, beginning with the Endicott program. These included a coast artillery fort (Fort Rodman, a.k.a. Fort Taber) and an underwater minefield. The command originated circa 1900 as the New Bedford Artillery District, was renamed Coast Defenses of New Bedford in 1913, and again renamed Harbor Defenses of New Bedford in 1925.Stanton, pp. 455-481, 484Coast Artillery Organization: A Brief Overview at the Coast Defense Study Group websiteRinaldi, pp. 165-166Berhow, p. 430-434 History =Early New Bedford forts= ;American Revolution through War of 1812 Two forts were built in the New Bedford area in the American Revolution, a 6-gun (possibly 11-gun)Roberts, p. 407 unnamed fort (later named Fort Phoenix) in 1775 in what is now Fairhaven,New Bedford forts at American Forts Network and the 10-gun Acushnet Fort in 1776 at an uncertain location, possibly on Clark's Point at the site of the later Fort Rodman. The building of the first fort was sparked by the Battle off Fairhaven on 14 May 1775, said to be the first naval engagement of the Revolution. A group of about 30 patriots in the 40-ton sloop Success retrieved two vessels that had been captured by HMS Falcon, taking some British prisoners in the action.First Naval Skirmish of the American Revolution Another major action in the Revolution was Grey's raid on 5‚Äì6 September 1778, in which the Fairhaven fort was destroyed. A force under Major Israel Fearing drove off the British, both at the fort and when they attempted an attack on the town the next day. The fort was then renamed Fort Fearing.Fort Phoenix at FortWiki.com Fort Fearing was renamed Fort Phoenix in 1784, after the mythical bird that \\"rose from its ashes\\", and was rebuilt with Commonwealth resources in 1798, contemporary with but not part of the federal first system of US fortifications. In 1808 both forts were upgraded, Fort Phoenix with state resources mounting 12 guns, and Acushnet Fort under the federal second system of fortifications, mounting six guns. Reports on Acushnet Fort indicate that it was not officially named, but was called the \\"fort at Eldridge Point\\", \\"two miles below the town\\", which may indicate Clark's Point.Wade, pp. 141, 236, 242, 248 The location of Eldridge Point is unclear from references, but the Eldredge family was prominent in the area. Acushnet Fort seems to have been abandoned after the War of 1812, and probably demolished by the 1840s. In the War of 1812, bombarded Fort Phoenix on 13 June 1814 when the local militia refused to surrender some guns. After an exchange of fire Nimrod sailed away. Local accounts differ as to whether she launched boats carrying a landing party that were driven off, or not. This event is confused in some references with an attack by the same ship on Falmouth on 29 January 1814.Fort Phoenix at FairhavenTours.com\\"Falmouth Stood Up to the British\\", Cape Cod Times, 26 January 2014 ;Civil War era Also known as the Old Stone Fort, the \\"Fort at Clark's Point\\" (named Fort Rodman in 1898) began construction in 1857 under the third system of US fortifications, and in 1862 construction became overseen by Henry Robert, author of Robert's Rules of Order and an Army Corps of Engineers officer.Fort Taber Park at New Bedford city website The fort, as built, had emplacements for 72 cannon in three tiers; two casemated tiers plus a barbette tier on the fort's roof.Weaver, pp. 115‚Äì120 Construction was halted in 1867, and the fort as planned was never completed.Fort Rodman at FortWiki.com After the Civil War began in April 1861, it was apparent that the Fort at Clark's Point was still years from completion. Fort Taber, a small earthwork with six cannon, was built nearby with city resources and named after New Bedford's mayor during that period. It provided a temporary defense until the stone fort was garrisoned in 1863. Fort Taber is marked by a stone outline today, directly behind the stone fort. It was noted at the time that the stone fort's presence interfered with effective fire from Fort Taber, and a battery of field artillery was emplaced east of Fort Taber.Fort Rodman article at FortWiki.comFort Taber at NorthAmericanForts.com The Fort Taber name was unofficially used to refer to the Fort at Clark's Point for many years, even by the garrison in letters home, and is used to refer to the stone fort in some recent references. Fort Phoenix was refurbished with eight 24-pounder cannon in the Civil War; it was abandoned in 1876. =Endicott period= The Endicott Board of 1885 recommended a comprehensive replacement of existing coast defenses, and most of its recommendations were implemented. In the New Bedford area this meant new installations at Clark's Point. As with other smaller Endicott installations, all of the new defenses were concentrated at one fort. The Clark's Point area was officially named the Fort Rodman Military Reservation in 1898, in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Logan Rodman, a New Bedford native with the 38th Massachusetts Infantry who died in the assault on Port Hudson, Louisiana in 1863. Armament included two one-gun batteries of 8-inch M1888 disappearing guns, a two-gun battery of 5-inch guns on pedestal mounts, and two two-gun batteries of 3-inch guns on retractable masking parapet mounts.Berhow, p. 206 Along with gun batteries, facilities for planting and controlling an underwater minefield were built. The fort was completed in 1902. =World War I= The American entry into World War I brought many changes to the Coast Artillery and the Coast Defenses of New Bedford (CD New Bedford). Numerous temporary buildings were built at Fort Rodman to accommodate the influx of new recruits. Some weapons were removed from forts with the intent of getting US-made artillery into the fight. Fort Rodman's pair of pedestal-mounted 5-inch guns was transferred to the US Army transport ship USAT Kilpatrick. Both of the fort's 8-inch guns were dismounted as potential railway artillery in 1918, but they did not leave the fort and were remounted in 1919. The 5-inch guns were returned in 1919, but by 1921 they were scrapped as part of a general removal from service of some weapon types. A major upgrade began construction at Fort Rodman during the war, Battery Milliken with two 12-inch guns on long-range barbette carriages, initially in open emplacements. Compared with disappearing carriages, this increased the range of this type of gun from to .Berhow, p. 61 This battery was built 1917-1921. References indicate the authorized strength of CD New Bedford in World War I was five companies, including one from the Rhode Island National Guard. =Interwar= In 1920 Fort Rodman's M1898 3-inch guns were scrapped as part of a general removal from service of this weapon; they were not replaced. On 1 July 1924 the harbor defense garrisons completed the transition from a company-based organization to a regimental one, and on 9 June 1925 the commands were renamed from \\"Coast Defenses...\\" to \\"Harbor Defenses...\\". The 23rd Coast Artillery Regiment was the wartime garrison of the Harbor Defenses of New Bedford (HD New Bedford). This unit was first organized in December 1924 as the 616th Coast Artillery Battalion, but was not activated until 1 February 1940 as the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion. HD New Bedford was in caretaker status for most of the interwar period, with the 10th Coast Artillery providing a caretaker detachment during at least the later years through early 1940. This caretaker detachment became the nucleus of the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion, which was gradually activated through mid-1941. In 1938 a battery of two 155 mm guns on \\"Panama mounts\\" (circular concrete platforms) was built at Fort Rodman, probably due to its complete lack of other medium- and small-caliber artillery. =World War II= Early in World War II numerous temporary buildings were again constructed to accommodate the rapid mobilization of men and equipment. In early 1940 the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion was mobilized to garrison HD New Bedford. In 1942 the two 8-inch guns of Batteries Walcott and Barton were scrapped, leaving only the 12-inch Battery Milliken and the 155 mm battery active. Battery Milliken was casemated for protection against air attack during the war. On 13 September 1943, the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion was expanded to a regiment due to the construction of new batteries in southeastern Massachusetts, with the transfer of a battalion from the 242nd Coast Artillery. The 242nd was a Connecticut National Guard regiment normally assigned to the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. Several medium- and small-caliber batteries were built in New Bedford and the Buzzards Bay area during World War II. Chief among these was Battery 210 at Mishaum Point Military Reservation in Dartmouth. It had two 6-inch M1 guns in long-range shielded mounts with a large bunker for ammunition and fire control between them. It currently has a private residence built on the site. A two-gun 155 mm battery was at the location until the 6-inch battery was completed in 1945, along with the harbor entrance control post for New Bedford. The battery in this area served as the examination battery for HD New Bedford. Defending the passage to New Bedford between Dartmouth and Cuttyhunk Island were two batteries of 90 mm dual-purpose guns, one at Barneys Joy Point Military Reservation and one on Cuttyhunk Island, part of the Elizabeth Islands Military Reservation. These were called Anti- Motor Torpedo Boat Batteries (AMTB) 931 and 932, respectively. The AMTB batteries had an authorized strength of four 90 mm guns, two on fixed mounts and two on towed mounts. An additional 90 mm battery, AMTB 933, was on Nashawena Island, just east of Cuttyhunk Island. Protecting the southern entrance to the Cape Cod Canal was a two-gun 155 mm battery on Panama mounts, replaced in 1943 by the 90 mm AMTB 934, at Butler Point Military Reservation in Marion. In early 1944 the US Army (except for the infantry branch) transitioned from a regimental to a battalion-based organization. The 23rd Coast Artillery was reduced to a battalion between 4 February and 12 April 1944. With little threat to the east coast from enemy surface forces, coast defenses were drawn down further. On 7 October 1944 this battalion was absorbed by the Harbor Defenses of New Bedford. The US Navy also participated in defending the Buzzards Bay area with net defenses and submarine-detecting indicator loops, including a station at Gooseberry Neck in Westport (Station 1I).Indicator loops website Following mobilization in 1940 HD New Bedford was subordinate to First Army. On 24 December 1941 the Eastern Theater of Operations (renamed the Eastern Defense Command three months later) was established, with all east coast harbor defense commands subordinate to it, along with antiaircraft and fighter assets. This command was disestablished in 1946.Conn, pp. 33-35 =Post World War II= Following the war, it was soon determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and they were scrapped by the end of 1948, with remaining harbor defense functions turned over to the Navy. In 1950 the Coast Artillery Corps and all Army harbor defense commands were dissolved. Today the Air Defense Artillery carries the lineage of some Coast Artillery units. From the late 1940s through the mid-1970s Fort Rodman served as a military reserve center. Present Except for a pair of fire control towers on Cuttyhunk and Nashawena Islands, the only significant remnants of the Harbor Defenses of New Bedford are Fort Rodman (in Fort Taber Park) and Fort Phoenix. The stone fort at Fort Rodman is in a good state of preservation, but is only open to the public on special occasions. A stone outline marks the location of the Civil War Fort Taber. A museum and a World War II M4 Sherman tank recovered from the tragic Exercise Tiger are in the park. As of 2016, the Endicott batteries at Fort Rodman are fenced off and overgrown, but can be viewed. Many of the garrison buildings of Fort Rodman remain; one of the tenants is the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Fort Phoenix has several 24-pounder Model 1819 cannon made in the 1820s, plus a cannon said to have been captured by the Continental Marines during the raid on Nassau in the Bahamas in 1776.

Eleven people were held hostage by four men in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Incident Police responded to an attempted robbery by four Sunni Muslims looking for guns, rifles, pistols and ammunition for \\"a holy crusade\\". There was a three- hour shootout. The gunmen were Shulab Abdur Raheem, 24 years old; Dawd A. Rahman, 22; Yusef Abdallah Almussadig, 23, and Salih Ali Abdullah, 26. In 1974, their court case went to the New York Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The defense contended that the four men held up the store in January because they feared attacks by their rivals, the Black Muslims, because the day before the robbery, seven Sunni Muslims were killed in a house in Washington. A jury found them guilty of 41 counts, including murder, kidnapping, and robbery.  Legacy  The hostage crisis was a turning point in the New York City Police Department's approach to hostage situations. Instead of brute force, the police used psychology, firearm discipline and patience to end the siege. These were techniques that were then codified in the department's hostage- negotiating training program.  Parole  In 1998, the New York State Board of Parole released Abdulah Almussudug. The public was not yet aware he had been released when he died in 2003. The convicted killer, Shuaib A. Raheem, was released on parole from the Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch, N.Y., in 2010 after serving 35 years in prison. He was 60 years old at the time of his release. In October 2020, Salih Abdullah died of a stroke he suffered at his 14th parole hearing. He was 71 yeas old and had served more than forty years in prison.

The primary ingredients in hunter's chicken are saut√©ed chicken and a reduced chasseur sauce prepared using tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, white wine, brandy and tarragon. Several other dishes from around the world share these names; yet each version is very different, with few to no similarities besides the use of chicken. Etymology means \\"hunter\\" in French, which also refers to the chasseur sauce. Hunter's chicken shares the same literal name as chicken cacciatore in Italy ( means \\"hunter\\" in Italian). Overview French hunter's chicken is prepared using saut√©ed chicken that is cooked crisp and a chasseur sauce consisting of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, white wine, brandy and tarragon. Prior to saut√©eing, the chicken can be dredged in flour. Tomato ingredients can include diced tomatoes, canned crushed tomatoes and canned tomato paste. Additional ingredients in hunter's chicken can include shallots, olive oil, chicken stock and vermouth, and in addition to tarragon, additional spices and seasonings can include marjoram, thyme, bay leaf, salt and pepper. The sauce for hunter's chicken is typically prepared and thickened by the process of reduction. The dish can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley and croutons. Hunter's chicken can become more flavorful after sitting and then being reheated, which allows the flavors of the ingredients to further intermingle. The British version of 'hunter's chicken' usually consist of chicken fillet wrapped in bacon, in a barbecue (or other tomato-based) sauce, often served with cheese on top, such as cheddar.

History Onchestos is mentioned in the famous \\"Catalogue of Ships\\" in Homer's Iliad where it is referred to as Poseidon‚Äôs \\"bright grove.\\" The town was a meeting place for the Boeotian League in the Macedonian period.

It aired in the United States on Fox on April 2, 2017. Plot A softball match is being played to little athletic achievement between teams from the Indian Point and Springfield Nuclear Plants. After Homer Simpson collapses on the field, Mr. Burns and the other coach talk about how the market for nuclear energy will be lucrative forever and ever. Mr. Burns heads right away to his alma mater, Yale University, to endow a chair in nuclear plant management, only to learn that the entire student body is now made of \\"highly entitled wusses\\" from the Whiffenpoofs on down, and who follow left-wing views that appall Mr. Burns. He then finds out that running a university can earn him a lot of money from a member of the Skull and Bones society named Bourbon Verlander. Mr. Burns then cuts a deal with Bourbon and withdraws all of his financial support to Yale in order to set up his own branch of the for-profit university system. Back at the power plant, Mr. Burns burns all of his Yale University memorabilia and tells Homer, Lenny and Carl about his new university. The teachers he chooses to run the university are the power plant workers. Homer and the others start working as teachers, but Homer is not doing well with his students and Lisa (who was horrified that Homer became a professor mainly because he didn't take the responsibility of educating people seriously) offers him a DVD box set of inspirational teachers movies. After watching them, he gets better at teaching and Mr. Burns sells Homer to Bourbon. Homer meets Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ken Jennings, Suze Orman, and Robert McKee, and sees them being introduced to a group of young female \\"students\\" who are actually life-like humanoid robots that will all get into Yale and earn \\"financial aid\\" that gets funneled directly to Bourbon. Six months later, Homer ruins Bourbon's integration of the robots at Yale University with a microaggression that makes them all explode. In the final scene, the teachers then start teaching Lisa, Marge, and Bart at the Simpson residence. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, stating \\"But 'The Caper Chase' is just all over the place, with Burns‚Äô return to Yale spurring him to open a for-profit, Trump- style university like those of fellow nuclear plant maven Bourbon Verlander (guest voice Jason Alexander). That plot seems prepared to morph into an inspirational tale of Homer becoming a Dead Poets Society-esque teacher (skinflint Burns staffs the school with plant workers), until Verlander swoops in to whisk Homer away to his super-secret Ex Machina-styled retreat, where he‚Äôs got a scheme going involving an army of Ava-looking robot students working to get government loans. Book in some time for a handful of guest- teacher guest stars (Neil deGrasse Tyson, Suze Orman, Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings, and screenplay guru Robert McKee as themselves), and a very rushed wrap-up where Homer has to short-circuit all the Yale-enrolled robot students before they can make Verlander all that sweet, sweet student aid, and you‚Äôve got a frenetic episode that can‚Äôt decide what it wants to be.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4.5/5 stars, stating \\"Release me, you hound. I love Mr. Burns, unabashedly and bashedly. I can see what Smithers sees in him. All that power in a man so fragile he floats away on cigar smoke and so old his living will is a sword of Damocles hanging over a trap door that leads to a mote of nuclear waste. Every single line, except the 'what what what' bit, is a joy tonight. We‚Äôve come to our understanding of Burns through segmented antics at the expense of all who don‚Äôt like to pay.

The film premiered at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, and aired on ESPN on May 11, 2010.

At this same time, the crack epidemic began to unfold in Los Angeles County's predominantly black communities such as South Central Los Angeles and Compton which, arguably disadvantaged by the economic policies of then-President Ronald Reagan, witnessed large increases in gang violence, illegal weapon use, and police brutality. By 1987, as Los Angeles hip hop, with its dance sounds and party raps, struck some residents as increasingly out of touch, Niggaz with Attitude (N.W.A), had begun recording what it called \\"reality rap.\\" Joining the national stage in 1988, N.W.A would favor a unified look representing its hometown area. Donning black, one of the Raiders' two colors, and Raiders ball caps, N.W.A extended the Raiders brand's reach and penetration.

Biography He was born in Cork in 1950 and was educated there. He acquired Irish at school and from sojourns in the Gaeltacht of West Kerry. He was a member of an group of poets at University College Cork in the late 1960s who chose Irish as a creative medium and were closely associated with the modernist poetry journal Innti, founded by fellow poet Michael Davitt (1950-2005). They were influenced by the work of Cork poet Se√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in, by the musician and composer Se√°n √ì Riada, and by popular American culture. Greg Delanty, writing for Poetry International, claimed that a fundamental achievement of √ì Muirthile and other members of the Innti group was to adapt the language to a contemporary urban landscape in a way that reflected the counterculture of the sixties.  Writing  √ì Muirthile has been described as a poet of immense formal and musical mastery who read deeply in the classical and neo-classical poetry of the Irish language. He studied French literature as a student and this influenced his work. He translated poetry by Guillaume Apollinaire, Fran√ßois Villon, Jacques Pr√©vert and Anne H√©bert. His first collection of poetry was Tine Chn√°mh (1984). This received the Irish American Cultural Institute‚Äôs literary award and an Oireachtas prize for poetry. He subsequently published a number of other collections. In 1996 he received the Butler Award for his novel Ar Bhruach na Laoi. Several plays by him have been staged. From 1989 to 2003 he wrote a weekly column, ‚ÄúAn Peann Coitianta,‚Äù for the Irish Times. Poems by him have been translated into English, German, French, Italian, Hungarian and Romanian.

Beginning in 1846, he spent several years traveling around Europe for further informal study of art, much of it in Rome. Paintings from this period of Lake Nemi and ancient Roman ruins were praised by critics.

Clarke soon became a labor organizer and recruiter for the United Auto Workers union. Her first project took on disparities between the men's and women's restrooms at the plant raising concerns that the men's restroom had many more sinks for washing after shifts than the women's. The difference added to the women's workday as they waited in long lines. It was the long wait times that allowed Clarke to raise awareness and organize women to become part of the union. Her efforts organizing workers at the plant into the United Auto Workers union survived a major company re-organization from Curtiss-Wright Corporation to North American Rockwell manufacturing company. After 22 years in the aircraft industry, Clarke was the first African American woman to be elected to the executive board of the UAW local 927. In 1969, she left the industry and took a job as a clerical worker at Columbus City Hall where she was supportive of a strike among the city's sanitation workers who were part of the AFSCME Local 1632 union. After the strike, Clarke was instrumental in organizing clerical workers to join the local 1632 union, a task completed by the end of 1969.

It was built in 1883 as Browerville was springing up around a newly built railroad line. The simple wooden building with a false front contained retail space on the ground floor and a community meeting hall upstairs. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for having local significance in the themes of commerce and exploration/settlement. It was nominated for being a highly intact example of the vernacular commercial architecture erected in Minnesota's railroad boomtowns. Description The Kahlert Mercantile Store is a two-story wood-frame building with a footprint. It has the squared-off false front typical of 19th-century rural and frontier towns. However the second floor rises a full story to accommodate the meeting hall, whereas most such buildings had a truncated upper floor. The Kahlert Store lacks any basement. The building is covered in clapboard siding broken by two-over-two sash windows. A balcony once projected from the front fa√ßade. It was removed around 1910, likely to accommodate improvements to the adjacent street or sidewalk. The only other major exterior alteration is the addition of a sliding garage door near the rear of the north wall. History The Kahlert Mercantile Store was established by brothers William and Ferdinand Kahlert. They were early settlers of Todd County who arrived in 1870, initially homesteading in Hartford Township. In 1882 the Sauk Center and Northern Railway‚Äîa subsidiary of the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway‚Äîbuilt a rail line nearby. Although mostly intended to access railroad-owned timber land, the rail line sparked the establishment of several towns along its route, including Browerville. Although a small village had been coalescing in Hartford Township, most of its business owners quickly relocated to the new trackside town, and the Kahlert brothers followed suit in 1883. Their building, at the corner of Main Street and 6th Street, used the same false- front style as most of the other early construction in Browerville. They operated a general store and grocery out of the ground floor. Despite competition from several similar stores in town, the Kahlerts prospered and even expanded into an adjacent building by 1900. Over the same period the meeting hall they'd established on the upper floor served as a popular venue for local gatherings, social events, and church services.

A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was one of four partial eclipses that took place that year, two within the space of two months each, the next one was on February 11 and covered the Northern Hemisphere. It was the three of last of solar saros 109, the next two were on January 22, 1841 and February 5, 1859. Description The eclipse was visible in parts of Antarctica including the 180th meridian and the Pacific Ocean. The eclipse started at sunrise off the shores of peninsular Antarctica, most of it started it at sunset, it finished at sunset around halfway between Antarctica and New Zealand, there it was January 11 being west of the 180th meridian, where the Date Line is located today. It showed about from 5% to 10% obscurity in a part of Antarctica, about 20% in the Pacific.. The greatest eclipse was in the Pacific Ocean east of the 180th meridian at 64.5 S and 173 W at 9:20:12 UTC (9:20 PM local time) at the furthermost area of the Southwestern Hemisphere (sometimes as the Southwestern Tetrasphere).

Normally, OP9 cells, a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, support the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into B cells.

OP9 cells expressing Delta-like-1 or Delta-like-4 were also able to induce differentiation of totipotent embryonic stem cells into functional T cells.

Early life  Robert Endean was born in December 1925 in Abermain, NSW and was raised in Abernethy. He attended Cessnock High School and won a scholarship to study at the University of Sydney taking a B.Sc. with Honours in Zoology in 1948 and a University Gold Medal. He took his M.Sc from the same in 1949, supervised by marine biologist, Professor William Dakin. He took his PhD at the University of Queensland in 1958.  Career  Endean worked as a Secretary, and later chair and president of the Great Barrier Reef Committee from 1954‚Äì75. It was during this time that the Heron Island Research Station passed to the control of the University of Queensland. Endean took up work as an Assistant Lecturer in 1950, rising to the position of Reader in 1964 at the University of Queensland. Endean's primary research was the study of the toxicology of marine organisms. particularly the crown-of-thorns starfish, acanthaster planci. He became an advocate for the environmental protection of the Reef, principally from the crown of thorns starfish, and his publications and outreach work into the impacts of the starfish on coral ecology, led to the formation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) in 1975. Endean accompanied Hans Hass on his first expedition to the Great Barrier Reef. In 1967, Endean accompanied the Belgian Scientific Expedition that conducted studies of the Great Barrier Reef. In the 1960s, Endean worked with Roche Laboratories to establish a research base at the Heron Island Research Station, and study a number of active compounds found in marine organisms for medical research. He published 160 scientific papers and books during his career. His report prepared for the Queensland government into the outbreak of the crown of thorns starfish outbreak was dismissed in 1970. A later report to the Commonwealth government was also tabled, for which Endean continued to provide research submissions. Endean was a member of the World Health Organisation's Expert Advisory Committee on Food Additives. He was Deputy Chair of the Heron Island board which oversaw the Research Station. He was a spokesperson on reef ecology, and had advised the community widely on toxins and marine pharmacology and biology. Endean retired from the University of Queensland in 1990, after 40 years of association with the Zoology Department.  Legacy  Endean died on 6 October 1997 on Heron Island, shortly before he was due to give an address at the Australian Coral Reef Society. He was survived by his partner Dr Ann Cameron with whom he worked and daughter Dr Coralie Endean. A reef was named for him ‚Äì the Bob Endean Reef off Mission Beach, Queensland.

Casa Susanna was a popular weekend destination in Jewett, NY for cross-dressing men and transgender women in the early 1960s. The bungalow camp was run by Susanna ValentiSusanna Valenti (born Tito, a name which she went by for many years) immigrated to the United States from Latin America in the mid-1940s. She wrote numerous articles for Virginia Prince's Transvestia. Susanna's time and place of death are unknown: the last known mention of her was her contribution to the 100th issue of Transvestia in 1979. and her wife Marie, who also ran a wig store in town. History Marie purchased the 150-acre property in the mid-1950s, and she and Susanna originally dubbed it Chevalier D'Eon Resort. They charged $25 for a weekend, which included food, lodging, and makeup lesson. Hidden away in the rural Catskills, Casa Susanna provided much-needed privacy to its guests in a time when publicly cross-dressing was a criminal offense. However, guests occasionally visited the town of Hunter to shop, where they were met by a range of reactions. Some were negative, but many locals saw them as reliable customers. Casa Susanna was a haven for its guests to go to and celebrate their \\"inner girl\\" without persecution. There, they could be happy and comfortable, participating in activities like gardening and Scrabble in elegant 1950s-style heels and dresses. Most guests at Casa Susanna were married and considered themselves heterosexual men who enjoyed cross-dressing, but many others later identified as transgender and lived out their lives as women, including Virginia Prince and Susanna herself. Photography for transvestites in the 1950s was both affirming and extremely dangerous. Sending negatives to a professional developer who might call the police was out of the question, so Casa Susanna appointed an official photographer from one of its own: Andrea Susan. Andrea took many photographs of her fellow guests and developed them at home. Although Polaroids were popular for their instantaneous development, Andrea's photography was of higher quality, and she could be trusted. She put the negatives in the possession of her mentor Dick, who had gifted her her photo development equipment. When Dick threw them away, they made their way to a Manhattan flea market in the mid-2000s. There, they were found by Robert Swope,Not the Robert Swope of Vagina Monologues fame. ‚Äúa gentle punk rocker turned furniture dealer,‚Äù who bought every photograph he could find and published them into a book with his partner Michel Hurst. The release of this book fifty years later led many former attendees of Casa Susanna to come forward and share their experiences, allowing the resort to be documented. Without this chance encounter, Casa Susanna may have been lost to history. Influence The book Casa Susanna which was a collection of photographs from the home inspired the Tony-nominated play Casa Valentina by Harvey Fierstein.

The 2002 Adelaide Festival had a vision markedly different from previous festivals, and intentionally moved away from the typical arts festival model used across the world. Sellars critiqued what he described as a ‚Äúshopping trolley‚Äù approach to arts festival management,Radio National Perspective where \\"exotic tidbits are brought to the table of an overstuffed population\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, pg. 15, Wednesday, April 12, 2000 i.e. a director fills the ‚Äòfestival trolley‚Äô with pre-existing work from around the world, rather than generating it locally.

'2002 Festival Gives Power to the People', the Advertiser, August 24, 2000 These additional staff were estimated to add an cumulative expense of $1.8 million over two years leading up to the program.Caust, Jo.

This unrealistic expectation may have come from Sellar's work in American contexts where private support is much more common, whereas in Australia the mix of government, corporate and philanthropic funding is markedly different, especially in Adelaide where few major corporations have their headquarters.Caust, Jo.

A replacement ad was aired consisting of a series of written inspirational quotes about the arts, ending with a voiceover saying ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter what you think so long as you think‚Äù. Festival Program Launch Partly due to the September 11 attacks and collapse of Ansett Airlines, the festival program launch had to be pushed back from early October to October 31, 2001, which meant that Sellars would not be able to attend since he was to be in Paris at the time to direct an Opera.Caust, Jo.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known simply as Shahbandar ('harbourmaster'). The territory under the jurisdiction of the Shahbandar was the royal capital, Pekan, and its surrounding area stretching from Bebar river to Kuala Lepar, which mostly lies within the Pekan constituency. During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, the title was renamed with the additional prefixes Orang Kaya Indera ('Mighty' or 'powerful nobleman'), thus it was later known as 'Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar'. The title is the fourth most influential among the four major chiefs, because the Shahbandar lived in the vicinity of the capital, and tended to become the monarch's minister or chief executive officer. Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar was one of four major chiefs () who wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation, and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. Their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, which varied according to their proximity to Pekan ‚Äî the further from the court, the greater their authority. Their districts were subject to the ruler granting monopolies () on certain goods. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year in the month of Muharram to pay the monarch homage () and a form of tribute (). During wartime, they were required to take to the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of the Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Sultan of Johor through his viceroy, the Bendahara. In time, with the sovereign being a distant figure, their allegiance tended to become more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of the Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century.  Titles and style  The full title and style for this peerage in the Malay language is Yang DiHormat Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. It placed at the front of the holder's name and his other Malay styles and titles.. For example, :Yang DiHormat Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar ke-10 Tun Abdul Razak Hussein. This is different from Peerages in the United Kingdom where the title and style placed at the back of the name. The first wife of the holder will carry the full title and style ‚Äî Toh Puan Indera. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch before his appointment was approved. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfit for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Shahbandar family The present members of the Shahbandar family claim matrilineal descent from To' Tuan, a Bugis chief who settled in Pahang about 1722, married a Pahang lady, and was said to have improved the art of silk weaving in his adopted country. The patrilineal ancestor of the family is To' Tondek, the first Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. After the death of Ali, the seventh Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar, the title went to a non-family member Che Osman, son of Imam Perang Indera Mahkota Gendut. On Che Osman's death, the chieftaincy reverted to the old family in the person of Dato' Hussein. The incumbent titleholder is Najib Razak, who is the former Prime Minister of Malaysia.

She was self-taught and her work is in the permanent collections of several American art museums.  Biography  Blizzard was born in Saltville in 1919. She has Apache and Irish ancestry. When she was little, she and her family moved to Plum Creek. Her mother taught Blizzard and her sister how to create art using a pit-fire method. During the Great Depression, she left school in order to be part of the National Youth Administration. She worked in a munitions factory in Bristol during World War II and after that, worked at a textile mill in Chilhowie until 1958. Blizzard had contracted black lung and lost one of her lungs. Her husband was crippled in an accident in a coal mine and eventually their marriage failed. Her husband died in 1954. Blizzard developed paranoid schizophrenia after these events and her art helped her deal with visions she saw and the feelings she needed to work through. She began making art for sale in the late 1950s and sold her pottery in her daughter, Mary's, store. In the early 1980s, her neighbor, Michael Martin, contacted a friend to take some of Blizzard's work to a gallery in Buckhead run by Judith Alexander where Jonathan Williams discovered her work. Blizzard died in Glade Springs on June 2, 2002.

Her art \\"expressed her memories, surroundings, and religious views.\\" The work is dark in terms of theme, as Jonathan Williams describes it, \\"they make you think twice about human despair.\\" Her work is in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the American Folk Art Museum, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Asheville Art Museum, the High Museum and the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Museum.

The glasses and two points represent the face of Jiang Zemin. The latin letters below stand for \\"na√Øve\\", which is Jiang's quote in one of the most famous Moha videos. Moha (, ), literally \\"admiring toad\\" or \\"toad worship\\", is an internet meme spoofing Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and paramount leader. It originated among the netizens in mainland China and has become a subculture on the Chinese internet. According to another explanation, it comes from China's social media Baidu Tieba. In the culture, Jiang is nicknamed h√°, or \\"toad\\", because of his supposed resemblance to a toad. Netizens who m√≥h√° (worship the toad) call themselves \\"toad fans\\", \\"toad lovers\\" or \\"toad worshippers\\" (), or \\"mogicians\\" () which is a wordplay on (, magician) in Mandarin.See: Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese. Another nickname for Jiang is \\"elder\\" or \\"senior\\" (), because he once called himself an \\"elder\\" or \\"senior\\" when he was berating Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung who questioned him. A video clip recording this event spread on the internet and led to the rise of the culture, which later greatly rose in popularity around 2014, when Hong Kong was experiencing a period of political instability. Initially, netizens extracted Jiang's quotes from the video and imitated his wording and tone, for parody and insult. However, as the culture developed, some imitations have taken to carrying affection toward him. The quotes for imitation have also evolved to include what he said during his leadership, and in his personal life. The Internet meme has been censored in China.  Origins  In October 2000, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee- hwa, went to Beijing to report to Jiang Zemin. On October 27, 2000, when Jiang Zemin and Tung Chee-hwa met with reporters before the formal talks, Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung questioned whether Jiang Zemin had appointed the Hong Kong Chief Executive in the election, which made Jiang Zemin angry.  Materials  Jiang Zemin The materials of moha usually come from three famous videos about Jiang called \\"Three Pieces About Toad\\" (). # In the first video, Jiang lashed out at Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung in Zhongnanhai when he met with Chee-hwa Tung, Chief Executive of Hong Kong at that time. Ms. Cheung asked if Jiang supported Tung's campaign for Chief Executive, which Jiang affirmed. Cheung then asked if it meant the Chinese government had already decided internally to re-appoint Tung. This made Jiang very upset, and criticized her for twisting his words to \\"make big news.\\" Jiang then continued to criticize the Hong Kong media on the whole, claiming that they need to learn to ask more meaningful questions, even stating that \\"Mike Wallace of the US is at a much higher level than you are.\\" # The second is the famous interview by American journalist Mike Wallace that Jiang referred to in the previous video. In this interview, Wallace and Jiang talked about many touchy subjects, such as democracy and dictatorship in China, freedom of the press, Falun Gong, and the Tiananmen square incident. # The third video is recorded when Jiang came back to China United Engineering Corporation (Jiang worked there for some years), and Jiang recalled his experience in the video. He also talks about Deng Xiaoping's decision to appoint him as leader of China, and what he considered his achievements during his years of leadership. There is also a heavy focus on elements of Jiang's appearance as well, in particular his very large and thick rimmed glasses, slicked back hair, high-waisted trousers, and unusually wide smile. Toad worshippers also extract some sentences from these videos for spoofing like \\"too young, too simple, sometimes naive\\" (originally in English).  Notable statements  Some most famous statements from Jiang are listed below. Note that phrases in italics were originally said in English. = Interview with the Hong Kong press = * \\"I did not say I would handpick him [Tung Chee-hwa]. You asked me if I support Mr. Tung; I said I support him.\\" * \\"Re-election will still have to follow the [Hong Kong] Basic Law, have to... Of course, our decision is very important too!\\" * \\"I feel that you journalist people still have to learn a bit! You're very familiar with those Western values, but after all, you're still too young!\\" * \\"(Mike) Wallace from America, is far better than you guys. I have talked jovially with him.\\" * \\"There is one good thing about you. Whenever things happen somewhere in the world, you'll run over there faster than the Western reporters. But all the questions you ask... too simple! Sometimes naive!\\" * \\"Pardon. As an elder, I need to tell you something. I'm not a journalist, but I've seen too much. It's necessary for me to teach (tell) you some life experiences.\\" * \\"Whenever I meet you, I want to say... There's an old saying in Chinese‚Äî'Keep silent and make a fortune.' That's the best way.\\" * \\"You people, don't want to...try to...make a big news! Saying that it's already decided internally, and then take me out for criticism. You people, naive!\\" * I'm angry! I guess I displeased you guys today. = Interview with Mike Wallace = * \\"You mean I'm a dictator?\\" * \\"Even under extreme situations, our soldiers have demonstrated restraint.\\" (referring to the Tank Man) * \\"Do you trust the Falun Gong?\\" * \\"All men are created equal.\\" = Visiting China United Engineering Corporation = * \\"This thing (book) you made for me.

GRNN was suggested by D.F. Specht in 1991. GRNN can be used for regression, prediction, and classification. GRNN can also be a good solution for online dynamical systems. GRNN represents an improved technique in the neural networks based on the nonparametric regression. The idea is that every training sample will represent a mean to a radial basis neuron.https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/7779/ch2.pdf?sequence=14 Mathematical representation : Y(x) = frac{sum_{k=1}^N y_k K(x, x_k)}{sum_{k=1}^N K(x, x_k)} where: * Y(x) is the prediction value of input x * y_k is the activation weight for the pattern layer neuron at k * K(x, x_k) is the Radial basis function kernel (Gaussian kernel) as formulated below. =Gaussian Kernel= K(x, x_k) = e^{-d_k/2sigma^2}, qquad d_k = (x-x_k)^T(x-x_k) where d_k is the squared euclidean distance between the training samples x_k and the input x.  Implementation  GRNN has been implemented in many computer languages including MATLAB, R- programming language, Python (programming language) and Node.js. Neural networks (specifically Multi-layer Perceptron) can delineate non-linear patterns in data by combining with generalized linear models by considering distribution of outcomes (sightly different from original GRNN). There have been several successful developments, including Poisson regression, ordinal logistic regression, quantile regression and multinomial logistic regression that described by Fallah in 2009. Advantages and disadvantages Similar to RBFNN, GRNN has the following advantages: * Single-pass learning so no backpropagation is required. * High accuracy in the estimation since it uses Gaussian functions. * It can handle noises in the inputs. * It requires only less number of datasets. The main disadvantages of GRNN are: *Its size can be huge, which would make it computationally expensive. *There is no optimal method to improve it.

Disappearance On the night of October 18, 1949, Dorothy's husband, magistrate Jules Forstein, left home for the evening. He later called Dorothy and told her that he would not arrive home until late. When he returned home, he was very surprised to find his two children, Edward and Marcy, clinging together in a bedroom. They were both crying \\"Mommy's gone!\\" Marcy told her father that roughly 15 minutes previously, she had been woken by a noise and had gone downstairs, where she had seen a middle-aged man in a brown, peaked cap carrying her unconscious mother down the stairs over his shoulder. When she asked him what he was doing, he patted her head and told her, \\"Go back to sleep, little one. Your mom is fine.\\"Robert Nash, Jay (1977) Among The Missing, p.121, . from Marcel Dassault's account and he then left and locked the door.  Investigation  Police initially doubted Marcy's story but believed it after a psychiatrist interviewed her and confirmed she was apparently telling the truth. The theory first posited by police was that someone with a grudge against her husband due to his job had targeted her. This was seen as most likely given that five years previously, a home intruder had stolen nothing but had severely assaulted Dorothy. On this occasion, too, nothing was stolen from the house. No fingerprints were left behind by the intruder, nor were there any signs of forced entry, just as in the previous assault. A large search was conducted to find Forstein, as the police asked for a check of all unidentified women and requested reports from hospitals (including mental hospitals), hotels, morgues and convalescent homes all across the country. Captain James Kelly of Philadelphia's detective bureau sent out 10,000 notices to police departments and institutions with the description of Forstein.

In this conformer, the dihedral angle of the A‚ÄìB bond and the C‚ÄìD bond is greater than +150¬∞ or less than ‚àí150¬∞ (Figures 1 and 2). Anti-periplanar is often used in textbooks to mean strictly anti-coplanar, with an A-B C-D dihehedral angle of 180¬∞ (Figure 3). In a Newman projection, the molecule will be in a staggered arrangement with the anti-periplanar functional groups pointing up and down, 180¬∞ away from each other (see Figure 4). Figure 5 shows 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane in a sawhorse projection with chlorine and a hydrogen anti-periplanar to each other. Syn-periplanar is similar to anti-periplanar. In the syn-periplanar conformer, the A and D are on the same side of the plane of the bond, with the dihedral angle of A‚ÄìB and C‚ÄìD between +30¬∞ and ‚àí30¬∞ (see Figure 2). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Figure 1: Functional groups A and D are anti-periplanar  Figure 2: Functional groups are considered periplanar if they have a dihedral angle less than ‚àí150¬∞ or greater than +150¬∞ or ‚àí30¬∞ to +30¬∞.

Figure 5: Sawhorse projection of 2-chloro-2,3-diemthylbutane showing Cl and H anti-periplanar. }  Molecular orbitals An important factor in the antiperiplanar conformer is the interaction between molecular orbitals. Anti-periplanar geometry will put a bonding orbital and an anti-bonding orbital approximately parallel to each other, or syn-periplanar. Figure 6 is another representation of 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane (Figure 5), showing the C‚ÄìH bonding orbital, œÉC‚ÄìH, and the C‚ÄìCl anti-bonding orbital, œÉ*C‚ÄìCl, syn-periplanar. The parallel orbitals can overlap and become involved in hyperconjugation. If the bonding orbital is an electron donor and the anti-bonding orbital is an electron acceptor, then the bonding orbital will be able to donate electronegativity into the anti-bonding orbital. This filled-to-unfilled donor-acceptor interaction has an overall stabilizing effect on the molecule. However, donation from a bonding orbital into an anti-bonding orbital will also result in the weakening of both of those bonds. In Figure 6, 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane is stabilized through hyperconjugation from electron donation from œÉC-H into œÉ*C-Cl, but both C‚ÄìH and C‚ÄìCl bonds are weakened. A molecular orbital diagram shows that the mixing of œÉC‚ÄìH and œÉ*C‚ÄìCl in 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane lowers the energy of both the orbitals (Figure 7). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Figure 6: The C‚ÄìH bonding orbital is aligned with the anti-bonding orbital of C‚ÄìCl and can donate into the anti-bonding orbital through hyperconjugation.  Figure 7: The energy of both the C‚ÄìH bonding orbital and the C‚ÄìCl anti-bonding orbital lower when they mix. }  Examples of anti-periplanar geometry in mechanisms = E2 mechanism= A bimolecular elimination reaction will occur in a molecule where the breaking carbon-hydrogen bond and the leaving group are anti-periplanar (Figure 8). This geometry is preferred because it aligns œÉC-H and œÉ*C-X orbitals. Figure 9 shows the œÉC-H orbital and the œÉ*C-X orbital parallel to each other, allowing the œÉC-H orbital to donate into the œÉ*C-X anti-bonding orbital through hyperconjugation. This serves to weaken C-H and C-X bond, both of which are broken in an E2 reaction. It also sets up the molecule to more easily move its œÉC-H electrons into a œÄC-C orbital (Figure 10). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Figure 8: In an E2 mechanism, the breaking C‚ÄìH bond and the leaving group are often anti-periplanar. In the Figure B is a general base and X is a leaving group.  Figure 9: The C‚ÄìH bonding orbital is mixing with the C‚ÄìX anti-bonding orbital through hyperconjugation.  Figure 10: In an E2 mechanism molecules generally prefer an anti-periplanar geometry because it aligns molecular orbitals and sets up the molecule to move electrons in a C‚ÄìH bonding orbital into a œÄC-C bonding orbital. } = Pinacol rearrangement= Figure 11: Mechanism of a pinacol rearrangement. The C‚ÄìC bonding orbital is aligned with the C‚ÄìO anti-bonding orbital, which facilitates the methyl shift. H‚ÄìA is a generic acid. In the pinacol rearrangement, a methyl group is found anti- periplanar to an activated alcohol functional group. This places the œÉC‚ÄìC orbital of the methyl group parallel with the œÉ*C‚ÄìO orbital of the activated alcohol. Before the activated alcohol leaves as H2O the methyl bonding orbital donates into the C‚ÄìO antibonding orbital, weakening both bonds. This hyperconjugation facilitates the 1,2-methyl shift that occurs to remove water. See Figure 11 for the mechanism.  History, etymology, and misuse The term anti-periplanar was first coined by Klyne and Prelog in their work entitled \\"Description of steric relationships across single bonds\\", published in 1960. ‚ÄòAnti‚Äô refers to the two functional groups lying on opposite sides of the plane of the bond. ‚ÄòPeri‚Äô comes from the Greek word for ‚Äònear‚Äô and so periplanar means ‚Äúapproximately planar‚Äù. In their article ‚ÄúPeriplanar or Coplanar?‚Äù Kane and Hersh point out that many organic textbooks use anti- periplanar to mean completely anti-planar, or anti-coplanar, which is technically incorrect.

Its text is drawn from letters between English composer Benjamin Britten and his first romantic interest, Wulff Scherchen. This orchestral song cycle forms a section within Chan's larger work Voices and Instruments. The work was commissioned by Queensland Symphony Orchestra and premiered at the 2016 Brisbane Festival on 22 September 2016. Scherchen died six weeks before the concert, at the age of 96, and the concert was dedicated to his memory. Both Arts Hub and The AU Review included the song cycle in their Top Ten shows at the 2016 Brisbane Festival. It is one of 4 works shortlisted for Orchestral Work of the Year in the 2017 Art Music Awards. The work has been broadcast in its entirety twice by ABC Classic FM, in November 2016 and January 2017. A complete performance lasts approximately 40 minutes. The world premiere was performed by tenor Andrew Goodwin, saxophonist Michael Duke and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra under conductor Paul Kildea, the noted Britten biographer.  Historical background  Wulff Scherchen was a young German man, the son of the conductor Hermann Scherchen. Though they first met in Siena, Italy when Britten was 20 and Scherchen nearly 14, the romantic friendship did not begin until four years later when Scherchen had started living in Cambridge. This relationship hit a crisis when World War II broke out and Scherchen was incarcerated as an enemy alien. He was deported to a Prisoner of War camp in Canada (Camp 23). Throughout the relationship, Britten and Scherchen corresponded. \\"The one person constantly in my thoughts and on my mind without fail was you. No one else occupied my heart, my mind or my body,‚Äù wrote Scherchen to Britten in 1941. Lyle Chan discovered this story via the book and film Britten's Children by John Bridcut. Chan met Scherchen after learning that he was alive at the age of 95 and living in northern New South Wales with his wife of over 70 years under the name John Woolford, which he had assumed after his release from enemy alien internment in 1941. In 2015 Scherchen consented to have these letters turned into a song cycle. Chan theorized that Britten's own works contain a coded symbol of Scherchen, the saxophone, and so this instrument was given a solo role.

It is the first ever such panpulmonate slug to be discovered at such depths. It is the only known member of its family group. Its radular formula is 1.1.2. Physical description Adults have a body length of approximately 9 mm. The animal's head includes two pairs of tentacles, one set of labial tentacles and another set of rhinophores, both sets of which are cylindrical, solid, and taper at their tips. The eyes are located just behind the rhinophores. The animal's creeping foot is three times the width of its head and tapers to a point at the posterior of the animal. The anterior end of the foot also has a pair of propodial tentacles. The animal's head is brown, and the tentacles and foot are semi-translucent. A distinct black stripe extends from the dorsal part of the cephalic tentacles and proceeds to the end of the animal's foot. The body includes a transparent notum which is free and oval-shaped. The notum is as wide as the foot and extends well over half of the body length. Some of the internal organs can be viewed through this structure. The mantle and foot are also covered in small granular white spots. There is no shell, no gills, and no mantle cavity. The animal is able to partially retract its head beneath the notum when disturbed. Anatomy =Nervous system= The nervous system is euthyneurous. The cerebral, pleural, and pedal ganglia form the typical molluscan pre-pharyngeal nerve ring. Each cerebral ganglion connects via a broad nerve to its corresponding labial and rhinophore tentacle, though there is no rhinophore ganglion. The animal also lacks optic ganglia and accessory ganglia. Despite the presence of eyes, there appears to be no optic nerve. The pedal ganglia each send one nerve anteriorly and two posteriorly to control the foot. These ganglia are separated by a long, thin commissure and have one statocyst and statolith each, attached dorsally. It has one subintestinal ganglion, one visceral ganglion, one osphradial ganglion, two gastro- esophageal ganglia, one left parietal ganglion, and two buccal ganglia, along with the necessary commissures and connectives. =Reproductive system= The reproductive system is hermaphroditic and monaulic. The ovotestis forms an incomplete ring around the sides of the large digestive gland. The ampulla is large and tube-shaped. Phylogeny Among the most interesting results of molecular studies of this deep-sea animal are that it is closely related to mesopsammic or limnic acochlidiids, and especially the evidence of its sister- group relationship with the amphibious and terrestrial Aitengidae, despite extreme differences in habitat.

The artisan who carved the casket is unknown, as is the identity of the person it was created for, although it is believed to have been crafted for a member of the imperial court due to its themes and the expensive materials it is constructed from.Maguire, H., New Constantines: The Rhythm of Imperial Renewal in Byzantium. 4th-13th Centuries, Papers from the Twenty-sixth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, St Andrews, March 1992, Cambridge, 1994, Variorum University Press  Physical Description  The Troyes Casket measures 13√ó26√ó13 centimeters. It has six intact, 1 cm thick panels of solid ivory, five of which feature carved inscriptions. The ivory panels are dyed a purplish-red color. Purple was considered a royal color in Byzantium, and only members of the imperial family and court were allowed to wear or use it.Walker, Alicia. The Emperor and the World: Exotic Elements and the Imaging of Byzantine Imperial Power, ninth to thirteenth century CE. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2011. The long front panels of the casket are carved with scenes of hunting and martial skill. The carving on the front panel of the casket depicts two men on horseback hunting a lion. The two hunters are dressed as soldiers, carrying bows and swords and wearing lamellar armor. The back panel depicts a lone individual spearing a wild boar.Heath, Ian, and Angus McBride. Byzantine armies: 886-1118. Wellingborough, Osprey, 1999. The shorter end panels depict, or were heavily inspired by representations of, the mythical Chinese bird known as the fenghuang. These images are very similar to those created in China at the time, although they were carved in Constantinople. The carver‚Äôs intention behind including this exotic imagery is debated, but unknown. The lid is flat and hinged, and can be opened upwards. On the lid panel, two men on horses are carved riding away from a walled city, which may be intended to represent Constantinople. These riders are also wearing armor, in a style modelled after Greco-Roman generals, and they carry spears. The two figures are believed to represent an unknown emperor and his heir, carrying out the action of expanding their empire through war.

In 1857, she took in children from the Washington County Infirmary, thus organizing the first children's home in the state of Ohio. Ewing taught school in Ohio before becoming a missionary among the Choctaw. Ten years later, upon her return to Ohio, she founded a home for destitute children. Through her efforts, the Ohio Legislature passed a bill in Columbus, which entitled every county to establish a children's home. Ewing also authored a comprehensive historical report on the origin and growth of the children's home movement in Washington County. Early life and education Catherine A. Fay was born in Westboro, Massachusetts, July 18, 1822. Her parents, William (a veteran of the War of 1812) and Elizabeth (Lankton) Fay, lived comfortably. She was the seventh of eleven children, of whom all grew up and nine reached an advanced age. On her father's side, Ewing was descended from Huguenot ancestry. Through the mother's influence, the 12 children became Christians in early life. Ewing's mother was of Scotch descent, and in the long line of Christian ancestors, there were many ministers and missionaries. In 1835, the family removed to Washington County, Ohio, and settled east of Marietta, near Marietta College. The father came here both to aid the struggling college and to give his sons the benefit of its advantages. Ewing attended the Marietta Female Seminary, remaining in Marietta through her girlhood, even as her health began to decline. Career =Educator and missionary= Ewing offered herself to the American Board for Foreign Mission work among the Native Americans, who were at that time included in the field of the Board's activities. She was 18 when she left home and became a mission teacher among the Choctaw, who had been removed in 1830 from their homes in the South to Indian Territory. Her salary as a teacher was US$100 a year plus her board. For 10 years, she labored among the Choctaw, much of the time the only non-Native American among them, living beyond the nearest post office. In the fall of 1853, while working as a missionary among the Choctaw, a physician called upon Ewing and asked her to visit a poor family where the mother, a New England woman, had died leaving five small children. They had been committed to his care, and he was trying to find homes for them, their drunken father having deserted them. The physician wanted Ewing to adopt a little girl who as two years old. She took the youngest for a little while, and became deeply attached to the child, but she felt the decision was impracticable as she was a poor teacher, hundreds of miles from home. The child was then taken by a married couple. Following a drunken fight, the child was thrown down the steps of the house and killed. This affected Ewing so deeply that she became determined to have a home of her own where she could care for orphan and homeless children. To achieve this objective, she began saving every dollar possible. Eventually, however, malaria and nervous exhaustion compelled her return to Marietta. =Philanthropist= Her father, sympathizing with her purpose, assisted Ewing to some extent, so from these and other sources she gathered a modest amount from sympathetic friends, borrowed $150, till her resources amounted to $500. In 1857, she purchased of land at Moss Run, about east of Marietta, and set about building. Meanwhile, soon after her return from the missionary work, she had chanced to visit the county infirmary, and was drawn to the young children there, living in the same environment with adults. These children were often diseased and depraved, but she fell in love with them nonetheless, and determined to make for them a home. Many thought her crazy, others suspected a moneymaking scheme, some appreciated her motives and sacrifices and helped her. On 1 April 1858, in a cottage of two rooms, she received from the County Poor House, nine children, all under 10 years of age. The county agreed to pay her $1.00 a week (The Marietta Register said the sum was $0.75 a week) and half the expense of medical attendance and burial in case of death. Each child was to have a new suit of clothes when brought to her, but for all other needs she was herself to be responsible. The first few weeks were very hard ones, the trustees of the district school refusing to allow the children to attend school because they were paupers, and they were unwilling to have their own children associate with them. After a lawsuit, she obtained permission to send them to school, but the children were taunted as poorhouse children. A few months later, before the ensuing winter, she moved into the new home with 20 rooms, and the first children's home was an accomplished fact. Its cost was $2000, and in five years, $4000 had been expended on the property. She also built her own schoolhouse and engaged a teacher. After the American Civil War broke out in 1861, many soldiers' children were added to her care. Her allowance for the increased cost of living was brought up to $1.25 a week and in response to her appeal for such children, the State opened at Xenia, Ohio a home for soldiers' orphans. For 10 years, she successfully managed the home and cared for 101 needy children of Washington County. She faced problems of feeding and clothing so many, especially in war times, when prices went up and the attention of those who had helped her before was drawn away. There was also the issue of sickness when diphtheria and scarlet fever invaded the home. =Activist= But Ewing knew that the need of other counties was as great and some even greater. As early as 1862, she began an \\"agitation\\" for a State law in behalf of neglected children. She personally went to Columbus and pleaded with the Legislature. In 1864, she conferred with the commissioners about the process at the state legislature to bring about this change. The bill was presented that year but failed. In 1865, it was again presented and rejected. Finally in 1866, a bill prepared by Hon. Samuel S. Knowles of Washington County was passed, authorizing the county commissioners throughout the state to establish children's homes. So the plan which she at first thought of only as a relief to her own Children's Home became in the course of time the means of creating homes in the different counties of the state. Washington County was one of the first to act under this law, and a farm of was purchased for this purpose. When all was ready for the children's arrival, she was asked to take the superintendency of the home, in 1870. But she declined the offer as she had married by then. Personal life In 1866, at the age of 44, she married Archibald S. D. Ewing (1828-1900), who had been an adviser and assistant on her farm. After 1867, she lived quietly in Marietta, still active in good works. For many years, she taught the primary department of the Presbyterian Sunday School, and was ‚ÄúAunt Katie‚Äù to a large part of the children and young people in the upper part of the city. She was interested in the temperance cause. Though the Ewings had no natural children, Mrs. Ewing had adopted five. She died April 4, 1897, leaving her property by will to the Missionary Society of the women of Marietta but this society had a temporary existence and had disbanded at the time of the death of her husband, so by direction of the Probate Court it was divided among her brothers and sisters and their heirs.

During World War II he assisted with the development of the calutron as part of the Manhattan Project. He returned to Berkeley in 1945 to lead the construction of the cyclotron, and spent the rest of his career there. Biography Robert Lyster Thornton was born in Wootton, Bedfordshire, England, on 29 November 1908, the son of Dudley L. Thornton, a mechanical engineer, and his wife Katherine Foster. The family emigrated to Canada when his father worked for the Canadian Pacific Railroad. He entered McGill University, earning his B.Sc. in 1930 and then his Ph.D. in 1933, writing his thesis on \\"The Stark effect for krypton; Stark intensities in hydrogen and helium\\" under the supervision of John Stuart Foster, an expert on the Stark effect. His results were subsequently published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. In 1933, Thornton came to the University of California in Berkeley on a Morse Traveling Scholarship from McGill University. He joined Ernest Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory, one of nine scholars from the British Commonwealth who worked there in the 1930s. He was one of the early pioneers of the cyclotron, a group that included Bernard Kinsey, Franz Kurie, Edwin McMillan, Arthur Snell and Stanley van Voorhis. Indeed, it was in a 1935 paper he co-authored with Lawrence and McMillan that the term \\"cyclotron\\" first appeared. He later bemoaned the fact that little valuable physics was done owing to the Radiation Laboratory's preoccupation with the cyclotrons and the detectors, but he was involved in an exploration of the Oppenheimer‚ÄìPhillips process. In 1938 he married Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Edie. They had two daughters, Katherine (Katy) and Margaret (Peggy), and a son, Denis. Other universities were eager to secure cyclotron technology, and Thornton helped the University of Michigan set up one in 1935. In 1940 he left Berkeley for a position as an associate professor at Washington University at St. Louis, where he again built a cyclotron, but he returned to Berkeley in 1942 at Lawrence's request to assist with the development of the calutron. This was a device for uranium enrichment using electromagnetic separation, as part of the Manhattan Project, the effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II. He worked in Boston with Stone and Webster, and eventually became assistant director of the Process Improvement Division of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. During the war he became a naturalized US citizen. After the war ended he returned to Washington University at St. Louis, where Arthur H. Compton was building up the physics department. Compton offered Thornton directorship of the new nuclear laboratory there, but Thornton turned down the offer. He also declined an offer of directorship of the Chalk River Laboratories in Canada. Instead, he returned to Berkeley in 1945 to head the work on the new cyclotron, the completion of which had been delayed by the war. Under a special arrangement between Lawrence and Robert Gordon Sproul, the president of the University of California, Thornton was made a professor of physics at the Radiation Laboratory. In the early post-war years, the 184-inch cyclotron would be at the forefront of physics, being particularly useful in the exploration of the meson. Thornton became a regular professor at the University of California in 1948, and started teaching courses in mechanics, and electricity and magnetism. He found he enjoyed teaching. Thornton became the assistant director of the Radiation Laboratory in 1954, associate director in 1959, and associate director of program and planning in 1967. He retired in 1972, but worked part-time at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory for another ten years, after which he returned to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as a consultant. His wife Betty died in 1974. In 1977 he married again, to Sigvor Hamre, the widow of Haakon Hamre, a professor of Scandinavian language and literature at Berkeley. He died in Berkeley on 28 September 1985. He was survived by his wife Sigvor, daughter Peggy and son Denis; his daughter Katy had died in a plane crash in 1966.

It is endemic to Western Ghats in India. This species was previously placed in the genus Platysticta, but recent phylogenetic studies has revealed that the genus Platysticta is actually confined to Sri Lanka. For the South Indian species, formerly known as Platysticta deccanensis, morphological and molecular analyses demonstrated that it does not belong to the Sri Lankan clade and a new genus Indosticta is erected to accommodate it. Description and habitat It is a medium sized damselfly with bluish-white face and black-capped brown eyes. Its thorax is cinnamon brown with a black mid-dorsal carina. Its wings are transparent with yellowish-red pterostigma framed in black nervures. Abdomen is dark-brown up to segment 7 and segments 8 to 9 are azure blue bordered below with black. Segment 10 is blackish-brown. Anal appendages are black. Female is similar to the male; but its thorax has a bit dark patches in the dorsum and the sides. There is a narrow ante-humeral pale blue stripe and another similar blue stripe bordering the black area of the mesepimeron. Abdomen is similar to the male; but segment 8 unmarked and segment 9 with a large oval pale blue dorso-lateral spot. It is known to occur close to Myristica swamps and streams with dense riparian vegetation. Laidlaw described it from the Kingdom of Cochin. Recent studies have found populations of this species in Kodaku too. Commonly found resting on ferns in dark shady spots in forests.

Dated to , the chalice was commissioned by King Bagrat III for the Bedia Monastery in Abkhazia. Only the bowl of the vessel is preserved and currently kept at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi.  History  The chalice was a donation by King Bagrat III and his mother, Queen Gurandukht, to the new church at Bedia, which was completed in 999. The base of the vessel was subsequently lost and restored in the 16th century at the behest of Germane Chkhetidze, Metropolitan Bishop of Bedia, as mentioned in a Georgian inscription. The item was preserved in the sacristy of the Ilori Church, when the historian Dimitri Bakradze visited it in 1865 and reported the danger of its being lost. The base then again disappeared. The surviving bowl was removed to Tbilisi, in the Treasure Chamber of the Georgian State Art Museum, now Georgian National Museum, in 1930.  Description  The bowl of the Bedia vessel is 14 cm high and 14 cm in diameter; it weighs 752 g. The piece is made of one sheet of gold, with all figures and details worked in repouss√©. The entire outer surface is framed and divided into 12 segments by a continuous arcade. The figures depicted are the enthroned Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin Hodegetria on the opposite side. Between them are standing figures of ten apostles, five on each side, holding rotuli in their hands. Christ is identified by a Greek inscription and all apostles by the Georgian texts; there is no inscription associated with the Virgin. The Georgian-language inscription just below the rim, in finely carved asomtavruli script, mentions King Bagrat and Queen Gurandukht. The Bedia chalice is notable for the orderly and rhythmic composition and decorative details which are endogenously Georgian, but exhibit some stylistic affinities with the contemporary Byzantine ivory icons and enameled chalices in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice. Yet, robust monumental effect of the artwork of the Bedia chalice is unparalleled.

Family Identity Hon‚Äôble Mr. Justice Iqbal Hameed ur Rahman is a scion of a noble family that has its roots in the legal fraternity since pre-partition of the Indian subcontinent. He hails from a very respectable Bengali Muslim family of Patna, India. His Grand father Khan Bahadur Dr. Dawdood-Ur-Rahman MB, FRCS was of aristocratic Bengali origin and a Bangla speaking person living in Patna, India and was the first Muslim Civil Surgeon of undivided Bengal, who secured his FRCS degree from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, London.

After the promulgation of Provisional Constitutional Order 2007, he was asked to take oath under the PCO. Like his courageous counterparts he stood for the rule of law in order to preserve the dignity and honor of his institution and the Constitution of Pakistan and refused to take oath under the PCO. He and his counterparts were subjected to an insurmountable mental anguish but no inducement or threat could deter him from his chosen path. He sacrificed his tenure of eleven years of judgeship at the altar of truth and rule of law with such dignity that the soul of his noble father would always be proud of him. He and his brother judges in the Lahore High Court ignited such flame in the heart of this nation that not only led to a great social awakening but also bound this society with the rule of law. In 2009, an unfortunate incident happened in Gojra in which certain members of the Christian Community were burnt alive by a mob. Mr.Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rahman was entrusted with One Man Tribunal of Inquiry in respect of Gojra incident in the year 2009.

Resignation During his tenure as Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court, few officers were appointed in the Islamabad High Court during the period 2011 and 2012, against which in adjudicating a reference application filed by the Islamabad High Court Bar association, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had come to a categorical conclusion that judges involved in the appointments have acted \\"in complete disregard of the mandate given by the Rules framed under Article 208 of the Constitution\\" and had been involved in \\"cherry picking by deliberately ignoring merits of the candidates.\\" The IHC Bar Association has taken very serious note of this matter, consequent to which Justice Hameedur Rahman tendered his resignation by writing resignation letter in his own hand on 23 October 2016, from the office of senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The reason although not disclosed in the resignation letter, yet it was presumed that he has voluntarily accepted the liability, since some of the appointment was made during his tenure, although the major appointments were made thereafter during the tenure of the next Chief Justice Mr. Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi. Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan (SCBAP) President Barrister Syed Ali Zafar welcomed and appreciated the resignation of Justice Iqbal Hameed-ur-Rahman as Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.https://dailytimes.com.pk/50166/judges- resignation-has-enhanced-scs-esteem/ Patriotism Being a Bengali speaking person, Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rahman and his father Chief Justice of Pakistan Mr. Justice Hamoodur Rahman did not support the Independence movement of Bangladesh in the year 1971, nor they opted for Bangladesh, rather remained stricter to the Patriotism for Pakistan.Due to their such patriotic attitude,the basic Bengali identity of them were practically disappeared in Pakistan and both of them are highly respected in Pakistan as patriotic Pakistani Citizen.

The Ambara church is one of the tourist destinations in Abkhazia. The area is reportedly increasingly being littered. Georgia has inscribed the church on its list of cultural heritage and treats it as part of cultural heritage in the Russian-occupied territories with no known current state of condition.

It is named after the Georgian king Bagrat, either Bagrat III or Bagrat IV, and traditionally dated to the late 10th or 11th century. The castle stands in ruins on a hill on the left bank of the Basla (Besleti) river, in the south- eastern portion of Sukhumi, measuring 55 x 27 m in total area. The surviving structures are walls, rising to 10-12 m in height, of an oval-shape edifice with a rectangular tower guarding the entrance gateway, which shows traces of tunnels. Archaeological digs, supervised by Mikhail Trapsh in the 1950s, revealed remains of fortified structures, wine jars, jugs, glazed pottery, and other items dating from the 12th to the 14th century. The naming and dating of the castle is based on a local legend recorded in the 19th century, but architectural evidence suggests the structure can be of a later date, serving as the seat of the eristavi of Tskhumi, as Sukhumi was known in the Middle Ages. The historian Yuri Voronov also conjectured that castle might have hosted the queen-regnant Tamar of Georgia during her stays in Abkhazia in the early 13th century. It also functioned as a shelter for the local elite, including the Shervashidze family, in case of danger. In the 16th century, when the town's chief settlement moved to the west, on the right bank of the river, the castle was abandoned and left to fall in ruins. Georgia has inscribed the castle on its registry of Cultural Monuments of National Significance and reported, in 2015, its condition as in an urgent need of conservation.

The name means \\"dirty\\" in Amharic. The site is located in the southaestern part of Addis Ababa. It has been in operation for about 50 years and, in 2014, was about 36 hectares but shrinking as the result of regulation. A community of hundreds of rubbish pickers lived and worked there. They were known as \\"scratchers\\" as they typically carried a metal hook to pry open the waste which was compressed and delivered by garbage trucks. In 2016, the local authority tried to close the site and relocate dumping to a new landfill site at Sendafa but opposition by local farmers caused the rubbish collectors to move back. In March 2017, a landslide at the site killed more than 113 people, as recovery continues the death toll is expected to rise. The country announced three day-national mourning, following the incident. Communications Minister, Negeri Lencho declared that 38 males and 75 females, lost their lives in this tragic event. One resident attributed the accident to construction work, as bulldozers were levelling the site for a biogas plant. A 50 (fifty) megawatt waste-to-energy plant is being built nearby at Reppie to burn rubbish to generate electricity. Operation Dumping of waste at Koshe landfill began in 1964, prior to that year, it was an unofficial site for burning dead animals. The landfill is located in Southwest Addis Ababa within the boundaries of Nifas Silk-Lafto and Kolfe Keranio. When Koshe became active, the surrounding area was sparsely populated and beyond the municipal master plan for Addis Ababa. Though, it was the only landfill in the capital city, few documented environmental studies were conducted or published for over 40 years. Koshe is not a fenced site and has an inadequate buffer between it and other land use activities such as farming and schools, exposing many residents to environmental and health risks. In addition, the area is open to temporary and permanent scavengers. The landfill hosts about 500 scavengers who sell recovered materials from the waste to businesses and farmers. The facility is being gradually phased out and replaced by a sanitary landfill in Oromia Special Zone, as of 2014, close to 17 hectares have been closed. Part of the land has been put to use including the construction of a ring road highway, siting of a proposed recycling center and a waste to energy project. In August 2016, protesting farmers blocked the pathway to the new landfill forcing the municipal government to direct solid waste disposal back to Koshe. Hazards Koshe's unstable garbage mounds regularly experience landslides of varying degrees of severity, most of them minor. One landslide at Koshe led to the deaths of over 113 people who lived in the dump. Another landslide on the 10 June 2019 killed an elderly man.

She told Isis Madrid of Public Radio International: \\"While I was shooting the documentary, I found myself in a government hospital burn ward.The things I saw in the ward left me forever changed. I had never witnessed so much misery all at once, I had never been surrounded by so much pain.

Mid-day , a newspaper in India had revealed how the NGO had collected donations under the pretext of helping the victims, but kept all or most of the money. After the report, the organisation pledged to give the victims their money. The Mumbai Police have finally booked the founder, Ria Sharma. Ria maintained her innocence through all statements given to Mid-day and after further investigation by online media agency, The Logical Indian, it was found that the newspapers facts didn't add up. https://thelogicalindian.com/fact-check/make-love-not-scars/ . Ria finally released a statement on her official Facebook handle with evidence of the newspapers unfactual reporting.

Its purpose was to promote the development of public libraries in rural areas through federal funding. It was passed by the 84th U.S. Congressional session as the H.R. 2840 bill, which the 34th President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law on June 19, 1956. To receive funding, states needed to submit a plan to the Commissioner of Education that demonstrated how the funds would be used, whether for library personnel, books, or equipment. Thus, making state and local governments prioritize the improvement of their libraries while also establishing their own initiatives and objectives. Since federal government was not favorably looked upon at the time, the law stated multiple times the state‚Äôs authority regarding any decisions toward the library‚Äôs goals, management, or collection. However, up until 1961, Indiana was the only state that did not accept federal funds. Governor Harold Handley believed that by accepting the funds, ‚ÄúHoosiers would be brainwashed with books handpicked by the Washington bureaucrats.‚Äù U.S. Representative John Brademas of Indiana vehemently disagreed. It was reported that Gov. Handley rejected approximately $700,000 to improve the library services. Overall, the LSA had a major positive impact on libraries throughout the rest of the country. And additional 5 million books and other informational and educational materials were secured for rural communities. Many libraries noted a 40% or more increase in book circulation as well, along with a 32% increase in interlibrary loans. Other accomplishments included 288 bookmobiles for rural communities and 800 new library staff members. Multitype and public library systems were being established due to the LSA as well. And when the Library Services and Construction Act became effective in 1964, the formation of regional and statewide library networks continued to grow. The LSA was set to expire in 1961, but plans were already in motion to prolong the act. On May 26, 1960, the Senate passed a five-year extension without a single opposing vote. Only a few years later, the Library Services and Construction Act would be introduced replacing the Library Services Act.

He won the Mavericks Big Wave Surf contest in 2009. In March 2017 he completed the first solo, unsupported stand- up paddle board (SUP) crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. He did it while supporting charitable organizations. He has also set other SUP world records. His efforts moved an obscure sport onto the forefront of many important media outlets. Background In February 2010, Bertish competed at the 2009/10 Mavericks Surf Contest near Half Moon Bay, Northern California, winning the $50,000 big-wave surf competition. Watched by 50,000 spectators, the contestants experienced waves in excess of . Bertish arrived at the competition without his equipment and had to borrow a board to compete. In 2016, a failed attempt at crossing the Atlantic on a stand-up paddleboard occurred. The boat was piloted by Nicholas Jarossay, a French citizen who was rescued a week into his trip. Solo Atlantic crossing In a 93-day trek, Bertish successfully completed a solo, unassisted and unaided crossing of the Atlantic Ocean on a stand up paddle board, going from Morocco to Antigua. The feat was the culmination of five years of preparation. On 6 December 2016, Bertish set out from a marina in Agadir, Morocco, in a custom-built stand-up paddle craft on a journey of and 120 days across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. His $120,000 craft was designed by Phil Morrison, a naval architect, and resembles a connected row-boat and a stand-up paddle board, called ImpiFish. It weighed , which Bertish now considers to have been \\"too light.\\" It had a \\"number of technological amenities such as a satellite phone, a radar device, a MacBook, a water maker\\" carrying the amount of fresh water he needed was impractical. On 9 March 2017, he arrived in Antigua at English Harbour becoming the first person to cross the Atlantic on a stand-up paddle board. He made the journey unsupported and unassisted in 93 days. Initially he wanted to continue to Florida, but due to forecasted poor weather made his landfall in Antigua. The craft was self-righting if it capsized, avoiding the possibility of turtling. Gear included a life raft, flares, and an emergency grab bag. An integral part of maintaining stability in adverse weather was the use of sea anchors. Bertish averaged a day, surpassing his planned daily. Paddling was mainly done at night to avoid sun exposure. The attempt was made in order to raise money for several South African charities to feed, school and provide medical operations for children and succeeded in raising $412,000. The charities include Signature of Hope Trust, the Lunchbox Foundation and Operation Smile. The attempt had been sponsored by the financial group Carrick Wealth. In addition to gaining the Guinness World Record for being the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a stand-up paddle board, Bertish also set another world record during the attempt by travelling the furthest distance solo, unsupported and unassisted over open ocean in a day of . In fact, he set at least three world records during the crossing; and promised to pay for a charitable surgery for each of them. Adventurer Previously he completed a 3¬Ω-day paddle and a \\"source to sea\\" run-paddle-bike descent of the Thames River, with an English Channel SUP bonus crossing. Unofficially and off the South African coast, he set the world record for 12-hour open ocean paddling, covering almost aided by \\"great downwind conditions.\\" The previous record was held by an American. Honours Bertish has been chosen, as one of 100 visionary people, to contributed a 250 word essay to be included in a 3D book.

Legislative status  According to the law, all pension payments are made from the Pension Fund of Ukraine. The Pension Fund of Ukraine monitors the target use of funds that go to payouts. The Pension Fund of Ukraine shall, in accordance with the established procedure, submit proposals to the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy of Ukraine on the issues of formation of the state pension policy and control the implementation of official legislative acts. Activities of the Pension Fund of Ukraine are subordinated and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine.  Pension reform  The implementation of pension reform proceeds through the gradual introduction of a three-tier pension system: * The first tier is a Solidarity system * The send tier is Mandatory Accumulation System * The third tier is Voluntary Non- State Pension Savings System The main objectives of the pension reform are: * to raise the living standards of pensioners; * to establish the dependence of the size of pensions on the numbers such as earnings and length of service; * to ensure the financial stability of the pension system; * to encourage citizens to save money on old age; * to create a more efficient and effective system of administrative management in pension provision. The three-tier pension system will allow the distribution of the three components of the risk associated with changes in the demographic situation (which is more sensitive to the solidarity system) and fluctuations in the economy and in the capital market (which is more experienced by the accumulation system). Such risk- republican sharing will make the pension system more financially balanced and sustainable, which will protect employees from lowering the total income after retirement.

History  The station opened on 28 August 1841 by the Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway. The station was situated on the A190 Station Road, south of the level crossing. After the footbridge subsided in 1940 due to a wartime barricade, all of the trains used the down platform. The principal goods traffic was bricks; this ceased in 1963. The station was closed to passengers on 27 June 1964 and closed completely on 7 June 1965. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle, Ashington and possibly a new terminus to the east, at , was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested that due to the short distance between the former stations at Seaton Delaval and only one, rather than both, of them should be reopened. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. The county council has, however, continued to develop the project, announcing an additional ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019, with the first passenger services potentially being introduced on the line in 2022. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. The revised plans appear to suggest that Seaton Delaval, rather than Seghill, has been selected for reopening but even on its own, Seaton Delaval has been excluded from the initial ¬£90 million phase and is instead proposed as part of Phase 2 of the project. In Phase 4 it is proposed to add a passing loop in the vicinity of the station. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transfroming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the first phase of the Newcastle to Ashington Northumberland Line project, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment.

One of the oldest churches in Abkhazia, it is a simple three-nave basilica built in the 6th century by Anchabadze dynasty. It was reconstructed in 1902. The Gagra church stands in the territory of the contemporaneous fortress known as Abaata, which was also built by Anchabadze dynasty in the 4th-5th AD ruling dynasty in Abkhazia ( Georgia) at the time. The fortress is now completely in ruins. It is built of blocks of rough ashlar stone, the main entrance is from the westerly located narthex. All three naves are connected with each other via doors. The main nave is lit through three windows in the southern wall and with one window, each on the western wall and in the altar. The church have many common architectural features with similar basilicas in eastern Georgia. The church was completely reconstructed in 1902 at the behest of Princess Eugenia Maximilianovna of Leuchtenberg, wife of Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian imperial family, who turned Gagra into a spa. On 9 January 1903 it was consecrated as the Church of Saint Hypatius. At the same time, the old fortress of Abaata was demolished to pave way to the construction of a hotel. In the Soviet era, the church building was used as a museum of old weaponry. The church underwent some renovation in 2007 and it was restored to Christian use in 2012.

A 14th-century fresco depicting Abraham and the Holy Trinity with a Georgian inscription. The Church of Dormition of Lykhny is a medieval Orthodox Christian church in the village of Lykhny in Abkhazia/Georgia, built in the 10th century. Its 14th-century frescoes are influenced by the contemporary Byzantine art and adorned with more than a dozen of Georgian and Greek inscriptions. The Lykhny church is a domed cross- in-square design, built of straight rows of well-refined ashlar stone. The small dome, with a low drum and a sloping roof, is based on four freely standing piers. The western portion of the building includes an upper gallery. The fa√ßades are simple, apertured with windows and marked with three protruding apses protruding from the east wall. There are traces of the 10th-11th-century wall painting, but the extant cycle of frescoes date to the 14th century. They are characterized by neatly colored, dynamic, and expressive paintings of somewhat elongated human figures. The antiquities of Lykhny, then also known as Souk-Su, were first studied and published, in 1848, by the French scholar Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset, who also copied several medieval Georgian and Greek inscriptions from the Lykhny church. Of note is the Georgian inscription, in the asomtavruli script, relating the apparition of Halley's Comet in 1066, in the reign of Bagrat IV of Georgia. Efforts at conservation have been launched by the de facto Abkhaz authorities in 2010. The works, according to Georgian specialists, carry the risk of authenticity infringement.

The Kamani Monastery is located at the village of Kamani in Abkhazia/Georgia, north of Sukhumi. The monastery building is a 1980s construction on the foundations of a medieval church. The locale of Kamani, also known as Komani, is associated in the local Abkhaz-Georgian legends with Saint John Chrysostom, who allegedly died there after being exiled from Constantinople to the Black Sea coast. In 1884, the Greek scholar Konstantinos Vrissis visited the area and conjectured that it was Kamani, not Comana Pontica, where John Chrysostom died and was initially buried. Only the foundation survived of a medieval stone monastic building, a hall church design without a protruding apse. In the 1880s, under the Russian rule, a Christian convent was founded there, but it fell in disuse with the arrival of the Soviet power in the region. In the late 1980s, the church was rebuilt through the efforts of the Abkhaz Yuri Anua. In 1990, Ilia II, Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia, consecrated the church. In July 1993, during the War in Abkhazia, the monastery was stormed by the Abkhaz separatist forces; Yuri Anua and the Georgian priest Andria Kurashvili were killed. In 2001, a group of Abkhaz monks returned to the Kamani monastery, which was transferred by the Sukhumi government, in 2011, in possession of the self-proclaimed Abkhazian Orthodox Church.

In 1900, the Shrine Bureau (Jinja kyoku) was created as a branch of the Home Ministry, and it was this organ that was responsible for the implementation of the policy. The aim of the policy was to reduce the political influence of Shinto, bringing the remaining shrines under government jurisdiction and making them easier to control. Within the first twenty years of the policy, 77,899 Shinto shrines were closed, despite considerable local opposition. The policy remained in effect until the end of World War II, although its greatest impact occurred in the first six years after its implementation in 1906; by 1912, the rate at which shrines were closed had fallen considerably.
