The film was released theatrically on 8 November 2019 With a budget= .  Plot Vikram Kapoor (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a renowned fashion designer, goes through a serious accident one night and one of his top models Sarah Brigenza (Shama Sikander) is also found dead on that night in what looks like a suicide. Vikram survives but is paralyzed and has to use a wheelchair in the rest of his life. During Vikram's absence, Radhika Nair (Adah Sharma), his girlfriend, takes over his fashion studio. Vikram returns home, where his father Pratap Kapoor (Rajit Kapur) and stepmother Romila Kapoor (Gul Panag) live and he left for years. Radhika also frequently visits his house to take care of Vikram. Police suspects Sarah did not die of suicide, but of murder, and they take Vikram as a prime suspect, because the gun that killed her found at the scene, belongs to Vikram's father Pratap, though Pratap had already reported its loss. Vikram is now meeting some accidents in his house that nearly killed him. The accidents however were arranged by his stepmother Romila, who wants herself and her blood daughter Nandini to succeed Pratap's assets. A flashback shows Sarah and Vikram had a one-night stand, after which Sarah, though engaged to Jimmy (Taher Shabbir) already, wanted to be Vikram's girlfriend. After being refused, upset Sarah shot herself in an underground garage. Vikram was shocked and realized no witness would prove his innocence if Sarah was found dead there. So he loaded her \\"body\\" in the car and drove her to her house, where her dead body was later found. At the present night, Vikram accidentally sees Romila's ex-boyfriend Narang Kapoor (Sudhanshu Pandey) sneaks into his house to secretly meet Romila, implying that the two had planned together those accidents in the house that nearly killed Vikram. Moreover, he has a strong feeling that someone around is secretly monitoring him. Jimmy is another prime suspect of Sarah's death because he was seen in CCTV footage escaping from Sarah's house, right after gunshot was heard and soon Sarah's body was found. However, Jimmy is on the run from cops and some parts of the CCTV footage videos in Sarah's house that night is still missing. The existing part of CCTV footage also shows Sarah was alive after Vikram drove her home, but the Jimmy shows up there, and learns they have an affair. Jimmy and Vikram then had a fight, short before the gunshot was heard. Pratap, Romila and Nandini leave for a cruise trip, leaving Vikram at home alone. The night they left, a masked man, apparently Narang, enters Vikram's house to attack and kill him. Paralyzed Vikram is trying his best to escape from him, and calls his girlfriend Radhika for help, who later arrives. However, Vikram is finally caught by him and Radhika cannot save him because she cannot defeat the attacker. Police Inspector Roy arrives Vikram's house at the crucial moment, and shoots the masked attacker. To everyone's shock, he is not Narang, or Jimmy, but his father Pratap, who is supposed to be in a cruise trip with family. Roy now reveals the story: Sarah called Pratap to inform him that she found his lost gun, asking him to visit her house to claim it. When Pratap arrived, he witnessed Vikram and Jimmy fighting each other, so he shot Sarah to frame Vikram, the two then escaped from the house to avoid suspicion. Roy learnt this only after he arrested Jimmy, who told him this story. Pratap did not go to the cruise trip, but instead, found an excuse and returned home.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.1 History In 1830, Benjamin Drake, his wife Maria, and several of their children moved to this site from St. Clair County. The family was the first Euro-American pioneers to settle in Oshtemo Township. The family constructed a log cabin near where the present house stands and began farming. More settlers joined them, and in 1833 the constructed the area's first school on the Drake property. By 1839, there were nearly 70 new residents in the township. In about 1852 constructed a portion of what is now the current farmhouse. In 1882, a major fire destroyed most of the house. It was reconstructed using the remaining walls, but in a substantially different form. Benjamin Drake died the next year; his wife Maria followed in 1886. Their oldest child, Jane, inherited the farm and lived in the house until her own death in 1899. Jane willed the farm jointly to her only surviving sibling, George, and their niece Elizabeth Waterman Fuller. In 1908, the farm was sold to Thomas and Mary Stewart. They continued farming, and left the property to their daughter Helen Stewart after their death. Helen Stewart sold roughly half of the property to be developed, and after her death willed much of the remaining property to Western Michigan University, with a small section including the house, and farm buildings going to Kalamazoo College. Western Michigan and Kalamazoo College sold the land to developers. In 2004, the Drake farmhouse was slated for demolition. However, Oshtemo Township purchased the house, carriage barn, and surrounding property. By 2017, additional property was added. The house was also substantially restored. As of 2018, a 26-acre park was planned around the home. Description The Drake Farmstead consists of a 2-1/2 story, brick farmhouse, a 1-1/2 story frame carriage barn, and the remains of a larger barn located in a large yard with a long, tree-lined entry drive. The house itself reflects three periods of construction: the original design, the 1882 reconstruction, and later, twentieth century renovations. The present house is an upright and wing design, constructed of brick with a fieldstone foundation and a steeply pitched gable roof covered with asphalt shingles. An addition extends to the rear. The style of the house is suggestive of the Late Victorian period when it was reconstructed. The windows are double-hung, wood, six-over-six sash units with stone lintels and sills. The upright section contains a formal double-door entry framed by a slightly projecting square- plan columns and a projecting gable. A second entry is in the wing section, sheltered by a single-story shed-roofed porch with square columns. The carriage house, located off one corner of the farmhouse, was likely constructed in the 1920s or 1930s. It is a 1-1/2 story frame structure, measuring roughly fifty feet by twenty-five feet, and is covered with vertical wood siding. It has a gable roof covered in asphalt shingles. Near the carriage bhouse is a cast concrete livestock watering trough and the concrete and stone foundation remains of former barns.

The National Afrikaans Literary Museum and Research Centre (, NALN) is a central archive for material and information on the history, development, and scope of literature, music, and drama in the Afrikaans language. The NALN was founded in 1973 by the Free State provincial government and is based in Bloemfontein, South Africa. It operates as a nonprofit organization. The hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 - 16:00. The NALN collection includes an estimated three quarters of a million items. These include books, manuscripts, magazines, newspapers, clippings, sheet music, posters, and programs, an audiovisual collection, and other unique artifacts. In addition, furniture and other effects of writers and other literary personalities can be viewed here. In front of the museum is a garden where several dignitaries have planted trees over the years. Busts of writers, musicians, and dramatists have been installed under the trees. Building NALN is located in the Old Free State Government Building. The building was commissioned by President Johannes Brand to house the various government departments of the Orange Free State government. The first story's front facade was designed by Richard Wocke and the keystone was laid by President Brand on May 31, 1875. In 1895, the second story was built, designed by Johannes Egbertus Vixseboxse. The remainder of the building was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, architect of the Union Buildings in Pretoria, and was completed in 1906. On October 28, 1908, the original building was destroyed in a fire. From 1909 to 1911, it was largely restored based on Baker's blueprint. Improvements, especially in the facade and tower, were the work of the government architect F. Taylor. The tower was, among other things, narrower and 10.5 m higher than the original one, and was fitted with a rounded crown. From 1877 to 1902, the Old Government Building was the headquarters of the Government of the Orange Free State. The Free State Volksraad met in the Third Council Chamber from 1877 to 1893. Afterwards, it remained the seat of the Government of the Orange River Colony, and in 1911 became the provincial headquarters of the Orange Free State. In 1972, the building was declared a national heritage site. History The Human Sciences Research Council began mounting exhibits in the building and using it as an archive for documents on language and literature in 1970. The document archive developed into the Literary Museum of Bloemfontein. On October 9, 1972, the lawyer Gabriel Francois van Lingen Froneman, the Administrator of Free State, announced the establishment of the NALN. On March 24, 1973, the NALN was officially opened by Johannes Petrus van der Spuy, at the time Minister of National Education. Since 1996, the NALN has brought renewed focus to the works of black and Cape Coloured authors in Afrikaans and expanded its collection of same. In 1994, the NALN began campaigning for a literary museum for Sotho (along with Afrikaans, one of the country's 11 official languages). The museum was announced in 1999, and was opened in 2006 with the help of NALN staff and funding. Gradual declines in priority and funding necessitated a downsizing in 2007, in which a great deal of professional expertise was lost. Departmentally, the institution's name was changed to the Afrikaans Literary Museum (ALM), and is now operating as a local institution in Free State province. A failed attempt to renovate the building led to a six-year disruption of activities starting in 2002. Exhibits covering 1 500 m¬≤ were reworked to portray Afrikaans literature from a post-1994 perspective.

It is located around 22 km south of Bloemfontein, South Africa. After the Second Boer War, he tended to operate from here as a leader and adviser to the Afrikaner people.  History  President Steyn bought the farm in 1896 and named it Onze Rust. During his Presidency and the War, he did not live there, but after his return from Europe in 1905, he settled there. After the war, President Steyn and his family traveled Europe to obtain treat his botulism. During their exile, Afrikaners decided to enlarge the farm. An encouraged Steyn invited out-of- work Free Staters to work on the building. No hard materials were used for construction. The walls were built with red, crude stone and long unplastered, and the woodwork was pine. The new house, with its large porch where Steyn met with visiting dignitaries, was very spacious. Onze Rust became Steyn's headquarters and was open to the public. They received many visitors. After Steyn's death in 1916, his widow continued to live in the house for thirty years.  Contemporary appearance  Steyn's grandson, Justice MT Steyn, made several alterations - for instance shuttering windows for more light and purchasing furniture and utensils for Onze Rust. The old homestead in the shade of the giant trees remains similar in appearance to what it was when President Steyn lived there, and the pomegranate and apricot trees planted by Steyn himself remain. The walls are covered with family portraits and photographs of friends. The bathroom still features an old pink bath made specially for President Steyn after his illness; the bedrooms have four-poster canopy beds and antique lamps; and the Victorian lounge contains family heirlooms. In the kitchen is a shelf where many of Mrs. Rachel Isabella Steyn often laid cake tins and kitchen utensils. The historic study is largely in line with its appearance in the President's time. The large old leather reading chair, or invalid chair, that the paralyzed president used, is still there. A photo of First Lady Steyn hangs in a place of honor on the mantel. There are also photographs of the Free State President and other leaders, such as Gen. Koos de la Rey and Paul Kruger.

It is typically torn or cut into small disks for eating. It is not flavored and thus need to be eaten with another accompanying dish, usually seafood. The most popular accompaniments include lat√¥ salads, kima (giant clams), and siagol (a stew made from shark meat and turmeric). It serves as a replacement for rice, after the introduction of cassava to the Philippines from South America by the Spanish during the colonial period. Similar and related staple dishes are biamban and sianglag. Biamban (or bamban) is made from steamed tapioca flour cylinders wrapped in banana or palm leaves. Sianglag (also known as tompe, tompek, tinompeh, or anggang) is made from grated cassava that is fried until yellowish. Both also replace rice as an accompaniment to savory dishes.

Individuals with this condition exhibit persistent vacuolation of granulocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Jordans' anomaly is associated with neutral lipid storage diseases. Genetics Jordans' anomaly is a characteristic finding in Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome and other neutral lipid storage diseases. The anomaly is associated with mutations in the PNPLA2 gene, which produces the enzyme adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and the ABHD5 gene, which encodes a cofactor of ATGL. These mutations lead to defective triglyceride breakdown and accumulation of lipid droplets in cells throughout the body. Composition The vacuoles of Jordans' anomaly contain neutral lipids that stain positive with Sudan staining techniques. History The anomaly was first described in 1953, by Dr. G. H. Jordans, who identified abnormal vacuolation in the white blood cells of two brothers with congenital muscular dystrophy. Using special staining, Jordans demonstrated that the vacuoles contained lipids. In 1966, two further cases of persistent lipid vacuoles were reported in sisters presenting with ichthyosis. The Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, comprising Jordans' anomaly, ichthyosis and lipid storage abnormalities, was defined in the 1970s, definitively connecting Jordans' anomaly to lipid storage disease. Jordans' anomaly was linked to genetic mutations affecting triglyceride metabolism in 2006.

The area then went through several industrial stages, such as pottery, before becoming overrun with pig farming and other \\"noxious\\" trades, all of whom were required to move out from their former inner city locations. This gave rise to area's nickname of \\"The Pigs and the Potteries\\". The area became known for appalling living conditions; in the mid-19th century, it fell into disuse and disrepair. By the late 19th century Notting Dale began to be developed for residential purposes, and also became known for its Irish Gypsy community. It is now home to a mix of public and private housing.

It is a remake of Destroy All Humans! (2005), the fifth installment in the Destroy All Humans! franchise, and the first entry since Path of the Furon (2008). The game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on July 28, 2020. A Stadia version was announced, but does not yet have an official release date. Gameplay The game is played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Cryptosporidium 137 (\\"Crypto\\" for short), an alien who arrives on Earth in 1950s America to harvest human DNA. Crypto is equipped with a vast arsenal of alien weapons such as the Zap-O-Matic and Anal Probe, to defeat enemies. He also has superhuman skills such as psychokinetic powers and the ability to disguise himself as humans. Crypto can use a jetpack to quickly navigate the environment. He can also command the flying saucer, which is equipped with a death ray to kill opponents. Players can perform movements such as gliding and dashing, and they can chain actions together such as shooting enemies while levitating them. The game introduces the Focus Mode, which allows players to lock onto other enemies. Crypto is protected by a shield, which informs players the direction of hostile attacks. The game features six sandbox locations which can be explored freely. Each location offers unique challenges for players to complete. Development A team of 60 people in Black Forest Games served as the game's developer. The original game's dialogue and humor remained intact, though the team enhanced them by updating the character models and cutscenes and introducing motion capture. Instead of rerecording the lines, the team used the audio from the original game and improved its quality for the remake. The game also includes a mission named \\"Lost Mission of Area 42\\" that was scrapped during the development of the original game. Black Forest considered developing the remake as a \\"natural continuation\\" of their work after finishing the development of Fade to Silence as they learned more about utilizing the technology and designing large, open areas. THQ Nordic acquired the intellectual property rights from THQ in 2013. In 2017, the firm reaffirmed that the company realized the demand for a new game in the series and added that they were exploring options to revitalize the franchise. The game was officially announced on June 7, 2019. An extended gameplay demo was launched at E3 2019. It is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In August 2019, Google announced that the game will also be available for Stadia.

The machine was often used in racing. History MV Augusta started making lightweight motorcycles in 1946. In 1948, a 125 cc class was added to the Italian national motorcycle racing championship (Campionato Italiano di Velocit√†). MV produced a 3 speed two-stroke machine to compete in this class, the 125 \\"Valenza\\". This was superseded in 1949 by the 125 \\"4 velocita\\" (4 speed). For 1950, the improved 125 \\"Motore Lungo\\" was introduced, which produced 12 bhp @ 9000 rpm. Details The term \\"long engine\\" derives from the elongated crankcase in front of the cylinder, which housed a special Magneti Marelli magneto. The previous model, the 125 \\"4 velocita\\", was retrospectively known as the \\"short crankcase\\" to differentiate it from the \\"long crankcase\\". The engine was an air-cooled single-cylinder two-stroke with a bore and stroke of 53 √ó 56 mm giving a displacement 123.5 cc. The compression ratio was 9:1, and the engine was fed by a Dell'Orto SS 25 A carburetor. A Wet multi-plate clutch was driven by gears from the crankshaft, and a four-speed gearbox sent drive to the rear wheel by chain. The MV Agusta had a double cradle frame and girder forks. At the rear there was a swinging arm with friction dampers. Drum brakes were fitted front and back, 190 mm diameter at the front and 160 mm at the rear. Two versions of the bike were made: the road version, complete with lights, and the sports version, called the \\"competizione\\" (competition) model. Racing The machine was especially popular in the national 125 cc racing class, where its characteristics of competitiveness and low price appealed to the needs of those who were beginning their career as a rider, and it became the most popular sports bike of the time.

Politics  Gunnar Sandelin published his first article criticizing the nature of Swedish migration policy in 2008 in Dagens Nyheter. Sandelin has published five articles in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Samh√§lle with content relating to the irresponsible migration policy of Sweden. G√∂teborgsposten published an article on Sandelin saying that \\"it is time to change course in the question of asylum immigration.\\" On May 5, 2019, Sandelin published an article in Det Goda Samh√§llet where he writes of how Jan Guillou published two articles denoting Sandelin as \\"xenophobic\\". Nya Tider published an article written by Sandelin where he states that 500,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Sweden between 2017 and 2021. In an article by Norwegian newspaper Samtiden, Sandelin warned of an increase in crime due to the migration of young men from violent regions with a failed state. In 2011, Aftonbladet published an article where Sandelin reported that he had been denied a job at Statistiska Centralbyr√•n (Swedens Statistics Agency) because he had the \\"wrong opinion\\". Sandelin reported the agency to the Justitiekanslern (Chancellor of Justice) for a violation of freedom of speech. The report was denied. In 2013, Dagens Nyheter published a marketing article about Sandelin's book Invandring och m√∂rkl√§ggning where it was criticized as being racist by Alexandra Pascalidou and state researcher Ulf Bjereld. Peter Woldoraski, editor in chief of Dagens Nyheter at the time, stated that he had done fact-checking before publication. On November 2, 2018, Svensk Webbtelevision released a video interview with Sandelin where he spoke of the total amount of Sweden's asylum seekers and whether it follows the United Nations minimum. In 2013, he published an article on Swedish news site Newsmill where he stated that Sweden does not have the capacity to handle its current level of migration. According to Ivar Arpi at Svenska Dagbladet, Sandelins books ended up on the leader charts after publication.

Early life  Anna Br√ºnn was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Szendro, Hungary, which at the time had a total of 4,000 residents. Because the small town only had 40 Jewish families, Anna felt the presence of anti-semitism while growing up. = Holocaust = When German Army took over Hungary in 1944, Jews in Szendro were quickly identified, forced to wear yellow stars, and were sought out for extermination. Anna's two brothers were sent to forced labor camps, while she and the rest of her family were sent to Auschwitz. Her two brothers died at the camps, and the Germans killed her father and extended family when they arrived at Auschwitz in June 1944. However, Anna and her mother survived deportation, Auschwitz, ghetto imprisonment, and the Parschnitz labor camp. The two returned to Hungary in July 1945.  Life after the Holocaust  Upon returning to Hungary, Anna finished high school and her mother ran an orphanage for Jewish children whose parents did not come back from the Holocaust. She was reunited with Paul Ornstein, whom she had met several years before and who had also survived the Holocaust. The two married in March 1946, and the two of them escaped Hungary into West Germany and enrolled in medical school there. = Medical training = After earning their medical degrees in 1952 from Heidelberg University School of Medicine, where some of their classmates were Nazi soldiers, Anna and Paul immigrated to the United States. The two are also graduates of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis.  Medical career  Ornstein served as a long-time Professor and Emerita Professor of Child Psychiatry at University of Cincinnati Medical School and later as a Lecturer in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

She and her husband also co-founded and was the Co-Director of the International Center for the Study of Psychoanalytic Self-Psychology. At the University of Cincinnati, Anna and Paul were instrumental in developing and leading the self psychology movement, \\"a post-Freudian method developed by Heinz Kohut, which stresses empathy and a relational approach in order to enhance the bond between patient and therapist and provide an analytic cure.\\" They worked very closely with Kohut. Ornstein has written over 100 publications that cover a wide range of topics, including the interpretive process in psychoanalysis, psychoanalytic psychotherapy, child psychotherapy, treatment of children and families, and recovery after traumatic experiences.  Holocaust education  Ornstein is an educator on the Holocaust and talks to universities, secondary schools, organizations, synagogues, and groups around the world about the Holocaust, her experiences, and anti-Semitism. She especially has a presence within the Boston area and has spoken to students at colleges including Tufts University, Northeastern University, and Brandeis University. She has been interviewed by The Washington Post, featured in The Jewish Journal, interviewed on Boston's National Public Radio station WGBH, and featured in numerous other publications. She also served as a staff member of Facing History and Ourselves and the Terezin Music Foundation. In 2004, she published her memoir, My Mother‚Äôs Eyes: Holocaust Memories of a Young Girl, a collection of short stories of her life during the war.  Awards  Ornstein has been the recipient of numerous awards, related to both her work in medicine and in Holocaust education: * American Psychiatric Association's Distinguished Psychiatrist Lecturer Award (1989) * Rosenberry Award for Dedication to the care of children (1991) * University of Cincinnati Award for Excellence in Research and Scholarship (1996) * American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs Special Presidential Commendation (2000) * Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute's Arthur R.

In 1995 it was declared a National Cultural Monument of the Czech Republic.  Construction-historical development  Church exterior The history and development of the church are inherently connected with the two noble families - the Rosenbergs and the Schwarzenbergs, who made ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov their settlement town and the church of St. Vitus thus represented the main sanctuary of the Rosenberg dominion and the Duchy of Krumlov. The church was rebuilt several times during the rule of the Eggenbergs. The first church built at its present location was founded in 1309. The first presbytery was built in 1317 by Peter I of Rosenberg and in 1340 it was rebuilt under the leadership of Master Linhart. However, the main and monumental reconstruction was initiated during the reign of Rosenberg Henry III. Indeed, the original church was not able to accommodate enough believers of the ever-growing settlement town, and it was, therefore, necessary to build a new church. The current building dates back to 1407 to 1438, while the foundations of the original church were used and, for example, the nave masonry dates back to the second half of the 14th century. We know from the preserved contract between the pastor Hostislav and Master Jan that it was explicitly stated that eight columns should be used to support sexpartite vaulting according to the pattern of the church of Sts. Jilj√≠ in Milevsko and the net vault inspired the cathedral of St. Vitus in Prague by Petr Parl√©≈ô. Although Master Jan Stanƒõk, a member of the Prague Stonemason Family, started the construction, he did not continue to participate in it for unknown reasons. The new church was consecrated by the Passau bishop Leonard von Laiming in 1439. View from street Before 1500, an organ loft was built and another major intervention was the construction of a massive Rosenberg mausoleum and a new altar with the Ro≈æmberk rider (coat of arms). However, both elements were gradually removed at the urging of the local Jesuits. Further major expansion occurred between 1725-1726 when ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov became the seat of the Schwarzenbergs. They built a new chapel of St. John of Nepomuk, the guardian of the House and the Dominium. The Chapel also had a so- called Heart Tomb, where the hearts of the Krumlov dukes were deposited The last important stage was a drastic neo-Gothic reconstruction in the 19th century when Baroque elements were removed and, unfortunately, many elements of the Pre-Baroque. Thus, in 1893‚Äì1894, the original Baroque onion dome tower was removed and replaced by the current Neo-Gothic tower. The church was then restored in 1899‚Äì1900. A thorough interior repair and equipment repair was carried out in 1936.  Chapel of St. Jerome (1389‚Äì1787)  Czech and German- speaking residents lived side by side since the foundation of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov. Since the sermon was preached in Czech, German believers began to preach the Rosenbergs sermons in German. For this purpose, the Chapel of St. Jerome, which existed at the church in Kosteln√≠ Street since 1389, served until the German sermon in 1602 was moved to the Church of St. Jo≈°t. The chapel was desecrated during the period of the secularization of the monarchy and sold in 1787.  Cemetery  Until 1585 the church was partially surrounded by a cemetery. However, due to a lack of space after a severe plague, it was moved to today's City Park to St. Martin's Chapel.  Building description  = Interior = The building is a three naval hall with a long presbytery with a pentagonal ending, a tower on the axis of the western facade, a rectangular sacristy, resurrection chapels and St. John of Nepomuk, and an entrance hall with an entrance portal on the north side. Nave vaulting In the Milevian net vault ( named after a special type of vault in the St. Giles church in Milevsko) of the presbytery, the ribs are supported by the cylindrical profile supports. The ribs are terminated at the lower edge of the windows by pyramidal brackets. In the ending behind the altar is a simple saddle portal. The entrance to the northern sacristy is also through the saddle portal. The extensions end at the bottom edge of the windows with pyramidal brackets. On the north wall (to the left of the altar) is a valuable sanctuary from the year 1500 - made of stone, richly decorated. Behind the altar in the apse is a simple saddle portal. The northern sacristy is vaulted with a variation of the Milevian net vault from 1425. The ribs extend from figural consoles. The space on the first floor above the sacristy has sexpartite vaulting with pyramidal brackets. The southern sacristy is from 1637 and it is vaulted with three cross vaults with stucco ribs; upstairs is a flat-ceilinged oratory from the second half of the 18th century. The presbytery is segregated from the main nave by an ogive; only the upper arch seems vigorous, the ribs are more delicate alongside the canopies in which the sculptures are embedded. In the western part, there is a remarkable late Gothic triforium, supported by pillars of columns. The space under the triforium is vaulted with a net vault. The entrance to the triforium is lined with a saddle portal from 1510. Aisle vaulting The three-aisles hall church is carried by four pairs of pillars, alternately in the outline of octagonal and four-leafed pillars. Each column is carrying a statue of a saint on a corbels, the two columns nearest to the altar are decorated by a statue of Mother Mary and the Saint Vitus, both statues have canopy above them. The main nave has a St Vitus net vault type, in the main nave with stone ribs, in the side aisles are used ribs made of brick. The aisles are vaulted with cross rib vault. The ribs pass through the walls without capitals turning into a rounded fine pillar that extends from the ground. The northern portal is Gothic, richly profiled, dating from about 1410. The wooden carved doors are from the late 17th century. The anteroom in front of him was vaulted in 1900. Two chapels are added to the church. The Baroque Chapel of St. John of Nepomuk from 1725 built by A. E. Martinelli is rectangular, semi-circular. The Chapel of the Resurrection is originally Gothic, in the 18th century it was rebuilt in Baroque style (eg. rid of ribs) and in 1777 it was painted by Franti≈°ek Jakub Proky≈°. The two chapels are entered from the nave by semicircular arches.Organ loft = Furnishings and Interior Decoration = * Gothic fresco of St. Catherine on the north wall * Valuable figural frescoes on the north wall * On the South Wall - a fresco- illustration of the legend of St. Vitus * Valuable altar from the early Baroque period * Rococo side altar of St. Paul * Other Neo-Gothic altars * Rococo Department * Valuable tombstones and epitaphs of the Renaissance = Exterior = Almost the whole church masonry is covered in white plaster except the visible pier-butters extending from the south and the north walls, the corner masonry (for reinforcing the structure) and some minor decorations such as the window ledge lining the whole church. Most noticeable is the bell tower in west with a pyramid roof. The tower is placed axial.  Tombs of Krumlov rulers  = The Rosenberg Mausoleum = After the death of the penultimate ruler of the Rosenberg house of Wilhelm von Rosenberg in 1592, a tomb was built in the middle of the presbytery and a Rosenberg emblem (a rider) was placed above the main altar. The size of the tomb and its placement right in front of the altar had long been eyesore for the local Jesuits, who pointed out that the former ruler of the Dominicum had been compared to God. Above all, however, the tomb interfered with mass. The Rosenberg rider was removed in 1621, but the last wife of Wilhelm , Polyxena, prevented further demolition. The tomb was completely removed again in 1670, but it was totally expelled by Duke of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov at that time, Jan Kristi√°n I. The final removal of the above-ground part of the tomb was only allowed during the Josephine reforms in 1783. The pewter coffins of William and Anne of Baden were replaced with oaken ones and laid back in the underground cellar. The above-ground part was dismantled, the columns were subsequently used to build a canopy for the baptistery, and the tombstones of William and Anne Mary were first set in front of the altar, then attached to the Chapel of Sts. John of Nepomuk. In the tomb of Wilhelm von Rosenberg was placed the body of the 3rd Duke of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov, Jan Christian I of Eggenberg, however, the remains were later removed and transported to Graz, where it was buried in the family tomb of the Eggenbergs. = Northern entrance portal with vestibule along with Rosenberg emblem. = The last wish of Eleonora Amalia, the wife of the first Duke of Krumlov from the Schwarzenberg family, Prince Adam Francis, was to rest in the newly built Chapel of St. John of Nepomuk. Her son, Prince and Duke Joseph I. Adam fulfilled her wish. After a spectacular procession, when her body was placed in an ordinary coffin to show her sympathy for the poor, was stored in the chapel. At the same time, however, a small cellar in the left side wall of the chapel was carved into which the hearts of both of Joseph's parents - Eleonora Am√°lie and Adam Franti≈°ek - were placed side by side. Thus the tradition began when the hearts of the Krumlov dukes and their wives were stored in this small tomb. The tomb of hearts is covered with a plate of black marble, which carries the Latin text: Here are stored the hearts of Adam and his wife Eleonora, princes of Schwarzenberg and dukes of Krumlov. In 1745, Josef had this made out of love for his parents. Above the board is the emblem of Alliance connecting Schwarzenberg and Lobkowicz. The above-ground tomb was designed in the form of an altar. The content of the \\"heart tomb\\" is known from the watercolours paintings of the engineer Josef Langweil, who drew it in 1834. The Habsburgs in the Augustinian church in Vienna also have a similar tomb of hearts (German Herzgruft).

The chimney also marks a notable waypoint on the South Telford Heritage Trail. Measuring high, construction of the chimney was completed in 1873. Stirchley Chimney pictured in 2015  History  In 1790 Thomas Botfield began the construction of an ironworks on the site, consisting of two blast furnaces, a forge, and a mill. The site was opened in 1828 and later expanded in order to produce bricks in 1838. In 1856, control of the site was granted to the Old Park Iron Company. Following the demise of the Old Park Iron Company, the blast furnaces were leased to the Wellington Iron & Coal Company, yet the company folded shortly after in 1877. It was during this tenure that the Stirchley Chimney was constructed. The blast furnaces continued to operate until 1885 until they were taken over by Wrekin Chemical Works in 1886, when the plant was converted in order to produce tar, sulphur, lime salt, wood naphtha and charcoal. Production at the site ceased in 1932. From 1923 until 1935 the Tarslag company purchased the slag mounds surrounding the chimney in order to use the refuse for the purpose of road building. The Tarmac company continued to remove slag from the site until 1964.  Recent restoration  The creation of Telford in 1969 led to the purchase of the site by the New Town Development Corporation.The decision was made to retain the Stirchley Chimney as a permanent reminder of the industry which once dominated the area. The chimney and the area around it was recently refurbished following years of neglect. The chimney now boasts information boards explaining its history to visitors. In 2020 work began to repoint the chimney with lime mortar. Work was suspended as a result of the UK Coronavirus lockdown. When the repointing resumed in May 2020 it was discovered that the chimney had become home to a nest of kestrels.

Early life and education  Fay Birdie Irving was born on August 15, 1918 in Bridgeport, Connecticut to Mollie Feldman and Alexander Ajolo Irving, a Russian-Jewish emigree. She graduated from Warren Harding High School as valedictorian in 1935. After high school, she became a women's fashion buyer and in 1941 married Burton Knopp. Together they had two children, Sari and Connecticut politician Alex Knopp. She studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California, Los Angeles.  Career  In 1939, she attended a Quaker peace demonstration as a Gandhian pacifist. In 1955, Knopp began visiting conscientious objectors of the Vietnam War in prison. In 1962, she traveled to Geneva, Switzerland as part of the Women Strike for Peace delegation, protesting the effects of nuclear testing on children's health. Also that year, Knopp became a Quaker serving as a prison visitor in the Federal penitentiary system through her designation as a \\"minister of record\\", and in 1968 co-founded Prisoner Visitation and Support with Bob Horton to further that work. In 1974, she founded the Safer Society Program and was the director until 1993. The program's goal was to offer sex offenders treatment through an international referral system to break the cycle of behavior rather than punishment. In 1976, Knopp founded the Prison Research Education Action Program and published the book Instead of Prisons: A Handbook for Abolitionists. The book includes three goals for abolitionists: prohibit the building of new prisons, reduce prison populations, and move away from incarceration as a solution. She was also director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia.

The one and a half story structure was built between 1803 and 1813, and is one of the only surviving colonial structures in St. Augustine.  History  = First Spanish Period and British Period = The first known owner of the lot is Antonio Jose Rodriguez, as listed on Juan Josef Elixio de la Puente's 1764 map of St. Augustine. In the same year, St. Augustine was transferred from Spanish to British ownership, and Jesse Fish was charged with finding a buyer for the lot. He sold it, along with the adjacent Rodriguez- Avero-Sanchez house, to Joseph Dyason in 1768. Prior to the sale, there were two small tabby houses on the lot, but they were demolished before the sale was finalized. = Second Spanish Period to Flagler Era = When the Spanish regained control of Florida in 1783, Dyason's property was reclaimed by the Spanish crown and was under the stewardship of Governor Juan Quesada. He sold it to royal caulker Don Juan Sanchez in 1791, and when Sanchez died in 1803 his widow Maria sold the lot to Mallorcan sailor Juan Paredes. He began construction on the home that year. It is notable in that the home's north wall is flush with the wall of the neighboring Rodriguez-Avero-Sanchez house. Paredes lived in the home with his wife and daughter until his death in 1813. The property was then sold to Pedro Fucha, who only had it for a short time before he sold it to Esteban Arnau. The house remained in the Arnau family until they were foreclosed on by George Eastman in 1895. = 20th Century = Jeweler James Dodge purchased the home in 1900. St. George Street had become primarily commercial property in the Flagler Era, and Dodge operated a jewelry store and curiosity shop out of the property. In the early 20th century, it was billed to tourists as The Oldest House in America and being built in 1565, though it was built much later. Dodge died in 1934 and his widow Emma sold the house to the St. Augustine Historical Society.  Architecture  The Paredes- Dodge house is notably one of the only surviving colonial structures in St. Augustine. It represents many characteristic features of colonial Spanish architecture in St. Augustine, including being set directly onto the street and being built out of coquina and plastered in stucco. The original building was only two rooms and served as a private residence, but was added onto over the years to include two more rooms towards the back of the home. The Paredes- Dodge House shares a wall and a chimney with the Rodriguez-Avero-Sanchez house. A second entry door was added to the building in the late 1800s, probably to increase access to shoppers. The building was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in ___.  Restoration  The St. Augustine Historical Society acquired the property in 1934 and began efforts to preserve the building in the late 1940s. Structural beams were added to the interior and exterior, and a kitchen and bathroom were installed on the second floor. The Historical Society sold it to the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board in 1988. When the Preservation Board was abolished in 1997, it became the property of the state.  Present Day  Today the Paredes-Dodge House is owned by the State of Florida and managed on its behalf by UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc., a direct-support organization of the University of Florida.

History Isen moved to Torrance with his family in 1913. He went on to graduate from Torrance High School in 1924 and the University of Southern California Law School, being admitted to the State Bar of California in 1930. In 1933, Isen opened his own law office in Torrance. Isen petitioned the city council to become the city police judge in 1934 instead of city attorney Charles T. Rippy; Isen had gathered 437 signatures and volunteered to till the position without pay. In 1935, Isen led a group who circulated petitions calling for the recall of Mayor Scott Ludlow and three city councilmen. He was elected to the Torrance City Council in 1954. The Council appointed him mayor in 1955. A special election held prior to 1958 changed the structure of the government; the size of the Council was increased to seven members and the office of the mayor became directly elected. Isen announced his candidacy for the mayoral race in February 1958. He was subsequently re-elected in 1962 and 1966, but lost to Ken Miller in 1970, who had promised to restrict mayors to two terms. In 1963, developer Don Wilson, who was building the new Southwood Riviera Royale tract in Torrance, was sued by the California attorney general for violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act by refusing to sell homes to African- American families in Dominguez Hills; at the June 25, 1963 city council meeting, Isen was famously quoted as saying \\"if Torrance has any Negroes, it has so few that I don't know whom I could appoint [to an interracial committee].\\" From 1955 to 1970, the population of Torrance grew by 100,000 under Mayor Isen. Isen died from a brain tumor on August 17, 1987, aged 79. Legacy Isen is credited with establishing the annual Armed Forces Day Parade, opening a branch of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, and attracting the Del Amo Fashion Center to Torrance. The city's transit center, built in 1986, is named for Isen.

The impact of the bolide was detected by infrasound and generated a 5-kiloton-equivalent explosion off the south coast of Puerto Rico. The strewn field would be spread over the Caribbean Sea. The Apollo asteroid was inbound approaching a late July perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) when it impacted Earth at 14.9 km/s. Overview The asteroid was discovered by ATLAS‚ÄìMLO on 22 June 2019 and was observed four times with an observation arc of just 30 minutes, typical for ATLAS discoveries before they are followed up by other resources. With such a short observation arc, how far away (and, therefore, how large) the object is very uncertain until more data are available. Using these four observations, JPL's Scout listed the impact risk as modest, and calculated that the asteroid was about 160 meters in diameter and would pass about 36 LD (14 million km) from Earth. A fireball was however reported. When the Caribbean bolide report came in from the GOES-16 weather satellite it was possible to link the ATLAS astrometry to it. Three additional precovery observations by Pan-STARRS 2 were then located and extended the observation arc to 2.3 hours. Using all seven observations, Scout then obtained a significantly better orbit determination with an impact rating of \\"elevated\\". The updated orbit shows that the asteroid was about 1.3 LD (500,000 km) from Earth when ATLAS-MLO observed it, 12 hours before impact.  Visibility  The asteroid came to opposition 175 degrees from the Sun on 17 May 2019 when it had an apparent magnitude of 27. Such a faint apparent magnitude would require a 10 hour image to detect with the largest 8-meter class telescopes in the world. Pan-STARRS is a 1.8-meter class telescope and with 30 second images has a limiting apparent magnitude of around 22. ATLAS has a limiting apparent magnitude closer to 19. The asteroid did not become brighter than apparent magnitude 23 until 19 June when it was about 4 million km from Earth. The asteroid was detected by ATLAS when it was apparent magnitude 18.1.  Meteorites  This bolide was a probable meteorite fall into waters 4.8 km deep. NEXRAD weather radar detected falling meteorites at 21:26:15 UT at 10.6 km above sea level. Signatures consistent with falling meteorites appear in a total of four radar sweeps. Meteorite falls with enough mass to generate green pixels on weather radar are very rare.  Origin  It could be an Alinda asteroid originating from the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Even though 2019 MO has a geometric similarity to the June epsilon Ophiuchids and four other minor meteor showers, it could just as easily be a sporadic meteor that just looks similar by chance. 2019 MO is about 12¬∞ away from the concentration of June epsilon Ophiuchids orbits. The few other asteroids discovered before impacting are 2008 TC3, 2014 AA, and 2018 LA.

Plot Tony Rodrigues is a motorcycle racer who has aspirations to enter the professional circuit. While not racing, he splits his time between working as a forklift operator during the daytime, and taking care of his son Sofiane whenever his ex-wife Leyla attempts to find employment. During one of his scheduled meetings with Leyla, Tony encounters a group of gypsie gang members led by Jordan exiting Leyla's residence. Tony finds Leyla beaten up and her apartment trashed, learning that Leyla was hiding drugs for Jordan, but the current supply in her possession was stolen by an ex-boyfriend. In an attempt to help her, Tony seeks out Jordan, and with the aid of his childhood friend and current street gang leader, Moussa, Tony meets with Jordan at their local bar in order to negotiate on settling Leyla's debt. Jordan dismisses Tony outright, but his boss, Miguel is more receptive to Tony. In order to pay off Leyla's debt, Tony is given the job of transporting drug packages to designated spots by motorcycle within a two-hour limit for two months. Tony's moonlighting jeopardizes both his daytime job and his tryout for a motorcycle team, which ultimately leads him to failing at both of them. After completing the last delivery, Jordan changes the terms on Tony, forcing him to endlessly work as a drug courier. In retaliation, Tony beats Jordan to death with his motorcycle helmet. Feeling betrayed, Tony enlists Moussa's aid in disposing of Jordan's body, and offers Moussa Miguel's assets in order to eliminate Miguel as a threat. Tony allows himself to be captured by Miguel in order to have Moussa tail him. Complications arise when local traffic create an obstacle for Moussa, and Miguel learns from his gang members that Tony lied to him about Jordan's fate. After a failed escape attempt, Tony is rescued by Moussa and his men, and Miguel is shot to death by Moussa's gang. During the aftermath, Tony works as a warehouse worker, but misses his thrill-seeking.

Similar to the 2018 Regional Measure 3, the tax would require a bill to be passed by the California State Legislature authorizing its placement on ballots in all nine Bay Area counties. According to Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG) CEO Carl Guardino, the goal of the tax is \\"to build a seamlessly integrated world-class transit system that serves the transit-dependent and lures the non-transit dependent out of their vehicles.‚Äù  History  The proponents of Faster Bay Area, Silicon Valley Leadership Group, Bay Area Council, and the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR) were inspired by the passage of similar very large transportation taxes in Los Angeles (Measure M) and Seattle (ST3) in November 2016, and began meeting in January 2017 to formulate such a tax for the Bay Area. In December 2017 this business coalition announced that it would seek to place the tax proposal on Bay Area ballots in 2020, and that the measure would focus on creating transit hubs to connect major cities around the region by rail, building public transit options in communities that are currently underserved and expanding rail, bus and ferry networks. The business coalition hired SCN Strategies, now SCRB Strategies, a political campaign firm also employed by Governor Gavin Newsom and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris in their successful bids for elected office, to manage the Faster Bay Area campaign.  Projects  Proponents of Faster Bay Area have provided few details on which projects the tax increase would actually fund, though high-cost highway and rail transit expansions have been the most frequently cited. The only \\"project list\\" so far provided at any public meeting is in fact a short list of project categories, presented by Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Policy & Community Relations Manager Scott Haywood at the June 21 VTA Board of Directors. That list envisions $, mostly highway traffic capacity expansion projects, for Santa Clara County, and does not consider any projects in other Bay Area counties.  Polls  Polls conducted in February 2019 and commissioned by SVLG showed strong general support for the tax measure, with 71 percent of respondents indicating support for a one-percent sales tax to generate the $ envisioned, and 64 percent of respondents supporting a $ bond plus a 0.4 percent gross receipts tax on businesses. However, SVLG has been widely criticized for politically- motivated \\"push polling\\" for years, and was found to have overestimated support for the proposed 2020 Caltrain sales tax by 9 percentage points in May 2019.  Public review  Despite the huge dollar amount and scope of the envisioned tax, Faster Bay Area has seen very little public review as of June 2019. The proposal was reviewed at a retreat of the Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) on May 30, 2019, by the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Board of Directors on June 6, 2019, and on June 13, 2019 by the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District Board of Directors.

Founder of Semper Idem, and co-founder of W. Duke, Sons & Co., Brodie produced and sold tobacco products across North Carolina for over 20 years. He mainly worked out of his property around Downtown Durham, including from his famous warehouse, the Brodie Duke Warehouse. Early life Brodie Duke was born in 1846, to Washington Duke and Mary Caroline Clinton two years after their first child, Sidney Taylor Duke. Just one year after Brodie's birth, his mother died. Five years later, his father remarried to Artelia Roney, from Alamance County, North Carolina. Washington and Artelia had three children, Mary Elizabeth Duke, Benjamin Newton Duke, and James Buchanan Duke. In 1858, Sidney caught typhoid fever and died at age 14. Days later, Artelia, who had been caring for Sidney, fell ill and died as well. Along with his father, Brodie volunteered for military service in the Civil War, and served as a guard. Career The Duke family owned and ran a 72-acre farm in what is Durham County today. Brodie was the first of the family to move away, and relocated himself to Durham. He purchased a two-level space, living in the upper level, while selling tobacco from the lower level. After a few years, the rest of the Dukes followed in Brodie's footsteps, and moved to Durham. At this time, Washington Duke built a split warehouse to share with Brodie, and the two held an agreement by which each would sell the other's products. Eventually, Brodie built his own warehouse, and co-founded \\"W. Duke, Sons & Co.\\" with his father, step-brothers, and a family business partner, George Washington Watts. Despite the rest of the Duke family's affection towards Watts, Brodie despised him. So much so, that he bought three pieces of land in Durham, and named the streets so that they read, \\"Washington, Hated, Watts,\\" from East to West. In 1902, however, \\"Hated St.\\" was renamed \\"Gregson St.\\" after Amos Gregson, a Durham minister. Built around 1878, the Brodie Duke Warehouse is the oldest warehouse, and one of the oldest tobacco-related buildings, in Durham. It remained operational through the mid-twentieth century. In 2000, educational testing company, Measurement Incorporated purchased the warehouse and renovated it. Alcoholism When he first moved away from his family, and started his business in Durham, Brodie developed an addiction to alcohol. In the early 1890s, he traveled to Illinois to receive the \\"Keeley Cure\\" for his alcoholism. The process started with the institution offering the new patient as much alcohol as they could drink. Each patient received injections of bichloride of gold four times a day, as well as multiple other tonics, for four weeks. He returned to North Carolina completely sober, however less than 3 years later, he declared bankruptcy, the mills were taken over by Benjamin, and Brodie returned to his alcoholic tendencies.

He held strong views on many issues of the time, including the role of coroners, the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Homeopathy and regulations regarding the sale of arsenic. Family and Education The Toogood family was well known in the town of Sherborne in Dorset. Jonathan's grandfather John Toogood, a merchant, was for many years a governor at Sherborne School and at one time resided at Sherborne House, Dorset. Jonathan's father, the Rev. John Toogood, was given a living at All Saints Church, Kington Magna in Dorset and it was there that Jonathan was born in 1784. Rev. Toogood was an ardent campaigner against the Atlantic Slave Trade. In 1798 at the age of 14 Jonathan became apprenticed to Mr Hill Dawe, a surgeon-apothecary in the town of Bridgwater in Somerset and after a five-year apprenticeship continued his surgical training as a pupil of Mr John Abernethy (surgeon) at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. In 1806 Jonathan returned to Bridgwater to set up in practice in this busy port, well known for its ship building industry and its brick and tile trade. Later that year he married Ann Giles from the nearby village of Mark, Somerset. Together they had 12 children - of the eight surviving sons, three entered the medical profession. His eldest son, Rev. Jonathan James Toogood became the vicar of North Petherton, just south of Bridgwater, but in later life moved to Kirkby Overblow in North Yorkshire. Work and Associations The work of a 19th-century surgeon in rural Somerset could be very difficult and challenging.Sutcliffe, Dr Lesley Dr Jonathan Toogood. The story of the 19th century Somerset surgeon who founded the Bridgwater Hospital self-published 2017 Jonathan believed that an Infirmary would be a great asset for the town of Bridgwater and the surrounding agricultural villages. In 1813 he \\"invited his medical brethren\\" and other notable persons in the town to help establish such an institution. By October of the same year a small 'Dispensary' opened its doors in Back Street (now Clare Street) in Bridgwater. This was based on the Voluntary hospital system, which had started in many large towns in the 18th century and depended on donations and benefactors. Despite the inevitable ups and downs the establishment continued to prosper, moving to larger premises in the town on the banks of the River Parrett in 1820. Here it flourished as a Voluntary Hospital until 1948, when it was taken over by the state. In 2014, some 200 years later, the hospital moved to new modern premises on the outskirts of the town. Jonathan worked at the Infirmary until 1845 but continued in the role of Consulting Surgeon and Physician after his retirement. He also founded and funded the Eye Dispensary in the town in 1834, assisted by one of his sons John Giles Toogood. Jonathan corresponded with many well known medical personalities of that era - for example, the surgeons Henry Cline and Sir Astley Cooper in London and James Young Simpson, Professor of Midwifery in Edinburgh. He also visited and walked the wards in Paris with the leading French surgeons. He embraced new ideas such as the use of the stethoscope, which had arrived in England in the 1820s, invented by Rene Laennec in Paris; and he employed anaesthesia in the form of ether and chloroform to relieve pain in surgery, unlike many practitioners at that time who frowned upon its use. Jonathan wrote many articles for the leading medical journals and was very critical of the new Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. He called for higher qualifications and tighter regulations for coroners. He also campaigned for changes in the sale of arsenic, petitioning parliament, and in 1850 was a member of the Arsenic Committee. Its work resulted in the Arsenic Act 1851. Finally he was very critical of homeopathy, which had become popular in the early 19th century, writing a scathing article about the practice in 1848. This resulted in a rebuff in the British Journal of Homeopathy entitled 'Medical Toogoodism and Homeopathy'.1849 British Journal of Homeopathy 7 (28) pp248-275 In 1843 Jonathan became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, one of the first 300 Fellows. Final Years Jonathan Toogood spent his retirement in [Torquay] where his son Isaac Baruch Toogood was a General Practitioner. He was often seen visiting patients with his son. He died of 'old age' on 7 December 1870, aged 86.

He is currently a group leader at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, Austria, Chair of Organismal and Developmental Neurobiology at the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich, and Honourary Associate Professor at the University of Melbourne. Education Keays studied Science and Law at the University of Queensland, graduating with a BSc majoring in neuroscience and LLB (Hons) in 1998. He received his honours degree in science from the University of Melbourne in 2001 with a thesis describing the isolation and discovery of a novel conotoxin with analgesic activity from the cone shell Conus victoriae.. He practiced law as a criminal prosecutor with the Office of Public Prosecutions (OPP) and was admitted to the Supreme Court of Victoria as a Barrister and Solicitor in 2002. Career and research In 2002, Keays was appointed as Christopher Welch Scholar by the University of Oxford and joined the lab of Jonathan Flint at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics to conduct research for a DPhil degree. During his degree he identified an ENU- induced mutation of Œ±-1 tubulin that resulted in abnormal hippocampal layering in mice. He went on to show that mutations in the human homolog (TUBA1A), cause cortical brain malformations in humans. He was awarded a DPhil in 2006 and became a Wellcome Trust OXION research fellow at St Anne's College, Oxford to continue his research on the molecular processes that drive neuronal migration during neuronal development. When Keays started his own research group at the IMP in Vienna as an Independent Fellow in 2008, he decided to start a second research branch, investigating the molecular, cellular and neuroanatomical basis of magnetoreception. Using the pigeon as their model organism, his lab was able to show that iron-rich structures in the beaks of pigeons were not part of mangetosensitive neurons but iron deposits in macrophages.

It has been home to General Edmund Kirby Smith, the St. Augustine Public Library, and the St. Augustine Historical Society Research Library.  History  The first record of a building at this lot appears in a Spanish map dated January 22, 1764. The building was most likely used as a dwelling during the First Spanish Period. During St. Augustine's British Period (1763-1783), the house belonged to a British Captain, Henry Skinner, and changed hands several times during the British occupation. St. Augustine was ceded back to the Spanish with the 1783 Treaty of Paris. At this time, a Menorcan man named Bernardo Segui bought the lot from Pablo Cortina; the home had a first floor made of coquina and a wooden second floor. The lot also accommodated a small two-room building on Artillery Lane. Bernardo and his wife had six children and most likely made additions to the dwelling. In 1824, Bernardo Segui's widow rented out the house to Judge Joseph Lee Smith, a judge in the Supreme Court of Florida. Judge Smith's son Edmund Kirby Smith, who would go on to become a Confederate general, was born there. The Smith family later became full owners of the building. In 1863, the Union occupiers of St. Augustine banished Edmund's mother, Frances Kirby Smith, from the city on suspicion of spying for the Confederacy. Alexander Darnes, the son of the enslaved woman Violet Pinkney, also lived in the house. In 1855, Darnes left St. Augustine to serve as valet to Edmund Kirby Smith during his military service in the Western Territories and throughout the Civil War. After the South lost the war, Darnes went on to earn a medical degree in 1880 at Howard University, moved back to Florida, and became one of the first African American doctors in the state. In 1887 the Smiths sold the house to E.P. Dismukes. Mr. and Mrs. John L. Wilson bought the home in 1894. Today outside the house on Aviles Street stands a historical marker designating the home as one of the thirty- six remaining Spanish Colonial homes in St. Augustine. Maria Kirby Smith, great-granddaughter of Edmund Kirby Smith, completed a bronze statue of the general and of Darnes titled \\"Sons of St. Augustine\\" in 2004. The statue stands in the courtyard of the Segui-Kirby Smith House today (2020).  Use as a library  According to the will of the Wilsons, the Segui-Kirby Smith House was to be used as a library for the citizens of St. Augustine. At first it was the property of the St. Augustine Library Association. In 1894 a public library moved into the house, from the second story of what is now the Governor's House Museum and Cultural Center. Today the Segui-Kirby Smith House and its outbuildings are used by the St. Augustine Historical Society to serve as the location for its research library, archives, and collection storage. The space includes a public reading room.

The original plan only covered land west of Gabriels Road (a road from Stockbridge to the east end of Princes Street. However, in 1797 the city acquired a five acre site east of Gabriels Road, allowing a more extensive plan. The final plan was on a north-south, east-west grid. As it evolved (although not obvious on the ground) it was decided that the east-west streets would be individual houses and north-house streets were flatted. Business (shops etc) were restricted to the north-south streets. The plan came to fruition in 1802, Sibbald being assisted by the much younger Robert Reid who largely designed the frontages. The area is now known as the Second New Town: extending from Heriot Row to Fettes Row.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=405260 In 1794 he was elected a town burgess under the title of \\"William Sibbald, mason\\". In 1800 he is listed as a builder living at 29 South Castle Street.Edinburgh Street Directory 1800 The building had been built by the builder John Hamilton (d.1812) the uncle of Thomas Hamilton.https://sites.google.com/site/joerocksresearchpages/thomas-hamilton- architect/thomas-hamilton-architect-1784-1858 The Second New Town was largely built on virgin ground and no significant demolitions were required. The only major house, Bellevue Lodge, the home of Major General John Scott, was retained as a centrepiece to what became Drummond Place. Although speculative the scheme proved enormously popular and rapidly developed, despite the relatively high cost of properties. It became the home to Edinburgh's rich and famous. He died on 29 March 1809. He is buried in the secular graveyard at Old Calton Burial Ground. The family vault lies in the southern section with its back to the Old Town. Second New Town Edinburgh's Second New Town (north of Queen Street Gardens) was created from 1802 onwards following the huge success of the First New Town (Princes Street to Queen Street). It was largely complete by 1825 apart from corner blocks. The builder was mainly John Paton (father of David Paton) and David Lind. North-south streets are built as tenements, often with ground floor shops. East-west streets are built as town- houses but now mainly split into flats due to their size. In terms of a single \\"building project\\" this is one of the largest early 19th century schemes in Britain, and is the more remarkable in that it is practically intact after 200 years. The area was developed during the height of the Napoleonic Wars. Although not immediately obvious the streets are named after people and incidents in the war, the patriotic events of 1803 to 1808: *Abercrombie Place - after Ralph Abercrombie - later changed to Abercromby Place *Albany Street/Duke Street/York Place - after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, the official commander-in-chief of the British Army - Duke St was later renamed Dublin St... Albany street was Albany Row for its first 20 years *Duncan Street - after Admiral Duncan - later renamed Dundonald Street *Dundas Street - either after General Ralph Dundas or after Admiral James Whitley Deans Dundas due to his then infamous recent recapture of Copenhagen, but also conveniently linking to the prominent Edinburgh Dundas family *Howe Street - after Admiral Howe *Nelson Street - after Admiral Nelson *Northumberland Street - after HMS Northumberland, Admiral Howe's flagship *Pitt Street - after the Prime Minister, William Pitt, renumbered and renamed as Dublin Street in 1920 *St Vincent Street - after Nelson's victory at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797) The exception to this pattern is Heriot Row which is an acknowledgement of the Heriot Trust who were the principal landowner.

In 1557 she married John Erskine, Lord Erskine. In 1560 Lord Erskine opposed the establishment of the \\"Book of Discipline\\", angering John Knox. Knox later attributed this opposition to greed and the influence of his wife, who he called \\"a verray Jesabell\\". Knox may have disliked her because she was a companion of Mary of Guise, and later of Mary, Queen of Scots.David Laing, The Works of John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), pp. 128, 572. In May 1566, pregnant with James, Mary made a will and bequeathed to Annabell and her daughter Mary Erskine jewels including her belt of amethysts and pearls, a belt of chrysoliths with its pendant chain, bracelets with diamonds, rubies and pearls, pearl earrings, a zibellino with a gold marten's head, and yet another belt with a miniature portrait of Henri II of France. These bequests show that the Countess of Mar was the queen's valued friend.Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne Descosse (Edinburgh, 1863), p. xliii, 105-8, 119.

Bringing up a King and a Prince at Stirling Castle A month after giving birth to the Prince on 19 June 1566 Mary, Queen of Scots visited the Earl and Countess of Mar at Alloa Tower. In August Lord Darnley was jealous of Annabell Murray's intimacy with the queen, along with two other close companions Agnes Keith, Countess of Moray and Jean Stewart, Countess of Argyll. In March 1567 Mary entrusted Annabell Murray with the young infant James, to be brought up at Stirling Castle.HMC 16th Report Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 16: HMC Report on the Manuscripts of Earls of Mar and Kellie, vol. 2 (London, 1930), p. 20: Alan Stewart, The Cradle King: A Life of James VI and I (London, 2004), p. 33: Aysha Pollnitz, Princely Education in Early Modern Britain (Cambridge, 2015), pp. 266, 276.

Mary was captured by her enemies, and abdicated at Lochleven Castle. Her half-brother James became Regent and gave Annabell ¬£500 Scots to give to the \\"rockers\\", women who rocked the king's cradle.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), p. 166. Lady Mar was the head of a large household serving the infant king at Stirling Castle. In 1568 James Cunningham of Drumquhassle was the Master of Household, Helen Littil was the chief nurse, five ladies including Christian Stewart, granddaughter of James V, took turns to rock the royal cradle, while the four Hudson brothers played their viols, there were cooks and brewers, Margaret Balcomie washed the king's linen and she had washed the linen of Mary, Queen of Scots at Linlithgow Palace.HMC 16th Report Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), pp. 18-21. In January 1570, Mary, Queen of Scots, in captivity in England, sent a present of clothes to James VI at Stirling. She wanted these to be his first proper clothes provided by his mother. In her letter to the Countess of Mar she said the gift did not include essential buttons, which with the rest of her jewels were kept from her, \\"whereto there wants such buttons as were worthy to garnish it, thanks to them who withholds from us suchlike and better.\\" Mar obtained Mary's buttons for James three years later.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3, p. 57. In her letters Murray described the king's well-being in formulaic terms, writing at least three times to Grey Colin Campbell, laird of Glenorchy, that \\"the Kingis Majestie is rycht blyth (praise to God)\\", a phrase which was reassuring during the years of the Marian Civil War.Jane E. A. Dawson, Clan Campbell Letters (STS, Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 168-9, 231-2. In one of his earliest letters James called Annabell \\"Lady Minny\\".HMC 16th Report Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 37, this letter is now held by the National Records of Scotland. Elizabeth I of England sent a letter congratulating her on taking good care of the king on 7 February 1572.HMC 16th Report Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 28. Among the childhood companions of James VI was her own son John, and her nephew Sir William Murray of Abercairny. A crowned letter 'A' at Mar's Wark, Stirling, may stand for \\"Annabell\\", or \\"Areskine\\" a variant of \\"Erskine\\" John Erskine, Earl of Mar became Regent of Scotland in 1572. This was a rise in status but the wife of a Regent had no defined political role or state duties.Amy Blakeway, Regency in Sixteenth-Century Scotland (Woodbridge, 2015), p. 149. Mar died in October 1572 (rumoured to have been poisoned). He had made a will in 1568, wishing his widow would follow the advice of his brother and others from the Erskine family, and his friends the Laird of Lochleven, John Cunningham of Drumquhassle, and Archibald Haldane, to guide her \\"in all things that concerns the treatment of friends and entertainment of them to the king's grace service for the honour of the house.\\" Annabell Murray kept these men around her.J. M., 'Will of the Regent Mar', Notes & Queries, 4th series VIII (21 October, 1871), pp. 321-2. She promised to repay money Mar had borrowed from the Laird of Lochleven, giving assurances as she \\"would not do to no other in Scotland but to you.\\"Registrum Honoris de Morton: Original Papers of the Earls of Morton, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1853), pp. 78-9. Annabell Murray continued to look after the king at Stirling, with Mar's younger brother Alexander Erskine of Gogar, the Master of Mar. His three sons, George, James, and Archibald joined the king in his schoolroom at Stirling.Gordon Donaldson, Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland: 1581‚Äì1584, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1982), p. 484 no. 2741. =Buttons and a football for a king= In May 1573 the \\"Lang Siege\\" of Edinburgh Castle ended in victory for the king's party. A coffer containing the jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots was recovered from the ruins. On 28 July 1573 Regent Morton sent some of these jewels to Annabell Murray to have sewn on the king's clothes, including gold buttons enamelled in white and red, and white and black, and sets of large \\"horns\\" or \\"points\\" with enamel and engraving. Morton also had 60 new gold and silver buttons made for James VI, bought him a football, and had the king's chamber at Stirling panelled in oak, and paid the outstanding wages of James's nurse Helen Litill, his cradle- rocker Jane Oliphant, and Grissel Gray, who made the king's shirts.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1566-1574, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), pp. 353-4. Annabell Murray received a variety of jewels over the subsequent years until 1579 when the King was declared an adult and moved to Edinburgh. These included a fossil shark tooth or \\"serpent's tongue\\" mounted in gold as an amulet intended to neutralise any poisons in the king's food.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 277-284. =Royal schooldays= James VI by Arnold Bronckhorst, National Gallery of Scotland In August 1573 Regent Morton told the English ambassador Henry Killigrew that he intended the Master of Mar should have more responsibility for the king. However a year later, nothing seems to have been done as Killigrew heard from the king's tutors George Buchanan and Peter Young that they were still \\"desirous to have him from the handling of women by whome he is yet guyded and kept, saving when he goeth to his booke.\\"Amy Blakeway, Regency in Sixteenth-Century Scotland (Woodbridge, 2015), p. 43. As a sign of maturity, James was dressed in adult clothing by May 1574, with a suit of red taffeta doublet and breeches.Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (London, 2020), p. 45. When Killigrew visited Stirling Castle in June 1574 he met Annabell Murray on the road and passed on Queen Elizabeth's messages of good will. He saw the eight-year old king speaking French and Latin, translating from the Bible, Buchanan and Young showed him that James could do this for any passage, unrehearsed, and then they made the king dance for him.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 13. An old story tells how Annabell Murray once tried to rescue the king from physical punishment by his tutor George Buchanan, who gave her a scurrilous answer.David Irving, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of George Buchanan (Edinburgh, 1807), p. 170. James had a French classmate, J√©r√¥me Groslot de l'Isle, whose father had been killed in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572.Natasha Constantinidou, Responses to Religious Division (Leiden, 2017), p. 63. Andrew Melville and his nephew James Melville visited the king in 1575 and heard him \\"discourse walking up and down in the auld Lady Marrs hand, of knowledge and ignorance,\\" evidently practising rhetoric with Murray.Thomas McCrie, Life of Andrew Melville, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1819), p. 65. They also met the king's physician Gilbert Moncreiff at Stirling, who was an old friend of Andrew Melville, and others.The Diary of Mr. James Melvill (Edinburgh, 1829), p. 38. =Kindness and ambition= Sir James Melville wrote about the people around the king. Annabell Murray was \\"wise and sharp\\" compared with the two Erskine commendators who were \\"wise and modest\\", and Alexander Erskine had a \\"true gentle nature.\\" Peter Young was more gentle or kind to the king than George Buchanan. The master of the household John Cunningham of Drumquhassle was \\"ambitious and greedy.\\" Buchanan and Drumquhassle became opponents of Regent Morton. In time the young king's household at Stirling became a threat to Regent Morton's power, and Melville's narrative suggests Morton was too slow to recognise this.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own Life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 261-4. =Pet birds and shoes= Surviving documents from the household include a long bill for shoes for James, which she signed with William Murray, a valet in the king's chamber. In 1578 John Murdo was the king's tailor and varlet of his wardrobe, Henry Quhite (White), the cordiner, who made the king's shoes, and James Ramsay made gloves.Gordon Donaldson, Register of the Privy Seal: 1575-1580, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1966), p. 278 no. 1732, 282 nos. 1750, 1751. Murdo had been the Earl of Mar's tailor, making his velvet breeches in 1571.Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (London, 2020), p. 44. William Murray bought cords to hang cages for James's pet birds in the palace of Stirling Castle and hemp seed to feed them, and decorated James's study with green fabric.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), pp. 21-2, 27, 316: See also exchequer vouchers National Records of Scotland NRS E25/5. In September 1577 she wrote to her brother-in-law Robert Murray of Abercairney, telling not to come to Stirling, because Regent Morton was coming. The Laird of Abercairney wanted to bring an accused woman Violet Mar to Stirling, and Annabell advised to get written statements from her accusers.HMC 3rd Report: C. H. D. Moray (London, 1872), p. 419. On 24 April 1579 the Earl of Atholl died at Kincardine Castle, near Auchterarder, soon after attending a banquet at Stirling Castle. His wife Margaret Fleming, (who had been married to Murray's brother-in-law, Thomas Erskine, Master of Erskine), was also unwell. A rumour started that they had been poisoned at the request of Murray or Morton.George Hewitt, Scotland Under Morton (Edinburgh, 1982), pp. 70-1. Agnes Graham, the wife of William Murray of Tullibardine, wrote to Annabell Murray assuring her that the Countess of Atholl's complaint was \\"forged lies\\".John, 7th Duke of Atholl, Chronicles of the Atholl and Tullibardine families (Edinburgh, 1908), pp. 44-5. Around this time the king sat for his portrait, for the second time, for a Flemish painter, probably Arnold Bronckhorst. Archibald Douglas supervised the painter and sent the picture to Queen Elizabeth.Cuthbert Sharp, Memorials of the Rebellion of 1569 (London, 1840), p. 392. Douglas said the painter needed three sittings in a day and the picture would take 9 days.Patrick Fraser Tytler, History of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1842), p. 418, Proofs to vol. 4, no. IV, \\"Letter of intelligence from an anonymous correspondent to Sir George Bowes,\\" undated letter, Spring 1579, (formerly in Bowes manuscripts at Streatlam Castle, Bowes MS vol. 6): Duncan Thomson, Painting in Scotland 1570-1650 (Edinburgh, 1975), p. 9. Murray was said to have had a significant role in the transfer of power from Morton to the king in 1578. Her brother, Sir William of Tullibardine (d. 1583) had a role in Morton's resignation of the regency and may also have been involved in the mini-coup at Stirling in April 1578 that expelled the Master of Mar. In December 1581 she wrote to Walter Stewart, Prior of Blantyre for payment of a reward promised for her services to the young king.HMC Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 36. She was also prominent during regime change in 1584 and was forfeited for supporting rebels in September 1584. =Anne of Denmark= She was the principal of ladies that welcomed Anne of Denmark at the shore of Leith in May 1590, with Lady Boyne, Lady Seton, Lady Thirlestane, Lady Dudhope, and others.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 186, 26-2. At the coronation of Anna of Denmark on 17 May 1590 she held the queen's train and opened her gown for the anointing.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 104-7. In 1594, Murray became the keeper of King James's son Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. Henry was born at Stirling, and Anne of Denmark had been attended by the doctors Martin Sch√∂ner and Gilbert Moncreiff, the surgeon Gilbert Primrose, the apothecary Alexander Barclay, and a midwife. Other members of the Murray family joined this new household, including Barbara Murray keeper of linen, William Murray a varlet, Patrick Murray of Geanis master of the wardrobe and his assistant John Murray, and Henry Murray master of the spicehouse.HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 1 (London, 1904), pp. 39-42. The Prince's nurse was Margaret Mastertoun, wife of James Primrose. At Henry's baptism on 30 August 1594, her formal role included lifting the prince out of his bed and passing him to the Duke of Lennox, who then handed him to the English ambassador, and she held him again in the chapel until the service began.Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 3 (Oxford, 2014), p. 752: Thomas Birch, The Life of Henry Prince of Wales (Dublin, 1760), p. 17. Anna of Denmark resented her son's absence and her attempts to gain custody of Henry involved Annabell and her son John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1558‚Äì1634) in bitter factional struggles.J. Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark, Queen of England (University of Pennsylvania, 2001), pp. 17-32. Old Age In July 1599 the King made a gift to the Countess and her son for their loyal services. The award noted her great age and \\"hir body waist and extenuat by hir former service\\". If she died the gift would be given to her daughter Marie Erskine (the former wife of Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus). Marie Erskine helped looked after the prince at Stirling.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 18. In 1600 James VI in Parliament granted her a property in Stirling called the \\"heuch and brae of Parkhill\\" or the Haining, and a formal discharge for service in keeping Prince Henry in the same terms.Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), p. 243. Annabell Murray died in February 1603. According to Archibald Simpson, minister of Dalkeith, she \\"peacefully ended her days, respected by all, hated by none.\\"Robert Paul, 'Will of Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar', The Scottish Antiquary, or, Northern Notes and Queries, vol. 9, No. 33 (1894), p. 3. On 7 May 1603, her daughter-in-law Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar frustrated the attempt of Anne of Denmark to take Prince Henry from the castle. Her other homes were Mar's Wark and Alloa Tower, and a townhouse in Edinburgh. The National Museum of Scotland has a chair carved with her initials and three stars from the Murray heraldry, and a cradle said to have been for the infant king or prince. Annabell made more than one will or list of legacies. In the will made on 1 November 1601 she noted her farmstock on the mains of Erskine and on the land of Glen Shee with Auchlansky and the park of Jarago. She wanted to be buried at the new burial aisle at the kirk of Alloa, as her husband had been. The bodies of Erskine predecessors should be brought from Cambuskenneth Abbey to Alloa, as her husband had wished in his will.Robert Paul, 'Will of Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar', The Scottish Antiquary, or, Northern Notes and Queries, vol. 9, No. 33 (1894), pp. 1-3, transcribing the will now in the National Library of Scotland. =Jewels and physic= In her will made on 16 November 1602 she left her jewellery to her family, including a gold locket depicting the story of Abraham and Isaac, and another with an allegory of an unyielding adamant (a hard stone) beaten by two hammers which she explained to her son \\"like as the pressing hammers cannot break the adamant no man [should] suffer his obliged affection and duty to his god, his prince & parent to be battered or overcome\\". Expensive clothes included a cloak called a \\"mandell\\" decorated with rubies, diamonds, and \\"pictures\\". New gold bracelets or signet rings engraved with the cipher of her name, her initials, were made for some male dependants. She had made physic with a servant Jonet Patersoune, and bequeathed her both medicine and distilling equipment; \\"the whole drugs extant in my possession the time of decease together with my whole stillatours, glasses, leam pots, and other furniture pertaining thereto\\".HMC 4th report, Erskine Murray of Alva (London, 1874), pp. 526-7 now National Library of Scotland MS Ch. 4031.

Officially designed for export and German security guards, it was used by the paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS). Export variants were used in South America, Ethiopia, China and Iberian Peninsula. The carbine version of this rifle was almost identical with the Karabiner 98k that became the standard German service rifle during World War II.  Design  It was a derivative of the Gewehr 98 or Mauser Model 1898, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. It featured combined features of the Karabiner 98AZ and Gewehr 98 versions. The barrel was only -long, comparable to the barrel of the Karabiner 98AZ. The rifle had a new iron sight line, with a tangent rear sight graduated from to , with increments. The rear sight element could be modified to match the trajectory of the standard 7.92√ó57mm Mauser S Patrone spitzer bullet or the heavier s.S. Patrone boat tail spitzer bullet originally designed for aerial combat and long range machine gun use. The first version of the gun was designed in 1924. It used the straight bolt handle and the bottom-mounted sling of the Gewehr 98. The rifle entered full-scale production in 1933 with a turned-down bolt and a Karabiner 98k type slot in the butt to attach the sling. The rifle was exported in 7√ó57mm Mauser, 7.65√ó53mm Mauser and 7.92√ó57mm Mauser. A carbine version, identical to the Karabiner 98k, was also produced.  Service  The Standardmodell of 1924 was used by the SA and the SS and was exported to China and South America. According to the manufacturer, the Model 1933 rifle was only sold to the Deutsche Reichspost, the German post office. The rifle was named Gewehr f√ºr Deutsches Reichspost (rifle of the German Post Office). Part of this production was actually purchased by Nazi organisations or by the Reichswehr. The Wehrmacht, through requisitions, might have used it during World War II. Bolivia purchased the Standardmodell in the 1920s and used it in combat during the Chaco War. Its enemy, Paraguay, fielded Standardmodell rifles bought during the 1930s. The rifle was also ordered by Honduras. The Standardmodell saw service in China. In the Chinese National Armament Standards Conference of 1932 it was decided that the Standardmodell was to be the standard issue rifle of the National Revolutionary Army. It started being imported from Germany in 1934, the first 10,000 were being bought for the Chinese Tax Police., and production in Chinese arsenals also began in 1935, first under the name \\"Type 24 Rifle\\", but was soon renamed to the \\"Chiang Kai-Shek rifle\\" after the Generalissimo. It was used during the Chinese Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Imperial Japanese Navy reportedly used rifles captured in China. The Ethiopian Empire bought 25,000 Model 1924 and Model 1933 rifles and carbines, and fielded them during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The Buenos Aires Police also bought Mauser Model 1933 in rifles and carbines configuration, the latter with a barrel. The Argentinean rifles and carbines differ from the other Standardmodells by having an extended arm on the bolt release. Both before and after the Spanish coup of July 1936, Spain bought Standardmodell rifles and carbines. The German Condor Legion fighting during the Spanish Civil War also used this rifle. Some of the Spanish rifles were rebarreled for the Spanish 7√ó57mm round. At the same time, Portugal ordered Model 1933s to modernized its military forces.

Background After the Nuovo codice della strada (traffic code) came into force, motorcycles with a cylinder capacity of less than 50 cc and a maximum speed of 40 km/h were the only motor vehicles that could be used by people without a driving license. Some Italian motorcycle manufacturers, seeing their production fall due to the availability of low-cost utility cars, decided to enter the light motorcycle sector, creating economical models equipped with refined and robust four- stroke engines. Overview As a motorcycle aimed at youngsters not old enough to hold a licence, the MV technicians focused giving the machine \\"real\\" motorcycle looks. The chassis and bodywork were of a generous size for its engine size. The \\"Liberty\\" was offered in two versions, the \\"Turismo\\" and the \\"Sport Speciale\\", priced at 112,000 and 114,000 Lire respectively. This was quite inexpensive, in relation to the technical refinement of the engine and chassis. For the domestic versions of the \\"Liberty\\", to the \\"Code\\", the maximum speed was 40 km/h, however, overseas version were capable of 60 km/h. Initially fuel consumption of 1 litre of petrol per 100 km was claimed, late a more credible consumption of 1.5 liters per 100 km was claimed. A second series was introduced in 1966, 18\\" wheels replaced the original 16\\" items and the \\"Sport\\" received a 4-speed gearbox. A more upmarket \\"America\\" model was introduced. The \\"Liberty\\" was not a great commercial success; 5,292 were produced, of which 2,000 were the \\"America\\" model and 3,292 \\"Sport\\". Technical details The Liberty's engine was an air-cooled pushrod single- cylinder four-stroke with a bore and stroke of 39 x 42 mm giving an displacement of 47,7 cc. Compression ratio was 7.5:1 and the ignition was provided by a magneto. Power output was 1.5 bhp @ 4,500 rpm. A wet multi-plate clutch was driven by gears from the crankshaft. There was initially a three- speed gearbox, but sports models got 4 speeds from 1966. Gears were controlled by a handlebar twistgrip. The rear wheel was driven by a chain. The MV Agusta had a double cradle frame and telescopic forks were used. At the rear there was a swinging arm with hydraulic shock absorbers.

Yoshiko married to Tokugawa Nariaki, the 9th feudal lord of Mito Domain. She was the mother to the 10th lord Yoshiatsu as well as the 15th and the last Chief of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Yoshinobu.  Personal history  Yoshiko, the twelfth and the last daughter was born to His Imperial Highness Prince Taruhito of Arisugawa-no-miya family with a courtesan Ando Kiyoko. Called when very young, and before coming to Edo from Kyoto. Named by husband for in case if she be widowed, then called post humously when she died in 1893 at the age of 89 in Tokyo. Tokugawa Yoshiko rests at Zuiryusan temple, the official Bodhi temple of Mito clan in Ibaraki Prefecture. One of her elder sisters, Princess Takako, was married to the twelfth shogun Tokugawa Ieyoshi, and others were married to feudal lords, one the wife of Asano Narikata of Hiroshima Domain and the other of Mori clan of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain. In 1830 and at the age of 27, Yoshiko was engaged to Nariaki who was 37 but had not had the first wife as he had become the chief of his clan just a year ago. Princess Takako, Yoshiko's elder sister who married a shogun, was said to have arranged the marriage, and there is a record of Emperor Nink≈ç's comment that Mito clan had been good in both politics and education since (Nariaki's) predecessors. The Mito clan was renowned to support the imperial system with enthusiasm for generations, and that the emperor gladly approved the marriage of Princess (Yoshiko) to a loyal feudal lord. When Yoshiko came to Edo and started leading a life of samurai wife, she kept the attire of imperial household for weeks after her marriage, which she wore and posed for a portrait wearing Kosode gown and hakama long skirt. In a letter boxed with that portrait, Nariaki called his wife Yoshiko, not Princess Yoshiko or other names. Among 37 children of Nariaki with four wives, Yoshiko was the mother of their first son Yoshiatsu, the seventh son Yoshinobu after an infant died prematurely, and a daughter as the last child. Yoshiko was known to be fluent in arts, especially waka Japanese poems as well as Japanese calligraphy as the Arisugawa family heritage. Embroidery and playing music on koto and hichiriki was among her hobbies, while after relocating to Mito from Edo, leant to fish at the river down the castle. As being the younger sister-in-law to Ieyoshi the twelfth shogun and being an imperial princess, those higher ranks including Ii Naosuke and his followers in Edo government were said to keep an eye on her if she would advise either the shogun or the emperor on political issues. While Nariaki was charged to take part in anti-shogun movements at Ansei Purge, and was detained in Mito for lifetime in 1859, it took her three months to obtain permission and move from Edo to Mito. Widowed the next year, Yoshiko followed samurai custom and cut her hair short and made a pabbajja, retiring from social activities and was renamed as Teiho-in .  Later life  Kobuntei villa in Mito city. Between 1869 and 1873 (2nd and 6th years of Meiji), Yoshiko resided in the Kobuntei Villa in Kairaku-en garden her late husband had opened. Her stepson Akitake invited Yoshiko to live in his mansion at Koume, Tokyo, which was the shimo-yashiki, or the second official residence of the Mito clan in Edo. While the samurai custom prohibited Yoshiko to live with her only surviving natural son, Yoshinobu, they were exchanging letters: Yoshinobu had been adopted to Hitotsubashi family when he was eleven to be entitled as an heir to shogunate, so that he no more was regarded as Yoshiko's \\"direct family\\". It took years for Yoshiko before overcoming the prejudice among Meiji politicians as being an anti-government, as being the mother of Yoshinobu who had opened fire against the government supporters in Kyoto, and on top of that, the Mito clan was known to be radically against opening the country to foreign relations and trades. As the emperor governed the Meiji government, Yoshiko had been distanced from her kins in Kyoto, before she regained family ties with her grand nephew Prince Taruhito of Arisugawa family (ja) (1835 ‚Äì 1895). It was after she moved to Tokyo and Prince Taruhito wrote in his diary that since after January 1873, Yoshiko invited the Prince to her residence, sent gifts when she heard Taruhito was ill, and when the engagement of Prince Taruhito was publicised in June 1873. Yoshiko recovered her social status when late Nariaki was honored with the rank of Sho-ni-i (ja) or the Second Rank of Honor, post-humously in 1873 and commemorated the occasion by giving Prince Taruhito a stationary Naruhito had handcrafted. When Prince Taruhito lost his first wife Sadako to illness in 1872, Yoshiko mourned over the death of her step daughter, and tried to show condolence by arranging an extended family reunion of the children of Nariaki for the deceased, with Prince Taruhito as the guest of honor. The eldest surviving son Ikeda Yoshinori (ja) offered his residence, who was the lord of Tottori domain, inviting Akitake (Sadako's natural brother), Atsuyoshi (Yoshiatsu's son), Matsudaira Tadakazu (Shimabara domain), Tsuchiya Tsugunao (Tsuchiura domain) among others. Princess Ei, wife of Akitake joined them who was Taruhito's pupil of calligraphy. Madam Bummei, or her posthumous name was said to be given by her late husband Nariaki even before his death.

As a mark of gratitude for his services to the borough, in November 1888 the council presented Morgan with a 36 piece silver dinner set (worth ¬£1,000) and two oil paintings of himself. Lady Morgan received a diamond bracelet. Following the creation of Cardiff County Borough in 1889, Morgan became councillor for the new Park ward, but was the most prominent casualty of the all-Cardiff elections in November 1890, when he lost to the Liberal contender. Despite trailing by 100 votes, Morgan demanded a recount, eventually losing by 649 votes to 747. Morgan stood unsuccessfully in the 1892 United Kingdom general election for the South Glamorganshire constituency. Death Morgan died at his house in Cathedral Road, Cardiff, on 13 December 1894. He had fallen ill on a trip to Scotland in the September, then caught a further cold staying at his house in Porthcawl in late November. After his death was announced, the muffled bells of St John's church were rung and flags were flown at half mast on some of Cardiff's important buildings.

Eventually, Modjeska would be acknowledged as a reigning star in Poland, and be equally celebrated when she toured America. Holmgren is Professor and Chair of the Department of Slavic and Eurasian Studies, Duke University. She is also on the faculty of the university's , Jewish Studies, and Theater Studies. Prior to the publication of this book, she had written articles on Modjeska for The Polish Review, Indiana Slavic Studies and Theatre Journal.; ; Synopsis Holmgren begins Starring Madame Modjeska: On Tour in Poland and America with Helena Modjeska's 1877 American debut at San Francisco's California Theatre, before flashing back to her Polish roots. The future thespian was born as Jadwiga Benda in 1840, into a working-class family in Krak√≥w, Poland. Her mother J√≥zefa Misel Benda was a widowed head of the household when Helena was born, and the mother of sons J√≥zef, Szymon, and Feliks. Baptized as Helena Opid, the identity of her birth father remains speculative, but Micha≈Ç Opid became J√≥zefa's husband after Helena's birth, and he is the man she acknowledged as her father. Through Michal Opid, she had a sister J√≥zefa and brother Adolph. Helena and sister J√≥zefa were educated at St. John's convent in Krak√≥w . She shared the thespian aspirations of her brothers. J√≥zef introduced 25-year-old stage actor Gustaw (or Gustave) Zimajer to the family when Helena was about age 10. The author portrays him as a dubious character. His stage name was Gustaw Modrzejewska (or Modrzejewski). Hired as a family German language tutor, he often read to them from that era's great works of literature. When she married Zimajer, Helena adapted his stage name to Modjeska (or Modjeski) for her stage persona. He served as her talent manager for her 1861 professional debut in Bochnia, Poland, and for ensuing performances. Holmgren believes hisbungling resulted in Modjeska resourcefully adapting to managing own career. The couple had a son Rudolf (or Dolcio or Ralph) and a daughter Maria, the latter not living past the age of 3. Discovering in 1865 that Zimajer was a bigamist with the other wife still living, Modjeska left him. Zimajer abducted Rudolf in 1866, holding the child hostage until an agreed- upon ransom figure was paid in 1869. She re-married in 1868 to Karol Bo≈ºenta Ch≈Çapowski, a member of the Polish aristocracy, and veteran of the January Uprising. Holmgren describes Ch≈Çapowski as a man who, after the political insurrections, began to reassess his purpose in life, and subsequently developed a keen appreciation of the theatre arts. He later became editor-in- chief of Kraj newspaper. Modjeska, who had learned to master stage roles, easily adapted to the social dictates of the aristocracy. Over the next 8 years, Modjeska's fame ascended to that of a reigning star at the Warsaw Imperial Theatres, but she longed to develop into an international performer. Modjeska and Ch≈Çapowski, along with a small group of friends, emigrated to the United States in 1876. She and close friend Anna Wolska had been discussing the possibility of establishing an American art colony. Ch≈Çapowski had instead envisioned a utopian agricultural cooperative. After visiting the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City, which she took a dislike to, they sailed to San Francisco. The author notes that she was immediately drawn to the city and its large immigrant population, many of whom were from Poland. Most importantly to Modjeska was the city's theatre culture, and the opportunity to attend the Shakespearean performances of Edwin Booth. She and her husband settled in Southern California, purchasing land in Anaheim, on which they and their friends Henryk Sienkiewicz and Julian Sypniewski operated the . It was sold in 1877 at a loss. She launched herself on a new acting career, performing in English-language productions throughout the United States. Modjeska performed again in Poland 1884‚Äì1885. After being introduced to pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski by a mutual friend, she was so impressed by his talent that she performed on stage with him in Krak√≥w, and is credited with helping Paderewski launch his public career. She toured America with Edwin Booth in 1889‚Äì1890, and returned to Poland once more in 1890. Holmgren gives the reader a glimpse into the loyalty between Paderewski and Modjeska, for as his artistic fortunes rose, hers descended. He returned her earlier generosity in kind by heading a 1905 benefit in her honor at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Her final tours of the United States were 1905‚Äì1907. Both she and her husband, as well as her son Rudolf, became naturalized United States citizens in 1893. Modjeska died at Newport Beach, California on April 8, 1909, and her ashes were later interred in Krak√≥w‚Äôs Rakowicki Cemetery. Holmgren concludes the biography with an examination of the Polish and American commemorations, and glimpses into historical documentations from Modjeska's tours. Reception H-Poland Book Review said, \\"Holmgren‚Äôs study is a truly transnational biography, elegantly written and immaculately researched. Its real achievement is to make Modrzejewska whole, not just by bridging two national narratives but by integrating her public and private personae.\\" Halina Filipowicz of the University of Wisconsin, commented on Wellesley Centers for Women, \\"The breadth of Holmgren‚Äôs research is impressive, as is her talent as a writer ... She proves a fine storyteller, recounting the actress‚Äôs life with verve, wit, and a sure eye for vivid detail\\". Filipowicz expressed disappointment that Holmgren did not delve into, \\" ... why she remained silent when progressive men and women in Poland campaigned during the 1880s and 1890s to open Polish universities to women\\". Kazimierz Braun reviewing in Modern Drama said, \\"This is an excellent and meticulously rendered book,\\" and lauded Holmgren's skills at putting the narrative together. He thought the book fell short on Holmgren's knowledge of Poland's history. Release information * Starring Madame Modjeska: On Tour in Poland and America. Indiana University Press, November 2011.

It was the first country music station in the area. KOYL's air staff as a country music station has included Bill Myrick. It went silent in March 1991. History The Mid-Cities Broadcasting Co., owned by Edward and Lowell Roskelley, received the construction permit for KPBX on September 19, 1956. Before going on the air September 7, 1957, the station was given call letters KOYL, a nod to the importance of oil in the Permian Basin economy. A 1981 Book of Texas Lists would feature KOYL and fellow Odessa station KRIG, both named for the oil industry. KOYL became the first country music station in the area, broadcasting with 500 watts (later increased to 1,000). It also was the first new radio station in Odessa in a decade. KOYL's air staff as a country music station over the years included Bill Myrick, and guest disc jockeys Waylon Jennings and Johnny Dollar. Jennings and Dollar would continue to appear on KOYL after leaving the station as part of its regular \\"Voice of the Past\\" feature, hosted by former station DJs. Edward Roskelley also hosted the station's morning show as \\"Ross the Boss\\" for the 22 years he owned the station. On April 5, 1966, KOYL-FM signed on the air, offering separate programming and country music at night when KOYL was off the air. In 1979, Roskelley sold KOYL-AM-FM to Stream Broadcasting of Texas, Inc. Stream added nighttime service to KOYL, broadcasting with 79 watts. In March 1980, Stream split the FM station off as contemporary outlet KUFO-FM; it is now KODM. The second‚Äîand final‚Äîsale of KOYL occurred in 1985, to Pete C. Rodriquez, as Stream sold the AM and FM stations separately. Rodriquez, the owner of Odessa's Pan American Ballroom, immediately changed KOYL to a Spanish-language format. One of the reasons Rodriquez bought KOYL was because the existing Spanish-language station in town, KJJT, was co-owned with a competing venue and tended to ignore entertainers performing at the Pan American. (Continued) KOYL also relocated its studios after the sale. The sale, however, prompted a concern from the Associated Press, which in 1989 sued Stream Broadcasting for terminating its AP wire service contract for KOYL right before selling the station without notifying Rodriquez; the AP sought $23,525 in back payments. KOYL's license was eventually canceled in 1992 after the station was reported silent in March 1991 and its silent status was reaffirmed by the National Association of Broadcasters in a May 29, 1992 letter to the FCC on media ownership rules.

Sushkevich attended secondary school in Voronezh and studied in Berlin from 1906 to 1911. There he attended lectures of F. G. Frobenius, Issai Schur, and Hermann Schwarz. Sushkevich studied piano with L. V. Rostropovich, father of Mstislav Rostropovich. In 1906 he was a cello student at Stern Conservatory (now part of Berlin University of the Arts). In 1911 he moved to Saint Petersburg, graduating from the Imperial University in 1913. Moving to Kharkiv, Suskevich taught in secondary education while he pursued a graduate degree at Kharkov State University. His dissertation was The theory of operations as the general theory of groups. Obtaining the degree, he became an assistant professor at the university in 1918, and adjunct professor in 1920. Voronezh State University employed Sushkevich in 1921 as professor of mathematics. He published the first edition of his Higher Algebra (1923). He published a generalization of Cayley's theorem for certain finite semigroups in 1926.A. Sushkevich (1926) \\"√úber die Darstellung der eindeutig nicht umkehrbaren Gruppen mittels der verallgemeinerten Substitutionen\\", Matematicheskii Sbornik 33: 371‚Äì4 The next year he was in Moscow for the Russian Mathematical Congress, and the following year in Bologna for the International Congress of Mathematicians. In Kharkiv, the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics was established in 1929 with Sushkevich as a member. With a rising interest in abstract algebra, he wrote a second book on algebra: Foundations of Higher Algebra which was published both in Russian and Ukrainian. In 1933 he directed the Algebra & Number Theory section of Kharkov State University's department of mathematics. At that time Stalin caused a famine in Ukraine, the Holodomor, killing millions especially in rural areas. Suskevich survived to edit new editions of his textbook that included \\"new algebra\\": fields, integral domains, rings, ideals, and quaternions. His original work, The Theory of Generalized Groups (1937) opened up the area of semigroups.

She is Emeritus Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her research considers the development of algorithms for high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) data analysis. She was the first to demonstrate that GPS could be used to detect seismic waves. She was awarded the 2015 European Geosciences Union Christiaan Huygens Medal.  Early life and education  Larson was born in Southern California. Her father Valdemar F. Larson, \\"Swede\\", worked on the Deep Sea Drilling Project. She studied engineering science and mechanics at Harvard University and graduated in 1985. Larson joined the University of California, San Diego for her doctoral studies, and earned a PhD in geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1990. Her dissertation evaluated the accuracy of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and was supervised by Duncan Agnew. She was a member of the technical staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where she worked with the team that developed the GPS infrared positioning system, GIPSY.  Research and career  Larson was appointed to the faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1990. She developed new algorithms for the analysis of Global Positioning System (GPS) data. She used GPS to identify plate velocities, boundary zone deformation and ice sheet motion. She completed a visiting professorship at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Larson started to develop GPS for new applications in geoscience in 2000. She led a team of scientists that was the first to demonstrate that GPS could be used to detect seismic waves in 2003. Her approach was used to evaluate earthquake triggering near the Denali rupture zone. GPS seismology is now used routinely in earth surveillance, including in the monitoring of tsunamis as well as in seismic source models. Larson has also worked on hydrogeodesy, as well as advising the US Federal Government on geodetic infrastructure. Larson noticed that there were errors caused by the interference of GPS signals, which correlated with the water content in the surfaces close to the receiving antenna. She showed that geodetic GPS receivers can be used to detect the water content of soil, as well as the depth of snow, snow water equivalent, and vegetation water content. She first demonstrated this capability in 2012, when she transformed a GPS network to be capable of interferometric reflectometry (GPS IR). GPS-IR was used in the Earthscope Plate Boundary Observatory. Larson also showed that it is possible to measure sea level changes, which allows the monitoring of subsidence and ground motion caused by earthquakes. These GPS receivers act as tide gauges, and can be tied to a terrestrial reference frame. She used them to monitor tidal levels in Kachemak Bay, and found that GPS was in good agreement with records from traditional tide gauges. Larson showed that the strength of the GPS signal is correlated to the density of volcanic ash. In 2015 she became the first woman to win the European Geosciences Union Christiaan Huygens Medal. In 2017 she became a Humboldt Fellow at GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. She became an Emeritus Professor at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2018. = Awards and honours = * 2006: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Award, University of Tokyo * 2006: American Geophysical Union Geodesy Award * 2007: American Geophysical Union Bowie Lecture * 2011: 150th Jubilee Visiting Professor, Chalmers University of Technology * 2011: American Geophysical Union Fellow * 2013: University of Colorado Boulder Faculty Assembly Research Award * 2014: Fulbright Specialist, Mohammed V University at Agdal * 2014: Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Creativity Prize for Water * 2015: European Geosciences Union Christiaan Huygens Medal * 2017: Humboldt Foundation Research Prize * 2017: Chalmers University of Technology Honorary Doctorate * 2017: University of Colorado Boulder Governor's Award for High Impact Research * 2018: University of Colorado Boulder Research Lecture * 2019: Visiting Scholar, Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo * 2020: Fulbright Research Scholar, University of Tasmania = Selected publications =  References  Category:Women geophysicists Category:Geodesists Category:American geologists Category:American geodesists Category:American geophysicists Category:University of Colorado Boulder faculty Category:Scripps Institution of Oceanography alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Writers from California Category:Living people ","title":"Kristine M.

The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. In Deadhaus Sonata, players play undead classes in the House of the Dead and fight the living. Deadhaus Sonata focuses on its gameplay pillars of procedural generation, narrative driven design, Twitch integration, and cooperative asymmetric gameplay, as well as looting and fast-action combat. Deadhaus Sonata is the spiritual successor to Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. Gameplay Deadhaus Sonata is an online action role-playing game, where the player controls a single character from a third-person perspective, alone or with up to five other people. The player will fight hordes of enemies, collecting large amounts of loot, and fulfilling quests to gain experience points and more equipment. To increase re-playability, the game's levels are procedurally generated. Players can choose from seven available classes to play as; Vampires, Revenants, Liches, Ghouls, Wraiths, Wights, and Banshees. Each of these classes are aligned with one to three of the core attributes of the House of the Dead: Physical, Magickal, and Essential. Dyack has titled this 'the Trinary Archetype System', mentioning that many themes in Deadhaus Sonata will be influenced by the balance of these attributes in the world. Classes more aligned with Physical damage will be more effective at melee and non-magickal ranged damage. Magickal-aligned classes are more specialized in spellcasting, and essential-aligned classes are focused on the use of Artifacts, objects that have gained sentience from supernatural beings possessing them. Each class will have their own unique skill tree, allowing for specializing into different class archetypes. Apocalypse has also said that crafting equipment will play a large role in the game, but they have yet to be specific on how much. Deadhaus Sonata will be free-to-play with microtransactions, using the in-game currency, 'bones'. Apocalypse Studios has stated the game will have entirely ethical monetization, avoiding all pay-to- win aspects, referencing games like Path of Exile and their strictly cosmetic microtransaction system. Setting Deadhaus Sonata takes place in the Gothic and Lovecraftian world of Nogosaua. The house of the Dead has been created in a cosmic war between two Elder Gods, and the Dead must discover what has brought them back and what their purpose is. In Nogosaua, there are many houses beyond Deadhaus, and a large amount of the story in Deadhaus Sonata will be about the rival between the houses. Being a narrative-driven game, Deadhaus Sonata is influenced heavily by the works of H. P. Lovecraft, Steven Erikson, and Thomas Ligotti. Development =Pre-release= Deadhaus Sonata was announced on IGN on October 24, 2018. Dyack has referenced in many instances his inspirations for Deadhaus Sonata being his previous games, saying \\"We are combining elements of many of my past games into Deadhaus Sonata... There are Lovecraftian overtones from Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, the Gothic role-playing elements of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, where you are undead, and finally, some of the action RPG elements of Too Human\\". In an interview with VentureBeat, Dyack stated Deadhaus Sonata has a \\"10-year rollout cycle where we're believing in the community\\", once again stating Apocalypse' want to keep community-driven design a major part of the games' production.

It opened in 1986, and is currently open 24 hours a day offering meals, shower facilities, shelters, overnight accommodation, medical and psychiatric care to homeless people.  History  Die Gruft was founded in 1986 by Salvatorian pastor and theologian Albert Gabriel (then pastor at the Mariahilfer Church) with the support of students from the nearby Amerling-School. It originally served as a warming room for the homeless during advent.

It is the first game in the Links series to be published by Microsoft, which purchased Access Software a month prior to the game's release. Links Extreme features unusual game modes and courses that are not common to the sport of golf. Critics felt that the game's concept was not handled well, and its small selection of two courses was particularly criticized. Gameplay Links Extreme features game modes and courses that are unusual to the sport of golf. Among the four unique game modes is Armadillo Al's Demolition Driving Range, in which the player uses exploding golf balls to hit targets such as armadillos, cows, and hot air balloons. The Extreme Golf mode features 17 pranks which affect a player's golf ball in different ways that can be harmful or beneficial to the player. In the Deathmatch and Poison game modes, the player is given a variety of exploding golf balls that are used to injure and ultimately kill the opponent golfer. The Poison mode differs in that the player can choose between playing the course or attacking the opponent golfer. The game also includes stroke play. The game includes two courses. Mojo Bay is an 18-hole course with a haunted island theme featuring zombies, giant skeletons, swamp monsters, crocodiles, and a pirate ship. Dimension X is a nine-hole course with the theme of a World War I battlefield, including biplanes, damaged buildings, and explosions. Golfers are dressed in Generation X clothing, including baggy jeans and cargo pants. The game features several golf swing methods, including traditional two-click and three-click options. Also featured is a multiplayer mode with options such as modem and LAN play, as well as compatibility with MSN Gaming Zone. Development and release Links Extreme was developed by Access Software, using the same game engine as other Links games at the time. The game was announced in mid-1998, and its release was initially scheduled for October 11 of that year. Chris Jones, executive vice president for Access Software, described the game as \\"Indiana Jones meets Happy Gilmore on the golf course. It's designed for the golfer who wants to bend the rules, demolish some clubs, but most importantly, win at all costs.\\" Access Software acknowledged that the game was a risky idea, but believed that it would introduce golf to a broader audience, specifically younger gamers. The company stated that the game was not intended for the hardcore fans of the regular Links games. Microsoft purchased Access Software in April 1999, but had little involvement in the game, which was largely finished by that time. Links Extreme was the first Links game to be published by Microsoft. In the United States, the game was released for Microsoft Windows on May 27, 1999. In Australia, the game was published by Sega Ozisoft in mid-July 1999. Reception Critics felt that Links Extreme did not push its concept far enough, and that the concept was not handled well. Marc Saltzman of GamePro called it \\"a great idea gone horribly wrong,\\" and believed that Access Software could have done better at making a creative and fun game out of the concept. Shawn Nicholls of AllGame called the game \\"a mix of a good idea with poor execution,\\" but believed that it achieved its \\"off-the-wall\\" aspect. Gordon Goble of Gamecenter considered it an \\"intriguing alternative golfing concept that didn't translate well,\\" and called it a \\"dumbed-down\\" version of Links. Dan Egger of PC Gamer also considered it a good idea, but called the final product a \\"hall-assed attempt to make golf seem like an Aerosmith video\\". Egger felt that the game went only \\"halfway toward extremeness,\\" and that \\"few, if any, boundaries are ever pushed\\" in the game. He considered it a \\"hideously unsuccessful\\" spin-off of the main Links games. PC Accelerator called the game a \\"Moronic detraction\\" from the Links series. Jon Dickinson of GameZone wrote that there \\"could have been a lot more time and effort\\" put into the game. Some critics stated that the game quickly became boring due to its lack of variety. The limited course selection was particularly criticized. William Abner of Computer Games Strategy Plus praised the Mojo Bay course for being adequately difficult, while Edgar Dupree of IGN considered it superior to Dimension X, which Dupree called \\"a joke of a course\\" in comparison. Goble also praised Mojo Bay, and felt that the various background features on Dimension X were \\"so superimposed and pixelated, it's laughable.\\" He also felt that its World War I theme was out of place, describing it as \\"more weird than 'extreme.'\\" Nicholls enjoyed Dimension X over Mojo Bay, writing that it \\"is so well done, it's a shame it isn't the 18-hole course instead.\\" Sean Miller of The Electric Playground praised both courses and considered them interesting. Steven L. Kent stated that \\"the monsters and strange course designs detract from the action.\\" The driving range mode was especially criticized, in part because of its graphics and sound. Egger called the driving range a \\"slapped- together\\" feature that would only hold minimal interest, and Stephen Poole of GameSpot also felt that it had limited appeal. Abner considered the driving range shallow and forgettable, while Goble called it \\"annoyingly awful\\", and stated that it quickly became \\"absurdly boring\\". Kent called the driving range \\"a fun diversion\\". Abner considered Extreme Golf to be the best game mode, praising its humor. Miller also praised Extreme Golf, although Nicolls stated that it \\"doesn't hold much interest\\". Egger called the Deathmatch mode \\"utterly forgettable,\\" and Dickinson considered Poison to be the most entertaining game mode. The sound and music received some praise, including the Mojo Bay course music. Abner and Nicholls praised the game's graphics, although Dickinson was disappointed by them. Nicholls believed the golf swings and putting were too difficult. Some critics wondered who the game's target audience was; Dupree wrote that golf fans would dislike the \\"wacky game mechanics\\" while action gamers would find the game boring. Poole stated that the game \\"tries much too hard\\" to appeal to both golfers and action gamers, resulting in a poor product. Some critics noted a complete lack of online players to compete against on MSN Gaming Zone. Saltzman noted various game glitches, including long load times and crashes. Miller also noted long loading times, and Goble complained of sluggish artificial intelligence as well as crashing. Goble considered the game \\"disjointed and hurried\\"; in describing Armadillo Al's Demolition Driving Range, he wrote \\"when Al himself says his facility is located in west Texas and the manual says it's in Nevada, you know someone didn't have enough time to straighten things out before the game's release.\\" Dickinson also believed that the game felt \\"sort of unfinished.\\" Aaron Curtiss of Los Angeles Times described the game as \\"tasteless and boorish,\\" and called it \\"my kind of golf game,\\" stating that it would appeal to men who enjoy explosions. Doug Bedell of The Dallas Morning News considered it more entertaining than real golf or the traditional Links LS games.

One such quintic is birationally equivalent to the compactification of the Siegel modular variety A1,3(2). In mathematics, a Siegel modular variety or Siegel moduli space is an algebraic variety that parametrizes certain types of abelian varieties of a fixed dimension. More precisely, Siegel modular varieties are the moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian varieties of a fixed dimension. They are named after Carl Ludwig Siegel, the 20th-century German number theorist who introduced the varieties in 1943. Siegel modular varieties are the most basic examples of Shimura varieties. Siegel modular varieties generalize moduli spaces of elliptic curves to higher dimensions and play a central role in the theory of Siegel modular forms, which generalize classical modular forms to higher dimensions. They also have applications to black hole entropy and conformal field theory. Construction The Siegel modular variety Ag, which parametrize principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g, can be constructed as the complex analytic spaces constructed as the quotient of the Siegel upper half-space of degree g by the action of a symplectic group. Complex analytic spaces have naturally associated algebraic varieties by Serre's GAGA. The Siegel modular variety Ag(n), which parametrize principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g with a level n-structure, arises as the quotient of the Siegel upper half-space by the action of the principal congruence subgroup of level n of a symplectic group. A Siegel modular variety may also be constructed as a Shimura variety defined by the Shimura datum associated to a symplectic vector space. Properties The Siegel modular variety Ag has dimension g(g + 1)/2. Furthermore, it was shown by Yung-Sheng Tai, Eberhard Freitag, and David Mumford that Ag is of general type when g ‚â• 7. Siegel modular varieties can be compactified to obtain projective varieties. In particular, a compactification of A2(2) is birationally equivalent to the Segre cubic which is in fact rational. Similarly, a compactification of A2(3) is birationally equivalent to the Burkhardt quartic which is also rational. Another Siegel modular variety, denoted A1,3(2), has a compactification that is birationally equivalent to the Barth‚ÄìNieto quintic which is birationally equivalent to a modular Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold with Kodaira dimension zero. Applications Siegel modular forms arise as vector-valued differential forms on Siegel modular varieties. Siegel modular varieties have been used in conformal field theory via the theory of Siegel modular forms. In string theory, the function that naturally captures the microstates of black hole entropy in the D1D5P system of supersymmetric black holes is a Siegel modular form. See Section 1 of the paper. In 1968, Aleksei Parshin showed that the Mordell conjecture (now known as Faltings's theorem) would hold if the Shafarevich finiteness conjecture was true by introducing Parshin's trick. In 1983 and 1984, Gerd Faltings completed the proof of the Mordell conjecture by proving the Shafarevich finiteness conjecture. The main idea of Faltings' proof is the comparison of Faltings heights and naive heights via Siegel modular varieties.\\"Faltings relates the two notions of height by means of the Siegel moduli space....

She is a University Professor and a Canada Research Chair in Canadian Francophonie and Public Policies at the University of Ottawa. Cardinal was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2013 and honoured with the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques and Member of the Order of Canada. She was also the first coordinator of the francophone studies program at the University of Ottawa. Early life and education Cardinal was born in Hawkesbury, Ontario on July 13, 1959. She earned her Bachelor of Arts and Master's degree from the University of Ottawa before travelling to Paris for her PhD. Career After earning her PhD in 1987, Cardinal worked as a professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Ottawa. Beginning as an adjunct professor in 1987, she worked her way up to full professor in the School of Political Studies by 1995. From there, Cardinal served as president of the Network of Women's Researchers in French Ontario between 1999 and 2002. In this capacity, she published \\"The Commitment to Thinking: Writing in a Francophone Minority Community in Canada\\" and \\"Chronicles of a Chaotic Political Life: Ontario Francophone from 1986 to 1996.\\" Cardinal was subsequently hired as the Craig- Dobbin Chair of Canadian Studies at University College Dublin from 2002 to 2004. During this time, she simultaneously directed the academic journal \\"Politique et societies\\". She also collaborated with David Headon to create \\"Shaping Nations: Constitutionalism and Society in Australia and Canada,\\" which combined the scholarly work of both Canadian and Australian scholars to question the ideas of nationhood and national identity. In 2005, Cardinal was approached by Marcel Castonguay, director of the Coordinator of French Language Services (FLS), to conduct a study regarding the FLS and justice system. As part of the Coalition des intervenantes et intervenants francophones en justice, Cardinal published \\"Coalition des intervenantes et intervenants francophones en justice: a community innovation to increase the offer of French-language services in Ontario\\" with Marie-√àve Levert, Danielle Manton and Sonia Ouellet. In 2006, she held the Chair in Canadian Studies at the University of Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3 and co-chaired the International Association of Political Science RC 50 on Language and Politics until 2012.

In 2013, she was awarded the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. She also worked with Jacques de Courville Nicol to co-found the Movement for an Official Bilingual Capital of Canada. Cardinal stated she co-founded this movement to ensure \\"that French does not lose its legitimacy as a language in Canada.\\" The following year, Cardinal collaborated with Simon Jolivet and Isabelle Matte to publish \\"Le Qu√©bec et l'Irlande: culture, histoire, identit√©.\\" The book was a compilation of text to showcase the similarities between Irish Catholics and French Canadians in 19th century Quebec, such as historical, cultural, religious, social, political and identity ties. In February 2017, Cardinal was awarded the Bernard Grandma√Ætre Award from the from the Association of Francophone Communities of Ottawa for her commitment to the Francophone community. She was also named a Member of the Order of Canada for her public policy developments. Cardinal worked with fellow University of Ottawa professor S√©bastien Grammond to published a book \\"Une tradition et un droit, le S√©nat et la repr√©sentation de la francophonie canadienne\\" detailing how the French language played a role in shaping the Canadian Constitution, legislation and evolution of Canada. In October 2017, the Law Commission of Ontario nominated Cardinal to their Board of Governors and she was officially appointed in June 2018. In January 2018, Cardinal was named one of the top 10 influential francophone personalities by the Francopresse. In June 2018, she was awarded the Association des juristes d'expression fran√ßaise de l'Ontario (AJEFO) Order of Merit. The following month, Cardinal was appointed by the president of the University of Ottawa to create a mandate regarding the state of French on campus. Cardinal continued her writing and collaborated with Anne Gilbert, Michel Bock, Lucie Hotte, and Fran√ßois Charbonneau to co-edit \\"Ottawa, lieu de vie fran√ßais. The book focused on the impact Ottawa francophones had in shaping their city, from the 1960s to contemporary French Ottawa. Her co-edited book was named a finalist for the 2019 Canada Prize in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

It explains that merely measuring or questioning an individual's intentions or anticipated regret changes his or her subsequent behavior. The mere- measurement effect has been demonstrated in multiple behavioural contexts both general and specific. But it is most commonly used to explain consumer behaviour. In this context, the effect implies that simply questioning one‚Äôs intentions behind a purchase influences his or her decision making in the market. The most well-known coiner of the mere-measurement effect is Vicki Morwitz, a marketing professor at NYU who addressed the term in hers, Eric Johnson and David Schmittlein's article Does Measuring Intent Change Behaviour? Morwitz is well known for her demonstration of the effect in the context of purchasing behaviour. In 1993, she demonstrated that simply questioning people‚Äôs intentions towards buying a computer or car would increase the likelihood of purchasing these items. Alongside the mere- measurement hypothesis, Morwitz et al suggested a polarization hypothesis. It implies that the questioning of one‚Äôs intent to buy something would increase their purchase rate. Yet, repeatedly questioning one‚Äôs intent would decrease their purchase rate. Morwitz et al outlines four explanations of the mere- measurement effect in the context of consumer behaviour specifically. Apart from purchasing behaviour, Morwtiz has demonstrated the effect in other behaviours. For instance, in the context of survey validity and the behaviour of survey respondents, the mere act of formulating a way to report an answer to a survey question can influence a respondent‚Äôs actual response.  Explanations of the effect  In Does Measuring Intent Change Behaviour? Morwitz et al outlines two main explanations behind this effect. Firstly, answering one‚Äôs question on behavioural intention would increase accessibility towards their own attitude. Therefore, their subsequent behaviour will be more in line with the attitude driving it. Secondly, answering one‚Äôs intention question will cause one to carry out heavy cognitive work which may lead to an attitude and intention change, and finally a behavioural change. These are the two basic explanations of the mere-measurement effect and can be applied to multiple behavioural contexts. Yet, Gavan Fitzsimons and Morwitz expand these explanations more in depth in their later article written in 2004‚Äì The Mere- Measurement Effect: Why Does Measuring Intentions Change Actual Behavior. It expands on Morwtiz's previous two explanations of the effect into four proposed explanations for why measuring intentions has an effect on behaviour. The mere-measurement effect can result from either all, a few or one of these explanations. # Enhanced label accessibility‚Äì Questioning one‚Äôs intentions increase the salience of feelings and thoughts associated with engaging in a certain behaviour. # Increased attitude accessibility‚Äì It enhances the extent to which one can access their attitudes towards performing a behaviour, especially towards the most salient option within a set of choices. # Attitude polarisation‚Äì Measuring intent may lead to a polarisation of attitudes toward the most salient option and will therefore change the subsequent behaviour. # Enhanced intention accessibility‚Äì Questioning one‚Äôs intentions will make the performance of these intentions and specific behaviours more accessible as a whole.  Theoretical background  Many theories and past literature have made a connection between intention and subsequent behaviour before the term mere-measurement effect was invented. One example Morwitz et al refers to is Icek Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour, Martin Fishbein and Ajzen‚Äôs theory of reasoned action, as well as research conducted by Shepherd, Hardwich and Warshaw 1988.  Research into other behaviours  = Self-erasing error of prediction = This term was invented by Steven Sherman in 1980. He conducted an experiment and demonstrated the strong impact pre-behavioural, cognitive processes has on one‚Äôs decision-making and behaviour. Sherman found that participants over-predicted the probability of them performing a socially desirable behaviour. He concluded their errors of prediction as self-erasing. Moreover, participants were more likely to perform the specific behaviour after making these predictions. = Voting behaviour = A later demonstration of the effect was done by marketing professor at the University of Washington, Anthony Greenwald. In 1987, he demonstrated that students who were asked about their voting intentions were more likely to vote in elections than those who were not asked. Both Sherman and Greenwald showcase the effect predictions have on one‚Äôs thoughts about performing the actual behaviour and the behaviour itself. = Blood donation = In 2008, Gaston Godin, Paschal Sheeran, Mark T Conner and Marc Germain in their article ‚Äì Asking Questions Changes Behavior: Mere Measurement Effects on Frequency of Blood Donation demonstrated that completing a survey on the topic of blood donation increased the likelihood of a respondent to donate blood. = Physical activity = In 2011, Godin, Ariane B√©langer-Gravel, Steve Amireault, Marie-Claude Vohl, and Louis P√©russe showcased that completing a survey on participant's cognition towards leisurely and physical activity. The found that higher levels of physical activity was observed in participants that completed the questionnaire as opposed to participants that didn't.

Heim was a self-taught machinist with an ability to visualize complex mechanisms and mechanical processes that resulted in the creation of novel machines, machine tools, manufacturing methods and mechanical bearings and was granted 92 patents over his lifetime. His inventions ranged from machines to manufacture hats and automate the ironing of fold collars to precision grinders and industrial bearings used in automobiles, aircraft and machinery.  Early life  Born on a farm in New York in 1874, Heim was the second of five children born to Charles and Frederika Heim, both immigrants from Germany. In 1890, at the age of 16, Heim moved to Danbury, Connecticut, which, at that time, was one of the major centers for manufacturing hats in the United States. Heim took several odd jobs before taking a job as a machinist at one of the Danbury hat-making companies.Beth Savage, ‚ÄúRegistration Form for the Ball and Roller Bearing Company‚Äù, National Register of Historic Places, 25 August 1989; Section 8: 1  Inventions  Heim was an inventor of many types of machines, mechanical devices and manufacturing processes. In 1895, at the age of 21, Heim developed a hat-stiffening machine (Patent No. 573,876) that freed the operator from having to hold or manipulate the hat during the process of applying stiffening compound. Heim's invention saved time, improved quality and lowered the cost of stiffening hats. Heim subsequently developed six additional complementary hat-making machines that were bought by many local manufacturers. In 1901, a large multinational manufacturer of hat-making machinery purchased six of Heim's patents. In 1902, Heim developed a laundry machine for detachable, fold-over collars. At that time, collars worn by men and women were stiffened with starch, then ironed to form an almost razor sharp edge that caused irritation to a person's neck. Heim's invention was a machine designed to iron, dry and shape detachable fold-over collars in a once-through process. Its unique feature, and one that was very popular, was its ability to soften the razor-edge of starched and ironed collars.3 Heim received his first patent (780,750) for the ‚ÄúCollar Roller‚Äù in January 1903 and thereafter received seven additional patents for improvements and other types of collar and cuff ironing machines that he sold throughout North America, Europe and Asia. = Centerless Cylindrical Grinder = In 1910, Heim entered the nascent business of precision-made rolling type bearings and formed the Ball and Roller Bearing Company in Danbury, Connecticut. Heim first manufactured ball thrust, roller thrust and journal roller bearings mostly for machinery and vehicles. At that time, grinding processes used to manufacture the cylindrical rolls used in roller bearings were slow, tedious and costly. Most rolls were ground on center-type machines resembling lathes. The lack of suitable grinding machines for mass-production of bearing rolls, that were made from hardened steel, led Heim to develop a method for grinding rolls without centers.Encyclopedia of American Biography, ‚ÄúLewis R. Heim,‚Äù The American Historical Company, Vol. 35, 1966, 622-624 In late 1913, Heim conceived of a two-wheel grinding machine that used a slowly rotating regulating wheel for controlling roll rotation against a high-speed grinding wheel. Heim filed his first patent (1,210,937) for a two-wheel centerless cylindrical grinder using a regulating wheel in March 1915. Heim called his invention a double-ring wheel roll grinding machine that ground uniform cylindrical work (rolls) using the radial sides of the two wheels. In order to grind a succession of rolls and to induce automatic forward motion of the rolls through the grinding zone, Heim installed an inclined centerless carrier in between the two wheels. The machine was able to grind 100 rolls for every roll ground on center-type grinders, grind to precision dimensions and greatly reduce production costs. Following the double ring-wheel machine, Heim developed centerless grinders using the peripheral surfaces of the two wheels that became the standard configuration for all future centerless grinders. His machines used either inclined carriers (1,264,930) or forward tilted regulating wheels (1,579,933) to draw the work through the grinding zone. The machines were able to grind both uniform and non-uniform cylindrical work with later machines able to achieve extreme precision to within 0.00001 inch (0.25 microns) and perfectly round work. Heim also developed tools and methods for grinding cylindrical work with various profiles including tapered, headed, rings, concave and convex shapes and was granted a total of 28 patents for centerless grinding. Heim's invention of the two-wheel centerless grinder had an immediate and widespread impact on industry, especially the automobile industry that ground many small cylindrical parts for internal combustion engines and other components. Heim's centerless grinder was so novel at the time that many machine tool companies illegally copied and sold competing machines. Heim's machine played an important roll in the development of automatic machine tools that was recognized by the Smithsonian Institute in its exhibit on grinding during the Hall of Tools exhibition presented in 1964. = Spherical Rod End Bearing = Heim was the original inventor of the Spherical Rod End Bearing that became known as the ‚ÄúHeim Joint‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeim Rod End‚Äù. In 1942, at the request of the US Army Air Force, Heim developed a four-piece spherical bearing for installation in the control system of fighter aircraft to improve maneuverability.\\"Fairfield War Plant Beats Nazis At Own Game\\", Bridgeport Sunday Post, April 23, 1944. Heim's bearing consisted of a ball with a drilled-through hole, a threaded shaft (rod) that contained a circular head forming the outer race, and two soft-metal bushings that sealed the ball into the head. The threaded shaft allowed the rod end of the bearing to be connected to a moving component and adjusted as necessary for a tight connection. On September 29, 1942, Heim filed his first patent application for the four-piece rod end bearing that was granted patent number 2,366,668 on January 2, 1945. In the fall of 1942, after testing against competing designs, the US Army Air Force awarded the Heim Company of Fairfield, Connecticut, the sole contract to produce spherical rod end bearings. Shortly thereafter, in order to help the war effort, Heim licensed the Rose Bearings Company of Saxilby, UK to manufacture rod end bearings for British aircraft. With its ability to handle misalignment and relatively heavy loads in linkages transmitting motion or power, Heim's rod end bearing was installed in most US and Allied aircraft by the end of World War II. Subsequently, Heim developed improvements to his rod end bearing as well as machines and methods used in its manufacture. Following the development of the rod end bearing, Heim developed spherical plain bearings that omitted the long rod that was used in textile looms, levers and general machinery. Later, starting around 1953, Heim developed designs, machines and methods for manufacturing two-piece spherical bearings (plain and rod end types) using various swaging methods such as those disclosed in patent 2,787,048.Robert V. Jacobs, ‚ÄúLewis R. Heim: Mechanical Genius of Modern Industry‚Äù, The Connecticut Press, 2019 Similar methods were also used to manufacture ball and roller bearings with unbroken races that eliminated the need for slots or notches used to insert the rolling elements. Slots and notches created breaks in the smooth race surfaces that accelerated wear that reduced the life of the bearing. Heim developed machines and methods, such as those in patents 2,910,765 & 2,913,810, for expanding or contracting metal components that allowed for the manufacture of bearings with perfectly smooth races. These bearings contained a full complement of balls or rollers that made the bearing suitable for higher load ratings as well as extending its operating life. Many of Heim's machines and methods developed in the 1950s and 1960s continue to be employed in the manufacture of modern rolling bearings.

History KWUN received its construction permit in 1961 and began regular broadcasts on September 30, after a three-year fight to convince the Federal Communications Commission that there was room to place an additional radio station in Concord. The original owners of the station were the Service Broadcasting Company, helmed by Don Reeves. Before that date, however, the five-tower transmitter site in the Kirker Pass hills lost a tower when engineer Tony Russell, blinded by the afternoon sun, drove into a guy wire supporting one of the towers, sending it crashing onto his car and missing Russell by six inches. KWUN, Inc., bought the station in 1963, followed by a sale to Kestner and Goldman Incorporated in 1967. The Kestner family bought out the Goldman family in 1968, and Adler Communications acquired it in 1971. Arthur C. Youngberg acquired the station in 1977, selling to Burgundy Broadcasting four years later. Through the various owners, KWUN maintained a music format with local programs for listeners in Contra Costa County. KWUN was sold in 1986 to the Concord Area Broadcasting Corporation, controlled by Chester P. Coleman. The station changed its call letters in 1993 to KKIS, which had previously been the call letters of 990 AM (now KATD). It then became KRHT in 1996 and KCKC in 2001. One final change came in 2002 when Coleman switched the call letters of KCKC and the 840 station in Long Island, Alaska, then KABN. The constant changes in call letters were matched by technical uncertainties. In 1993, the station lost the land lease on its transmitter site, on which upscale homes were built; for its last 7 years, it operated with an interim 25-watt site broadcasting traffic and weather reports as Coleman sought to sell the license. It went silent in 2004, and the license was not renewed, expiring December 1, 2005.

The film is set around Margarita Island. Synopsis Chucho is a stingray, searching for something to eat, but he only comes across rotten sea snails. F√©lix, a fisherman, is catching these snails when his line gets caught ‚Äî he dives into the water to cut himself loose, then sees Chucho caught up; he imagines the stingray as his own meal and brings him on board. Waking up on the boat, Chucho spots a healthy snail and steals it, diving into the sea. Felix gives chase and the two get to explore the sea life, until a mountain of trash falls on them. Felix struggles back to the surface as Chucho gives the snail to his children. Felix tries fishing again, turning up garbage. A party boat called \\"Fast and Furious\\" sails past, blasting music and dumping their rubbish in the sea. Production The 5-minute film took a year to produce. Rodr√≠guez described the animation process \\"complex\\", saying the reason why the film is only a short is to keep it a quality product while working within those constraints. He has also suggested it allows the production company the possibility of short sequels. The film intends to encourage its viewers to help the ecology, particularly of Nueva Esparta state, where human activities can damage the environment. The film score was designed to \\"give a magical connection\\" to the indigenous music of the Margarita/Eastern Venezuela region. The fisherman Felix is voiced by Luis Carre√±o, the voice actor who plays SpongeBob SquarePants in Latin America. Release Rodriguez gives an interview about the film The film was an official selection at the Short Films Corner of the Cannes Film Festival in May 2011. The film was co-produced with 20th Century Fox. It began showing in Venezuelan cinemas in August 2011, as an animated special shown before the Fox film X-Men: First Class. In December 2016, it began screening as VOD through the media channels of the Venezuelan El Est√≠mulo. In January 2013, it was in the catalogue of the first films to be shown at the San Cristobal Cinematheque Hall for its opening; all the films were animated, with the event mostly attended by children, because the hall contains a film library and resources with the aim to promote cinema to new generations. It was still on the festival circuit in 2016, being shown at the 11th Santo Domingo International Children's Film Festival. Response The film has been described as \\"one of the first Venezuelan films to touch on the topic of ecology\\". At the 2011 Margarita Latin American and Caribbean Film Festival, the film won the award for Best Short or Medium Length National Fiction film, awarded by the Venezuelan Association of Film Exhibitors. In 2013, the Margarita Gastronomy Festival itinerary included an event attempting to make the world's biggest Stingray Pie, a delicacy of the region; this alerted environmentalist groups, who wrote that the film had warned of such a situation threatening the sustainability and should have been learned from.

They remained unidentified until they were both identified using GEDmatch in early 2019. While unidentified, Whitt was nicknamed Mebane Child and the Boy Under the Billboard. Discovery On May 13, 1998, the nude body of an Asian female was found on the side of a road parallel to Interstate 85 in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The victim had been bound at the wrists, with ligature marks present upon her discovery. An autopsy determined her cause of death as suffocation. On September 25, 1998, a landscaping crew cutting grass under a billboard along Industrial Drive along Interstate 85 and Interstate 40 in Mebane, North Carolina discovered the skeletal remains of a young boy. There was no sign of trauma at the scene and was likely that the child was killed elsewhere. The child was wearing khaki shorts, white socks and matching underwear, and black and white shoes that appeared to have been purchased recently. $50 was found in the pocket. The child had straight, dark brown hair about 3 to 4 inches in length, likely had a light brown to fair complexion, and likely had brown eyes. The boy was initially thought to have been Hispanic and possibly a migrant worker. The boy had no fillings, but preventative dental sealing in multiple teeth, as well as a slight overbite with erupting upper canines, which may have been noticeable when he smiled or spoke. The boy likely died during the spring or summer of 1998. Investigation Sketches of the decedents were created in attempts to identify them, but to no avail. The boy's case received wider attention. Through the use of forensic palynology and isotope analysis, it was determined that the boy was originally from the southeastern United States, particularly Alabama and Georgia. Forensic artist Frank Bender created a clay reconstruction in 2010. It would be Bender's last case he worked on before dying of cancer in 2011. The boy's case was also given to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, where they created multiple reconstructions using CG technology. In October 2018, 20 years after the boy's discovery, more details about the boy's case were released. The cause of death was determined to be strangulation, and through further genetic testing determined that the boy was not of Hispanic descent, but was biracial; being of European and East Asian descent. The details also narrowed the time of death to be around June or July 1998. Additional photographs of the crime scene were also released to the public. Identification In December 2018, Dr. Barbara Rae-Venter, who is known for her work in identifying the Golden State Killer, reviewed the boy's latest DNA tests, and matched his DNA to the DNA of a relative who submitted the information into the GEDmatch database. After contacting the relative, a first cousin from Hawaii, the relative confirmed the identity of the boy as Robert \\"Bobby\\" Adam Whitt. Whitt's extended family, who lived in Ohio, did not report Whitt missing because they were under the assumption that he was sent to live with his mother in her native South Korea. Based on this information, investigators suspected that Whitt's mother was also killed. Shortly thereafter, NCMEC helped investigators find a case of an unidentified woman found in Spartanburg County matching the description of Whitt's mother. After a DNA comparison, the unidentified woman was identified as Myoung Hwa Cho. Shortly after Whitt and Cho's identifications, Whitt's father, John Russell Whitt, who was serving a prison sentence for armed robbery in FCI Ashland and is not scheduled for release until 2037, confessed to the murders of Whitt and Cho. It is believed that Whitt killed Cho in Concord on May 12, 1998 and dumped her body in Spartanburg. According to Whitt's indictment, it alleges that Bobby was killed on July 29, 1998 in Concord and was dumped in Mebane. Police are determining whether the jurisdiction lies in North Carolina or South Carolina. In May 2019, a grand jury in Orange County indicted Whitt on first-degree murder charges in Bobby's murder as well as charges for the concealment of his murder.

The Taipei District Court ruled in March 2001 that the three legislators were to serve 59 days in prison.

Characteristics It has hanging shoots and very small, thick and fleshy, succulent, button-like leaves that may entwine and weave in and out of each other.World Plants: Synonymic Checklists of the Vascular Plants of the World =Habitat= An epiphyte, the plant grows in tropical forests in North and South America on trees and can also be found crawling on rock cracks, rotten logs and the forest ground as well, preferring moisture and shaded conditions. Their USDA hardiness zone is 10a to 11b: from 30 ¬∞F (‚àí1.1 ¬∞C) to 50 ¬∞F (+10 ¬∞C). Cultivation The plant does best in hanging baskets, where it can cascade and also in terrariums. The species require high humidity, especially when it is warm, though they are very sensitive to overwatering, where they would wilt or have scab-like bumps on their leaves. They grow well in steadily moist soils. Summer temperatures should exceed 24 ¬∞C and in winter it should not be lower than 16 ¬∞C.Dawid Longman: Nurturing house plants . Warsaw: PWR and L, 1997.

Upon his return home, Posculo held the distinction of being the first to teach both Greek and Latin in Brescia. Life Posculo was born in Brescia with family roots in nearby Bagnolo Mella. His father, Maffeo Posculo, was a notaio who had done well enough in his profession to afford Posculo's studies. Posculo most likely studied first under Tommaso Seneca da Camerino and later Gabriele da Concorezzo in Brescia, but while still an adolescent left for Ferrara to learn Greek from Guarino da Verona. It was here that Posculo determined to follow the same path that a number of other Italian humanists had taken (including Guarino da Verona) to perfect their Greek by studying in Constantinople for an extended period of time. Posculo chose to do this in 1452 and while there most likely continued his study of Greek with John Argyropoulos (marginalia in two manuscripts containing works by Posculo identify John Agyropoulos as Posculo's teacher in Constantinople). For a recent assessment of Argyopoulos and the milieu of scholars who taught alongside him, see Zorzi 2017/2018, 310-313. It is unclear whether Posculo participated in the defense of Constantinople, but the detail he is able to provide in the Constantinopolis about the positions of the defenders suggests he may have been among those stationed along the walls. What is more certain is that after Constantinople fell, Posculo was taken prisoner, sold as a slave, and held in Pera, thus compelling him to secure ransom. After a year his ransom had been paid, but before he was even able to leave the Aegean Sea, Posculo was captured by pirates and nearly sold into slavery a second time on the island of Rhodes. Through the assistance of Hospitaller Knights, Posculo was able to escape and eventually return to Italy in 1455. The entrance to Posculo's school is thought to be at Corso Giacomo Matteotti, 19 where a pillar bearing a Hospitaller cross (upper right in this picture) and architrave from the original structure stands enclosed within the edifice of the current building. Brescia was not Posculo's first destination upon returning to Italy. Instead, he remained in Rome for three years under the patronage of Domenico Capranica and later under his brother Angelo Caprianica. In the meantime, he began composing the Constantinopolis and the De Laudibus Brixiae Oratio. Upon returning to Brescia in 1459, Posculo opened a school which bore the distinction of being the first to offer Greek in Brescia. He taught in this school until his death, and throughout this time continued to compose additional works, but quite likely never traveled beyond Brescia again. The family tomb inscription he commissioned with his brother still stands in the church of San Franceso where Posculo was buried. Posculo's funeral inscription is currently hidden by the confessional which is pictured here and situated immediately to the left of the public entrance to the church He died as someone well known in his region for his skill in teaching Greek and Latin and was respected by contemporary humanists who knew him. A few epigrams in praise of Posculo have survived in a manuscript containing the Constantinopolis and the De Laudibus (Oxford Bodleian Canon. Class. lat. 120 55r), the first by Michele Carrara and the second by an individual who identifies himself only as ‚ÄúMagister G‚Äù: :::Praise of Posculo by Michele Carrara ::::Dum lupus in mugilum nativa exarserit ira, ::::dum geret in folles odia tanta canis, ::::carmine clara tuo vivent monimenta Pelasgum, ::::nomina Ubertini tempora nulla terent. ::::\\"As long as the sea bass by nature burns with anger for the mullet ::::as long as the dog harbors great hatred for the ball, ::::the distinguished monuments of the Pelasgians will live on through your poem ::::the passage of time will not wear away the name of Ubertino.\\" :::Praise of Posculo by \\"Magister G\\" ::::Constantini urbis casus, quem, Poscule vates, ::::scripsisti egregie, vivet dum robora tellus, ::::dum coelum stellas, dum vehet amnis aquas. ::::\\"The fall of Constantinople, which you, O Posculo the prophet ::::wrote so marvelously, will live so long as the earth bears the oak, ::::so long as the sky the stars, so long as the river the waters.\\" Prose assessments by authors in generations proximal to Posculo's lifetime are similarly laudatory. Works =Ultima Visio Danielis Prophetae= A translation from the Greek original into Latin in the year 1454, most likely in the months immediately following his release from slavery under an unidentified Ottoman. A prefatory sentence in the one manuscript containing this work identifies the translation as ad verbum or ‚Äúword for word.‚Äù The content of this brief work by Pseudo-Methodius of Patara presents an apocalyptic future closely linked to the destruction of Constantinople with special emphasis on the role that Muslim empires would play in bringing this about. =Constantinopolis= Composed between the time Posculo arrived in Rome in 1455 and completed at some point close to 1460. This Latin hexameter epic poem in four books with 3,007 verses recounts the events leading up to the fall of the city in books 1‚Äì2 followed by a description of the fall itself in books 3‚Äì4. The style is aspirationally Vergilian, but intertextual references to authors other than Vergil abound. In effect, this poem serves as Posculo's Iliad and it brought him notoriety in Brescia and the surrounding region in the 15th century. This poem has received considerable attention in recent years including a translation of Book 4 by D√©roche with notes by Therry Ganchou in French (2012), a translation and historical commentary of Book 4 in Italian by Francesco Macinanti as an M.A. thesis (2017), and a translation and philological commentary of Book 4 in English by Bryan Whitchurch as a Ph.D. dissertation (2019). =De Laudibus Brixiae Oratio= Composed between the time Posculo arrived in Rome in 1455 and when he recited the speech before the Grand Council of Brescia on the occasion of his return home in 1459. If the Constantinopolis can count at Posculo's Iliad, the opening chapter of the De Laudibus (approximately 676 words) might be seen as Posculo's Odyssey. Beyond the opening chapter, the De Laudibus is an encomium in praise of Brescia and its citizens. To accomplish this, Posculo begins by praising the climate of the city, its ancient history, the fertility of the land, the activities of its inhabitants including their brave defense against the siege Milan laid upon the city when Posculo was roughly eight years old, the natural beauty of Brescia, and finally the virtues of its inhabitants not the least of which is their piety toward God. This speech has garnered considerable attention from scholars in Brescia, most significantly in the work of Valseriati 2009. =Symonidos= Composed shortly after the death of two year old Simon of Trent in 1475, whose death served as the catalyst for a vicious initiative headed by Johannes Hinderbach to hold the Jews of the city accountable. It is a two book hexametrical poem in hagiographic style on the life, martyrdom, and miracles brought about by Simon of Trent. The work continued to see revisions and additions in the form of prefatory distichs and a letter well into the 1480s. It was one among several literary projects sponsored by Hinderbach to inflame antisemitic sentiment throughout the region and beyond. Unlike the other works of Posculo, this poem was printed and in distribution well past 1511. Current research on the interpretation and historical analysis of the Symonidos is represented by the work of Stephen Bowd. =Lost works= Brescian historian Ottavio Rossi (1570‚Äì1630) reports two additional Latin works of Posculo which are now lost. One recounts the 1438 siege of Brescia by Milan in seven books of hexameters, De Obsidione Brixiae Libri VII, and the other in elegiac couplets, De Antiqua Urbe et Agro Brixiano, appears to mix a number of genres by recounting the history of the city and agriculture of the region. There is also some evidence of Greek works, though it is limited to a single couplet in praise of historiographer Elia Capriolo in a manuscript that has been documented in catalogs, but to date attempts to recover it have been unsuccessful. Recent research on the Padova manuscript containing the Constantinopolis and the Ultima Visio has argued on paleographical and codicological grounds that Latin translation of the Life of Andreas Salos may also be considered among the works of Posculo.

Poly.) is an epistle attributed to Ignatius of Antioch, a second-century bishop of Antioch, and addressed to Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna. It was written during Ignatius' transport from Antioch to his execution in Rome.H. Burn-Murdoch, Church, Continuity and Unity (Cambridge University Press, 2014) p. 120 Composition To Polycarp is one of seven epistles attributed to Ignatius that are generally accepted as authentic. In 5th century, this collection was enlarged by spurious letters.\\"Spurious Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch\\" at NewAdvent.org It is clear that To Polycarp was written soon before the martyrdom of Ignatius, but it is uncertain when precisely this martyrdom occurred. Tradition places the martyrdom of Ignatius in the reign of Trajan, who was emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. While many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. Richard Pervo dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD, and British classicist Timothy Barnes has argued for a date some time in the 140s AD. Content The epistle contains various exhortations about morally correct behavior, and warnings against false doctrines (Ign. Poly. 2-5). Ignatius also rejoices at the fact that his home church of Antioch is now \\"at peace\\": Scholars such as Pearcy Neale Harrison have argued that Ignatius must be referring to some sort of schism in the Antiochene church which had recently been resolved. Ignatius then asks Polycarp to send a letter to the church in Antioch, congratulating and encouraging them for having resolved their schism: Ignatius then requests that Polycarp send letters to various churches in Asia Minor, asking them to also send letters of congratulation to Ignatius' home church in Antioch: Polycarp seems to have responded to this request in Chapter 13 of his epistle to the Philippians, where he refers to a request of Ignatius that the Philippians send a letter to the church in Antioch.

It was the first novel by a Chinese diaspora writer to be published in Australia, and the first Chinese-language novel to be published in Australia and possibly in the West. On first publication the author was identified by the alias Jiangxiaerlang. Subsequent research has identified the writer as Wong Shee Ping, a newspaper editor, Christian preacher and republican revolutionary also known as Wong Yau Kung. \\"The Social Lens\\": an illustration from the Chinese Times, Melbourne, that accompanied each installment of The Poison of Polygamy  Plot  The novel opens in the Qing dynasty in the 1850s during the Victorian gold rush. The main character, Huang Shangkang, lives in a village in Guangdong province with his wife Ma and is addicted to opium. He and Ma have been married for three years, have no children, and are struggling to pay Shangkang's debts. When Shangkang's mother becomes ill, Ma pawns her few possessions to pay for doctors, but their remedies do not work and the old woman dies. The couple descend further into poverty until they receive a visit from Ma's cousin, who has made his fortune in the Victorian goldrush. The cousin offers to pay for Shangkang's passage to Australia on condition that he give up opium. Shangkang agrees and departs for Victoria. The novel describes the voyage from Hong Kong to Victoria via South Australia, life on the Victorian goldfields and in Melbourne's Chinatown, and events back in Guangdong, where Ma waits for news of Shangkang. Although set during the second half of the 19th century, the story was written during the first decade of the Australian Federation and just before the end of the Qing Dynasty. It also describes interactions between Chinese Australians and Aboriginal Australians, European colonists, and the Australian bush, and commentary on the status of women in Chinese society.  Publication and translation history  The novel, written in Literary Chinese, was first published in 53 installments in the Chinese Times newspaper in Melbourne, between 5 June 1909 and 10 December 1910. Each installment was accompanied by an illustration of a young boy holding up a mirror to the Chinese character for \\"Society\\". Its author Wong Shee Ping was an editor of the newspaper. It was rediscovered by historian Mei-fen Kuo while she was researching early Chinese-Australian newspapers. The first English translation of the novel, by Ely Finch, was published by Sydney University Press in 2019 in a bilingual parallel edition with historical commentary by Mei-fen Kuo and Michael Williams.

Keene The Chapel of St Mary on the Bridge, commonly known as the Bridge Chapel, was built on the first arch of a medieval bridge over the River Derwent; the springing of the arch can be seen below the east wall. It now stands beside the 18th-century St Mary's Bridge, which replaced the medieval bridge. The precise date when the first bridge chapel came into existence is uncertain, but it is likely to have been the late 13th or early 14th century. The south elevation has a timber-framed gable over a 15th-century stone-mullioned window with modern leaded lights. The original building was of stone, but some restoration is in brick with tile slips. The interior is small and aisleless. The north wall has a lychnoscope. It is one of only six bridge chapels left in England. The building has had other uses including as a prison and a carpenter's workshop. It was restored in 1930 in memory of Alfred Seale Haslam, a former Mayor of Derby, using funds from his family. An incised slate tablet on the north side records the names of three Catholic priests, Nicholas Garlick, Robert Ludlum and Richard Simpson, who on 24 July 1588 were martyred near here.

The Squadron's role was to provide geodetic surveys, survey control for topographic mapping, map compilation, identification/spot and supplementary air photography and field completion of compiled maps. It also supported the PNG Defence Force and provided advice to PNG National Mapping Bureau on all aspects of survey and mapping.Laing, A.W. Colonel (Retd) RA Svy, The End of an Era ‚Äì A short history of the Royal Australian Survey Corps' involvement in mapping, charting and geodesy in Papua New Guinea in the period 1942‚Äì1995 unpublished 1995 The unit was based at Popondetta (January 1972 ‚Äì June 1975), then Wewak (June 1975 ‚Äì June 1980) and then Port Moresby (June 1980 ‚Äì December 1995). Although based in these towns, the unit operated across the entire country from the border with Indonesia in the west to Bougainville in the east. The squadron served full-time in PNG from it being a Territory of Australia, to self government in December 1973, to Independence on 16 September 1975 and then for another 20 years. After Independence the survey and mapping assistance was under the auspices of Australia's Defence Cooperation Program. Unit accommodation at Popondetta in the Northern District was in the recently vacated District Engineers Office (Royal Australian Engineers) which had moved to Mendi in the Southern Highlands. When the unit moved to Wewak in July 1975 it was accommodated in Moem Barracks on Cape Moem, the home of the 2nd Battalion, Pacific Islands Regiment. With the 1:100,000 mapping programme complete in 1980, the unit (much reduced in personnel) then moved to Port Moresby. Like any military unit there were often miscellaneous tasks to be done. Popondetta is located between Kokoda and the Gona-Sanananda- Buna Second World War battlefield sites and large airbase complexes around Dobodura. The unit was often called upon to assist with Explosive Ordnance Demolition tasks in those areas. Mount Lamington, a volcano which exploded in 1951 killing more than 3000 people up to 14km away, is 20km south-west of Popondetta. One of the daily duties of the Squadron was to observe the vertical angle, by theodolite, to the mountaintop to compute any apparent change in height. Results were reported to the Rabaul Vulcanology Observatory.Jensen,P.A.,Personal notes having served with 1 Fd Svy Sqn in TPNG 1970, with 4 Fd Svy Sqn in TPNG 1973 and 8 Fd Svy Sqn in PNG 1974‚Äì75 Unit structure and its people Headquarters 8 Fd Svy Sqn at Popondetta 8 Fd Svy Sqn was raised at Popondetta in December 1971 with an establishment of two officers and eighteen other ranks (1 x Major Officer Commanding, 1 x Lieutenant Troop Officer and Second-in-Command, 1 x Staff Sergeant QuarterMaster Sergeant, 1 x Sergeant Chief Clerk, 1 x Staff Sergeant Topographic Surveyor, 1 x Sergeant Topographic Surveyor, 4 x Corporal Topographic Surveyor, 8 x Sapper Topographic Surveyor, 1 x Private Cook, 1 x Private Storeman).

Four members of the squadron were awarded the PNG Independence Medal. Postings for single and married male soldiers with families were normally for one and two years respectively. For most wives and families, life there especially in the very tropical and small town Popondetta was something which they had never experienced before and pre-arrival information did not quite cover reality. There were few of the conveniences and supports of home, but they formed their own groups and integrated with the community which was essential during the long and frequent absences of their surveyor soldiers.Defence Widow Support Group ACT, 2012, Here There & Away ‚Äì Voices of the families of those who served, Big Sky Publishing Pty Ltd, p271 Dawn Laing, Christmas in Popondetta; p282 Tosha McHenry, No Worries!; p160 Dawn Laing, The Bedtime Story. Background During the Second World War, Australian and United States Army survey units produced nearly 400 surveyed maps for military operations in Papua, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville. The end of the war saw the cessation of most topographic surveys, except for economic development projects, although it was known that there were large areas where mapping was terribly inadequate with errors of tens of miles in position and thousands of feet in height. Many aircraft were lost during the war because of the state of air charting. From the mid-1950s surveys of PNG were once again a high priority for the Australian Government. RA Svy conducted surveys with Australia based units in conjunction with US forces in the mid-1950s and with the Australian Division of National Mapping in the early-mid-1960s. There remained a huge need for field survey and by the end of the 1960s Army decided to raise a new field survey unit (8 Fd Svy Sqn) to be based permanently in the Territory of Papua New Guinea. A large part of the unit's work was related to the dual purpose defence and civilian mapping programme of 278 scale 1:100,000 topographic line maps covering the entire country, large scale urban orthophotomaps and working with the Royal Australian Navy on beach surveys of much of the coastline. The scale 1:100,000 mapping programme was completed in 1980. Cartographically derived scale 1:250,000 Joint Operations Graphic ‚Äì Ground (JOG) and the companion JOG ‚Äì Air were completed in 1982. In the 1970s up to 60% of the Royal Australian Survey Corps' capability was engaged on PNG surveys and mapping. 8 Fd Svy Sqn, assisted by 1, 2 and 4 Fd Svy Sqns, completed the geodetic and topographic surveys, acquired survey point identification/spot and supplementary air photography and field checked compiled/preliminary maps. All five field survey squadrons (Australia and PNG based) compiled maps on photogrammetric stereo-plotters using mainly Skai Piksa photography; and Army Survey Regiment photogrammetrically triangulated the air photography, compiled maps using photogrammetric stereo-plotters, cartographically completed and printed the maps, and cartographically derived and printed the JOG.Coulthard-Clark, CD, 2000, Australia's Military Mapmakers ‚Äì The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915‚Äì96, Oxford University Press, On 26 June 1980 the Australian High Commissioner for PNG presented a complete three volume Atlas of the maps in the 1:100,000 series to the Prime Minister of PNG, Sir Julius Chan. The preface to this atlas states, in part: ‚ÄúThe Royal Australian Survey Corps during and since World War II has been engaged almost continuously upon a programme of Survey and Mapping in PNG. The work has been undertaken with the assistance and co-operation of all Arms and Services of the Australian Defence Force, Papua New Guinea Defence Force, members of the National Mapping Bureau PNG, Division of National Mapping Australia, Royal Engineers Survey (UK), Royal Air Force (UK), Army Map Service United States Army, United States Navy, United States Air Force and numerous expatriate civilians in PNG and PNG Nationals who assisted survey parties in the field on a variety of supporting tasks in the jungles, swamps and mountain peaks of their Country.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. At a time when PNG is assuming a position of increasing prominence in the world and regional affairs, I hope this atlas of topographic maps will promote further understanding of the challenge of its environment and will contribute to the successful utilisation of its resources for the benefit of all its peoples and their neighbours\\". Puniard, D.J., Australias' Role in the Mapping of Papua New Guinea ‚Äì from Colonial Outpost to Independent Nation proceedings 100 Years of National Topographic Mapping Conference, Mapping Sciences Institute Australia 2011 Two cornerstones for the success of the survey and mapping programmes were the Geodetic Survey of Papua New Guinea and high altitude (40,000 feet) medium scale mapping photography (Wild RC10 cameras 88.5mm focal length - superwide angle), flown by No. 2 Squadron RAAF Canberra bombers on Operation Skai Piksa. Skai Piksa completed 90 percent of national coverage, mostly cloud free, in the first year 1973 and completed the task by the end of 1975. RA Svy topographic surveyors planned the photography flight lines and provided quality assessments to ensure that the photography met the high technical standards for the subsequent mapping processes. The Corps also acquired substitute photography in some cloud areas after Operation Skai Piksa. The geodetic survey commenced with New Britain (Project Xylon 1954-55) and New Ireland/New Hanover/New Britain/Green /Dyaul/Tabar/Lihir/Tanga/Anir Islands and the Duke of York group (Project Cutlass 1956-57) ship-to-shore triangulation surveys conducted jointly by New Guinea Field Survey Unit ‚Äì RA Svy, raised for these operations with men mainly from Topographic Squadron (Topo Sqn), AHQ Survey Regiment, and US Army Map Service. These operations were particularly arduous, each being about 12 months long. The high order astronomic/triangulation/trilateration network through the Papua and New Guinea highlands was undertaken by Australia's Division of National Mapping (DNM) 1962‚Äì1965.Johnson, HA, DNM The High Level Geodetic Survey of New Guinea (formerly Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy,including active service in Second World War) In 1962 and 1963 Topo Sqn AHQ Svy Regt undertook a high order coastal traverse around mainland Papua and New Guinea with intersections to the DNM highlands survey when the beacons were visible.Lovejoy, V, 2003, Mapmakers of Fortuna - A History of the Army Survey Regiment, Ex-Fortuna Survey Association Incorporated, The rapid progress of surveys in the 1960s would not have been possible if it was not for the technological development of the microwave electronic distance measurement man-portable system Tellurometer and using helicopters capable of positioning and resupplying survey parties on high altitude survey stations between 10,000 feet and 15,000 feet above sea level. In 1963 the Australian Government was very concerned about the land border with Indonesia and RA Svy used a new Radar Airborne Profile Recorder to map the border area. This required additional horizontal and vertical control such that height contours could be mapped. At the same time a US Air Force airborne High Frequency Ranging and Navigation (HIRAN) trilateration network measuring long lines between ground stations connected Australia, Papua, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and Buka (Bougainville) to a wider South West Pacific Survey which linked to North America.Wise, Paul,The South West Pacific Survey All of these surveys contributed to the 1966 Australian geodetic network adjustment and the resulting coordinate set in the Australian Geodetic Datum 1966. In 1964, Topo Sqn AHQ Svy Regt undertook a three year program of topographic survey control for scale 1:100,000 mapping of a three degree longitude band east of the land border with Indonesia. Horizontal control was by trilateration network using a new airborne electronic distance measurement system, Aerodist Tellurometer MRC2, connected to the high order surveys established by RA Svy and DNM 1962 -1965. Mixed results were achieved with mapping photography of the border area in the 1960s. Control surveys for scale 1:100,000 mapping of the remainder of mainland PNG was taken up by Northern Command Field Survey Unit/1 Fd Svy Sqn (Brisbane) mainly using Aerodist MRC2 in 1969 and 1970, and by 4 Fd Svy Sqn (Adelaide) mainly using Aerodist Tellurometer MRB3 from 1972 to 1974. In 1970 a British Royal Engineer Survey Troop was attached to 1 Fd Svy Sqn. Vertical (height) control for the mapping was a combination of trigonometric heighting, barometric heighting by helicopter, levelling with connections to sea level and WREMAPS II Airborne Profile Recorder (APR).Sargent, Clem, Lieutenant- Colonel RA Svy, 1990, The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915‚Äì1990Royal Australian Survey Corps Association Bulletin 1965 to 1989School of Military Survey, 1985, The Chronology of RA Svy Corps, Edition 2 There are few countries in the world that present more challenging weather, terrain, vegetation, transport, living, communications, health and volcanic conditions for astronomic and terrestrial geodetic surveys than Papua New Guinea. Surveyors could be working and living on a beach, or in a mosquito infested lowlands grass and tree swamp in the morning and on a freezing cold mountaintop over 10,000 feet high in the afternoon. Origins Spain had visited eastern Papua New Guinea in 1545 and 100 years later the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman charted part of the north coast. By the turn of the 20th century Great Britain, Germany and France had produced coastal charts mainly for marine navigation for trade, commerce and exploration. Some charts included basic plans of key points around ports, coastal towns and plantations. In the First World War, Germany surrendered German New Guinea mandated in 1899, including New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville to Australia and military surveyors and draughtsman as part of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force worked as part of land administration of those places. In the Second World War it was not until Japan attacked and captured Rabaul on New Britain on 23 January 1942 that much emphasis was placed on surveys and maps for military purposes in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. Existing surveys and maps were mainly about government administration, mining, agriculture and forestry. A state of emergency was proclaimed on 27 January 1942 including the compulsory callup of civilians. The Army's New Guinea Force issued orders for raising a New Guinea Survey Section of twenty-five officers and men in March 1942, under the command of Lieutenant EC O'Reilly a New Guinea surveyor. The men were mainly 'old New Guinea hands', some of them being surveyors and members of the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles and others from the Queensland 49th Infantry Battalion Intelligence Section and some suitably qualified civilians. In early July 1942 the Survey Section was reinforced by a thirty-three man all volunteer group of the 3rd Aust Field Survey Company RAE from Victoria, retitled 2nd Aust Field Survey Section and Captain John Herridge appointed Officer Commanding. The section had field survey and draughting elements and limited one colour sun- dyeline printing, but most colour maps and larger print runs were sent to 2/1 Army Topo Svy Coy (Toowoomba) for rapid cartographic finalisation and printing. One of the original officers, Lieutenant Noel (Gerry) Owers a New Guinea surveyor, was given the tasks of surveys for installations and roads. The Japanese landed at Gona-Buna on 21 July, had captured Kokoda on 29 July and were advancing in force towards Port Moresby. On 15 August, Owers and two sub-sections (16 men total) commenced the task of blazing a jeep road forward of Iiolo across the Owen Stanley Ranges to Kokoda as an alternate route to the footpath Kokoda Trail for supply of forward troops and evacuating the sick and wounded. On occasions the two survey parties had to evade the Japanese advance and surprised front-line Australian infantry patrols who were not aware that the surveyors were forward of them. After the Japanese were stopped within sight of Port Moresby at Ioribaiwa Ridge and the Australian advance started, the need for the road reduced as air transport improved, and the impossible task, at an impossible time, in impossible terrain was finally abandoned. That road has never been built. The work of Owers' parties was honoured by naming the intersection where his track departed from the mule track down to Uberi on the Kokoda Trail, as Owers Corner. The priority then changed to surveys and standard and special mapping for the advance through Kokoda and preparation for the assaults and defeat of the Japanese at Gona-Sanananda-Buna in early-1943. The other priority area was the Port Moresby Defence Area and the coastal strip south-east towards Milne Bay. The Section was again reinforced on 29 October with a draft of seventeen men from 3 Aust Fd Svy Coy RAE then at Gymp ie. It was not until near the end of 1942 that other Australian or American field survey units were sent to New Guinea with elements of 2/1 Aust Army Topographic Survey Company AIF and 3 Aust Fd Svy Coy AIF in Port Moresby and detachments deployed. In January 1943 the section was retitled 8th Aust Field Survey Section AIF. In March a sub-section flew into Wau as part of Kanga Force remaining there for more than six months in direct support of the combat troops in the Wau-Bulolo-Salamaua areas. All methods of field survey were used, much based on the urgency of the need: astronomy, triangulation, theodolite and chain traverse, plane-tabling, compass traverse, levelling, trigonometric heighting, barometry, intersection of prominent features behind the enemy to improve artillery targeting. A narrow triangulation chain was carried from the astronomic datum at Wau, north through Bulolo into the Markham Valley in anticipation of the Australian attacks on Japanese held Lae. In October the sub-section was to be relieved and they walked out 110km to the south coast on the Wau-Bulldog road and then by steamer to Port Moresby. After sixteen months of active service 8 Aust Fd Svy Sect was absorbed as No 2 Field Section of 6th Aust Army Topographic Survey Company and moved to Australia.Viccars, JS, 1987, History of New Guinea Survey Section later 8th Aust Field Survey Section, bookletNew Guinea Survey Section,1995, Long Way Too Much, Being the Last Parade of the New Guinea Survey Section 1942 ‚Äì 1943, Royal Australian Survey Corps On 19 October 1943, General D MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief, South West Pacific Area, highly commended 2/1 Aust Army Topo Svy Coy AIF, 3 Aust Fd Svy Coy AIF, 69th US Engr Topo Coy and 8 Aust Fd Svy Sect AIF for their worthy efforts in supporting the campaigns: Kokoda, Milne Bay, Gona-Sanananda-Buna, Wau-Salamaua, Lae and the Huon Peninsula. \\"Great technical difficulties were surmounted in producing and distributing maps and photomaps covering more than twelve thousand square miles in time for operations, from combat type photography never before used in this theatre. Astronomic locations vital to the success of the other Allied mapping efforts were obtained under conditions of hardship and grave difficulties of transportation and, upon occasions, considerable risk. This untiring effort to provide the combat units with the maps needed when they were needed, from the material at hand, reflects great credit upon the officers and men of these organisations\\". Operations Topographic surveyors at Popondetta compiling scale 1:100,000 topographic maps from Skai Piksa air photography using Wild B8 photogrammetric stereo-plotters ‚Äì this task was often a respite from field survey work. A sergeant supervisor sitting at the B8 is checking the work of the corporal and sappers of the map plotting/compilation section. Standing procedure for marking survey stations, with exception where it was not practicable, was: a Royal Australian Survey Corps three-and-a-half inch bronze plaque, stamped with the station number and set in concrete at ground level oriented such that reading the mark while facing north; three recovery marks set in concrete at ground level spread around the horizon about five metres from the station mark; one two-and-a-half inch capped galvanised steel pipe 'witness post', painted white, protruding about one metre from the ground, about one metre north of the station mark. Station numbering was the prefix AA (Australian Army) followed by three digits commencing with 500 (eg AA501) allocated to 8 Fd Svy Sqn. This convention started with the 1962 high order traverse, for example AA001. Most stations were targeted with white or black plastic panels as crosses, black used on white sand beaches, for station identification on Wild RC10 air spot photography for transfer to the mapping photography. 1972 * Within weeks of 8 Fd Svy Sqn forming in Popondetta, operations commenced in January 1972 with vertical control by helicopter barometric heighting for scale 1:100,000 mapping of the Ramu, Goroka and Kwikela 1:250,000 map areas. Suitable existing survey points were marked (plastic panels) for spot photography by F24 aerial camera mounted in an Army Pilatus Porter. Horizontal control surveys by Wild T2 theodolite and Tellurometer MRA3 Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) traverse and vertical control by helicopter barometric heighting were conducted in the Madang area. RA Svy Associations website www.rasurvey.org PNG projects page * A 3rd Order level traverse of 115 kilometres from Oro Bay and Cape Killerton through Popondetta and over the Kumusi River to Kokoda was completed. Bench marks were established every three kilometres.

Two survey stations on Bagabag Island, AA500 and AA501 were the first stations marked by the Squadron. * A major undertaking commenced with a first order astro-geodetic (Kern DKM3/A theodolite and Tellurometer MRA3 EDM) traverse beginning at Rabaul (survey point The Mother atop an inactive volcano) on New Britain, west along the New Britain mountain spine through the islands in the Vitiaz Strait west of New Britain to connect with the high order coastal New Guinea traverse. After delays mainly because of weather, the traverse was finally completed in late-1974. A RAAF Iroquois helicopter crashed and was destroyed by fire on the survey point HIRAN 15 (Nandan) about 55 kilometres west of Rabaul. All on board survived but the co-pilot was seriously injured. The helicopter crashed on top of another helicopter which crashed there when the US Airforce established HIRAN 15 survey point in 1962. 1974 * Surveys on Bougainville existed from Second World War, US Army Engineers after the war and TPNG Dept of Lands and Surveys. Suitable survey marks were found, cleared and panelled with white plastic crosses for the marks to be identified on spot photography flown with a Wild RC10 mapping camera mounted in a civil chartered Beechcraft Queen Air aircraft. The various survey networks were integrated into the Geodetic Survey of PNG/Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 by using original survey observations in a network adjustment (variation of coordinates by least squares adjustment computer program VARYCORD) compiled by 8 Fd Svy Sqn and computed by Army Headquarters Directorate of Survey (DSVY) in Canberra. A survey network by theodolite (Wild T2) and Tellurometer MRA3, and large scale mapping air photography was completed over Kieta, Arawa and the Panguna mine for large scale Urban OrthoPhoto Mapping (UOPM).

Two surveyors sat on the right side to separately markup map corrections. The helicopter flew up the left of each valley and down the right to cover the terrain. The two pilots cautiously watched the morning cloud build up while advancing slowly up each valley as far as they could safely go with sufficient turn around space between the rising terrain and the lowering cloud base. Villages in the mountains of the Huon Peninsula * The New Britain high order astro-geodetic traverse was completed from Long Island in the middle of Vitiaz Strait connected to a high order RA Svy survey station, established 1962‚Äì64, near Saidor, New Guinea. The Long Island survey point on top of the highest point (1,280 metres or 4,200 feet) overlooked the huge volcanic crater Lake Wisdom. A volcano in the middle of the lake was active from time-to-time during the survey occupation, with ash and lava spouts sometimes above the lake surface and sometimes only surface bubbles. Volcanic activity was reported to Rabaul Vulcanology Observatory. Theodolite observations were interrupted by minor seismic/volcanic activity evident by the very sensitive theodolite level bubbles racing back-and-forth along their tubes.

This allowed for an observation of the separation between the geoid (sea level) and the reference ellipsoid (geoceiver computed height) at that point. The Geoceiver antenna/preamplifier is off the tripod standing on the concrete in the background * At the same time that the New Britain high-order traverse was joined to the New Guinea high order traverse, the New Guinea survey point was also occupied by a Transit (US Navy Navigation Satellite System) Magnavox AN/PRR-14 Doppler satellite geodetic receiver (Geoceiver), on loan from US Defense Mapping Agency, operated by 4 Fd Svy Sqn (Adelaide).Stansell,TA,The Transit Navigation Satellite System ‚Äì status, theory, performance, applications, Magnavox Pty Ltd This allowed for the connection of the astro-geodetic survey traverse to the global geocentric World Geodetic System which later became the reference frame for the Global Positioning System (GPS). Geoceiver was a huge technological and logistic leap, allowing geodetic quality surveys to be established with stations independent of each other, in any weather, any terrain, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day. RA Svy was equipped with six Geoceivers in 1975 as a Corps asset and were allocated as required to all field survey squadrons for surveys in Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the South West Pacific. They were highly productive and reliable in all operating conditions from sandy deserts to the variety of tropical environments. Geoceiver satellite data was recorded on punch paper tape and processed (computer program named DOPPLR) with post-orbit precise satellite ephemerides provided by US Defense Mapping Agency, at AHQ DSVY (Canberra) to produce three-dimensional geocentric coordinates accurate to about 1.5 metres from about 25 balanced (east-west, north going ‚Äì south going, elevation) satellite passes. Doppler station coordinates, reference the Naval Surface Weapons Centre 9Z-2 (NSWC9Z-2) geodetic system were then mathematically transformed to be consistent with the Geodetic Survey of PNG/Australian Geodetic Datum 1966. 1975 * Surveyors were detached to Royal Australian Navy/PNGDF maritime element Landing Craft Heavy (LCH) HMAS/PNGS Salamaua for an inshore route hyrdographic survey for safe passage of LCH and Patrol Boats from Port Moresby south-east towards Milne Bay and assisted Staff Officer Survey Headquarters PNG Command with miscellaneous tasks. * Operation Beachcomber ‚Äì a surveyor was attached to the HMAS/PNGS Salamaua based Beach Survey Team working in the D'Entrecasteaux Group of Islands (Goodenough, Ferguson, Normanby, Samaroa and Dobu Islands) north of Milne Bay. * June ‚Äì the Squadron moved by LCH and RAAF C130 from its base at Popondetta to Wewak (Moem Barracks) after being in Popondetta for three-and-a- half years * Field completion of scale 1:100,000 compiled maps in Bougainville, New Britain and western mainland. * Operation Sandy Bush (June ‚Äì December) ‚Äì a geodetic and scale 1:100,000 mapping survey by Geoceiver in the 100 islands of the Louisiade Archipelago east of Milne Bay from Samarai in the west to Pocklington Reef in the east. * survey control, air photography and photo annotation for UOPM 1976 * Operation Lahara ‚Äì Geoceiver operations continued in the Trobriand and Woodlark Island groups * Over five years Geoceivers were used to fix 202 Doppler satellite stations across all parts of the country to geodetic and mapping quality standards. 1977 * Operation Nyalaun Kup Phase 1 (20 Feb ‚Äì 8 May) ‚Äì Geoceiver surveys, geodetic traversing, field completion and aerial photography.

It reached its peak in the first part of the 19th century, in the writing of Fran√ßois- Ren√© de Chateaubriand and Victor Hugo, the poetry of Alfred de Vigny; the painting of Eugene Delacroix; the music of Hector Berlioz; and later in the architecture of Charles Garnier. It was gradually replaced beginning in the late 19th century by the movements of Art Nouveau, realism and modernism. Painting French romantic painting was sometimes called \\"theatrical romanticism\\". Unlike the romanticism in Germany, it was based less on expressing philosophical ideas than upon achieving extravagant effects, with the dramatic use of color and movement. Figures were twisted or stretched out, canvases were crowded with figures, and lines were sometimes imprecise. The locations used were often exotic, usually in Egypt or the Turkish Empire. One of the early prominent figures in French romantic painting was Hubert Robert, famous especially capricci, picturesque depictions of real or imagined ruins in Italy and of France. These included his view of what the Grand Gallery of the Louvre would look like, collapsed and overgrown with vines. Jean de Cayeux. \\"Robert, Hubert.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 13 Jan. 2017 Anne Louis Girodet was one of the first important painters in French romanticism. A pupil of Jacques Louis David. His work was greatly admired by Napoleon; he painted The Shadows of French Heroes who died in the wars of Liberty, received by Ossian (1802) especially for the main salon of Napoleon's home at Malmaison. It featured the mysterious lighting, symbols, mythological figures and theatrical effects which were to be recurrent romantic themes. Ferrier, Jean-Louis, L'aventure de l'art au XIXme si√®cle (2008), p. 34 The first major painter of French romanticism was Th√©odore G√©ricault (1791‚Äì1824).

His most famous work, however, was the Raft of the Medusa, (1818‚Äì1819), based on a real incident, showing the survivors of a shipwreck on a raft, waving desperately to be noticed by a faraway ship. the work was painted with extreme realism, after numerous studies, and captured in the most dramatic fashion the mixture of desperation and hopelessness of the passengers. The French painter most frequently associated with romanticism is Eug√®ne Delacroix (1798‚Äì1836). Delacroix had tried seven times to enter the Academy of Fine Arts without success; he finally entered with the political support of Napoleon's foreign affairs minister, Talleyrand. Delacroix's favorite authors were Shakespeare and Lord Byron, and he sought to vividly portray the summits of tragedy. Delacroix introduced a dramatic contrast of action, violence and nudity in an exotic setting, in his Death at Sardanapale (1827}, a theme inspired by Byron. Delacroix's work was an example of another tendency of romanticism, the use of exotic settings; in French romanticism, these were usually in Egypt or the Middle East. He is best known for Liberty leading the People (1830), shown in the Salon of 1831, inspired by the combat outside the Hotel de Ville in Paris during the July Revolution of 1830. The semi-nude figure of Liberty, raising a flag, surrounded by the violence and death of combat, next to a small boy raising a pistol too large for his hand, was something new and dramatic.

Important figures in later French romantic painting included the Swiss-born Charles Gleyre (1806‚Äì1874), who specialized in mythological and orientalist scenes. He painted in a more realistic style and with paler colors than the earlier romantics, but his works were equally charged in exoticism. He was famous as a teacher, and Some of his students later became prominent in very different styles; they included Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Thomas Couture was another prominent late romantic painter, who combined history painting and romanticism. His most famous painting is THe Romans in their Decadence (1847), an enormous canvas, almost five meters by eight meters, crowded with scenes of decadence. He was a teacher at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and, like Gleyre, he taught a number of famous later painters, including √âdouard Manet, Henri Fantin-Latour, [and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. In the center is a declining woman with a look of despair, surrounded by all the possible vices of Rome, encircled by statues of ancient Roman heroes recalling the more virtuous classical age.

His best-known work is THe Departure of the Volunteers on the facade of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris (1833‚Äì36), made at the peak of the romantic movement, with its vivid depiction of the passion and fury of the volunteers setting out from Paris in 1792 go defend the French Revolution]. The model for the figure of the Genius of War, above the others with wings spread, sword pointed forward and arm raised, was Rude's wife, the painter Sophie Fr√©miet.

Following its success, Napoleon named him secretary of his Embassy in Rome. He achieved another literary success in 1809 with his novel Les Martyrs. His work had a major influence on the generation of writers who followed him. In 1848 romantic literature reached a high point with the publication of the novel La Dame aux Cam√©lias by Alexandre Dumas fils. The novel became an immensely successful play, and then was transformed into one of the most successful operas of all time, La Traviata, by Giuseppe Verdi (1853). Prosper Merim√©e was another important figure in the romantic movement. His romantic novella, Carmen, published in 1845, was transformed by Bizet into a highly successful opera. Romantic poetry was dominated by the work of four poets; Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred de Vigny, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Musset. The period of romantic poetry reached its peak in the 1840s, and the death of Victor Hugo in 1885 is often considered the end of the movement in poetry.Charpentreau, Dictionnaire de la po√©sie fran√ßaise (2006), p. 924 However, it was carried on by others, particularly Charles Baudelaire, Theophile Gautier, G√©rard de Nerval, and Paul Verlaine until the end of the century.Charpentreau, Dictionnnaire de la po√©sie fran√ßaise (2006), p. 921 The poet Alfred de Musset gave a characteristically romantic definition of romanticism: \\"Romanticism is the star which weeps, the wind which cries out, the night which shivers, the flower which gives its scent, the bird which flies...It is the infinite and the starry, the warmth, the broken, the sober, and yet at the same time the plain and the round, the diamond-shaped, the pyramidal, the vivid, the restrained, the embraced, the turbulent.\\" Charpentreau, Dictionnnaire de la po√©sie fran√ßaise (2006), pg. 924 File:Portrait of Francois Rene Vicomte de Chateaubriand, 1828.jpgFran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand (1826) File:Alphonse de Lamartine.PNGAlphonse de Lamartine (1831) File:Victor Hugo by Charles Hugo, c1850-55.jpg Victor Hugo (1853) File:Alfred de musset.jpgAlfred de Musset File:F√©lix Nadar 1820-1910 Alfred de Vigny.jpgAlfred de Vigny File:Prosper M√©rim√©e.jpgProsper Merim√©e Theater Hernani (1830) Victor Hugo was the first major figure in French romantic theater. His play Hernani, which premiered on 23 February 1830 at the Th√©atre-Fran√ßais in Paris, a few months before the overthrow of the Charles X of France and the Bourbon monarchy, was a sort of manifesto of romanticism. It was seen as a direct attack at the formal classicism of French theater. There were fights inside the theater, as more conservative playgoers jeered the performance. The play was later made into a successful opera, Ernani, by Verdi. However, Hugo's career as a romantic playwright did not last long; his next work, another historical play Les Burgraves, which premiered on 22 April, 1843, was a dismal failure, and Hugo abandoned playwrighting entirely. The Paris theater turned instead to historical dramas, such as La Reine Margot by Alexandre Dumas, which premiered on 19 February 1847.Fierro, Alfred, Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris(1996), p. 619 Music Hector Berlioz was the best-known French romantic composer. His major works included the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy, choral pieces including the Requiem and L'enfance du Christ, and three operas: Benvenuto Cellini, Les Troyens and B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict, a \\"dramatic symphony\\" Rom√©o et Juliette and the \\"dramatic legend\\" La damnation de Faust.Vila, Marie Christine, Paris Musique (2007) (in French), pp. 132‚Äì133 Another important figure in French romanticism was Charles Gounod, best known today for his operas Faust and Romeo and Juliet and his arrangement of Ave Maria based on a melody by Bach. French music was enriched by the presence of some of the most important romantic composers. Frederic Chopin moved to Paris in 1830, at the age of 20, and lived and composed there until his death in 1849. Beginning in 1824, Gioachino Rossini lived and composed in Paris; he created a series of operas, including The Siege of Corinth and the opera William Tell , with its famous overture, which premiered on August 3, 1829 at the Royal Academy of Music, It was not a popular success, and Rossini retired from writing operas, though he lived another forty years. Vila, Marie Christine, Paris Musique (2007) (in French), pp. 132‚Äì133 The Composers Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, Franz Liszt, Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner all spent time in Paris during the romantic period, composing, influencing and being influenced by its music.

The Cambridge Companion to Ballet. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. pp. 175‚Äì176 Other celebrated dancers of romantic ballet included Carlotta Grisi, the first Giselle, and Carolina Rosati, who originated the role of Medora in Le Corsaire (1856). Famous male dancers included Lucien Petipa, who created the role of Count Albrecht in Giselle. From 1860 to 1868, he was ballet master of the Paris Opera Ballet. His brother Marius Petipa, also a dancer, became the ballet master of the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, and created a series of romantic ballets, including La Bayad√®re (1877); and The Sleeping Beauty (1890). The Romantic ballet gave prominence to the ballerina, where previously the male dancers had been the stars, and introduced the Pointe technique, with ballerinas on their toes, seeming to float across the stage, as well as the use of the tutu as a performance costume. Other innovations of Romantic ballet included a separate identity of the scenarist or author from the choreographer, and the use of specially written music by one composer rather than a pastiche of works by several composers. The invention of gas lighting also enhanced the atmosphere of the romantic ballet; it allowed gradual changes of lighting and a sense of mystery. Various other stage devices and illusions were introduced in romantic ballet, including the use of trap doors and wires to make it appear that the dancers could fly.Kant, Marian (2007).

A celebrated early example is the Hameau de la Reine created for Queen Marie-Antoinette in the park of the Palace of Versailles between 1783 and 1785. I was designed by the royal architect Richard Mique with the help of the romantic painter Hubert Robert. It consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in Normandy. It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen. The writer Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand (1768‚Äì1848) played an important part in the popularity of romantic architecture. In his writings, including The Genius of Christianity, (1802) he attacked what he considered the materialism of the Englightenment, and called for a return to the Christian values of earlier years, through the religious feelings inspired by Gothic architecture. He described the Gothic style as the native architecture of France, comparable to the role played the forests in the pagan religion of the Gauls. The revival of the Gothic style was also greatly enhanced by immense popularity of the novel Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo, published in 1821. That led to a movement for the restoration of the Cathedral, and to the creation in 1837 of a commission of Historic Monuments, headed by Prosper M√©rim√©e, who was himself the author of popular novellas and stories in the romantic style. Restoration was first begun of the crumbling chapel of Sainte-Chapelle and then, between 1845 and 1850, of the battered cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, which had been semi- ruined and stripped of its decoration. The restoration was carried out by the young Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc (1834-1879) and Jean-Batpiste-Antoine Lapsus (1807‚Äì1857). Movement for a Gothic revival led to the construction of the first neo-Gothic church in Paris, the basilica of Sainte-Clothilde, begun in 1845 by architects Christian Gau and Th√©dore Ballu. The new church had two towers and a purely Gothic nave and apse, with an abundance of sculpture and stained glass, but was slightly was more linear and streamlined, following the classical tendency. Nonetheless, the project was harshly judged by the rigorously neoclassical faculty of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, who denounced it as \\"plagiarism\\" and \\"false Gothic.\\" A notable shift in French official architecture took place in the 1830s, with a change in the direction of the Academy of Fine Arts. The devoted classicist Quatrem√®re de Quincy departed, and the Academy turned to Italian Renaissance architecture as the new model. Major examples included the Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library, Paris by Henri Labrouste (1844-1850), with its pure Renaissance facade. Labrouste designed the interior of this library and of the reading room of the National Library of France with an innovative use of new materials: he employed cast iron columns and arches, combined with simplified Renaissance decorative motifs, to create large and elegant open spaces with abundance of natural light. Italian Renaissance architecture, combined with modern materials, was also adopted for use in the new train stations constructed in Paris, particularly in the Gare de l'Est by Fran√ßois Duquesnoy Later in the 19th century, Some architects sought more exotic sources. Byzantine architecture was the inspiration for French some buildings in the late 19th century, notably the domes of the church of Sacr√©- C≈ìur, Paris begun by Paul Abadie (1874‚Äì1905). Marseille is home to two remarkable romantic churches, the Marseille Cathedral (1852‚Äì1896), in a Romanesque-Byzantine style, and Notre-Dame de la Garde, consecrated in 1864.

In 1926 he was in Munich in art history and Asian archeology and worked as a private lecturer at the University of Munich. He held lectures on Chinese, Japanese and Indian art history. In July 1933, he was appointed associate professor, but the responsible ministry disagreed with the nomination because of the \\"non-Aryan origin\\" of Bachhofer's wife. Since Bachhofer refused a divorce from his wife of Jewish origin [3] and he was threatened with dismissal, the family emigrated in 1934 to the United States . From 1935 Bachhofer worked as a professor of East Asian art history at the University of Chicago, and from 1941 as a full professor. From 1941 to 1945 he was also co- editor of the Art Bulletin. In 1965 he retired.  Research  Bachhofer's research interests included East Asian art, with a focus on the history of art in Central Asia and its connection with India, Iran and China. In Germany, he was one of the most important experts of the new discipline of Asian art history. [1] His work on the early Indian sculpture has long been considered a standard work.

He was the first president of KK Crvena zvezda.  Journalism career  Aksentijeviƒá graduated from the journalistic and diplomatic school and has been engaged in journalism since 1948. From the beginning of his journalistic career he worked in the Tanjug Agency, firstly in the domestic politic department, and since 1950 in the foreign policy section. Aksentijeviƒá was reporting from Greece, Republic of the Congo and Lebanon. He was an outstanding connoisseur not only for the Palestinian problem but also and the Kurdish issue. During his rich journalistic career, he met with numerous foreign politicians, intellectuals, cultural and sports figures he interviewed and whose work he wrote. At the beginning of the 1960s, Aksentijeviƒá was the eyewitness of the end of the Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. His report from Congo in 1960, about the overthrow of Prime Minister Lumumba, was the first which spread the news around the world. Aksentijeviƒá was the last journalist, and perhaps the last man who talked with Lumumba before he was executed on 17 January 1961. Aksentijeviƒá was the first foreign journalist to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Palestinian bases in Jordan in 1968. Since then, he reported about the struggle of the Palestinian people for freedom from close proximity. He reported about the largest Arab-Israeli war in 1973. Although he was seriously wounded on the Syrmian Front in 1945, he always tried to be on the front line when he reported on the Middle East conflicts. He is the first Yugoslav journalist who met with Mustafa Barzani, a famous Kurdish leader and president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Aksentijeviƒá organized and led the International Press Center in Belgrade from 1977 to 1982. In 1982, he became director of the Yugoslav Cultural Information Center in Vienna, Austria. This job was a special challenge in his career because he made it possible for him to become acquainted with the life of Serbian diaspora in Austria, as well as to promote Yugoslav culture in this country.  Crvena zvezda  Aksentijeviƒá was a co-founder of the Belgrade-based powerhouse Red Star Sports Association in 1945. Due to wounding during World War II, Aksentijeviƒá was not able to play basketball so he completely devoted himself to the club's work organization. Aksentijeviƒá was the first president of the Crvena zvezda basketball club. Shortly thereafter, future FIBA Hall of Famer Neboj≈°a Popoviƒá joined the club as a player-coach. In 1950, Aksentijeviƒá steps down as the club president. During his tenure, the Zvezda won five Yugoslav Basketball Championship.

Morgan, Oxford University Press, 1981 Much of the detail of the novel, especially that pertaining to coal mining, is drawn from the author's experiences. Background The story tells of the Davies family who live in Merthyr Tydfil, the ‚Äòiron capital‚Äô of Wales, commencing in the 1850s. The Merthyr Rising of 1831 is still fresh in the memories of many of the inhabitants. Despite the coming of the union movement and the election of members of parliament, Merthyr is still effectively ruled by the iron masters and coal owners. Summary Ann Davies, prematurely aged matriarch of the large Davies family, is devastated when her hardworking, hard drinking coal miner husband Rhys drags her youngest, Little Joe, down the coal mine at the age of eight to start work as a door boy. Joe is the first of the family to have any schooling and can already read a bit. His two sisters Megan and Moriah are already working in the brickyard; they get their entertainment by singing, most of the ‚Äògels‚Äô in the brickyard are good singers. Rhys angrily storms home when he learns that the girls have won a marble clock in a public singing competition ‚Äì singing is only for chapel. He smashes the clock and prepares to give the girls a beating. Ann hysterically raises the breadknife to defend them, but collapses with a massive stroke. Ann does not recover, and Rhys, racked with guilt, is now a changed man, gentler in his ways and eschewing his visits to the public house. Megan has to leave the brickyard to run the household. She is courted by the flamboyant and prosperous Shon Howell, the ‚ÄòCheap Jack‚Äô, who is disliked by the town's tradesmen as he undercuts them, but admired by many for the entertainment he provides. But it is Moriah who eventually runs away with him to Aberdare, and then to England to marry him. He pays for her to have voice training and lessons in Italian. Ann eventually dies on the same day as her rich and elderly aunt, ‚ÄòBopa‚Äô Lloyd. The girls inherit five thousand pounds between them, whilst the aunt's carer, Marged Ellis, inherits her house and extensive rental properties. Megan takes Joe, now fourteen years old, out of the mine to be educated. Moriah is accepted on a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. Megan also studies tonic sol-fa, and in 1873 visits London as part of the Cor Mawr (Great Choir), the South Wales Choral Union, which wins the national competition at Crystal Palace. Strikes in the coal mines see women reduced to begging Megan for financial assistance; her inheritance begins to dwindle, but she cannot refuse them. Two of her brothers decide to emigrate to America with money lent by Megan. Joe is now working as an assistant in an auctioneer's office and doing well. Will, the other brother who lives next door, is full of enthusiasm with the nascent union movement and is now working in the mine as a haulier ‚Äì a considerable rise in status. Moriah is singing with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and travels to Italy, where she adopts the professional name of Madam Moriana. Rhys is killed when the Gethin mine floods and he attempts to rescue a fellow worker. Joe has an opportunity to buy into a business partnership in Cardiff. He asks Megan for the money, which she gives him, knowing that she will now see Joe less and less. Alone in the family house, she asks Sophie, the former ‚ÄòMother of the yard‚Äô under whom she worked in the brickyard, to come and share her house. The National Eisteddford of Wales visits Merthyr in 1881 and Megan takes part in the choral singing. Dr Joseph Parry, a native of Merthyr, arrives to see his music performed. Moriah also visits with some professional colleagues, but declines to perform at a ‚Äòmere‚Äô Eisteddford. Marged Ellis dies and leaves Megan her entire estate. Joe has repaid Megan's loan, and comes up from Cardiff to handle her properties. He persuades her to leave the small rented cottage in ‚Äòthe Row‚Äô and restore Marged's large house, so that the brothers in America will have a place to stay when they visit. They arrive to an emotional welcome. Megan and a family party travel to Cardiff to see Moriah perform with members of her company. Her voice is glorious, but the sisters have now grown apart. Joe becomes a partner in a steamship company with a loan from Megan; he hopes to join the ‚Äòmerchant princes‚Äô of Cardiff, making big money out of coal and steel export. He repays the loan with interest, but Megan is upset when Joe announces that he's going to leave chapel and join the Church of England to please his future wife. After strong words, Megan becomes estranged from Joe, but Shon Howell manages to reconcile them in time for Joe's wedding in Cardiff. Megan finds her new in-laws to be down-to-earth ‚Äòtidy‚Äô folk, despite their wealth, and grows to like them. She later stands as godmother for Edith and Joe's baby son. Moriah returns to Wales extremely ill, and dies soon afterwards. Megan travels to America, with emotional visits to her brothers and their now-large families.

Soon he published a video splash screen on his pages in social networks, in which he throws a red balloon towards the audience. Sharij did not explain what this means, but on his website there was a message that it was a hint of creating a party.

The namesake leader of the party, Shariy, as the candidate for the parliamentary election himself was denied registration by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine on the grounds that he did not meet the requirement of a term of five-year residence in the country immediately preceding the elections. Previously, Shariy was known primarily for his investigations on corruption in the police and other law enforcement agencies during the Yanukovych government and, subsequently, sought asylum in the European Union in 2012 due to libel, defamation, and alleged politically motivated persecution by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies of the time.

Political positions and goals of the party The main ideology of the party is libertarianism The party aims to reduce the powers of the executive to the required minimum. The party is in favour of an authoritarian style of governing. The immediate three goals of the political movement and its rationale as a future Ukrainian parliament party are: # Cleansing of the Ukrainian political landscape and war on corruption. # Total transparency and permanent control over the bodies of legislative and executive power in Ukraine. # Informing the population of the country about the official and unofficial, shadow processes in Ukrainian politics. Generally, the party stands on a number of fundamental principles shared by its members, such as: # –êbsolute priority of personal dignity and human rights in Ukraine. # Freedom of speech and conscience, yet the accountability of the press and public figures for libel and defamation. # Direct democracy: electronic voting and cooperative decision-making. # Euro-optimism and Euro-integration. # Modernization of Ukrainian society, its politics, science and technology. # Economic liberalism, yet continued support to the socially neglected strata of population. Also, on the party's program said that: # They are in favour of the pro-European vector of Ukraine's development. # They are in favour of differentiated budget and insurance medicine # Observance of the law, inevitability of punishment, effective functioning, guarantee of the independence of the judicial branch are their priority. # They also oppose nuclear weapons and nuclear capability. # \\"The Party of Shariy\\" allows for the presence of several citizenship, Criticism of the EU and George Soros After Verkhovna Rada adopted neoliberal land reform laws,https://www.gazeta.ru/business/news/2020/03/31/n_14227951.shtml Anatoliy Shariy posted a partisan program video on his YouTube channel, where he promoted renegotiation of conditions of IMF debt payments, while embracing sympathetic rhetoric towards Viktor Orb√°n's eurosceptic nationalist policies, describing EU as \\"an agressor, which suppresses facts about Icelandic Revolution\\" and alleging those, who support land reform as people who \\"got education and worked in financial structures of George Soros.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtmhsXJOvqI Also, in another interview, which Shariy described as \\"his manifesto\\", he stated that \\"IMF wants to divide Ukraine\\" and compared Ukraine to a \\"drug abuser, where loans are syringes\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD1RxTy9x3w  Party members  Apart from the leader of namesake party Anatoly Shariy, the top-10 of the Party list during the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election included: * Olha Shariy (Bondarenko) - Ukrainian journalist and blogger * Pavlo Ullakh - journalist and historian, Ph.D. in World History * Yevgeniy Yevtukhov (aka DJ Sender) - Ukrainian DJ, music producer, songwriter and singer; the owner of Send Records and its sublabels; the founder of the DJFM radio station * Ivan Mamchur - businessperson, expert in online-marketing and online education * Artur Talabira - journalist and reporter; theatre and movie actorArtur Talabira on imdb.com * Mykola Gladenky - political science specialist * Dmytro Butenko - IT-entrepreneur * Roman Katerinchuk - IT-entrepreneur Antonina Beloglazova was the third number in the party list until 2019.

Life  Dieter Leisegang was born on November 25, 1942, the eleventh child to painter and cartographer Gustav Leisegang. He spent his childhood in the city of Wiesbaden until his family relocated to Offenbach am Main in 1959. His first literary works and poems appeared in the 1950s and were published in newspapers, magazines, and anthologies. After graduating secondary school, Leisegang studied History, German, and Philosophy at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, primarily under the instruction of Theodor W. Adorno and Julius Jakob Schaaf. Leisegang took Schaaf's approach of ‚ÄúUniversal Relational Theory‚Äù and developed it further into a ‚Äúdraft of a philosophy of relationships‚Äù, with which ‚ÄúLeisegang leaves behind a self-contained philosophical oeuvre, in which, with a staggering systematic power at the highest level of both introspection and argumentation, profound historical knowledge of the entire history of philosophy seamlessly unites‚Äù (Julius Schaaf). In 1963 Leisegang met typographer and publisher Horst Heiderhoff, together with whom he released the poetry series ‚ÄúDas Neuste Gedicht‚Äù (‚ÄùThe Newest Poem‚Äù). In the same year, however, he was forced to take a break from his studies at the university due to a serious lung condition. After an operation, he was able to return to his studies in 1967. Already during his years at university Leisegang worked a variety of different jobs: as a teaching assistant for an aesthetics course at the Werkkunstschule (College of Design Offenbach) (1968-1960); as a lecturer for text and rhetoric at the Technical College for Industrial Advertising and Sales Promotion in Kassel (1968-1971); and as a freelancer in the editorial department ‚ÄúArt and Literature‚Äù for the Hessischer Rundfunk (Hessisch Broadcasting). In 1969 he finished his doctorate in Philosophy (Julius Schaaf/Theodore W. Adorno), German (Paul St√∂cklein), and East European History (Klaus Zernack) with a dissertation on \\"The Three Powers of Relation\\". Leisegang was then given a position at Frankfurt University as a lecturer for the History of Philosophy, with particular emphasis on the philosophy of art theory (1971-1973), which he used to work on a philosophical analysis of the works of both Franz Kafka and Karl May. During this time, Leisegang began intensively examining fundamental questions underlying graphic design. This culminated in his Prolegomena on a Theory of Design, which Leisegang published in the newspaper design international in 1971 (whose editors were Leisegang himself, Anton Stankowski, and Horst Heiderhoff). In addition to this, he also toyed with prime numbers. Leisegang put his teaching position in Frankfurt on hold in 1972 in order to take up a position as guest lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg (South Africa). Here, alongside a relational theory drafted in English, he began plans for a philosophic political paper on \\"Apartheid and Integration as Moments of a True Political Relationship between Black and White in South Africa\\" (Letter to Julius Schaaf on July 20, 1972). Unfortunately, his posit that one-sided political relationships would inevitably lead to foreseeable social and economic catastrophe, which drew from examples from South Africa, never came to fruition in the form of a paper, as his manuscript went missing during a move. However, it was discussed during his lectures. While still in South Africa, Leisegang explicitly withdrew his application for a chair position at J.W. Goethe University and left his lecturer position there to rest (Letter to J. Schaaf, July 20, 1972). In August 1972 he returned to Germany due to the death of his father. He held the seminar \\"Philosophical Aspects of Literature, Karl May: Ardistan and Dschinnistan\\" in the winter semester of 1972/73, which, in a certain sense, came to be his legacy. Despite his successes, Leisegang committed suicide in the early hours of March 21, 1973. Shortly before this, he had written a letter informing the police of his impending suicide.

It aired in the United States on Fox on March 1, 2020. The episode was written by Dan Vebber and was directed by Jennifer Moeller. In the episode, Bart accidentally sees a new superhero movie, one month before its intended release, and uses his knowledge to terrorize the other fans. Two executive producers of the film attempt to prevent Bart from leaking any more news to the public. The episode parodies the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the Avengers films, specifically on the spoiler phenomenon revolving around Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. MCU film producer Kevin Feige, Infinity War and Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo, and MCU actress Cobie Smulders make voice cameos in the episode. Smulders' husband, Taran Killam, also guest stars. Plot Numerous Springfield citizens watch Vindicators Crystal War, the new movie in a Marble Cinematic Universe superhero franchise called Vindicators. When the film ends on a cliffhanger in which the villain kills the film's heroes, the audience is emotionally affected by the bleak cliffhanger and they eagerly anticipate the concluding sequel which doesn't come out until the next year, much to their impatience. Eleven months later and one month before the release of Vindicators Crystal War 2: Resurgence, Milhouse is injured while Bart attempts a YouTube stunt. One of the stars of Vindicators, Australian actor Glen Tangier who plays the superhero Airshot, mistakes Bart for Milhouse while visiting him at the hospital and passes out drunk. Bart hijacks his laptop where he finds and views a cut of the unreleased final Vindicators film that night. With knowledge of the film's key moments and plot reveals, Bart decides to visit Comic Book Guy to exchange the spoilers for an expensive comic book. However, Comic Book Guy instead gives away all of his products so he doesn't get the film spoiled for himself. Realising the power he has, armed with the film's spoilers, Bart decides to blackmail the town by threatening to spoil the ending of the film. When he attempts to blackmail his father, Homer tells Bart that he is immune to his spoiler power because he doesn't care about the Vindicators films. Instead, Bart lets Homer in on the deal, allowing him to scam free beer from Moe. Bart also exploits Lisa by giving her a chance to dance with Airshot (played by Tangier) at a school dance. After realising that his power will mean nothing when the film finally opens in theaters, Bart's blackmailing escalates. Milhouse berates Bart for stealing his visit from Airshot before Bart is kidnapped by the Marble film studio, who has been made aware of Bart's blackmailing and knowledge of the spoilers. Using virtual reality, the studio executives make him believe that his spoilers will actually kill the film's heroes in their universe if he leaks them. Bart refuses to reveal the spoilers to the film's villain to save the heroes, satisfying the studio executives. As a result, Bart releases the town free from his blackmailing and he successfully doesn't spoil the film until the film premieres and opens. However, the first Springfield audience to see the film in the theater inadvertently spoils the film on social media. Reception Writing for The A.V. Club, Dennis Perkins gave the episode a B, praising the parody elements but finding the Homer and Marge story weak. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave \\"Bart the Bad Guy\\" an 8/10, writing that \\"If you watch 'Bart the Bad Guy' solely to see the MCU taken down a peg, you may come away a little disappointed. [...] Luckily, [the episode] finds other, better avenues to explore, lampooning spoiler culture and making a familiar formula feel fresh and exciting again.\\" References  External links  * Category:The Simpsons (season 31) episodes Category:2020 American television episodes ","title":"Bart the Bad Guy"},{"id":"61147574","text":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Barnette‚ÄìBos√°k‚ÄìLederberg graph is a cubic (that is, 3-regular) polyhedral graph with no Hamiltonian cycle, the smallest such graph possible.

It aired in the United States on Fox on March 8, 2020. The episode was written by J. Stewart Burns and was directed by Michael Polcino. It was dedicated to James Lipton who died on March 2, 2020 and had guest starred in the episodes \\"The Sweetest Apu\\" and \\"Homer the Father\\" respectively. Plot The Simpson family is watching ‚ÄúMarketing a Murder‚Äù on TV. When Maggie tries to get their attention, Lisa switches to Baby Ein-sign, a show teaching babies sign language. Maggie was trying to tell them that Hans Moleman was stuck under a fallen tree in their yard, which they fail to notice. In the morning, they keep watching the show while Hans is taken into an ambulance. The show is cancelled due to government stopping funding the show, before Maggie can completely learn to use sign language, so the family attempts to teach her themselves. When Maggie begins to use sign language on her own, Marge tries to tell the family about Maggie's development, only to find them uninterested and playing on their devices, so Marge stops them and limits their time on the devices to half an hour a week for everyone. When Homer, Bart and Lisa cheat by having the Wise Guy revert their screentime, Marge puts the devices away entirely. Bored at work, Homer becomes an expert in word jumble puzzles, Marge sees how the devices affect the lives of Patty and Selma, Bart starts to use his imagination when he recovers a rocket from the school's roof, involving Jimbo and Dolph too, and Lisa rediscovers the joy of finding books manually. Marge cannot find recipes on her books and fails to get help from Luigi, so when the family returns home they find her in her closet with her phone and laptop, finding out she is the addicted one. Finally admitting she has a problem, she signs herself and the family up for a month at the Screen Addiction Rehab Center. The next day they arrive at the center, finding out it is a paradise. The owner Dr. Lund shows them various activities. They start healing, but they cannot hold on for long. They also discover the workers all use computers, sending spam mails after stealing patients' accounts. In addition, the family signed a non-disclosure contract, which also prevents them from being able to leave the center. At night, the family work together, using sign language for communication, and manage to stealthily escape the center undetected and get a ride home on Jimbo and Dolph's makeshift rocket. The next day, Dr. Lund is arrested by the police for his scams. Dr. Lund offers to help Chief Wiggum with his compulsive overeating. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B-, stating that ‚ÄúAlas, there‚Äôs not enough else to recommend ‚ÄòScreenless,‚Äô as the Simpsons‚Äô individual journeys through the hell of online withdrawal are short-changed and unsatisfying. Homer gets good at newspaper jumbles, which has one truncated but lovely little montage sequence where the glimpse of Homer J. Simpson recognizing some hidden talent inside himself is set to evocative music...Lisa briefly rediscovers the musty, dusty, opossum-infested joys of the library‚Äôs neglected card catalog. Bart, like Homer, has the merest hint of a personal arc when he alone among his phone- tapping peers spies a forgotten toy rocket on the school roof and, retrieving it, rediscovers his atrophied imagination.‚Äù.

She left Europe in 1867, first to sing with Annibale Biacchi's Italian opera company in Cuba and then to tour with Augusto Cagli's Italian opera company in Australasia. She remained with Cagli's company in its various incarnations until 1877, singing in India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. She died in Turin, her native city, less than a year after her return from South Africa. Early life and Italian career Portrait of Margherita Zenoni by Eugenio Yerna Zenoni was born in Turin. She was initially self- taught and began her career in the late 1840s singing secondary roles in small theatres. Unable to make a breakthrough but possessed of a promising voice and stage presence, she was encouraged by music critics to get formal training. She became a pupil of Marcelliano Marcello who had opened a singing school in Turin and went on to further training with Carlo Boniforti at the Milan Conservatory. She made rapid progress and by the early 1850s was signed to various northern Italian opera houses as the prima donna assoluta. She had a triumphant debut at the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1854 in the title role of Donizetti's Gemma di Vergy. Later in her career she also sang the title roles in his La Favorita, Lucrezia Borgia, and Anna Bolena. She went on to sing many leading roles in Verdi's operas, including some of the earliest performances of his La traviata (as Violetta), Rigoletto (as Gilda) and Il trovatore (as Leonora). She also appeared in Verdi's I masnadieri (as Amalia), Nabucco (as Abigaille), Macbeth (as Lady Macbeth), Attila (as Odabella), Ballo in Maschera (as Amelia), and I due Foscari (as Lucrezia). Francesco Regli wrote of her in 1860: > Wherever she sings she has shown herself to be an artist worthy of every > praise, for she unites an exquisite sentiment, an ardent spirit and a > dramatic talent that has few equals with a beautiful and charming voice. > Margherita Zenoni is not only an impeccable singer. She is also an excellent > actress. According to Italian press articles on her benefit performances in several northern Italian opera houses, they were lavish affairs. An account of her benefit night in 1857 at the Teatro Sociale in Rovereto described the audience screaming wildly and throwing flowers; garlands of roses, laurel, and carnations; gold coins; and poems in her honour onto the stage at the end of the performance. A large cornucopia filled with ribbons and flowers was brought onto the stage as well as a silk banner carried by an angel. She was then escorted to her lodgings by a torch-light parade composed of still- cheering audience members and the city's orchestra and chorus who proceeded to serenade her under her window. Although Zenoni's career up to 1867 was primarily concentrated in the opera houses of northern Italy, she also sang in southern Italy at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and the Teatro Piccinni in Bari and appeared abroad with touring Italian opera companies in Bucharest, Constantinople, Valencia, and Oviedo. In a gala performance at the Teatro del Font√°n in Oviedo in 1864, she sang Abigaille in Nabucco opposite Giorgio Ronconi who had created the title role at its world premiere in 1842. India, Australasia, and South Africa In December 1867 Zenoni sailed to New York and then on to Cuba were she appeared at the Teatro Tac√≥n in Havana with an Italian opera troupe organized by Annibale Biacchi. After Havana she proceeded to India to join Augusto Cagli's Italian opera company as its prima donna assoluta for the 1868-69 season in Calcutta. She was an immediate success with the audiences, and Cagli tailored the company's repertoire to reflect her greatest successes on the Italian stage ‚Äì modern, tragic operas. She remained with Cagli's troupe for the 1869-70 season and then signed with Giovanni Pompei's rival company who were performing in Bombay and the Dutch East Indies. Cagli and Pompei subsequently joined forces to create a composite company. Zenoni toured both Australia and New Zealand with them. While in Sydney she married Annibal Luis Gamboa on 23 September 1873. According to the marriage announcement in the Sydney Morning Herald, Gamboa was from Cadiz, Spain. He had also been on the ship with her when she sailed to New York on her way to Cuba in 1867. Zenoni performed in Australia through the 1875 season appearing as Griselda in I Lombardi, Leonora in Il trovatore, Paolina in Poliuto, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, and in the title roles of La Juive, Norma, Lucrezia Borgia, and Anna Bolena. Her next stop was South Africa where Cagli had begun producing opera seasons for Cape Town in 1876. For the 1877 season his latest venture was al fresco opera in the gardens of the Good Hope Masonic Lodge. The season proved disastrous. In January Zenoni had to sing through a cold in Lucrezia Borgia while strong winds buffeted singers and audience alike. Cagli then built a pavilion to partially enclose the performances, but in April a fire broke out which destroyed not only the pavilion and its stage but all of the company's scenery and props as well as the lead tenor's costume collection. Zenoni set sail for her native Italy in July 1877, a fact much lamented by the editor of The Cape Standard and Mail. She died in Turin in March of the following year. Her husband later remarried and died in Turin in 1899. After her death, Zenoni's name briefly lived on in the entertainment world, albeit in vaudeville rather than opera. In 1878 the impresario Harry Rickards discovered that an artiste from another troupe was performing under the same name as Katie Angell, a young Australian trapeze artist who worked for Rickards and later became his second wife. He considered a lawsuit, but instead Angell changed her own stage name, and Rickards billed her as \\"Mademoiselle Zenoni. The Premier Lady Gymnast of the World.\\" According to the Dictionary of Sydney, the name was inspired by the celebrity of Margherita Zenoni who was singing in Australia when Angell began her career.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History Alfred Wilcox purchased the property where this house is located in 1835, selling it the next year to Henry Sparks. Sparks began farming a portion of the property, and in 1842 sold this section to his brother Asa. Asa Sparks likely lived with his brother while starting his own farm, and in about 1852 constructed this farmhouse. Asa Sparks sold the farm to Addison Sill in 1866. It was resold to Silas N. Brownell in 1867, then to George Montgomery in 1876, and finally to Edward Anderson in 1884. Anderson passed the farm to his daughter, Lillian, who deeded roughly about to Kalamazoo College in 1982 and sold about to Warren L. and Nella Langeland in 1992. As of 2014, Kalamazoo College owns the house, with the neighboring former farmland now used as the Lillian Anderson Arboretum. Description The Sparks-Anderson House is a wood-framed Greek Revival Upright and Wing house, consisting of a two-story upright and a single-story, side-gable wing. A shed-roofed porch fronts the wing, sheltering three entry doors. A similar single-story wing, constructed in 1977, is attached to the rear of the house. The house is covered with wooden siding, and sits on a stone foundation. The front facade of the upright contains two windows on the first floor and two more on the second. The windows are over six sash units with shutters. A frieze-band window is located above in the gable. Three more frieze-band windows are located on the side facades, and two more large windows are located below on the exposed side. The wing contains two more windows, located between the three entry doors.

The name of the plan refers to the blue uniform of the Venezuelan Air Force in which several suspects were officers. Foro Penal declared that the accused suspects were political prisoners and that they were convicted without evidence, and its director described the sentence as arbitrary. Based on the accusations, the metropolitan mayor of Caracas Antonio Ledezma was arrested in his office on 19 February by SEBIN officers. According to opposition reports, Golpe Azul is the twelfth coup d'√©tat attempt that President Maduro denounces.  Plot and arrests  On 12 February 2015, President Nicol√°s Maduro announced the alleged coup. Libertador Municipality Mayor Jorge Rodr√≠guez, during a special broadcast of Con El Mazo Dando on state-run Venezolana de Televisi√≥n (VTV), denounced the participants of an alleged attempt planned by aviation general Oswaldo Hern√°ndez, who was convicted in May 2014 along with nine other military personnel for the crimes of rebellion and against military decorum. National Assembly president Diosdado Cabello announced the arrests of eight people in Aragua by officials of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and the seizure of various equipment, including a computer with information on the tactical objectives of the coup group. He also showed maps allegedly located on the computer equipment of the protagonists of Golpe Azul, where buildings appeared in Caracas that were marked as tactical objectives such as the Miraflores Palace, the Public Ministry of Venezuela, the Caracas mayor's office, the Ministry of Defense headquarters, the Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace building, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), the National Electoral Council (CNE), the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) and offices of Telesur. During the program, Mayor Jorge Rodr√≠guez accused National Assembly deputy and opposition politician Julio Borges of choosing the places indicated as tactical objectives. Cabello also revealed the alleged possession of AR-15 rifles, grenades, military and security uniforms, as well as an eight-minute video with a statement from the protagonists. According to Cabello, the bombing would be carried out with a Tucano artillery plane after publishing a statement in the national press requesting the government, among other things, the dissolution of public powers, the call for elections and the affiliation to organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and later the military would issue a uniformed message where they would make a called the population to calm.  Arrest of Antonio Ledezma  Antonio Ledezma, metropolitan mayor of Caracas, arrested on 19 February 2015. On 19 February 2015, Antonio Ledezma was detained by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service at his office in the EXA Tower in Caracas. In the operation, the security forces made warning shots to the air to disperse a crowd that was forming. He was then transported to SEBIN's headquarters in Plaza Venezuela. His lawyer declared that the charges for his detention were unknown. The New York Times stated that Ledezma was arrested by the Venezuelan Government after accusations made by President Nicol√°s Maduro about an \\"American plot to overthrow the government\\" that he presented a week before Ledezma's arrest. Ledezma mocked the accusations stating that the Venezuelan government was destabilizing itself through corruption. The United States denied the accusations by President Maduro and stated that \\"Venezuela‚Äôs problems cannot be solved by criminalizing dissent\\". = Response to arrest = Following the news of the arrest of Ledezma, his supporters quickly created protests and called the arrest a \\"kidnapping\\" and that the coup conspiracy was created for political purposes. Hours after the news broke, hundreds of Ledezma supporters gathered in a Caracas plaza to denounce his arrest. Protesters also gathered outside of the SEBIN headquarters. Human rights groups quickly condemned Ledezma's arrest and the similarity of the case to Leopoldo L√≥pez's arrest was noted by The New York Times. Amnesty International condemned Ledezma's arrest calling it politically motivated, noting the similar cases of arrests made by the Venezuelan Government in what Amnesty International described as \\"silencing dissenting voices\\". Human Rights Watch demanded his release with Human Rights Watch's Americas division director, Jose Miguel Vivanco, stating that without evidence, Ledezma \\"faces another case of arbitrary detention of opponents in a country where there is no judicial independence\\". = Imprisonment = In March 2015, the court ordered Ledezma to be taken at the Ramo Verde military jail, where he would be imprisoned before standing trial. On the same month, former socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe Gonz√°lez, agreed to take over the defense of Ledezma in his trial after Ledezma's family requested his assistance. Two months later, he was sent back home for health reasons, where he had been placed under house arrest and unable to express himself publicly. On 1 August 2017, Ledezma (along with Leopoldo L√≥pez) were re-arrested by SEBIN, which did not file any legal arrest warrant. According to the pro-Maduro Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice, it said that it had received intelligence reports alleging the two were trying to flee Venezuela. The court also said that it had revoked Mr Ledezma's and Mr L√≥pez's house arrest because they had made political statements relating to the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election. Lopez and Ledezma were sent to Ramo Verde prison and Ledezma was released back to house arrest on 4 August. = Escape from house arrest = On 17 November 2017, Ledezma slipped past guards and fled to Colombia. He departed the same day from El Dorado International Airport in Bogot√° to Adolfo Su√°rez Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport in Madrid, Spain. Upon landing he declared he would continue his fight of opposition to the Venezuelan Government and was reunited with his family.  Trial  The eight defendants, three civilians (Pedro Maury, Jesus Salazar and Luis Colmenares) and five military officers of the Venezuelan Air Force (Ricardo Jos√© Antich, Luis Lugo, Peter Moreno, Carlos Esqueda, Henry Salazar and Laided Salazar) were sentenced in the second military court of Maracay on 12 January 2017. Captains Ronald Ram√≠rez and Jackson Garc√≠a were witnesses at the trial. On 26 December 2018, the sentence was ratified by the TSJ.http://globovision.com/article/tsj-ratifica-condena-a-militares- implicados-en-operacion-jerico References Category:2015 in Venezuela Category:Crisis in Venezuela ","title":"Golpe Azul"},{"id":"61148048","text":"Ron Schieber (born April 3, 1960) is an American politician who served in the Missouri House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015.

History  In 1755, Alexandre Jean Joseph Le Riche de La Pouplini√®re, a ferme g√©n√©rale under Louis XV, constructed a theater at the entrance to his estate in Boulainvilliers. At the time the estate was on the outskirts of Paris, well outside city walls. As a frequent patron of the arts he would gather a group of artists and intellectuals around him. Some of those he patronized were Voltaire, Quentin de la Tour, Van Loo and Johann Wenzel Anton Stamitz. Despite Pouplini√®re's support of the arts, the theater on his estate was the least celebrated. Jean- Fran√ßois Marmontel said that the plays were rather unexceptional but not quite bad enough not to applaud. However, because the plays were often followed by a great dinner and attended by the most prominent thinkers in Paris, the evenings were well attended by noblemen, despite the mediocrity of the entertainment. The estate was left intact during the French Revolution but in 1815 the gardens of the property were destroyed by the English. In 1826 the estate was sold to speculators who created a new neighborhood called \\"Boulainvilliers\\" out of the estate's grounds. The land was fragmented into numerous plots, one of which was bought by Louis Mors who built another theater in 1894 on the site of Pouplini√©re's old theater. Mors was a music enthusiast who encouraged the emergence of musical themes in the early nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The theater was inaugurated 25 April 1900 by Camille Chevillard with an 80 musician orchestra as well as by others such as Bizet, Terrasse, and Wagner who all performed there during its early years. In 1931, the hall became a theater for artistic films, quickly becoming a cinematographic Mecca, frequented by personalities such as G√©rard Philipe and Marcel Carn√©. The director of the cinema for 20 years, Madona Bouglione, developed musical programs, a weekend showing of a circus movie and a wide array of other programming. In 1977 the hall and decoration were added to the list of Monuments Historique.

Eddy House and Grounds is a historic property in Medina, Washington. The two-story mansion was built in 1925 for James Garfield Eddy. With It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since February 19, 1982. THE COLONIAL Revival home hugging the bluff is half hidden from Lake Washington by a landscape that has been developing for nearly 90 years. When James Garfield Eddy and his family moved into their Medina house in 1918, the Great War had just ended and Seattle, along with the rest of the country, was trying to get back to normal. Twenty-two years before the first bridge crossed Lake Washington, Eddy commuted to Seattle by boat from his Lake Washington dock to the foot of Madison Street and then by streetcar into town. But it was worth the commute. His five-acre estate, formerly apple orchards, was shaped into gardens framed by evergreens. It was an appropriate setting for a man whose family had gained from the sale of timber and sought to preserve that richness for future generations through tree breeding. As was the case with several of Seattle's pioneering lumbermen, the Eddy family had left Maine for Michigan for the Pacific Northwest as the great East Coast and Midwest forests were depleted to build American towns and cities. In 1903, James and his brother John partnered with David Skinner to purchase the Port Blakely Mill Co. on Bainbridge Island. James realized that in order to benefit from trees, you needed to replenish them. He became one of the first tree breeders in the country. In 1918, he consulted with Luther Burbank about producing better forest trees through breeding experiments and joined him at his California nursery to explore the potential. These early experiments led to the establishment, in 1925, of a research station in Placerville, Calif., that, by 1931, had become the most complete arboretum of pines in the world. Eddy funded the station until it was turned over to the U.S. Forest Service in 1935. Eddy's home recalled the New England traditional architecture that was part of his family's geographic roots. Built by Howard S. Wright Sr., the 10-bedroom house wraps around the driveway in an unpretentious manner that downplays its size. The modest entrance is framed with nonsymmetrical wings that bend slightly (coincidentally creating some quirky angular bathrooms and storage areas inside). Its interiors, while spacious and well-proportioned, are also understated, with low ceilings throughout. There is no fancy woodwork or decorative molding, only first-growth fir paneling in the stair hall and quarter-sawn oak floors. This and the 8-foot ceiling heights reinforce the early New England Colonial ambiance. Yet the house is designed for entertaining and also for maximum light and ventilation. Its principal rooms are oriented toward Lake Washington and are spacious, despite those low ceilings. French doors open on hinges to connect living and dining room to outdoor living areas. Two large skylit bays, one in the informal kitchen/dining area, one in the den/family room on the other side of the house, turn these rooms into solaria. Previous owners opened up the original kitchen with rough-cut timber and beams but complementary fir cabinetry. Otto Holmdahl laid out the grounds and pathways. At the time, he was one of only a few landscape designers practicing in the Puget Sound area. His interest in native plant materials and regional landscape made the landscape designer and his client the perfect match. He also took pleasure in forming concrete aggregate into steps and walkways ‚Äî a style he repeated in his work at Woodland Park and the Loveless Studio Building courtyard later in his career.

It has smooth greyish bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between eleven and fifteen, creamy white flowers and more or less hemispherical but flattened fruit. Description Eucalyptus ecostata is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptical, dull green leaves that are up to long and wide. Adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped to lance-shaped, glossy dark green, long and wide. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen on a pendulous peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are yellowish, long and wide with a long, conical operculum that is between two and five times as long as the floral cup. The flowers are creamy white and the fruit is a woody, flattened, more or less hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near the level of the rim or slightly beyond it. Taxonomy and naming This eucalypt was first formally described in 1911 by Joseph Maiden who gave it the name Eucalyptus falcata var. ecostata and published the description in Journal and proceedings of the Natural History and Science Society of Western Australia. In 2012 Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French raised the variety to species status. The specific epithet (ecostata) is derived from the Latin word costata meaning \\"ribbed\\" with the prefix e- meaning \\"out of\\", hence \\"without ribs\\".

It was initially launched in Early Access during 2017, and was fully released on July 12, 2019.  Gameplay  Streets of Rogue is set in a procedurally generated city consisting of several floors. In order to progress, the players will need to accomplish specific mission goals through the use of special character traits and items. After every death, new gadgets and abilities can be bought for the next session with chicken nuggets earned up to that point. The action is seen from a top-down view, and every level has a different visual theme. The Home Base is the central base of operations of the Resistance, an organisation created to fight against the tyranny of the Mayor of the city. It is populated by Resistance Leaders and other playable characters. Certain characters will allow the players to trade in Chicken Nuggets earned or provide other services as well. There are 6 main stages in Streets of Rogue, formed, with the exception of the last, by 3 levels each: Slums, Industrial, Park, Downtown, Uptown and Mayor Village.  Reception  On its release, Streets of Rogue was met with \\"generally favourable\\" reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 75/100 for Nintendo Switch, and 82/100 for Xbox One on Metacritic. Polygon praised the game for its comedic elements, explaining that \\"comedy in game design is difficult [and[ [i]t‚Äôs something of an achievement that developer Matt Dabrowski pulls it off by piling cheap gags so high, so often.\\" Rock Paper Shotgun compared it to \\"relatively plain-faced immersive sims of the blockbuster sort\\", praising the \\"sheer variety of this city‚Äôs pandemonium\\". PC Gamer compared it to other roguelikes, celebrating that Streets of Rogue \\"gives you more freedom than almost any roguelike, and its varied cast of characters, combined with the randomness of traits and mutators, mean no two runs play out the same way.\\" Nintendo Life also compared it to related game genres, explaining that \\"RPGs are at their best when they give you a world where you can be anyone and do anything [...] so if you want to be a werewolf, or a scientist, or a bartender, then this is the game for you.\\"  Sequel  In 2020, a sequel was announced by Matt Dabrowski. He added that he didn't have any established development schedule at the time. The plan is to build it on the existing code of the original game, and make something that is more open-ended.

The forward piston engine of a Cessna 337 Skymaster (a push-pull aircraft) is replaced by an electric motor powered by a battery, in a parallel hybrid configuration. The demonstrator first flew on 6 June 2019.  Design  Ampaire is replacing the Cessna 337 Skymaster (a push-pull aircraft) forward piston engine with an electric motor. The forward Continental IO-360 piston engine is replaced with an electric motor powered by a battery in a parallel hybrid configuration, optimising power output to reduce operating costs and pollution. The centerline thrust makes the 337 a useful testbed, allowing thrust differences with no yawing unlike a conventional twin-engine aircraft. Ampaire is marketing the EEL to government departments and private owners while undisclosed commercial operators already placed orders. Manufactured between 1965 and 1982, there is in-service fleet of 2,500 of the six-seat aircraft. EEL refers to the original 337 designation, with the characters reversed. Ampaire wants to offer multiple single and twin-engined aircraft, powered by its proprietary electric-propulsion system.  Development  By January 2019, Ampaire planned to fly the prototype on Hawaiian Mokulele Airlines commuter routes operated with Cessna Caravans. Seven other airlines are interested by Caravan or Twin Otter conversions: Seattle‚Äôs Kenmore Air, Tropic Air of Belize, Puerto Rico-based Vieques Air Link, Southern Airways Express of Memphis, Tennessee, Guernsey‚Äôs Aurigny and Star Marianas Air, based in the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as Norway. Test flights will take place on a route over 15 minutes between Kahului Airport in Central Maui and Hana Airport on the East side. The hybrid prototype held its first public test flight on June 6, 2019, before scheduled service planned for 2021. Later that month, Personal Airline Exchange (PAX) became the launch customer for the electric EEL modified six-seat Skymaster, to be certified in 2021, with an order for 50 plus 50 options. US start-up PAX is an on-demand per-seat charter offering point-to-point service competing with driving, is connecting small airports to bypass hubs and congested roads. PAX will acquire two Cessna 337s, sourced and refurbished by Ampaire, to start commercial operations in early 2020 in southern California before a nationwide introduction, with their original engines. A second prototype was first flown in September 2020. With this second prototype, Hawaiian regional carrier Mokulele Airlines will experiment connecting Maui airports. It will be limited to a pilot and two non-paying passengers, below its six-seat capacity, and Mokulele will provide hangar space, parts, pilots and maintenance. A similar pilot project is supported by Vieques Air Link, a regional airline in Puerto Rico. The certification and service entry of the EEL is planned for 2021. The prototype was originally configured with the electric motor replacing the aft engine, but by October 2019 the configuration was swapped with the piston engine in the back and the electric system forward. This redesign also moved the batteries outside the cabin into a belly pod.

The term is often used to indicate that the resolvent, when considered not in the original space (which is usually the L^2 space), but in certain weighted spaces (usually L^2_s, see below), has a limit as the spectral parameter approaches the essential spectrum. This concept developed from the idea of introducing small absorption into the wave equation for selecting particular solutions, which goes back to Vladimir Ignatowski. Relation to the scattering theory As an example, let us consider the Laplace operator in one dimension, which is an unbounded operator A=-\\\\partial_x^2, acting in L^2(\\\\R) and defined on the domain D(A)=H^2(\\\\R), the Sobolev space. Let us describe its resolvent, R(\\\\lambda)=(A-\\\\lambda I)^{-1}. Given the equation :(-\\\\partial_x^2-\\\\lambda)u(x)=f(x),\\\\quad x\\\\in\\\\R,\\\\quad f\\\\in L^2(\\\\R), then, for the spectral parameter \\\\lambda from the resolvent set \\\\C\\\\smallsetminus\\\\overline{\\\\R_+}, the solution u\\\\in L^2(\\\\R) is given by u(x)=(R(\\\\lambda)f)(x)=(G(\\\\cdot,\\\\lambda)*f)(x), where G(\\\\cdot,\\\\lambda)*f is the convolution of with the fundamental solution : :(G(\\\\cdot,\\\\lambda)*f)(x)=\\\\int_\\\\R G(x-y;\\\\lambda)f(y) \\\\, dy, with the fundamental solution given by : G(x;\\\\lambda)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{-\\\\lambda}}e^{-x\\\\sqrt{-\\\\lambda}}, \\\\quad \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\C\\\\smallsetminus\\\\overline{\\\\R_{+}}. It is clear which of the branches of the square root one needs to pick: the one with positive real part (which decays for large absolute value of ), so that the convolution of with f\\\\in L^2(\\\\R) makes sense. One can consider the limit of the fundamental solution G(x;\\\\lambda) as \\\\lambda approaches the spectrum of -\\\\partial_x^2, given by \\\\sigma(-\\\\partial_x^2)=\\\\overline{\\\\R_+}=[0,+\\\\infty). Depending on whether \\\\lambda approaches the spectrum from above or from below, there will be two different limiting expressions: G_+(x;\\\\lambda)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0+}G(x;\\\\lambda+i\\\\varepsilon)=-\\\\frac{1}{2i\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}e^{i x \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}} if \\\\lambda=\\\\lambda+i 0 (when \\\\lambda approaches \\\\R_+ from above) and G_-(x;\\\\lambda)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0+}G(x;\\\\lambda-i\\\\varepsilon)=\\\\frac{1}{2i\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}e^{-i x \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}} (when approaching \\\\R_+ from below). What do these two different limits correspond to? Let us recall that one arrives at the above spectral problem when studying the Schr√∂dinger equation, :i\\\\,\\\\partial_t\\\\psi(t,x)=-\\\\partial_x^2\\\\psi(t,x),\\\\quad t\\\\in\\\\R, \\\\quad x\\\\in\\\\R. The word \\"absorption\\" is due to the fact that if the medium were absorbing, then the equation would be i\\\\,\\\\partial_t\\\\psi(t,x)=-\\\\partial_x^2\\\\psi(t,x)-i\\\\varepsilon\\\\psi(t,x), the solution with \\\\varepsilon>0 would gain a temporal decay: \\\\psi(t,x)\\\\to\\\\psi(t,x)e^{-\\\\varepsilon t}, t\\\\to+\\\\infty; the \\"limiting absorption\\" means that this imaginary part tends to zero. Due to this decay in time for positive times, the Fourier transform in time of the solution, :\\\\hat\\\\psi(t,x)=\\\\int_\\\\R e^{i\\\\lambda t}\\\\psi(t,x) \\\\, dt, could be analytically extended into a small region of the lower half-plane, \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\C, with \\\\Im\\\\lambda>-\\\\varepsilon. In this sense, the \\"correct\\" resolvent, the one corresponding to the outgoing waves, would be represented by the operator R_-(\\\\lambda) with the integral kernel G_-(x-y,\\\\lambda), which is defined as the limit of the resolvent when approaching the spectrum from the region \\\\Im\\\\lambda<0. Estimates in the weighted spaces Let A:\\\\,X\\\\to X be a linear operator in a Banach space X, defined on the domain D(A)\\\\subset X. For the values of the spectral parameter from the resolvent set of the operator, \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\rho(A)\\\\subset\\\\C, the resolvent R(\\\\lambda)=(A-\\\\lambda I)^{-1} is bounded when considered as a linear operator acting from X to itself, R(\\\\lambda):\\\\,X\\\\to X, but its bound depends on the spectral parameter \\\\lambda and tends to infinity as \\\\lambda approaches the spectrum of the operator, \\\\sigma(A)=\\\\C\\\\smallsetminus\\\\rho(A). More precisely, there is the relation : \\\\Vert R(\\\\lambda)\\\\Vert\\\\ge\\\\frac{1}{\\\\operatorname{dist}(\\\\lambda,\\\\sigma(A))}, \\\\qquad \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\rho(A). In recent years, many scientists refer to the \\"limiting absorption principle\\" when they want to say that the resolvent R(\\\\lambda) of a particular operator , when considered as acting in certain weighted spaces, has a limit (and/or remains uniformly bounded) as the spectral parameter \\\\lambda approaches the essential spectrum, \\\\sigma_{ess}(A). For instance, in the above example of the Laplace operator in one dimension, A=-\\\\partial_x^2:\\\\,L^2(\\\\R)\\\\to L^2(\\\\R), defined on the domain D(A)=H^2(\\\\R), for \\\\lambda>0, both operators R_\\\\pm(\\\\lambda) with the integral kernels G_\\\\pm(x-y;\\\\lambda) are not bounded in L^2 (that is, as operators from L^2 to itself), but will both be bounded when considered as operators :R_\\\\pm(\\\\lambda):\\\\;L^2_s(\\\\R)\\\\to L^2_{-s}(\\\\R),\\\\quad s>1/2,\\\\quad\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\C\\\\smallsetminus\\\\overline{\\\\R_+}, where the spaces L^2_s(\\\\R) are defined as spaces of locally integrable functions such that their L^2_s-norm, : \\\\Vert u\\\\Vert_{L^2_s(\\\\R)}^2=\\\\int_\\\\R (1+x^2)^su(x)^2 \\\\, dx, is finite.

The wing was tested for a total of 47500 flights which is 2.5 times the number of flights in 25 years of operation. Each 16 hour flight took 11 minutes to simulate on the fatigue test rig. Fatigue testing is a specialised form of mechanical testing that is performed by applying cyclic loading to a coupon or structure. These tests are used either to generate fatigue life and crack growth data, identify critical locations or demonstrate the safety of a structure that may be susceptible to fatigue. Fatigue tests are used on a range components from coupons through to full size test articles such as automobiles and aircraft. Fatigue tests on coupons are typically conducted using servo hydraulic test machines which are capable of applying large variable amplitude cyclic loads. Constant amplitude testing can also be applied by simpler oscillating machines. The fatigue life of a coupon is the number of cycles it takes to break the coupon. This data can be used for creating stress-life or strain-life curves. The rate of crack growth in a coupon can also be measured, either during the test or afterward using fractography. Testing of coupons can also be carried out inside environmental chambers where the temperature, humidity and environment that may affect the rate of crack growth can be controlled. Because of the size and unique shape of full size test articles, special test rigs are built to apply loads through a series of hydraulic or electric actuators. Actuators aim to reproduce the significant loads experienced by a structure, which in the case of aircraft, may consist of manoeuvre, gust, buffet and ground-air-ground (GAG) loading. A representative sample or block of loading is applied repeatedly until the safe life of the structure has been demonstrated or failures occur which need to be repaired. Instrumentation such as load cells, strain gauges and displacement gauges are installed on the structure to ensure the correct loading has been applied. Periodic inspections of the structure around critical stress concentrations such as holes and fittings are made to determine the time detectable cracks were found and to ensure any cracking that does occur, does not affect other areas of the test article. Because not all loads can be applied, any unbalanced structural loads are typically reacted out to the test floor through non-critical structure such as the undercarriage. Airworthiness standards generally require a fatigue test to be carried out for large aircraft prior to certification to determine their safe life. Small aircraft may demonstrate safety through calculations, although typically larger scatter or safety factors are used because of the additional uncertainty involved.  Coupon tests  MTS-810 Fatigue test machine Fatigue tests are used to obtain material data such as the rate of growth of a fatigue crack that can be used with crack growth equations to predict the fatigue life. These tests usually determine the rate of crack growth per cycle da/dN versus the stress intensity factor range \\\\Delta K. Standardised tests have been developed to ensure repeatability and to allow the stress intensity factor to be easily determined. = Coupon shape = A variety of coupons can be used but some of the common ones are: * compact tension coupon (CT) * Centre Cracked Tension panel (CCT) * Single Edge Notch Tension coupon (SENT). = Instrumentation = The following instrumentation is commonly used for monitoring coupon tests: * Strain gauges are used to monitor the applied loading or stress fields around the crack tip. They may be placed beneath the path of the crack or on the back face of a compact tension coupon. * An extensometer or displacement gauge can be used to measure the crack tip opening displacement at the mouth of a crack. This value can be used to determine the stress intensity factor which will change with the length of the crack. Displacement gauges can also be used to measure the compliance of a coupon and the position during the loading cycle when contact between the opposite crack faces occurs in order to measure crack closure. * Applied test loads are usually monitored on the test machine with a load cell. * A travelling optical microscope can be use for measurement of the position of the crack tip.  Full scale fatigue tests  Fatigue test at Boeing Everett Full-scale tests may be used to: # Validate the proposed aircraft maintenance schedule. # Demonstrate the safety of a structure that may be susceptible to widespread fatigue damage. # Generate fatigue data # Validate expectations for crack initiation and growth pattern. # Identify critical locations # Validate software used to design and manufacture the aircraft. Fatigue tests can also be used to determine the extent that widespread fatigue damage may be a problem. = Test article = Certification requires knowing and accounting for the complete load history that has been experienced by a test article. Using test articles that have previously been used for static proof testing have caused problems where overloads have been applied and that can retard the rate of fatigue crack growth. The test loads are typically recorded using a data acquisition system acquiring data from possibly thousands of inputs from instrumentation installed on the test article, including: strain gages, pressure gauges, load cells, LVDTs, etc. Fatigue cracks typically initiate from high stress regions such as stress concentrations or material and manufacturing defects. It is important that the test article is representative of all of these features. Cracks may initiate from the following sources: * Fretting, typically from high cycle count dynamic loads. * Mis-drilled holes or incorrectly sized holes for interference fit fasteners. * Material treatment and defects such as broken inclusions. * Stress concentrations such as holes and fillets. * Scratches, impact damage. = Loading sequence = A representative block of loading is applied repeatedly until the safe life of the structure has been demonstrated or failures occur which need to be repaired. The size of the sequence is chosen so that the maximum loads which may cause retardation effects are applied sufficiently often, typically at least ten times throughout the test, so that there are no sequence effects. The loading sequence is generally filtered to eliminate applying small non- fatigue damaging cycles that would take too long to apply. Two types of filtering are typically used: # deadband filtering eliminates small cycles that completely fall within a certain range such as +/-3g. # rise-fall filtering eliminates small cycles that are less than a certain range such as 1g. The testing rate of large structures is typically limited to a few Hz and needs to avoid the resonance frequency of the structure. = Test rig = Fatigue test rig at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base All components that are not part of the test article or instrumentation are termed the test rig. The following components are typically found in full scale fatigue tests: * Whiffletrees. In order to apply the correct loads to various parts of the structure, a mechanism known as a whiffletree is used to distribute the loads from a loading actuator to the test article. Loads applied to a central point are distributed through a series of pin jointed connected beams to produce known loads at the end connections. Each end connection is typically attached to a pad which is bonded onto the structure such as an aircraft wing. Hundreds of pads are usually applied to reproduce the aerodynamic and inertial loads seen on wing. Because the whiffletree consists of tension linkages, they are unable to apply compressive loads and therefore, independent whiffletrees are typically used on the upper and lower sides of wing fatigue tests. * Hydraulic, electromagnetic or pneumatic actuators are used to apply loads to the structure, either directly or through the use of a whiffletree to distribute the loads. A load cell is placed inline with the actuator and is used by the load controller to control the loads into the actuator. When many actuators are used on a flexible test structure, there may be cross- interaction between the different actuators. The load controller must ensure that spurious loading cycles are not applied to the structure as a result of this interaction. * Reaction restraints. Many of the loads such as aerodynamic and internal forces are re-acted by internal forces which are not present during a fatigue test. Hence, the loads are reacted out of the structure at non-critical points such as the undercarriage or through restraints on the fuselage. * Linear variable differential transformer can be used to measure the displacement of critical locations on the structure. Limits on these displacements can be used to signal when a structure has failed and to automatically shut down the test. * Non-representative structure. Some test structure may be expensive or unavailable and are typically replaced on the test structure with an equivalent structure. Structure that is close to actuator attachment points may see an unrealistic load that makes these areas non-representative. = Instrumentation = The following instrumentation is typically used on a fatigue test: * strain gauges * accelerometers * displacement gauges * load cells * crack sensor * structural health monitoring sensors It is important to install any strain gauges on the test article that are also used for monitoring fleet aircraft. This allows the same damage calculations to be performed on the test article that are used to track the fatigue life of fleet aircraft. This is the primary way of ensuring fleet aircraft do not exceed the safe-life determined from the fatigue test. = Inspections = Inspections form a component of a fatigue test. It is important to know when a detectable crack occurs in order to determine the certified life of each component in addition to minimising the damage to surrounding structure and to develop repairs that have minimal impact on the certification of the adjacent structure. Non-destructive inspections may be carried out during testing and destructive tests may be used at the end of testing to ensure the structure retains its load carrying capacity. = Certification = Test interpretation and certification involves using the results from the fatigue test to justify the safe life and operation of an item. The purpose of certification is to ensure the probability of failure in service is acceptably small. The following factors may need to be considered: * number of tests * symmetry of the test structure and the applied loading * installation and certification of repairs * scatter factors * material and manufacturing process variability * environment * criticality  Notable fatigue tests  * Cold proof loading tests of the F-111. These tests involved applying static limit loads to aircraft which had been chilled to reduce the critical fracture size. Passing the test meant that there were no large fatigue cracks present. When cracks were present, the wings failed catastrophically. * The International Follow-On Structural Fatigue Test Program (IFOSTP) was a joint venture between Australia, Canada and the U.S. to fatigue test the F/A-18 Hornet. The Australian test involved the use of electrodynamic shakers and pneumatic airbags to simulate high angle of attack buffet loads over the empennage. * de Havilland Comet suffered a series of catastrophic failures that ultimately proved to be fatigue despite being fatigue tested. * Fatigue tests on 110 Mustang wing sets were carried out to determine the scatter in fatigue life. * The novel No Highway and movie No Highway in the Sky were about the fictional fatigue test of the fuselage of a passenger aircraft. * Fatigue tests have also been used to grow fatigue cracks that are too small to be detected.

A proponent of enlightened absolutism, he held the office of censor of the Illyrian Deputation for two decades and was responsible for printing and reprinting hundreds of books during the reigns of Maria Theresa, Joseph II, Leopold II, and Francis II. Biography He was born in Gy√∂r on the 18 of January 1738 and baptized in the Serbian Orthodox Church. His father, a small peasant-farmer, died when Atanasije was in his teens. He was brought up to farm work, but he cultivated all his leisure in reading, and when he was seventeen entered the University of Vienna Law School where he picked up Latin and German. Gradually, and by dint of infinite patience and concentration, the young man became a master of many languages, namely German, Hungarian, Romanian, Greek, Slovak, Russian, and Old Church Slavonic, all languages commonly read and spoken in the empire among Eastern Orthodox Slavs and their co-religionists. Atanasije was a pragmatist who eventually in mid-1776 converted to Roman Catholicism (Uniate) in order to secure his future. But, from then on he became one of the most hated and vilified persons amongst his compatriots in Habsburg lands and even in other neighboring Serbian lands, then under the Turkish yoke. It was that \\"struggle\\" that Sekere≈° alone chose to endure. During his tenure as Austrian Royal censor of state publishing houses, he was responsible for printing and reprinting hundreds of textbooks, primers, catechisms, scholarly manuals, and popular literature for nationals who professed the Eastern Orthodox faith. Perhaps for Sekere≈°'s lofty position, he was regarded with suspicion by most, though his friend Dositej Obradoviƒá, never doubted him. He began his career as a censor in 1772 at the prestigious Publishing House of Josef von Kurzb√∂ck and a year later he got the lofty Latin title of Excelsae Deputationis Caesareo-Regiae in Illyris Athanasius Demetrovich Szekeres revisor. His mentors were Metropolitan Viƒáentije Jovanoviƒá Vidak and Adam Franti≈°ek Koll√°r. He was also active as a Serbian school reformer, translating most of the German textbooks, particularly those written by Johann Ignaz von Felbiger. He also collaborated with Teodor Jankoviƒá Mirijevski. On his watch, censorship was organized in a different way under his direction. He carried out a centralization of the censorship that was only partly successful, however, through his own design. He also tried to use scientific and rational aspects for the judgment of literature. He reprinted Slavic, Romanian, Greek and Armenian textbooks en masse for dissemination to all the district schools throughout the empire. Atanasije Dimitriejeviƒá Sekere≈° worked diligently at his office until the day he died on 30 April 1794 in Vienna. Works He wrote and published \\"Sokroviste slavjanskog jezika\\", \\"Mona≈°skaja pravila\\" (which appeared in 1777), \\"Memoiri\\". Also, he edited and published \\"Itika Jeropolitika\\" in Vienna in 1774. This miscellany of emblems, first printed in Kyiv in 1712, and for the express use of Serbian reading public, was reprinted, thanks to his efforts to leave a literary legacy for his fellow Slavs and others. The influence of this book can be seen both in the printing and in poetry (the poetry of Jovan Rajiƒá) of that period. Much later, this book was mentioned in the rhetoric of Avram Mrazoviƒá in 1821. The importance and the influence of the emblematic in Serbian baroque can also be seen both in the painting art, graphic art, and in the newspaper articles of that period, as well.

The game features an unnamed protagonist trapped in a house, needing to solve puzzles while avoiding the titular \\"Granny\\" to get out of the house in a time period of only five to six days. The game gained heavy traction following its release through various media platforms, such as YouTube, Twitch and other sources of social media. The latest update the game received was on April 18, 2019. Granny has very sensitive hearing, taking advantage of any loud sound made by the player and using it to track them down. The overall objective of the game is to escape the house by using clues, solving puzzles and to finding various items that are scattered around the house.  Gameplay  The game takes place in an old house where the player is trapped. The player must explore the house to find items that can help them escape. Items include a hammer to pry out planks of wood, a pair of pliers, a shotgun and a crossbow. The player can either escape by removing the locks on the front door, or by repairing the car in the garage, the latter of which requires an additional set of items. Granny searches the house for the player, using any loud sound to her advantage and setting traps in order to hinder the player. If Granny spots the player, she will start chasing them at different speeds depending on the difficulty. There is also a 'practice' mode, in which Granny is not present, allowing the player to freely roam the house. There is also a giant spider in the top attic floor, which guards an important item and will attack the player on sight if it is not distracted or killed. There is also an additional 'nightmare mode' which adds a bloodier texture to surfaces and re-textures Granny's model as well as re-skinning Granny's bear traps. If the player is caught, Granny will knock the player unconscious, which ends the current day. The player can also get knocked out by falling through the unstable flooring, the spider in the attic, or by blowing themselves up with the gasoline can. If the player is caught on the last day, one of 4 \\"game over\\" cut-scenes play, and the player is sent back to the title screen. The player can knock Granny unconscious (which lasts for a period of fifteen seconds to two minutes, depending on the difficulty level.), or blind her temporarily by using a variety of different traps and weapons. If Granny is shot with the shotgun, an extra 30 seconds is added (which is decreased to 15 if the player is playing in Extreme Mode.). The player also receives injuries during the period of time they are in the house which includes limping and blood surrounding the peripheral vision.  Plot  The game's plot is unmentioned in the mobile version. In the PC version, the game starts off with a cut-scene of the player walking through the woods. The player finds Granny's house and is subsequently attacked by Granny. The player awakes in a bed, which starts the game properly. According to a note that is found inside the basement, the player is not the first person that Granny has trapped. It is unclear if the previous visitor escaped the house, but the note indicates that they were quite badly injured and aware that they had little chance of escaping.  Series continuation  = Granny: Chapter Two = A second game, Granny: Chapter Two, was released for Android on September 6, 2019, iOS the following day, and on Microsoft Windows on December 30 the same year. Similar to the first installment, the player is once again trapped in a house. Granny: Chapter Two also introduces a secondary antagonist, Grandpa, who has limited hearing capabilities and will not be alerted by most sounds. The player also has the option to choose between Granny or Grandpa on lower difficulties, as opposed to harder difficulties, in which both of them are automatically forced on. There are several new items and weapons in this game, and in addition to the front door escape, the player can also escape via helicopter or a motorboat. There are also two new monsters who pose a threat to the player. The game was last updated on April 3, 2020. It initially received positive reviews.  Reception  The game became a viral hit on various media platforms. It is rated 4.2 out of 5 stars on the Google Play Store, 4.4 out of 5 on the App Store. The game also spawned numerous clones, such as Scary Granny, a scam game designed to infect players with malware. The game had received over 100 million downloads as of June 2019. William Lewinsky of Indie Game Critic gave the game 10 out of 10 stars, praising its controls as \\"very well implemented\\" and its sound effects as \\"stellar\\", while also stating that it was effective at scaring the player.

It stars Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Suki Waterhouse, Harry Shum Jr., Shiloh Fernandez and Josh Hutcherson. It was released on August 23, 2019, by Momentum Pictures. Plot Melinda begins the graveyard shift as an attendant at a gas station on a cold winter night. Lonely and introverted, she doesn't object when her coworker Sheila, who has an attitude, mentions the toilets need cleaned when she steps inside. Later, while taking a break, she searches through her phone for photos of a police officer she has been taking photos of discreetly in the store. She also sticks her fingers in the hot coffee pot. Getting her cash tray from the biometric safe, she begins her shift behind the counter. Sheila tries to get her to do some dance moves, then films them, to Melinda's disgust. An older repeat customer offers Sheila a pair of shoe insoles to ease her standing all night, but Sheila is creeped out, having seen the man many times before. They fit Melinda however, and she tries to make amends with the dejected man as he walks outside, to no avail. Meanwhile, another customer, Billy, parks his stolen vehicle, stashes a gun in his back, and walks in to Melinda greeting him at the front door. A policeman, Officer Liu pulls up and strikes up conversation with Melinda, who admires his new patrol vehicle and asks for a ride, even if it's just around the parking lot. Later, as Liu purchases coffee, Melinda snaps a new photo and Sheila catches her in the act. Melinda drops her phone, breaking the screen, and Liu kindly consoles her before being called away on an alert. Sheila bullies her into showing the multiple photos she's taken of Liu. Melinda is devastated and eases the pain by smoking out the back door. Upon returning to shift, she finds Billy engaging Sheila in a stick up. In a rather jovial manner, he demands cash and demonstrates that his gun is real by firing it when they doubt him. There's not much money in the registers, and Sheila tells him they don't have access to the safe. He says he really needs it to pay back a gang of bikers he crossed. Melinda offers to open the safe. Sheila tries to write a note to another customer to call 911, but Melinda grabs it. She tells Billy she wants to go with him. A struggle ensues because she won't hand over the backpack until he says yes. As Billy is finally leaving with the money, Sheila's begins to talk him down with profanities. He grabs her and forces her to the ground, then orders Melinda to lock the doors and go into the bathrooms. Billy hauls Sheila to an employee break room and begins beating her. Melinda sneaks out and burns her whole hand with the hot coffee before sneaking up behind Billy and flinging it in his face. His gun accidentally goes off, killing Sheila. Melinda then hits Billy in the head with a fire extinguisher, causing him to black out. When he awakens, he finds himself strapped to a chair, with Melinda quietly mopping blood and Sheila's body wrapped in a tarp. Melinda and Billy converse, with him talking her up even though he doesn't care anything about her. He didn't want to take her along earlier. At his request, she gets a cigarette, aspirin and water. She gives him some pills and he begins to feel something happening to his body. What Melinda actually gives Billy is cheap gas station erectile medication. She proceeds to tape Billy's eyes and mouth shut, undoes his jeans and pulls down her pants and underwear and attempts to rape him. He struggles and he is able to rip the tape holding one of his arms, knocking his Melinda away. Then everything becomes a game of cat and mouse in the small room as a blind Billy goes after a scared and sadistic Melinda. He gets knocked out once again when he hits a locker door and everything is quiet once again. Melinda pockets his gun, takes the backpack of money, straightens the room and leaves. Melinda quietly unlocks the front door for a customer, who then berates her for having no hot coffee. Behind the counter, unable to take it any longer, Melinda puts the gun to her chin briefly before breaking down and sobbing, telling the customer to just leave her alone. Perry, Sheila's boyfriend, soon shows up to give her a ride home, but Melinda tells him she's not there. Perry doesn't believe her when he finds her phone on the floor. In troubled desperation, Melinda tells him that Sheila has left with another guy. She doesn't know what name or which hotel they went to, but this lie gets Perry out the door. Melinda steps out the back door and tries to find a place to bury the bodies. The ground is too hard and cold. That's when the biker gang rolls in looking for Billy. She stands guard at the front door and says she hasn't seen him, and won't let them in. She says the store is closed, even though the sign says 24 hrs. When she threatens them with her gun, they pull out theirs until their leader makes them back off. They promptly leave. Melinda can't break into the box where the surveillance data is stored in order to destroy it. She stands outside the front of the store, thinking. Melinda smokes and flicks her lighter. Then she remembers the No Smoking rule and begins filling containers with gas. Officer Liu shows up, recognizing Billy's car as stolen. He questions Melinda, who says she hasn't seen anything suspicious. Everything is fine. He calls and wakes the manager to come access the surveillance data. Behind the counter, Melinda slowly reaches for her gun and pockets it. As Liu questions Melinda, she is slowly losing it again. He says he cares about her, she doesn't believe him. Melinda tries to keep Liu from searching the store, but finding nothing, he leaves. Billy has escaped, leaving only zip ties. Melinda begins dowsing the store with gasoline. She hears Billy come from the back and hides behind shelves. He kills the power, which locks the front doors. Perry returns, suspicious as to Sheila's disappearance. Billy escapes out the back door and barricades it with dumpsters, then strangles Perry out front. Melinda calls Liu and finally admits her lies and need for help. Billy rams Perry's Jeep into the front doors, shattering the glass. Backed into a corner with his gun pointed right at her, Melinda pleads with Billy to simply take the money and leave. But that's not good enough for Billy after what she did to him. He fires a bullet from the gun, which ignites the gas. As he shrieks from the burns, Melinda grabs a fire extinguisher and escapes through the front door. Soon sirens can be heard and Liu is by her side. Liu helps Melinda carefully into his car and comforts her. It is finally then that Melinda believes that someone does care about her.

There are five copper plates in this collection, with seventy-six verses in Sanskrit, written in the eastern variety of North Indian alphabet prevalent in the sixth and seventh centuries. All six plates in this grant were first discovered around 1950 during digging near a Siva temple in Dubi village about three miles from the Pathshala railway station, Kamrup district, Assam; but the sixth plate was irrecoverably destroyed soon after discovery. These plates are currently in the Assam State Museum. This plate was issued before the Nidhanpur copperplate inscription, during the earlier part of Bhaskkaravarman's reign.

Known as The Clay Lady since 1982, McDaniel developed The Clay Lady Way teaching method for art educators. The effective process streamlines clay firing into one step instead of two, which helps educators cut costs and time when creating pottery. The Clay Lady Way is further explained in McDaniel's manual for teachers, How to Teach Clay The Clay Lady Way, self-published in 1996. The manual offers instructions and suggestions for applying a series of pottery lessons appropriate for a variety of educational settings while working on a budget. Biography McDaniel was born in Tulsa, Oklahomaand moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee in 1973. After graduating from high school, McDaniel attended Volunteer State Community College in Nashville, Tennessee (1980); Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky; and Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee (1982). In 1982 McDaniel began studying pottery with Lena Lucas at Metro Parks Centennial Art Center in Nashville, Tennessee. McDaniel built a small classroom next to her home in Hendersonville, Tennessee and began offering clay classes to local children. It was during this time that her students named her The Clay Lady. McDaniel continued teaching classes for Metro Parks and offered workshops and classes at Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art and the Jewish Community Center in Nashville. By 1995 McDaniel was also teaching workshops and classes for the Hendersonville Arts Council as well as providing classes at local festivals and community events in the Nashville area. She then began working with local public and private schools in teaching weekly onsite workshops and clay classes featuring The Clay Lady Way. Eventually, McDaniel was working with over 800 students each week and traveling to numerous schools across middle Tennessee. She published a textbook, The Clay Lady Way: A Textbook for Teaching Clay Grades K-12. Other publications include Made the Clay Lady Way, a collection of lessons for teachers; The Spirit of the Lesson, and Forted, a novel for young adults. A series of Clay Lady DVDs was developed and included titles such as How to Throw on the Potter‚Äôs Wheel and How to Teach Clay the Clay Lady Way. These are now part of The Clay Lady's YouTube Channel. In 2007, McDaniel and her business associate, Tami Archer, purchased Mid-South Ceramic Supply and merged The Clay Lady‚Äôs products and educational services into one facility on Lebanon Pike in Nashville. This merger lead to the establishment of The Clay Lady‚Äôs Artist Co-op and Galleries. A purchase of an additional building in 2011 allowed for educational outreach expansion and studio space for artists. The Clay Lady‚Äôs Campus now serves almost 200 students each week who visit for tours, pottery classes and workshops on a variety of topics that include on- going pottery classes, sculpture classes, glass, metal, and wood. The campus is also home to over 65 Co-op artists and provides meeting space for conferences and events such as the International Ceramic Arts Network Conferences (formerly The Potter‚Äôs Council), and ARTable, an event that merges artists with art enthusiasts, and workshops sponsored by Tennessee Craft. In addition, McDaniel continues to offer workshops and related art opportunities for young people with disabilities as part of Borderless Arts Tennessee (formerly VSA TN). McDaniel was awarded the 2020 Friend of Tennessee Art Educators by the Tennessee Art Educators Association for her work in art education as well as for her ongoing support for art educators across Tennessee. She stays active in community and leadership organizations and maintains membership in Metro Arts Commission (Nashville) and Tennessee Craft.

Each approach had advantages and disadvantages. Prior to the redefinition the kilogram, and several other SI units based on the kilogram, were defined by a man-made metal artifact called the international prototype of the kilogram. There was broad agreement that the older definition of the kilogram should be replaced. SI system after the 2019 redefinition: the kilogram is now fixed in terms of the second, the metre and the Planck constant The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) approved a redefinition of the SI base units in November 2018 that defines the kilogram by defining the Planck constant to be exactly . This approach effectively defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre, and took effect on 20 May 2019.Decision CIPM/105-13 (October 2016). The day is the 144th anniversary of the Metre Convention. In 1960, the metre, previously similarly having been defined with reference to a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it, was redefined in terms of an invariant physical constant (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be independently reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) in 2005, it was recommended that the same be done with the kilogram. In October 2010, the CIPM voted to submit a resolution for consideration at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), to \\"take note of an intention\\" that the kilogram be defined in terms of the Planck constant, (which has dimensions of energy times time) together with other physical constants. This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM in October 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014. Although the Committee recognised that significant progress had been made, they concluded that the data did not yet appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition, and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting, scheduled for 2018. Such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of delineating the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision, accuracy and stability. The Kibble balance is one way do this. As part of this project, a variety of very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. Some of these approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, physical constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to physical constants. Such approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.  Kibble balance  NIST's Kibble balance is a project of the US government to develop an \\"electronic kilogram\\". The vacuum chamber dome, which lowers over the entire apparatus, is visible at top. The Kibble balance (known as a \\"watt balance\\" before 2016) is essentially a single-pan weighing scale that measures the electric power necessary to oppose the weight of a kilogram test mass as it is pulled by Earth's gravity. It is a variation of an ampere balance, with an extra calibration step that eliminates the effect of geometry. The electric potential in the Kibble balance is delineated by a Josephson voltage standard, which allows voltage to be linked to an invariant constant of nature with extremely high precision and stability. Its circuit resistance is calibrated against a quantum Hall effect resistance standard. The Kibble balance requires extremely precise measurement of the local gravitational acceleration g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance when the elevation of the centre of the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309ŒºGal per metre, which affects the weight of a one-kilogram test mass by about 316Œºg/m. In April 2007, the NIST's implementation of the Kibble balance demonstrated a combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36Œºg.The combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of these measurements, as with all other tolerances and uncertainties in this article unless otherwise noted, are at one standard deviation (1œÉ), which equates to a confidence level of about 68%; that is to say, 68% of the measurements fall within the stated tolerance. The UK's National Physical Laboratory's Kibble balance demonstrated a CRSU of 70.3Œºg in 2007.\\"An initial measurement of Planck's constant using the NPL Mark II watt balance\\", I.A. Robinson et al., Metrologia 44 (2007), NPL: NPL Kibble Balance That Kibble balance was disassembled and shipped in 2009 to Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the National Research Council), where research and development with the device could continue. interference fringes‚Äîthe dark and light bands above‚Äîblooms at an ever-faster rate as a free-falling corner reflector drops inside an absolute gravimeter. The pattern's frequency sweep is timed by an atomic clock. Gravity and the nature of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local gravitational acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly‚Äîby nearly 1%‚Äîdepending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g at a location due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon and the Sun. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the process of measurement of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilised helium‚Äìneon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature‚Äîand with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8 ppb of .R. Steiner, Watts in the watt balance, NIST, Oct 16, 2009. The virtue of electronic realisations like the Kibble balance is that the definition and dissemination of the kilogram no longer depends upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It frees physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards can simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram is delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it is defined in a manner that is directly traceable to three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram depends in addition only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium-133 atom . The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light . With the kilogram redefined in this manner, physical objects such as the IPK are no longer part of the definition, but instead become transfer standards. Scales like the Kibble balance also permit more flexibility in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards would be the same as existing national primary and check standards (‚âà21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability for chemically isolating these new alloys. The challenge with Kibble balances is not only in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realisations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state- of-the-art technology that‚Äîunlike a device like an atomic clock‚Äîfew countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in a different part of NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards down the hall to the Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10Œºg) or more.R. Steiner, No FG-5?, NIST, Nov 30, 2007. \\"We rotate between about 4 resistance standards, transferring from the calibration lab to my lab every 2‚Äì6 weeks. Resistors do not transfer well, and sometimes shift at each transfer by 10 ppb or more.\\" Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. When the new definition takes effect, it is likely there will only be a few‚Äîat most‚ÄîKibble balances initially operating in the world. Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram Several alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram that were fundamentally different from the Kibble balance were explored to varying degrees, with some abandoned. The Avogadro project, in particular, was important for the 2018 redefinition decision because it provided an accurate measurement of the Planck constant that was consistent with and independent of the Kibble balance method. The alternative approaches included: = Atom-counting approaches =  Avogadro project  Achim Leistner at the Australian Centre for Precision Optics (ACPO) holds a 1kg, single-crystal silicon sphere for the Avogadro project. Among the roundest man-made objects in the world, the sphere scaled to the size of Earth would have a high point of only 2.4 metres above \\"sea level\\".The sphere shown in the photograph has an out-of-roundness value (peak to valley on the radius) of 50nm. According to ACPO, they improved on that with an out-of-roundness of 35nm. On the 93.6mm diameter sphere, an out- of-roundness of 35nm (deviation of ¬±17.5nm from the average) is a fractional roundness . Scaled to the size of Earth, this is equivalent to a maximum deviation from sea level of only 2.4m. The roundness of that ACPO sphere is exceeded only by two of the four fused-quartz gyroscope rotors flown on Gravity ProbeB, which were manufactured in the late 1990s and given their final figure at the W.W. Hansen Experimental Physics Lab at Stanford University. Particularly, \\"Gyro 4\\" is recorded in the Guinness database of world records (their database, not in their book) as the world's roundest man- made object. According to a published report (221kB PDF, here ) and the GPB public affairs coordinator at Stanford University, of the four gyroscopes onboard the probe, Gyro4 has a maximum surface undulation from a perfect sphere of 3.4¬±0.4nm on the 38.1mm diameter sphere, which is a Scaled to the size of Earth, this is equivalent to an deviation the size of North America rising slowly up out of the sea (in molecular-layer terraces 11.9cm high), reaching a maximum elevation of 1.14¬±0.13m in Nebraska, and then gradually sloping back down to sea level on the other side of the continent. Another Avogadro constant-based approach, known as the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and delineate the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature technology for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists, the Czochralski process, to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realisation of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius‚Äîroughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (‚âà192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With the size of the sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram. Experiments are being performed on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better than that of the IPK's, because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see ', below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artefact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of 10‚Äì20 parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidises and forms a thin layer (equivalent to silicon atoms deep) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished size. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don't oxidise unless coaxed to do so in the laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide stoichiometry. All silicon-based approaches would fix the Avogadro constant but vary in the details of the definition of the kilogram. One approach would use silicon with all three of its natural isotopes present. About 7.78% of silicon comprises the two heavier isotopes: 29Si and 30Si. As described in ' below, this method would define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of 12C atoms by fixing the Avogadro constant; the silicon sphere would be the practical realisation. This approach could accurately delineate the magnitude of the kilogram because the masses of the three silicon nuclides relative to 12C are known with great precision (relative uncertainties of 1ppb or better). An alternative method for creating a silicon sphere-based kilogram proposes to use isotopic separation techniques to enrich the silicon until it is nearly pure 28Si, which has a relative atomic mass of . With this approach, the Avogadro constant would not only be fixed, but so too would the atomic mass of 28Si. As such, the definition of the kilogram would be decoupled from 12C and the kilogram would instead be defined as atoms of 28Si (‚âà fixed moles of 28Si atoms). Physicists could elect to define the kilogram in terms of 28Si even when kilogram prototypes are made of natural silicon (all three isotopes present). Even with a kilogram definition based on theoretically pure 28Si, a silicon-sphere prototype made of only nearly pure 28Si would necessarily deviate slightly from the defined number of moles of silicon to compensate for various chemical and isotopic impurities as well as the effect of surface oxides.NPL: Avogadro Project; Australian National Measurement Institute: [ Redefining the kilogram through the Avogadro constant]; and Australian Centre for Precision Optics: The Avogadro Project  Carbon-12  Though not offering a practical realisation, this definition would precisely define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of carbon12 atoms. Carbon12 (12C) is an isotope of carbon. The mole is currently defined as \\"the quantity of entities (elementary particles like atoms or molecules) equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon12\\". Thus, the current definition of the mole requires that moles ( mol) of 12C has a mass of precisely one kilogram. The number of atoms in a mole, a quantity known as the Avogadro constant, is experimentally determined, and the current best estimate of its value is This new definition of the kilogram proposed to fix the Avogadro constant at precisely with the kilogram being defined as \\"the mass equal to that of atoms of 12C\\". The accuracy of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom‚Äîand the magnitude of the kilogram‚Äîcould be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realisations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see ', below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement. A variation on a 12C-based definition proposes to define the Avogadro constant as being precisely 3 (‚âà) atoms. An imaginary realisation of a 12-gram mass prototype would be a cube of 12C atoms measuring precisely atoms across on a side. With this proposal, the kilogram would be defined as \\"the mass equal to 3√ó atoms of 12C.\\"  Ion accumulation  Another Avogadro-based approach, ion accumulation, since abandoned, would have defined and delineated the kilogram by precisely creating new metal prototypes on demand. It would have done so by accumulating gold or bismuth ions (atoms stripped of an electron) and counting them by measuring the electric current required to neutralise the ions. Gold (197Au) and bismuth (209Bi) were chosen because they can be safely handled and have the two highest atomic masses among the mononuclidic elements that are stable (gold) or effectively so (bismuth).In 2003, the same year the first gold-deposition experiments were conducted, physicists found that the only naturally occurring isotope of bismuth, 209Bi, is actually very slightly radioactive, with the longest known radioactive half-life of any naturally occurring element that decays via alpha radiation‚Äîa half-life of . As this is 1.4 billion times the age of the universe, 209Bi is considered a stable isotope for most practical applications (those unrelated to such disciplines as nucleocosmochronology and geochronology). In other terms, of the bismuth that existed on Earth 4.567 billion years ago still exists today. Only two mononuclidic elements are heavier than bismuth and only one approaches its stability: thorium. Long considered a possible replacement for uranium in nuclear reactors, thorium can cause cancer when inhaled because it is over 1.2billion times more radioactive than bismuth. It also has such a strong tendency to oxidise that its powders are pyrophoric. These characteristics make thorium unsuitable in ion-deposition experiments. See also Isotopes of bismuth, Isotopes of gold and Isotopes of thorium. See also Table of nuclides. With a gold-based definition of the kilogram for instance, the relative atomic mass of gold could have been fixed as precisely , from the current value of . As with a definition based upon carbon12, the Avogadro constant would also have been fixed. The kilogram would then have been defined as \\"the mass equal to that of precisely atoms of gold\\" (precisely 3,057,443,620,887,933,963,384,315 atoms of gold or about fixed moles). In 2003, German experiments with gold at a current of only demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%.The German national metrology institute, known as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB): Working group 1.24, Ion Accumulation Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30mA were expected to accumulate a mass of 30g in six days and to have a relative uncertainty of better than 1 ppm.General Conference on Weights and Measures, 22nd Meeting, October 2003 (3.2MB ZIP file). Ultimately, ionaccumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.Bowers, Mary, The Caravan, September 1‚Äì15, 2009: \\"Why the World is Losing Weight\\" Among the many technical challenges of the ion- deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects‚Äîa phenomenon whereby ions that had already been counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around (<1km/s for gold). If the kilogram had been defined as a precise quantity of gold or bismuth atoms deposited with an electric current, not only would the Avogadro constant and the atomic mass of gold or bismuth have to have been precisely fixed, but also the value of the elementary charge (e), likely to (from the currently recommended value of ). Doing so would have effectively defined the ampere as a flow of electrons per second past a fixed point in an electric circuit. The SI unit of mass would have been fully defined by having precisely fixed the values of the Avogadro constant and elementary charge, and by exploiting the fact that the atomic masses of bismuth and gold atoms are invariant, universal constants of nature. Beyond the slowness of making a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach that proved to be formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realisation. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion- deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum- iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto‚Äîand become part of‚Äîan electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low- temperature solders, slowly oxidises when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere. = Ampere-based force = perfect diamagnetic levitation via the Meissner effect. Experiments with an ampere-based definition of the kilogram flipped this arrangement upside-down: an electric field accelerated a superconducting test mass supported by fixed magnets. This approach would define the kilogram as \\"the mass which would be accelerated at precisely when subjected to the per-metre force between two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, placed one metre apart in vacuum, through which flow a constant current of elementary charges per second\\". Effectively, this would define the kilogram as a derivative of the ampere rather than the present relationship, which defines the ampere as a derivative of the kilogram. This redefinition of the kilogram would specify elementary charge (e) as precisely coulomb rather than the current recommended value of It would necessarily follow that the ampere (one coulomb per second) would also become an electric current of this precise quantity of elementary charges per second passing a given point in an electric circuit. The virtue of a practical realisation based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, all of which require the careful characterisation of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates the magnitude of the kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realisation based upon accelerating masses. Experiments over a period of years in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.

He joined the Pogo≈Ñ youth teams at the age of 12, before signing his first professional contract with Pogo≈Ñ in 1976 aged 18. After 2 seasons with Pogo≈Ñ, Kruchy moved to rivals Arkonia. He stayed with Arkonia for 5 seasons until 1983. =Lechia Gda≈Ñsk= Kruchy joined Lechia in 1983, just after the team had won the Polish Cup and secured promotion to II liga, the second tier in Polish football. His first competitive match for Lechia was to be the Polish SuperCup final against Lech Pozna≈Ñ. Lechia ended up winning the final due to Kruchy's 88th-minute goal to secure victory with a 1-0 win. In his first season with Lechia it was also Lechia's first ever season taking part in a continental competition, despite being in the second tier. Lechia were drawn with Italian and European giants, Juventus. Lechia lost 10-2 over both legs, with the home leg finishing 3-2 to Juventus, but with Kruchy scoring the second Lechia goal in the game, a penalty in the 63rd minute to put Lechia 2-1 ahead. The season was successful for both Lechia and Kruszczy≈Ñski. Lechia won the II liga, securing promotion to the Ekstraklasa for the first time in 22 years, while Kruchy ended up being the leagues top goal-scorer scoring 31 goals in 30 games, including hat-tricks in both games against arch rivals Arka Gdynia. The following season Lechia were back in the top flight. While the season was not as spectacular in terms of goals scored or competitions they competed in, Lechia succeed in avoiding relegation, with Kruchy scoring an important 8 goals in 27 appearances. =Lech Pozna≈Ñ= Kruchy moved to Lech for the 1985-86 season. While at Lech, he didn't make the same goal scoring impact he initially had at Lechia, scoring 6 goals in his first season. In total he amassed 108 goals while scoring 30 goals for Lech. The Lech team was much more competitive than the previous Lechia team, and offered him the chance to win more silverware. Lech won the Polish Cup in the 1987-88 season, and finished runners up in the Polish SuperCup the following season. Lech were also often much more competitive than Lechia in the league, but failed to win the title while Kruchy was at the club. While at Lech, Kruchy competed in European competitions every season, two of these seasons however being the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Most famously was in his final season for Lech when they beat Albanian team Flamurtari Vlor√´ in the first round, securing a second-round game against the Spanish giants Barcelona. Both legs finished 1-1, with Kruchy once again scoring from the penalty spot in the home leg. After finishing as a draw after extra-time, Barcelona went through after winning 5-4 on penalties. =Return to Lechia= After 4 seasons with Lech, Kruchy had a brief spell in Sweden with Ume√• FC before returning to Lechia Gda≈Ñsk again. The stay at Lechia was only for half a season, with Kruchy scoring 3 goals in 9 games for Lechia, before finally retiring from football. =Sweden= After returning from playing professional football, Kruchy moved to Sweden where he managed two female football teams, Ume√• S√∂dra FF, the female section of Ume√• FC where he briefly played, and Gislaveds FF.

He was born to poor farmers and worked straight after his education as a shoemaker due to being unable to afford further education; he was likewise unable to pursue his dream of becoming a priest due to wanting to work to support his siblings. He joined the Franciscans as a religious brother instead in 1878 and worked as their cobbler and beekeeper while ministering to poor children and going around asking for alms for them. His apostolate continued in World War I when he would bring gifts to those affected. Kosiba's process for beatification launched in the 1960s and he became titled as a Servant of God. He had a large number of devotees following his death which included the Bishop (and future pope) Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça and the Archbishop of Krak√≥w Franciszek Macharski. He became titled as Venerable in mid-2017 after Pope Francis acknowledged the fact that the late religious had lived a life of heroic virtue. Life Kosiba's tomb. Piotr Kosiba was born on 29 June 1855 in Libusza in his parents' log home as the second of three children to the poor farmers Jan Kosiba and Agnieszka (who were married on 29 January 1849). His paternal grandparents were Maciej Kosiba and Katarzyna Przyby≈Çowicz and his maternal grandparents were Valentin and Anna (who died from cholera in 1845). He received his baptism just hours after his birth in the wooden church of the Blessed Virgin from its parish priest Alojzy Haas (his godparents were his neighbors J√≥zef Sroka and Marianna Piotrowska). His siblings (in order) were his brother Jacob and his sister Ludwika (born on 18 December 1857). His mother died on 21 December 1857 when he was a toddler just before Christmas after giving birth to Ludwika. His father - who was managing seven acres of land - remarried to Apolonia Kosibow and had seven more children with three of them having died in their infancies. His maternal aunt was Tekla. Her daughter (and Kosiba's cousin) Agata married Walenty in 1872 and the couple had twelve children. Maciej - one of those children - became a blacksmith and emigrated to the United States in 1905. Two of Maciej's siblings married relatives of Jan Kosiba's mother Katarzyna Przyby≈Çowicz. He did his schooling in his hometown from 1862 until 1866 and his father then asked him to continue his studies in order to prepare him for work. Kosiba decided to learn cobbling as his trade since his poor financial condition did not allow for him to pursue further education. He had felt called to the religious life since his childhood (during that time he served also as an altar server at his local parish church) and set himself on becoming a priest. But his poor financial state prompted him to seek a trade that would best support his siblings. He earned a certificate that certified him as a shoemaker in Biecz around 1874 and then worked at a shoe warehouse in Tarn√≥w from 1876 until 1878 in order to support his siblings. It was in Biecz that he first met friars from the Order of Friars Minor and after visiting their Wieliczka convent decided to join their ranks as a professed religious rather than as an ordained priest. He liked talking to the friars after his first meeting with them and often participated in their Masses when he was not working. He entered the Franciscans in 1878 and arrived at their convent for admittance on 7 March; he had to wait for his time as a postulant to begin though was vested in the Franciscan habit on 21 June 1878 and received his religious name of \\"Alojzy\\". This latter name was a cause for Kosiba's satisfaction since he was noted in life for having a strong devotion to Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and also to Saint Peter the Apostle. He was first stationed in Jaros≈Çaw but was soon transferred back to Wieliczka on 5 August 1878 (to prepare for beginning his Franciscan formation) where he was made the order's shoemaker and repairman for the monks' belts. Kosiba began his novitiate period on 22 September 1879 and made his initial profession on 22 September 1880 at 11:30am. He later made his solemn religious profession on 14 May 1855 into the hands of the Provincial priest Joachim Maciejczyk. Kosiba did much for poor children whom he made the focus for his religious apostolate. Their concerns were his own and he made it a practice to provide for their spiritual and material needs. His colleague Brother Blazej Ranosz wrote in 1965 that Kosiba was \\"a monk without a reproach\\" and that \\"he loved the children\\" and \\"valued and loved the poor\\". He was also noted for his gentleness with all people and for his kind disposition that was demonstrated with the children more so. His collection and distribution of funds to the poor made him a popular figure but made him sometimes a figure of ridicule among some of his colleagues. He sometimes used a horse-drawn cart to go around for alms or would walk on foot. He also helped children facing hunger in the southern and eastern parts of Krak√≥w during World War I when he would tend to those that the conflict affected while providing them with food. He also would provide them with medicine with the help of a pharmacist from Wieliczka. He would bring them gifts such as crosses and rosaries or pictures during the Christmas season. There was one tale said that a frustrated grandmother once poured hot soup on him as she chased him off her land after he had asked her for a small donation for the poor. He lived in a small cell and slept on bare boards on the floor. He would write using a goose feather and he wore a patched old habit. He also served for a brief period as his order's beekeeper at some stage. Kosiba was known for his humble and modest disposition and so modest was he in temperament that he could never look at women in the face when speaking to or with them. Just after Christmas in 1938 he set off for a trip to Niegowiƒá eight miles off but had to return due to feeling unwell. Upon his return he said to his colleagues: \\"I will die\\" in the knowledge that he was unwell. He learnt the following morning from his doctor Roman Wojtaszek that he had contracted pneumonia. This was exacerbated after he became depressed learning about the death of a new priest on 30 December 1938. Kosiba met with the Provincial on 2 January 1939 and the latter joked that Kosiba had to prepare and help him serve the Mass. But to his surprise the ill Kosiba got out of bed and began preparing for the service despite his grave condition. He felt faint and ill on 2 January and was confined to bed while on 3 January suffered from vomiting bouts and had a high fever. He began wearing a Carmelite scapular around his neck and asked that the image of the Blessed Mother be hanged near his bed so that he could look at it. Kosiba died with a small sigh at 8:00pm on 4 January 1939 after having confessed and receiving the Eucharist not long before. His remains were interred in an oak coffin in a grave he selected for himself in Wieliczka. His remains were exhumed twice in 1977 and 1998 before being relocated to a newer grave. Bishop Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça (future pope) visited his grave and cell on 9 October 1961 and again later as a cardinal on 23 April 1970. The Archbishop of Krak√≥w Franciszek Macharski also had a devotion to him and during his tenure as archbishop supported Kosiba's beatification cause. Beatification process The beatification process launched in the Krak√≥w archdiocese in an informative process that Bishop Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça inaugurated on 13 May 1963 (therefore naming Kosiba as a Servant of God) and which he later closed on 10 May 1966. The cause remained dormant until 4 June 2004 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the informative process and then later receiving the official Positio dossier in 2007 for evaluation. Nine theologians consulting the C.C.S. issued their approval for the cause on 14 June 2017 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members themselves later on 4 July 2017. Kosiba became titled as Venerable on 7 July 2017 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged the fact that the late religious had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life to a sufficient degree. The current postulator for this cause is Fra Giovangiuseppe Califano O.F.M. In popular culture The director Andrej Baranski oversaw production of a Polish film based on Kosiba's life in 2007 entitled Braciszek.

Biography  Leland Kent was born in Corpus Christi, Texas on August 30, 1984. He was raised in Birmingham, Alabama and received his bachelor's degree at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; however, he discovered his passion was in photography and taught himself the art on his own. He currently resides in Florida with his wife.  Career  Since 2014, Kent has photographed dozens of historic and forgotten places from across the Southeast. He posts his findings to his blog www.abandonedsoutheast.com. Searching through deserted sites come with many different risks. Kent tries to acquire permission from each location he photographs; however, there are some considered off limits, in which case he's had to trespass. Some places come with other risks, such as falling through rotting floors, coming in contact with debris, bio-hazardous waste, discarded body parts, and encountering homeless people, drug addicts, and animals. During an exploration at an abandoned factory in Florida, Kent came across a huge black snake that chased him out of the building. During an interview with Inside Edition, Kent was asked about his favorite place to photograph. He stated, \\"I would probably say my most favorite is the Masonic Temple in Birmingham ‚Äì that's where I grew up. It's one of the first places I've explored and it was almost kind of like a museum. It was closed up and kind of forgotten about for years and it's really unique to see. That kind of history is something so unique and ornate.\\" He goes on to say, \\"I feel like I'm kind of doing a favor by saving the place, saving the history of it.\\"  Bibliography  Leland Kent's books are part of the \\"Abandoned\\" series published by Arcadia Publishing. This series includes 45 books from photographers who capture photos of various abandoned buildings across the U.S. *Abandoned Birmingham: (published July 30, 2018) Birmingham became an industrial enterprise after the Civil War due to their abundance of iron ore, limestone, and coal; three ingredients used to create steel. Due to its growth in resources, it has been nicknamed the ‚ÄúMagic City‚Äù and ‚ÄúPittsburgh of the South‚Äù. After almost a century of growth and success, the industries began to shrivel, leaving behind a variety of abandoned structures. For the past several years, some of those structures have been reconstructed and refurbished, and many are still left untouched. Leland Kent gives an inside look of the city's many abandoned factories and buildings. *Abandoned Georgia: Exploring the Peach State: (published November 26, 2018) Georgia has many abandoned places, ranging from a little amusement park to one of the word's largest mental asylums. Leland Kent captures photos of forgotten sites across the state of Georgia. *Abandoned New Orleans: (published March 25, 2019) After experiencing the worst hurricane ever in 2005, Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans was left in almost complete destruction. Years after the hurricane and after reconstruction of many historic landmarks, structures, and homes, many buildings are still left desolate. Leland Kent presents eight locations that were affected by Katrina, including a hospital where people were trapped during Katrina and a WWII internment camp called Camp Algier. *Abandoned Georgia: Traveling the Backroads: (published May 27, 2019) During his travels through Georgia's backroads, Leland Kent discovered fourteen abandoned locations. This book features some of Georgia's forgotten locations including a tiny hidden school and a widespread religious community.

M.\\" Bailey (1903‚Äì1987) was an African American artist best known for his large cement sculptures, which he often displayed in his front yard. Born in Flovilla, Georgia, Bailey spent most of his life and career in Atlanta, Georgia.  Life  Born the son of a railroad worker, Bailey left school in the third grade and moved to Atlanta, Georgia from Flovilla, Georgia at the age of thirteen. Like his father, he worked on the railroads until 1942. He married his wife Marjorie in the early 1940s and left the instability of the railroad to become a cement mason in 1942 Specifically, he worked with cemeteries and funeral homes making cement grave markers and grave-digging. Bailey made his first yard sculpture (Crucifixion) in 1945 and continued to fill his yard thereafter with monuments to political figures, celebrities, and artistic figures. Bailey died in Atlanta at age 83 in 1987.  Career  Settling into a stable life as a cement mason allowed Bailey to build a studio in his home in the Mechanicsville neighborhood of Southside Atlanta. Often, Bailey's more public sculptures, which he displayed in his yard, were either recreations of historical figures, animals, or inanimate objects, such as giant urns. These sculptures were painted in vivid color during the 1940s and 1950s, but faded over time until bleach-white cement was left. Bailey's small outdoor sculpture Dancers inspired the poem \\"Dreaming We're E.M. Bailey's Dancers\\" by Carrie Meadows. Bailey's more personal work, including small sculptures and paintings, were made inside his home out of the public eye. He made shrines to dead friends (e.g. Pyramid), carved and painted mythological trickster figures with Masonic symbolism (Spider),Spider Lady, soulsgrowndeep.org. Accessed August 18, 2019 and created work with overt political opinions (e.g. Ecumenical, and Politician's FuneralPolitician's Funeral Vase, soulsgrowndeep.org. Accessed August 18, 2019). His work has been shows at The Rockford Art Museum in Rockford, IL and in the exhibition ASHE: Improvisation & Recycling in African-American Visionary Art, which showed at the NC Diggs Gallery. However, Bailey's constructions were not contained to sculptures and paintings alone. He also covered the interior of his home \\"in modeled concrete that resembled walls of a grotto. This \\"decor\\" conversed with Bailey's sense of the early Christian habitations of the catacombs of Rome (two plaster fish were sculpted into his laundry room's ceiling) and his interest in the legacies of those lost civilizations known only through their tombs or caves. Many of the utilitarian furnishings inside his home continued this theme. Lamps and planters assumed the forms of rock outcroppings, as if to emphasize Bailey's idea that the earth, repository of all things past, provides the assistance necessary for human life.\\" Whether placed inside or outside of his home, some scholars proposed that Bailey's work was a consolidation of the past, which is \\"inhabited by beings now approachable only in memory and spirit [and] a future shaped by hope that the living and dead will meet again on the other side of the river...\\" The scholar and author Grey Gundaker argues that Bailey epitomizes this notion with a cast concrete polyptych, formerly embedded in his yard, of the suits in a deck of cards, wherein the diamond concrete cast held an inscription that read, \\"Remember to Die.\\" After his death in 1987, Bailey's sculptures were removed from the property. Although Bailey's smaller outdoor sculptures, such as Dancers and Moon Lady, have been preserved, his largest yard works have not been seen since. His work is now in the permanent collections of the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the High Museum of Art.

On July 30, 2003, she went to work as a waitress in the Lebanese fish restaurant \\"Cedar of Lebanon\\", owned by a former SLA member, under the Cesar Hotel on the shore of Lake Kinneret. Three months before her disappearance, Bennett underwent surgery to treat blood vessels in her head. In the months since, she needed medicine and regular treatment.  Disappearance  On Friday, August 1, 2003, around 2:30 PM, when her second day of work at the restaurant ended, Bennett and her co-worker, Shiran Koria, boarded a shared taxi. According to the company's testimony, she got off the taxi at about 1:00 AM, at a bus stop near the city's football stadium.Koria said: \\"She did not tell me, but I was sure she was going home, according to all things who call us.\\" She crossed the road and began walking towards the house, where her aunt and uncle lived on Bar-Kocha Street in Upper Tiberias, where she was supposed to meet her cousins Ortal and Lalon. Since then, nobody saw her. At 1:45 that night, a signal was received from her cellphone near a cell tower. After she did not reach her aunt's house until the morning hours, the police were called.  Investigation  A special investigation team was set up for the case, headed by Chief Superintendent Avi Hilweh, investigations officer of the Amakim District of the Israeli Police, to question dozens of witnesses regarding the incident. Some were detained at the police station, although later released by the Judiciary of Israel in Nazareth. The team also examined dozens of testimonials from people who saw of heard Bennett from the date of absence, but to no avail. The investigation also examined the possibility of criminal or nationalistic motives. Because of her American citizenship, the FBI aided in searching for the missing girl. Among the testimonies examined was that of a taxi driver who said that two days after her disappearance, he drove a girl who resembled Bennett from Rehovot to the entrance to Kiryat Gat. The police located the girl, but it was not Bennett. Other reports placed her in the Ashdod area. After ten days of intense searching, the number of volunteers fell considerably, and most of the police's efforts moved to the intelligence level. In addition, another testimony revealed about two men in a parked car who were seen signaling to a girl matching Bennett's description. It was determined that the two men, who were married, were seeking sexual adventures, but the police denied their involvement in Bennett's disappearance. At the same time, the Israel Police conducted extensive searches for Bennett, in cooperation with thousands of volunteers and policemen, with the assistance of helicopters, cavalry, jeeps and ATVs, which initially focused on the environs of Migdal and Maghar. The Arab regional radio station \\"Radio a-Shams\\", which had opened shortly before, also helped recruit Arab volunteers for searches. About a week later, her father and brother came to Israel to participate in the searches, and they involved the FBI in the investigation. The searches later moved to the area of Lavi, in the Lower Galilee and after a weeks, to Kfar Hittim, located close to Lake Kinneret and the Mount Carmel area. More than a month after her disappearance, and after they reached the conclusion that the investigation had hit a dead end, her parents, Victoria and Benjamin, together with Yachdav- Am and Rabbi Shlomo Harush, the principal of her childhood school in the United States, decided to offer a $50,000 prize to anyone who knew where she is. The amount was later doubled to $100,000. However, the police did not have an active suspect in the case, and nobody claimed the family's prize. Later, Amnon Levy claimed that the head of Am Ehad, Miriam Moskowitz, had defrauded the Bennett family, telling them that their daughter was held in Jenin and taking large sums of money from them. More than four months after her disappearance, the police launched another large-scale search operation to locate Bennett in the area of the Poriya Junction and Giv'at Avni in the Lower Galilee. Another such operation was conducted in January 2004, and the establishment of a new brainstorming by the Valley Commander Yaakov Zigdon, who made yet another search the following month in Tiberias and Migdal. More extensive searches were conducted four years after her disappearance. In December 2004, a special investigative team was established and shared information with the police, the army and other organizations, led by Deputy Commander of the Northern District of the Israel Police, Brigadier General Yehuda Solomon and attended by Gen. Arie Tessler from Northern Command. The purpose of the special team was the investigation of several disappearances, including Dana Bennett's, the disappearance of the soldier Guy Hever, the mysterious disappearance of Ira Gurevich (Gurevich's body was later found in a minefield near an abandoned car), the disappearance of a Czech tourist near Tzalmon River (the tourist's disappearance was later solved and connected to Bennett's disappearance, see below) and the murder of a couple from Rosh Pinna, with the assistance of the Shin Bet in the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute. The team opened a website to provide information about Bennett's fate from civilians, and maintained the working assumption that she had been kidnapped. In January 2005, a report was sent to Agence France-Presse, which was signed by a terrorist organization called \\"Free Galilee\\", in which it claimed that the organization's members were holding Bennett. The organization demanded that the Israeli government release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in return for giving information about her fate, and the Israeli prime minister apologize to \\"our people for all the crimes committed by the occupying army\\". However, the organization refrained from publishing information proving its responsibility for the abduction and thus raised doubts as to the legitimacy of the announcement. The very existence of the organization is questioned. Similar messages linked to the organization, supposedly composed of Israeli Arabs, were given during Guy Hever's disappearance. In 2008, efforts were renewed and searches were carried out for Bennett's body in the Migdal area, but to no avail. The investigation of the case was entrusted to Superintendent Shlomi Mu'alem in 2008, the intelligence coordinator of the Tiberias police.  Discovery of remains  In 2009, close to Independence Day, information reached the police that was more important than anything else collected to that date. Based on that information, the investigators arrived at the house of a 22-year-old woman named Y. (because she was a minor at the time of the murder, her identity was concealed). Y. confessed that she was the girlfriend of the murderer, Yahya Adwan Farhan, a 32-year-old resident of Hamaam. She revealed details of the murder and Farhan's modus operandi, as well as other murders committed by him. Based on the information provided by Y., the police succeeded in finding Bennett's remains. The body was buried and the gravesite disguised as an archaeological excavation, in order to conceal the corpse. On May 18, 2009, six years after her disappearance, the police central valley units announced that they had found Bennett's remains near Tiberias. The body parts were sent to the Forensic Institute at Abu Kabir, where her identity was confirmed. Three days later, Bennett was brought for burial near Tiberias. On May 26, police announced that the suspect in the murder was Yahya Farhan. In the indictment, it is alleged that Farhan and Y. noticed Bennett exit the shared taxi while travelling in his car. They persuaded her to board the car under false pretences, and then Farhan drove to the fields between Migdal and Hamaam, where he beat, choked Bennett to death with her own bra, and then burned her body. Y. witnessed the murder, and then helped in burning the body. The police also charged Farhan with two other murders: in June 2003, he murdered Silvia Molarova, a Czech tourist who was drowned in the Tzalmon River; in this murder, he was also assisted by his girlfriend. The other murder occurred in July 2004: at the time, Farhan was detained by the Tiberias police. After a fight with another prisoner named Aharon Simchov, Farhan followed him to the shower, where he strangled him to death. Until then, the police though that Simchov had committed suicide. Farhan was also charged in the kidnapping and rape of a prostitute in September 2005, but the victim escaped after the attack. On March 15, 2010, Y. was convicted in a plea bargain and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. On January 4, 2012, the Supreme Court rejected her appeal on the severity of the sentence. On July 21, 2010, Farhan was convicted and sentenced to three cumulative life sentences and another 12 years. The judges ruled that the act was \\"murder for no reason\\", and that Bennett was not raped before her death. In the appeal, Farhan was acquitted of Simchov's death, but his conviction in the other offenses was confirmed.

While many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. Richard Pervo dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD, and British classicist Timothy Barnes has argued for a date some time in the 140s AD.

She is considered the finest flower painter of the period. Her work was popular at the time, and consistently sells well at auction. Her painting Rising Early in the Spring to Lament Flowers (1631) was sold at Christie's New York on 16 September 2015 for US$413,000, four times its estimate.; Sale 3765, \\"Fine Chinese Paintings\\", New York, Lot 403, 16 September 2015.  Life  Wen Shu was the great- granddaughter of Wen Zhengming, a leading Ming dynasty painter of the Wu School whose family were also highly respected in the movement. Her father was Wen Conjian, a landscape painter, and taught both his children to paint from a young age. Her brother, Wen Ran, was a calligrapher and landscape painter. Wen Shu married Zhao Yun who was a student of her father and a member of the House of Zhao. They lived a reclusive life in a villa close to the Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou, in an area noted for its natural beauty. They had one child, a daughter called Zhou Zhou, and adopted a male cousin of Zhao in order to continue the male line. Most of Wen Shu's surviving art is dated 1626 or later. This is after Zhao Yun's father died and the family's fortunes declined, so it is likely that Wen Shu turned to commercial art production in order to maintain her family's lifestyle. One critical essay suggests this is because Zhao Yun was unwilling to work but this is not supported by other sources. She was sought out as a tutor by both married women and girls in the gentry. After Zhao Jun died in 1640, Wen Shu's daughter Zhao Zhao collected the biographical information on both her parents for the tomb inscription.  Work  Painting of Flowers and Bird, collection of the Shanghai Museum Wen Shu worked under the pen-name Hanshan, among others, and in a range of formats. She painted hanging scrolls, fan paintings and illustration. Her primary subjects were flowers and wildlife as unwritten rules on suitable subjects for women painters meant women rarely painted landscapes. Wen Shu may have chosen flora in particular for their commercial aspect as new paintings of flowers were in demand. This is supported by the fact her work seldom carries poems or dedications: the absence of these is an indicator of work for commercial clients. = Style = Wen Shu focused on a few essential elements in the composition presented against a plain background. This style means the eye is drawn to the brushwork and pale colours displayed. Her approach is seen as intimate rather than showy, with a careful composition that often frames glimpses of delicate flowers with rough rocks. This composition echoes the popular garden layouts of her time. This approach can be seen in her fan painting, 'Carnations and Garden Rock' of 1627, which uses a limited palette and only two elements for the composition. She is noted for an attention to detail, even when she was using the mogu (boneless) technique. = Reception = Her professional work was sufficiently popular that she trained female assistants to help with the workload. For the collection 'Pattern of Plants and Insects by Hanshan' she produced one illustration a day for one thousand days. During her lifetime, other artists would produce forgeries of her work. One collector suggested her flower paintings were the equal of Qiu Zhu, an earlier female professional painter.  Legacy  Wen Shu's style is reflected in work by later artists, such as Yun Shouping.. She was cited in inscriptions and seals by later female artists. Chinese art critic Wang Wenzhi, writing in the 1700s, asserted that Wen Shu's work was so special and sensitive that it could not be duplicated by a man and cited Luo Qilan and Wang Yuyan (painter) as her artistic descendants. Other artistic descendants include Li Hui, Guo Shu and Yuan Lan. In 1994, the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature approved naming a crater on Venus Wen Shu after her.

The type and only species is V. paranaensis, which would have lived in the giant prehistoric Botucatu Desert.  Etymology  The generic name means \\"evening\\" or \\"west lizard\\" (\\"vesper\\" is latin for \\"evening/west\\") in reference to the town Cruzeiro do Oeste (\\"Western Cross\\") near which the fossils were found. The specific name refers to the Paran√° state.  Description  Frontal bone and tooth The taxon is notable for its distinct, functionally monodactyl foot anatomy, where the singularly large third digit would have borne most of the weight while walking. Based on the proportions of its holotype remains (MPCO.V 0065d), V. paranaensis was a small theropod, with an estimated body length of 1 to 1.5 meters. This makes it comparable in size to Noasaurus leali and Masiakasaurus knopfleri. Body mass of V. paranaensis was 11.28 kg, nearly that of the ornithischians Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis and Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis.
