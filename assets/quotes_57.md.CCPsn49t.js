Background The Chinese government has raised the concept with an aim to build a new framework of international relations and promote and improve global governance. Some analysts say this is the first major amendment on China‚Äôs foreign policy in more than four decades, shifting from being nation-oriented to focusing on the whole humankind. Usage The concept first appeared in a report delivered by former Party General Secretary Hu Jintao to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November, 2012. In the report, Hu emphasized that \\"mankind has only one earth to live on, and countries have only one world to share\\" and called for the building of a harmonious world of enduring peace and common prosperity by raising awareness about human beings sharing a community of common destiny. Hu envisioned a new type of more equitable and balanced global development partnership that would stick together in times of difficulty, both sharing rights and shouldering obligations, and boosting the common interests of mankind. When Xi Jinping met with foreigners for the first time after taking office as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (paramount leader) in November 2012, he said that the international community has increasingly become a community with shared future with each having a stake in others; In the face of the complicated situation of the world economy and global problems, no country could possibly stay aloof by taking good care of itself alone. Xi first proposed the concept in an international arena at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in March 2013, and raised it again in a speech to the World Economic Forum at Davos In January 2017, which \\"won him high credits at home and abroad\\". On October 12, 2017, \\"no first placement of weapons in outer space\\", a draft resolution on the prevention of an arms race in outer space approved by the First Committee of Disarmament and International Security of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, reaffirmed that \\"practical measures should be examined and taken in the search for agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space in a common effort towards a community of shared future for humankind\\". On October 13, 2017,\\"Further practical measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space\\", a draft resolution on the prevention of an arms race in outer space approved by the First Committee of Disarmament and International Security of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, also mentioned \\"promoting and strengthening international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, with the objective of shaping a community of shared future for mankind\\". On March 11, 2018, the constitutional amendment adopted at the first meeting of the 13th National People's Congress of China added a sentence that promoted the building of a community with a shared future while developing diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with other countries. Chinese leaders and diplomats have been promoting this strategy and persuading the international community that China sticks to its peaceful development policy and has no intention to change the international order. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collective effort across the globe can be regarded as the first attempt towards the community of a shared future for mankind.

It was designed by Edmund Blacket and Blacket and Sons, and built from 1880 to 1881 by George Donald. It is also known as St. John the Evangelist Church and Church of St. John the Evangelist. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 September 2004.  History  =Wallerawang= The place named Wallerawang derives from the language of the Wiradjuri Aboriginal people who occupied the area before white settlement. It is said to mean \\"place near wood and water\\" or \\"plenty of water\\". The first colonial settler in the Lithgow-Wallerawang district was James Walker. He was born in Perth, Scotland, in 1785, the son of wealthy merchant. He became an artillery officer in the Royal Marines and retired in 1822. In May 1823, he set sail on the Brutus for NSW. A road was surveyed from Hartley to Mudgee in 1823, eleven years after the first successful white crossing of the Blue Mountains.Friends of St. Johns Church, undated. On reaching Sydney in September, Governor Brisbane granted Walker acres at Wallerowang, which stretched to the Wolgan Valley to the north. This land had been by-passed on the way to Bathurst by the early settlers. In 1837 he applied for more land between the Wolgan Valley and Bathurst. Walker started 1800 cross-bred sheep, 64 merinos, 312 head of cattle and 15 horses. By the end of 1840, he held an immense tract of country under licence and was running 1487 cattle and 20,534 sheep. In 1854 he was the holder of 16 stations with an area of . Thomas returned to Scotland and married his wife, Robina Ramsay Walker, his cousin, in 1832. They had four children; Allison, Archibald and Georgina (all born at Wallerawang) and Wilhelmina (born in London). James had sympathy with the Church of England as well as a strong acceptance of Presbyterian doctrine. He was a deeply religious man and built a house, Wallerawang Station and a church. Clergy from both denominations were frequently welcomed at Wallerawang, including the Rev. Colin Stewart, pioneer Presbyterian minister who arrived in the area in 1830. James Walker died on 24 November 1856, aged 71 and was buried in the family cemetery on the estate. He is remembered as having good dealings with his convict workers and also a remarkable relationship with the local Wywandy Aboriginal people. In 1866 his widow, who still held licences for 15 stations, died in 1867. =St John The Evangelist Church= St John the Evangelist Church, pictured in 2010. Their daughter Georgina Walker-Barton married Edwin Barton, who was the surveyor / engineer of the Zig Zag railway. He died in 1876. Mrs Barton commissioned renowned Gothic Revival church architect and family friend, Edmund Blacket, in 1880 to design St John The Evangelist Church on the estate as a place of worship for the Church of England and the Presbyterians of Wallerawang. The church was a commemoration to her parents and family, who had all died before her. It was to be used as the Wallerawang Estate Chapel and a \\"union\\" or public dual-denomination church: by both the Presbyterian and Anglican denominations in memory of James Walker, his wife Robina and Georgina's late husband Edwin Barton. She mainly financed the construction and established a small Gothic Revival style brick school nearby, which is still standing. The reflection of religious philanthropy is an important theme in Lithgow with five other churches in the area being privately funded. The stone was from a quarry on Tunnel Hill, and the fine stone for the tracery and door frames came from Sydney. The carving on the Western Australian karri pews was designed to represent the Scottish heritage of the Walker / Barton family. George Donald The builder, George McGarvie Donald of was a master mason and builder who helped create the city of Lithgow. He would later become its first Mayor and Member for Hartley. Born in Paddington in 1846, he was son of a Scottish stonemason, George Donald, senior. George senior had been encouraged to migrate to New South Wales by Governor Macquarie who wished him to assist with government building works. George junior did an apprenticeship as a mason under his father and uncle. After this he was engaged on railway construction projects in the Bowenfels district in the late 1860s. He worked on stone railway bridges at The Great Zig Zag and Marrangaroo and married Marion Wiles, daughter of one of the construction foremen. Following completion of the railway Donald moved to Hill End and worked on a range of construction projects. Among these was Hill End Methodist church, built of basalt rubble from the gold mines. It is now used as an Anglican church. After the failure of the deep lead gold boom of the 1870s George returned to the Lithgow valley and established a construction business with Thomas Crowe. In the early 1880s he constructed St. Mary's Presbyterian church for Thomas Brown, built as a memorial to Brown's wife, Mary. He also built Cooerwull Academy (now De La Salle College, Littleton) for Brown, and the Church of St. John the Evangelist at Wallerawang. Other projects included Lithgow Town Hall, Wallerawang Public School the Lithgow Oddfellows Hall and many residences. Donald and Crowe also built Mort's freezing works. Donald was extremely active in community affairs and had a great sense of social justice. He was founding member of the GUIOOF Lily of the Valley Lodge and the Good Templars Lodge. Popular among citizens he was elected the first mayor of Lithgow after establishment of the Municipality of Lithgow in 1889. He held the seat of Hartley in the NSW Legislative Assembly jointly with Joseph Cook from 1891.Christison, 2014, 32-33 Donald was responsible for the best stone buildings of the late Victorian period in the area. The foundation stone was laid in 1880 by Bishop Frederic Barker D.D. of Sydney. He was assisted by the Anglican incumbent from Hartley and the Presbyterian minister of Bowenfels, with Rev. Colin Stewart in attendance. Church design Knowing Blacket's great success since 1843 in both Sydney and Australia for harmonising religious desires for austerity/simplicity with High Anglican richness, detail and iconography, Georgina ensured a magnificent opening ceremony in 1881, officiated by various dual denominational clerics. Furthermore, she granted in perpetuity the land to St Johns to be a parish Church for Presbyterians and Anglicans. The church was opened on 6 November 1881 by the Rev. Dr. Robert Steele, MA, Minister of St. Stephens Presbyterian Church, Phillip Street, Sydney. In attendance was Rev. W. J. Debenham, BA, Anglican Church representative, Mr Morgan, the local catechist, Rev. William McKenzie MA, Minister of Bowenfels and Wallerawang and Rev. Colin Stewart. The private church was used by both denominations with equal rights, an early ecumenical move. The church's timber floor is locally- cut black Sallee (Eucalyptus pulverentula).Witty, pers.comm., 20 March 2016. The church bell was cast by John Warner & Sons, Cripplegate, London, in 1880. Numerous memorials grace the church, in the form of plaques and stained glass windows. The magnificent east window represents the Prophets, Apostles, Christ and Martyrs. The church window is in memory of Georgina Lyon Wolgan Abbott, who married Thomas Abbott in 1882 after the death of her first husband Edwin Barton. The window was installed after Georgina's death in 1906. The latest window was installed in 1962 in memory of Mary Barton, Georgina's daughter. James Lyong Walker Barton and his sister, Lue Loveday Walker Barton, were murdered at Wallerawang (by then renamed and rebuilt as 'Barton Park') on 26 September 1948. Barton Park homestead, including Wallerawang's extensive stone barn and outbuildings, is now under the waters of Lake Wallace, created in the late 1950s to power nearby Wallerawang Power Station. The Walker / Barton family cemetery now belongs to Delta Electricity Company and the cemetery remains above the water line. It may be visited by contacting the company.  Evangelical union  St. John's Church was given by the sole surviving member of the Barton family, Miss Hazel Gowring Walker Barton. On 18 November 1952 the Trustees of the Church of England, Sydney Diocese and the Presbyterian Church NSW became the new owners as tenants in common, with equal moiety. The Presbyterian minister from Bowenfels was conducting regular Sunday services but the local Anglican Parish has not used the church regularly since the early 1980s. Regular Anglican workship ceased at the church in 1971. In 1983 a violent storm damaged the north-east tower's pinnacle, which fell and smashed. badly damaging the roof. Gosford Quarries repaired the roof and pinnacle, using Maitland stone. Sometime during 2001 the church's insurance company ordered the property to be locked and fenced after an engineer's report revealed serious cracking in the bell tower that could be dangerous to people within the grounds. At this stage the church was no longer used for regular church services. In 2001 the church was advertised for sale. Suggestions ranging from dismantling and rebuilding the church in Canberra to bulldozing it completely were met with vigorous opposition from the Presbyterian Bowenfels parish. Their efforts were supported by the establishment of the Friends of St. John's Church, to save this important community asset. The Friends' charter is to preserve the fine building in the interests of the community. The church now belongs half to the Friends of St. John's Church and half to the Presbyterian Church NSW. Through the work of the Friends of St John Committee, who were successful in obtaining a grant from the Heritage Office, a conservation management plan and urgent structural and maintenance was work completed during 2004 and 2005. To mark the occasion of the official re-opening of St John the Evangelist Church a Thanksgiving Service was held on 14 May 2006. Church services (Presbyterian) restarted in May 2006 are now held on 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month at 8.30am. Once again the church is available for services of all faiths.  Description  A large imposing church of Victorian Gothic style. The building is symmetrical with rectangular body, of cruciform plan with square high bell tower in three lifts (no turret), smaller chancel and transepts. Entrance porch at street side only (possibly an early addition). Pointed-arched sandstone windows, some stained glass, some diamond and square panes. The tower is even topped with battlements and pinnacles of a real \\"Carpenters\\" Gothic type and has interesting animal face gargoyles. Mix of dressed stone quoins and bush hammered stone elsewhere. Walls are buttressed. Cement on the roof is unsympathetic. There are fine stained glass windows erected between 1906 and 1962. Other key measurements: *Nave *Chancel *Organ chamber and vestry are in the transepts *Tower high. = Condition = As at 1 August 2002, the physical condition is fair to poor. Cracking to bell tower. Largely intact, including interior designed by Blacket.  Heritage listing  As at 5 October 2006, St John the Evangelist Church, Wallerawang, constructed between 1880 and 1881, is of state significance as a rare example of a major church building erected by private philanthropy, equalled in Lithgow only by the Hoskins Memorial Church and comparable to the Hunter Baillie Memorial Presbyterian Church in Annandale.

The hills were recaptured by the South Vietnamese in costly fighting that depleted its reserve forces. Background The H·∫£i V√¢n Ridge formed the Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Qu·∫£ng Nam Province boundary from the sea to B·∫°ch M√£ Mountain, which was occupied by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) in October 1973. The ridge continued west past B·∫°ch M√£ until it descended into the valley of the S√¥ng T·∫£ Tr·∫°ch at Ruong Ruong, where the PAVN had established a forward operating base. Local Route 545 twisted through the mountains north from Ruong Ruong (), joining Highway 1 just south of Phu Bai. As it crossed over the western slopes of the H·∫£i V√¢n Ridge, Route 545 passed between two lower hills, N√∫i M√¥ Tau () on the west and N√∫i Bong () on the east. N√∫i M√¥ Tau and N√∫i Bong were only about 300 meters and 140 meters high, respectively, but the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) positions on them, and on neighboring hills, formed the main outer ring protecting Phu Bai and Hu·∫ø from the south. Outposts were placed on hills 2,000 to 5,000 meters farther south, including hills as identified by their elevations of 144 (), 224 (), 273 () and 350 meters (). At first, the I Corps commander, General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng, viewed the see-saw contest for the hills south of N√∫i M√¥ Tau as hardly more than training exercises and of no lasting tactical or strategic importance. That assessment was supportable so long as the PAVN was unable to extend his positions to within range of Phu Bai. Once this extension occurred, protecting Hu·∫ø's vital air and land links with the south became matter of great urgency. During inconclusive engagements in the spring of 1974, the ARVN 1st Division managed to hold on to N√∫i M√¥ Tau and N√∫i Bong, losing Hill 144 between the two, but regaining it on 7 April. Hills 273 and 350 were lost; then Hill 350 was recaptured by the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Infantry, in a night attack on 4 June. By this time, I Corps units were restricted by reductions in artillery ammunition. Tight restrictions had been imposed by General Tr∆∞·ªüng on the number of rounds that could be fired in counterbattery, preparatory, and defensive fires. These conditions compelled the infantry commanders to seek means other than heavy artillery fires to soften objectives before the assault. In recapturing Hill 350, the 3rd Infantry worked around behind the hill and blocked the PAVN's access to defenses on the hill. Within a few days, PAVN soldiers on the hill were out of food and low on ammunition. When the ARVN commander, monitoring the PAVN's tactical radio net, learned this, he ordered the assault. No artillery was used; mortars and grenades provided the only fire support for the ARVN infantrymen, but they took the hill on the first assault even though the PAVN defenders fired a heavy concentration of Tear gas against them. ARVN casualties were light while the PAVN 5th Regiment lost heavily in men and weapons. As the ARVN 1st Division pressed southward against the PAVN 324B Division's battalions trying to hold hard-won outposts in the hills, another new PAVN corps headquarters was organized north of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass and placed in command of the 304th, 324B and 325th Divisions. Designated the 2nd Corps, it was a companion to the new 1st Corps in Thanh H√≥a Province of North Vietnam, the 3rd Corps south of the H·∫£i V√¢n and the 301st Corps near Saigon. In the Th·ª´a Thi√™n campaign, the 324B Division eventually assumed control of five regiments: its own 803rd and 812th and three independent PAVN infantry regiments, the 5th, 6th, and 271st. In early June 1974, after releasing the 1st Airborne Brigade to the reserve controlled by the Joint General Staff, General Tr∆∞·ªüng made major adjustments in command and deployments north of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass. The Marine Division was extended to cover about 10km of Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province and was reinforced with the 15th Ranger Group of three battalions and the 1st Armored Brigade and had operational control of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province's seven Regional Force (RF) battalions. The division commander, Brig. Gen. Bui The Lan, positioned his forces with the 258th Marine Brigade, with one M48 tank company attached, defending from the sea southwest to about 5km east of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. The 369th Marine Brigade held the center sector, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã city and Highway 1. Southwest of the 369th was the attached 15th Ranger Group along the Th·∫°ch H√£n River and the 147th Marine Brigade was on the left and south of the 15th Rangers. When he had to extend his forces southward to cover the airborne sector, General Lan used a task force of the 1st Armored Brigade, two Marine battalions, and an RF battalion, keeping three tank companies on the approaches to Hu·∫ø. The Airborne Division retained the responsibility for the Song Be approach, placing its two remaining brigades, the 2nd and 3rd, to the west. The 2nd Brigade had two RF battalions and one company of M41 tanks attached. The PAVN 4th Regiment was the principal unit in the 2nd Brigade's sector, while the 271st Regiment opposed the 3rd Airborne Brigade to the south near Firebase Bastogne. The four regiments and two attached RF battalions of the 1st Infantry Division were deployed in a long arc from the Airborne Division's left through the hills to Ph√∫ L·ªôc District, with the 54th Infantry Regiment protecting Highway 1 from the Truoi Bridge, just north of N√∫i Bong, to the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass. Hills 144, 273, 224, 350 and N√∫i Bong, and N√∫i M√¥ Tau, overlooking the lines of communication through Ph√∫ L·ªôc District and providing observation and artillery sites in range of Phu Bai, were generally along the boundary between Ph√∫ L·ªôc and Nam Hoa Districts of Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province. Having recaptured Hill 350 on 4 June, the ARVN 1st Division continued the attack toward Hill 273. A fresh battalion, the 1st Battalion, 54th Infantry, took the hill on 27 June, incurring light casualties and by the next day, the 1st Division controlled all of the important high ground south of Phu Bai. On 29 June General Tr∆∞·ªüng directed his deputy north of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass, General L√¢m Quang Thi, to constitute a regimental reserve for the expected PAVN counterattacks against the newly won hills. General Thi accordingly replaced the 54th Infantry with the 3rd Infantry on July, the 54th becoming the corps reserve north of the H·∫£i V√¢n. General Tr∆∞·ªüng had good reason to be concerned as the PAVN were preparing for increased and prolonged operations in Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province, as revealed by aerial photography of PAVN rear areas on 30 June. A 150,000 gallon fuel tank farm, connected to the pipeline through the A S·∫ßu Valley, was photographed under construction in far western Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, only 25km south of the PAVN base in Ruong Ruong. The Ruong Ruong region, also called the Nam Dong Secret Zone, was seen growing in logistic capacity. Local Routes 593 and 545 were shown to be repaired and in use, and a tank park and two new truck parks were discernable. The 324B Division took a while to get organized for renewed attacks in southern Th·ª´a Thi√™n. Its battalions had taken severe beatings, and a period of re-equipping was necessary. In the meantime, action shifted to the old Airborne Brigade sector in northern Th·ª´a Thi√™n where the 6th and 8th Marine Battalions, attached to the 147th Brigade, came under heavy attack. Attacks continued through July, and some Marine outposts, targets for 130 mm gunfire, had to be given up. No important changes in dispositions took place, however. Mid-July passed in southern Th·ª´a Thi√™n without much activity. But on 25 July, as the 2nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division, was trying to regroup following a devastating engagement in the Battle of Duc Duc, General Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered the 54th Infantry from Th·ª´a Thi√™n to Qu·∫£ng Nam for attachment to the 3rd Division. The 1st Division, with only three regiments, was left with a 60km front including Highway 1 and no reserve north of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass. Since this situation was hazardous, General Tr∆∞·ªüng on 3 August ordered General Thi to reconstitute a reserve using the 15th Ranger Group, at that time attached to the Marine Division on the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. On 5 August the 121st RF Battalion replaced the 60th Ranger Battalion on the Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã front. Shortly afterward the 61st and 94th Ranger Battalions pulled out, relieved respectively by the 126th RF Battalion and the 5th Marine Battalion. But events in Qu·∫£ng Nam forced General Tr∆∞·ªüng to change his plans for the 15th Group; because Th∆∞·ª£ng ƒê·ª©c had just fallen, he needed the 3rd Airborne Brigade in Qu·∫£ng Nam. So, as soon as the Marines and RF replaced the battalions of the 15th Group, the relief of the 3rd Airborne Brigade began in the Song Bo corridor. However General Thi was still without a reserve north of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass, and fresh opportunities for the new PAVN 2nd Corps appeared in Ph√∫ L·ªôc District. While General Tr∆∞·ªüng was shifting forces to save Qu·∫£ng Nam, the PAVN 2nd Corps was moving new battalions near Hill 350. First to deploy, in late July, was the 271st Independent Regiment, previously under the control of the 325th Division. In mid-August, the 812th Regiment, 324B Division, began its march from A L∆∞·ªõi in the northern A S·∫ßu Valley, covering the entire 50km on foot, the regiment arrived undetected on 26 August. Battle On 28 August attacks on ARVN positions in the N√∫i M√¥ Tau-Hill 350 area began. Over 600 artillery rounds hit N√∫i M√¥ Tau where the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry, was dug in. The ARVN battalion held the hill against the assault of the PAVN infantrymen, but an adjacent position, manned by the 129th RF Battalion, collapsed, and the battalion was scattered. To the east, on N√∫i Bong and Hills 273 and 350, the other two battalions of the 3rd Infantry were bombarded by 1,300 rounds and driven from their positions by the PAVN 6th and 812th Regiments. Meanwhile, the 8th Battalion, 812th Regiment overran Hill 224. Thus, in a few hours, except for N√∫i M√¥ Tau, all ARVN accomplishments of the long summer campaign in southern Th·ª´a Thi√™n were erased. The ARVN 51st Infantry Regiment was rushed into the line, but the momentum of the PAVN attack had already dissipated. The casualties suffered by the 324B Division were high, but it now controlled much of the terrain overlooking the Ph√∫ L·ªôc lowlands and Phu Bai. Heavy fighting throughout the foothills continued into the first week of September with strong PAVN attacks against the 3rd Battalion, 51st Regiment, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 3rd Regiment. The PAVN 6th and 803rd Regiments lost nearly 300 men and over 100 weapons in these attacks, but the ARVN 3rd Infantry was no longer combat effective due to casualties and equipment losses. Immediate reinforcements were needed south of Phu Bai. Accordingly, General Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered the 54th Infantry Regiment back to Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province, together with the 37th Ranger Battalion, which had been fighting on the Duc Duc front. General Thi took personal command of the ARVN forces in southern Th·ª´a Thi√™n and moved the 7th Airborne Battalion from north of Hu·∫ø and the 111th RF Battalion, securing the port at T√¢n M·ªπ, to Phu Bai. These deployments and the skillful use of artillery concentrations along enemy routes of advance put a temporary damper on PAVN initiatives in the foothills. In an apparent diversion to draw ARVN forces northward away from Ph√∫ L·ªôc, the PAVN on 21 September strongly attacked the 5th and 8th Marine and the 61st Ranger Battalions holding the Phong ƒêi·ªÅn sector north of Hu·∫ø. Although some 6,600 rounds, including hundreds from 130 mm field guns, and heavy rockets, struck the defenses, the South Vietnamese held firmly against the ground attacks that followed. Over 240 PAVN infantrymen from the 325th Division were killed, mostly by ARVN artillery, in front of the 8th Marines, and General Thi made no deployments in response to the attack. The next week, however, renewed assaults by the PAVN 803rd Regiment carried it to N√∫i M√¥ Tau, and by the end of September, the 324B Division had consolidated its control over the high ground south of Phu Bai from N√∫i M√¥ Tau east to N√∫i Bong and Hill 350. The PAVN 2nd Corps immediately began to exploit this advantage by moving 85 mm field gun batteries of its 78th Artillery Regiment into position to fire on Phu Bai, forcing the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) to suspend operations at the only major airfield north of H·∫£i V√¢n Pass. The attack to retake the commanding ground began on 22 October with a diversionary assault on Hill 224 and Hill 303. The ARVN 1st Infantry Regiment was to follow with the main attack against the PAVN 803rd Regiment on N√∫i M√¥ Tau. Bad weather brought by Typhoon Della reduced air support to nothing, and little progress was made by the ARVN infantry. Nevertheless, the attack on N√∫i M√¥ Tau, with a secondary effort against elements of the PAVN 812th Regiment on N√∫i Bong, began on 26 October. The ARVN 54th Infantry, with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry attached, made slight progress on N√∫i M√¥ Tau, and the 3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry, met strong resistance near N√∫i Bong. But the ARVN artillery was taking its toll of the PAVN defenders, who were also suffering the effects of cold rains sweeping across the steep, shell-tom slopes. Heavy, accurate artillery fire forced the PAVN 6th Battalion, 6th Infantry, to abandon its trenches on Hill 312, east of Hill 350, and the 803rd Regiment's trenches, bunkers, and communications were being torn up by the ARVN fire placed on N√∫i M√¥ Tau. Toward the end of October, the PAVN 803rd and 812th Regiments were so depleted that the PAVN 2nd Corps withdrew them from the battle and assigned the defense of N√∫i M√¥ Tau and N√∫i Bong to the 6th Regiment and 271st Regiment respectively. As heavy rains continued, movement and fire support became increasingly difficult, and the ARVN offensive in southern Th·ª´a Thi√™n slowed considerably. PAVN artillery continued to inhibit the use of Phu Bai Air Base, and 1st Division infantrymen around N√∫i Bong suffered daily casualties to PAVN mortars and field guns. On 24 November, Maj. Gen. Nguyen Van Diem, commanding the 1st Division, secured permission to pull his troops away from N√∫i Bong and concentrate his forces against N√∫i M√¥ Tau. For a new assault on N√∫i M√¥ Tau, General Tr∆∞·ªüng authorized the reinforcement of the 54th Infantry Regiment by the 15th Ranger Group drawn out of the Bo River Valley west of Hu·∫ø; the 54th would make the main attack. The 54th Infantry commander selected his 3rd Battalion to lead, followed by the 2nd Battalion and the 60th and 94th Ranger Battalions. When the 3rd Battalion had difficulty reaching the attack position, it was replaced on 27 November by the 1st Battalion. Weather was terrible that day, but two Ranger battalions made some progress and established contact with the PAVN on the eastern and southeastern slopes of the hill. On 28 November, with good weather and long-awaited support from the RVNAF, the 1st Battalion, 54th Infantry, began moving toward the crest of N√∫i M√¥ Tau. On the hill the PAVN was approaching a desperate state; one battalion of the 5th Regiment was moving to reinforce but washouts on Route 545 between Ruong Ruong and Thon Ben Tau south of N√∫i M√¥ Tau had all but eliminated resupply. Despite difficulties, however, the PAVN continued to resist strongly on both hills. On 1 December, Colonel Vo Toan, the commander of the ARVN 1st Infantry, returned to his regiment from a six-month absence at South Vietnam's Command and General Staff College. His timely arrival was probably responsible for injecting new spirit and more professional leadership into the attack, which had bogged down so close to its objective. Help also arrived for the defenders; the PAVN 812th Regiment, refilled and somewhat recovered from its earlier combat, returned to N√∫i M√¥ Tau, replacing the badly battered 6th Regiment. Over on N√∫i Bong, however the remnants of the PAVN 271st Independent Regiment were without help. On 3 December, the 1st Reconnaissance Company and the 1st and 3d Battalions, 1st Infantry Regiment, were assaulting a dug-in battalion only 5O meters from the crest, but the expected victory slipped from their grasp. Intense fires drove the South Vietnamese back and although the 1st Infantry retained a foothold on the slopes, it was unable to carry the crest. The attack by the 54th Infantry and the 15th Ranger Group had more success. On 10 December, the 1st Battalion of the 54th took one of the twin crests of N√∫i M√¥ Tau and captured the other the following day. As bloody skirmishing continued around the mountain for weeks, the PAVN executed another relief, replacing the 812th Regiment with the 803rd. Although the PAVN remained entrenched on N√∫i Bong, his access to lines of communication and the base in Ruong Ruong were frequently interdicted by the ARVN units operating in his rear. Furthermore, the PAVN 78th Artillery Regiment was forced to remove its batteries because resupply past the ARVN position around N√∫i M√¥ Tau became too difficult. The RVNAF, meanwhile resumed flying into Phu Bai on 13 December. Aftermath By making timely and appropriate economy of force deployments, often accepting significant risks, General Tr∆∞·ªüng was able to hold the PAVN main force at bay around Hu·∫ø, but the ring was closing on the city. Reinforced PAVN battalions equipped with new weapons, ranks filling with fresh replacements from the north were in close contact with ARVN outposts the length of the front. Behind these battalions, new formations of tanks were being assembled and large logistical installations were being constructed, protected by antiaircraft weapons and supplied by newly improved roads. The PAVN claim to have \\"eliminated\\" 2,500 ARVN during the battle. During the 1975 Spring Offensive on 21 March elements of the PAVN 325th Division overran the 61st Ranger positions on Hill 560 to the southeast, while elements of the 324th Division attacked Hills 224 and 303 and N√∫i Bong and N√∫i M√¥ Tau capturing them by 22 March. From these positions the PAVN proceeded to shell Highway 1 and then moved down from the hills cutting Highway 1, severing the land route between Hu·∫ø and Da Nang.

It was designed by John McDonald and NSW Engineer for Bridges and built from 1892 to 1893 by NSW Public Works. It is also known as McKanes Bridge. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  The design of the McDonald Truss was greatly influenced by the needs of the time. During the period 1865-1885, the Public Works Department (PWD) was attempting to tap the resources of inland Australia and to redirect the line of trade from Melbourne to Sydney. To achieve this most funds were directed at the railways. As more people were moving to the rural areas it was necessary to link farms and towns to nearby railheads, with consequent road and bridge requirements. The McDonald Truss was designed by John A McDonald M.I.C.E. and was the answer to the need for more bridges, the technical faults of the old PWD design and limited funds. It is most probable that McKanes Falls, McKanes Crossing and McKanes Bridge are named after Archibald McKane. He was born in Edinburgh in 1807 and was trained as a joiner and ploughwright. He was convicted of cattle stealing in 1830 and transported to Australia for seven years. He was sentenced to another seven years for larceny in 1833. He was appointed as overseer of carpenters in the 1830s. He was involved in expeditions with Thomas Mitchell, and was commended for his duties as a carpenter. He was granted his certificate of freedom in 1844. The road on which the bridge sits was built in the late 1870s to connect Bowenfels and Hampton. With the increase in road use in the early 1890s due to tourism at Jenolan Caves, but mainly farm production, especially wool, the road was upgraded and the bridge was built in 1893. Tenders were called to erect a bridge over Coxs River in September 1891 and was under construction by 1892. The bridge was constructed to shorten the distance for traffic going from Bowenfels to Lowther, Hampton and Jenolan Falls. The earlier route had run via Hartley.  Description  The bridge consists of two truss spans supported at each end by sandstone masonry abutments. The centre pier was built as stone but replaced with a reinforced concrete pier in the 1980s following flood damage. The bridge is between kerbs at its narrowest point. There is no footway. The deck is made up of lateral timber cross girders supporting longitudinal timber decking. The cross girders are bearing on the bottom chords of the trusses. The substructure consists of two sandstone abutments and a central concrete pier. = Condition = As at 15 June 2005, the bridge was generally in good condition following major repairs carried out in the last few years. Elements of truss true to original design although most or all of the timbers have been replaced as part of routine maintenance as with other parts of the bridge. The central stone pier replaced with concrete pier. = Modifications and dates = *brushbox decking laid *1934bridge screwed up *1941dismantling and erecting squared timber *1951-86repairs and maintenance *1986new reinforced concrete central pier replaced original stone pier after severe flooding. *1986a metal flashing has been placed over all top chords and principals to shed water. Regular maintenance by RTA.  Heritage listing  As at 15 June 2005, this bridge is a McDonald timber truss road bridge. Timber truss road bridges were extensively used in New South Wales because of the high quality of local hardwoods and the shortage of steel during the early decades of settlement of the state. The timber truss was highly developed for bridges in New South Wales, perhaps more so than anywhere else in the world at that time. The McDonald truss is a significant evolutionary link in the development of timber road bridges in New South Wales and has three standard span lengths, , , and . At March 1998 there were seven McDonald truss road bridges remaining in New South Wales, McKanes Falls Bridge being one of two with a span and one of two in a double span configuration. The bridge has been assessed as having State significance. McKanes Falls Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. McDonald truss bridges have historical significance because timber truss bridges were developed and refined in Australia to achieve the highest level of timber bridge construction for the time of their design and the McDonald truss is an important recognisable design in the evolution of timber truss bridges in NSW. The bridge also has a historical link with the evolution of the local community. The probable association with Archibald McKane and his involvement with Mitchell's third expedition also lends some significance to the crossing itself. McKanes bridge is a relic of the NSW government's policies of the late nineteenth century which focused on the provision of land areas to facilitate an increase in production and trade throughout the state. Is associated with John A McDonald, designer of the McDonald Truss and a significant figure in the area of bridge design and construction in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. McDonald truss bridges have aesthetic significance because they are evocative of Australian methods of bridge construction, in their materials, scale and configuration they reflect and express nineteenth century technologies and experiences and for the time of their design and construction they demonstrate the best quality design available. The dark green painting and the valley setting complement the surrounding rural environment. McKanes Bridge is an excellent example of a twin span McDonald Truss type bridge The scale of the structure, the natural timber and other materials allow the bridge to meld with the surrounding landscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. McDonald truss bridges have social significance because their size and location contribute directly to the local area and they are a strong element in the local environment. McKanes Bridge is located in farming country and is isolated, with few residents nearby. For these reasons there is little contemporary community association. However, the bridge forms part of local school bus routes and consequently is well known to the children of the wider community. The bridge has been an important feature of one of the old routes to the Jenolan caves tourist area since its construction in 1893. Built tp provide better access for traffic from Bowenfels to Lowther, Hampton and Jenolan Falls, it played a significant role for those people living, working and holidaying in the surrounding area. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. One of six remaining McDonald truss bridges, one of two span bridges. One of very few timber truss bridges remaining in the Lithgow area. The only surviving example of a twin span McDonald Truss road bridge in NSW and one of only five surviving in NSW and still in use. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Representative example of a two span, McDonald truss bridge. Representative of the first truss bridge design which can be considered uniquely Australian due to its local design and use of native timbers. Is an example of the design which led to a rapid expansion in bridge construction throughout NSW and an excellent example of a twin span McDonald Truss in good condition and easily accessible  Engineering heritage award  The bridge received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

The toxin acts on potassium channels, blocking Kv1.3 and slowing the deactivation of Kv4.2. BmP02 is not toxic to humans or mice.  Source and etymology  The BmP02 toxin is a component of the venom of the Buthus martensi Karsch scorpion, making up 0.09% of its dry venom mass . This scorpion species is native to northwestern China, Mongolia, and Korea. BmP02 is also known as ‚ç∫-KTx9.1 or Bmkk(6). The Bm acronym derives from the initials of Buthus martensi scorpion species. P02 refers to the fact that BmP02 is one of the short-chain peptide toxins found in Buthus Martensi Karsch's crude venom.  Structure  BmP02 is a member of the ‚ç∫-KTx toxin family. KTx's are toxins from the scorpion. Members of the ‚ç∫ subfamily typically consist of short peptides, approximately 28-42 amino acids in length. The majority of them contain three or four disulfide bridgesSaucedo AL, Flores-Solis D, Rodriguez de la Vega RC, Ramirez-Cordero B, Hernandez-Lopez R, Cano-Sanchez P, et al. New tricks of an old pattern: structural versatility of scorpion toxins with common cysteine spacing. J Biol Chem. 2012;287(15):12321-30. Most Œ±-KTx toxins act on potassium channels. They bind to the channel using a dyad-motif centered on a lysine in the Œ≤ strand. Then they use a hydrophobic residue to block the channel's activity. Despite not containing this dyad-motif, BmP02 is still able to block multiple types of potassium channels. Bmp02 is a 28 amino acid toxin which is stabilized by 3 disulphide bonds. Its mass is 2950 Da. Although BmP02 is a member of the Ktx family it lacks the active dyad-motif which is common to this family. BmP02 is among the shorter toxins in the Buthus martensi venom. The untranslated cDNA of BmP02 consists of three parts: a 5‚Ä≤ untranslated region (UTR), an open reading frame (ORF) and a 3‚Ä≤ UTR. Its precursor consists of 56 amino acids. In the functional toxin, only 28 amino acids remain.  Homology  Structurally, BmP02 is very similar to Kbot1 (Buthus occitanus tunetanus, 93% similar) and to BmP03 (BmK, 96% ). It also shares similarity with BmP01 (BmK, 46%) and BmP05 (BmK) but it has a different mode of action. BmP05 acts blocks the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (SKCa), whereas BmP02 acts on potassium channels, but is not able to exert a pharmacological effect on the SKCa channels.  Targets  BmP02 targets potassium channels. Its activity has been shown in Kv1.1-Kv1.3, Kv4.2, Shaker- IR (Inactivation Removed) type, and SKCa. BmP02 blocks Kv1.1-Kv1.3 with nanomolar affinity but has no effect on Kv1.4 isoform of the channel. Kv1.3 (IC50 = 7 ¬± 0.6 nm) and Kv4.2 (EC50 = 845 nM) channels are the most sensitive targets to this toxin. =SKCa= SKCa channel can be found in the brain. It has been experimentally shown that BmP02 can bind to SKCa with micromolar affinity. However, unlike BmP05, BmP02 does not generate toxic effects in mice. This loss of toxicity has been ascribed to the differential coupling of the disulfide bridge between BmP05 and BmP02. This lowers the affinity of BmP02 for the SKCa channel and removes its pharmacological effect. Furthermore, it has been shown that after intracerebroventricular injection in mice it could very well compete to binding to the SKCa channel with the toxin iodinated apamin. = Kv1.3 = Kv1.3 channels can be found in T-lymphocytes and macrophages. The effect of BmP02 on Kv1.3 channels has been validated in HEK293T cells. BmP02 acts on the Kv1.3 channel by blocking it, which does not affect Kv1.3's voltage-gating properties. BmP02 binds on two negatively charged aspartate residues (D421 and D422) in the turret of the channel. Three positively charged residues (His9, Lys11 and Lys13) within the large Œ≤ turn of the toxin facilitate this interaction. After binding, the Lys11 associated side chain will block the central pore.Wu B, Wu BF, Feng YJ, Tao J, Ji YH. Mapping the Interaction Anatomy of BmP02 on Kv1.3 Channel. Sci Rep. 2016;6:29431. Other residues that have been found to be important for BmP02's action are Asp16 on the toxin which interacts with the His401 residue the channel. Blocking of BmP02 on Kv1.3 is state-dependent, the toxin preferentially binds to and blocks the channel in its closed state. = Transient outward K+ channel (Ito) = BmP02 blocks the Ito in adult rat ventricular myocytes by physically obstructing the channel's pore while leaving the channel's gating properties intact. The toxin-channel interface here is mediated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged residues on the toxin and negatively charged residues in the pore of the channel. The Ik and Ikl1 were not affected in guinea pig ventricular myocytes . = Kv4.2 = BmP02 delays the inactivation of Kv4.2. The Kv 4.2 channel partially mediates the transient outward potassium current (Ito) in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Three negative amino acids (A359, K347, K353) within the pore of Kv4.2 channels and positive residues E4/E5 and D20/D21 on the toxin facilitate the interaction between the channel and the toxin. BmP02 delays Kv4.2 inactivation, which would be expected to cause an increase in the Ito. However, in vitro experiments on adult rat ventricular myocytes showed that BmP02 blocks the Ito channel. As a solution it has been proposed that Kv1.3 is involved in the Ito  Toxicity  BmP02 is not toxic to humans and gives only minor and temporary symptoms in mice. It is not possible to experimentally establish an LD50.

The stranger, Juliette Carfienne, arrives at Marianne's house while G√ºnther, bored, is leaving. After they meet she refuses G√ºnther's offers of friendship. He offers the guests a game: poker elimination that will finally have one winner only and who will be the only one who will stay dressed; losers must undress themselves or commit suicide. In the last hand between Juliette and G√ºnther, the latter wins. All losers undress except Juliette who chooses to commit suicide. As a sign of defiance, G√ºnther takes an automatic pistol from his jacket and hands it to Juliet. While the latter is about to shoot, G√ºnther removes the weapon from her hand and wants to be who lost the game; then he undresses. Juliette declares herself defeated and also strips. After the party, the guests leave; on the stairs G√ºnther tells Juliet that he has only seen her eyes; both leave together.

Jensen was a painter, singer and dancer known for his career as an entertainer, recording work as Jerry Madison and later success as an impressionist artist.  Early Life  Born on a ranch in Fresno, Jensen grew up in Carmel. He was a direct descendant of Daniel Boone on his mother's side and his paternal grandparents emigrated from Denmark. Blessed with a beautiful singing voice, as a youth, Jensen was chosen to sing in church and at the Carmel Mission, as well as appearing as a boy soprano and tenor in the Carmel Bach Festival. His early success led to further study with Lotte Lehmann at the Music Academy of the West and the University of California at Santa Barbara from which he graduated with a music degree. Further study at Los Angeles City College led to roles in many local productions.  Broadway  Jensen moved to New York City soon after college where he appeared in numerous musicals culminating in being cast as the young lead, Lun Tha, by Rodgers and Hammerstein in a touring production of The King & I. He then toured the country with Harry Belafonte, Raymond Massey, Tyrone Power and Judith Anderson in the 1954 road company production of John Brown‚Äôs Body. He joined Eleanor Powell's act that played many of the top nightclubs in the US as well as an appearance of the Ed Sullivan Show. That success led to a similar tour with Janis Paige. He went on to be a regular on The Ford Show and the Dinah Shore Chevy Show. Madison Album Released in 1958  Jerry Madison  Taking the stage name of Jerry Madison, Jensen became a pop recording star on Tops Records with \\"Merry, Mary\\" becoming a minor hit, putting him on the cover of Deejay magazine in April 1958. Another hit was \\"Von Hutch, the Mad Russian Pinstriper.\\" He recorded a song \\"Girls, Glamorous Girls\\" for the Sherman Brothers' Buena Vista Records compilation Tinpanorama. Tops commissioned famed photographer John Engstead to photograph Jensen. As Madison, Jensen appeared on Coronado 9 and in Where the Boys Are.  Artistic Endeavors  From when he was young and throughout his show business career, Jensen spent his spare time painting, and it eventually became his primary love. The first Los Angeles exhibition of his impressionist works was at Galerie Marumo in 1985 entitled \\"California Summer.\\" Jensen was the first American painter to have a solo show at Galerie Marumo's sister gallery in Paris with his exhibition of 24 Southern California scenes entitled \\"Fleurs de Liberte\\" coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty's presentation to the United States by France. Jensen was the only American artist represented by the gallery. In 1988 Jensen traveled to China with journalist Bonnie Churchill. The paintings that resulted from his visit were collected into an exhibition entitled \\"The Waking Dragon Beckons\\" which were displayed at the Walter Library at Alliant International University in San Diego, the University of Redlands Armacost Library, and the USC Pacific Asia Museum. Jensen was an early adopter of digital technology with his painting Man in Yellow Straw Hat, scanning a sketch into his computer then laser printing it with a device that converted black laser output to colors. In 1994 Jensen and Churchill produced a book entitled The Young Athlete that feature Jensen's illustrations of life lessons that celebrities such as Clint Eastwood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Bob Hope learned from playing sports as children. Jensen also illustrated Churchill's 1992 book, What Color is the Wind?. His sketches and paintings were featured in the book Sport as Symbol by Mari Womack. Jensen painted portraits of Marguerite Piazza, Vincent Price, Boris Yeltsin and Roy Disney. He used his art to support charitable causes including the LA Philanthropic Foundation, Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Stephen S. Wise Temple. Before he was a painter, Jensen also made a name in Los Angeles as a textile designer, designing wall coverings for John Williams' Los Angeles home.. His fabric designs were displayed at the Bowers Museum in 1981 at an exhibition entitled \\"Inspiration to Realization.\\"  Official Artist of USC Band  Jensen was the \\"Official Artist of The Spirit of Troy,\\" producing numerous paintings and two books about the band along with his partner Keith Walker. His affiliation with USC began with a painting of the band's director, Arthur C. Bartner, at the Rose Bowl Game in 1990 and he went on to produce numerous art works for the program. Jensen's paintings were projected on screen to illustrate USC Concert Band concerts. The two books Jensen and Walker produced for the organization celebrated director Bartner's 25th and 40th anniversary at the helm of the organization: Silver Celebration and The Man on the Ladder.

He took control over Sharjah in a coup during the absence of his uncle, Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, and ruled both Sharjah and, from 1900 until his death in 1914, Ras Al Khaimah.  Accession  Saqr bin Khalid was left in charge of Sharjah when his unpopular uncle, Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, travelled to Ras Al Khaimah and he took the opportunity to seize power over the town. He was quickly supported by the Rulers of Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Qawain, Ajman and Dubai. Having cemented his position, he conferred a pension on the former Ruler, Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, which guaranteed him an annual payment as well as the retention of his property in Sharjah and the primacy over the island of Abu Musa. There were issues both with Salim's conduct and Saqr's payment of the pension, culminating in a meeting in Ajman taking place in 1884 with the British Resident presiding, where an agreement was reached to restore the pension. = Secessions = Later that year, Saqr attempted to force the secessionist Sharjah dependency of Hamriyah back into the fold, inviting headman Saif bin Abdulrahman to visit him in Sharjah and simultaneously dispatching Saif's brother, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman, to take over Hamriyah. The next day, Saif returned to Hamriyah and expelled his brother with the greatest of ease. Another attempt at secession took place, this time in Ras Al Khaimah, and Saqr bin Khalid assisted his cousin Humaid bin Abdullah Al Qasimi, in December 1885, to re-take the village of Sha'am to the North of Ras Al Khaimah. The village was then prevailed upon to pay a fine of 1,600 Marie Therese Dollars. The former Ruler of Sharjah, Salim bin Sultan, continued to plot against Saqr, effecting an unsuccessful landing at Ajman in 1886 and again trying to gain support from Dubai to usurp Saqr in 1888, in which he was also unsuccessful. Organising an attack against Sharjah the following year, Salim was unable to carry it out and eventually was reconciled to Saqr, becoming his wazir (advisor). = Retaking Ras Al Khaimah = On 2 August 1900, Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah of Ras Al Khaimah was paralysed by a stroke and Saqr moved, unopposed, to declare his rule over the emirate. He first placed his cousin and then, after a few months, his son Khalid as wali, or governor, over Ras Al Khaimah. Hamriyah continued to struggle for confirmation of its independence from Sharjah and, on the occasion of the visit by Lord Curzon in 1903, tried to gain recognition from the British as a Trucial State. This attempt was unsuccessful and was followed by a murderous jostle for the succession as headman of the town following the death of Saif bin Abdulrahman. Saqr was not a popular ruler and in 1904 managed to survive yet another attempt to unseat him by his Uncle, Salim bin Sultan. However, he ruled Sharjah for a further ten years until his death in 1914. Salim bin Sultan became wali of Ras Al Khaimah in 1910 and although Saqr remained nominally the Ruler of the emirate, Salim consolidated his hold on power and was in all but name independent.

His short rule was most notable for the means of his accession, which involved the murder of his nephew, and also his death, at the hands of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan in single combat.  Accession  On the death of Abdulla bin Sultan Al Qasimi during the fighting for Hamriyah in 1855, the administration of Sharjah (under the head of the Al Qasimi tribe and federation, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi) fell to a wali, Mohammed bin Saqr Al Qasimi, a grandson of Sultan bin Saqr's. Khalid bin Sultan proceeded to intrigue against Mohammed bin Saqr, who was his nephew. At this time, Sultan bin Saqr was in his dotage and had lost both the use of his hearing and memory and took little or no part in proceedings. By 1859, Khalid had collected strong support from the families of the town and the area became effectively divided between two groups, one supporting Mohammed and one behind Khalid. Khalid and Mohammed rode out together into the desert in late 1860 and Khalid shot Mohammed, dumping his body in a well. Seeking British recognition for his accession, he was rebuffed with the Resident refusing to converse 'with one so recently and fearfully polluted.' = Ruler of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah = Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi died in 1866 at the age of 85 and Khalid proclaimed himself the independent Sheikh of Sharjah, while Ibrahim bin Sultan Al Qasimi declared himself Sheikh of Ras Al Khaimah. However, in May 1867, Khalid led a successful attack on Ras Al Khaimah, expelled Ibrahim and declared himself Ruler. The town of Ras Al Khaimah and its dependencies were then re-incorporated into Sharjah. A number of clashes took place between the forces loyal to Sharjah under Khalid and those of Abu Dhabi under Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. In April 1868, during one such armed conflict with Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed advanced ahead of his troops and challenged Khalid bin Sultan to single combat. Zayed wounded Khalid mortally and he died that month. He was succeeded by Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi.

The 290th overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 10, 2018. The episode explores modern political correctness and cancel culture as the people of South Park turn against longtime recurring character Mr. Hankey, and Vice Principal Strong Woman and PC Principal deal with the fallout from their fling at the end of the previous season. These themes are also seen in the episode's references to the 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu, the cancellation of Roseanne after controversial tweets by the show's eponymous actress, and the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Plot At a South Park City Council meeting, Mr. Hankey, a sentient piece of feces, and the director of the town's Christmas pageant, is told that the budget for his show has been cut in half. Despite the fact that many in town like him, he is told that many others are offended by him due to his scatological nature. After he takes his anger out on South Park Elementary's music students, both during class and with a series of politically incorrect tweets, the City Council fires him. Unable to find a lawyer to accept his case, he enlists Kyle Broflovski, since Kyle's father is a lawyer. At a public hearing, greater scrutiny is placed upon his history of offensive tweets, which he attempts to minimize as failed attempts at humor that he blames on his use of Ambien. He also argues that preparing for the upcoming Christmas show is more important than focusing on such indiscretions. Vice Principal Strong Woman, pregnant following her fling with PC Principal in \\"Super Hard PCness\\" and \\"Splatty Tomato\\", tells PC Principal that their affair was a mistake, and that she wishes to break up with him. PC Principal, despite his concerns over whether this is possible, reluctantly agrees, and the two organize a school assembly on in vitro fertilization in order to stave off speculation that Strong Woman became pregnant through sex or any other questions over the father of her children. She gives birth to quintuplets who turn out to be highly politically correct (PC) and bear a strong resemblance to PC Principal, but she refuses to acknowledge that he is the children's father. PC Principal, not being able to stay away from his children, proposes that they tell others that he is the children's male nanny, or \\"manny\\". Feeling that people have forgotten what the spirit of Christmas is about, Mr. Hankey enlists Kyle to help him put on a musical performance in the park, but when the show's politically incorrect humor offends PC Principal's and Strong Woman's PC babies, they begin crying. Their distress continues even after Mr. Hankey ceases his politically incorrect material, because it is explained to him that \\"sometimes PC babies don't know what they're crying about.\\" Mr. Hankey angrily excoriates the townsfolk for this, and when Kyle tries to stop him, an altercation ensues that destroys their stage. South Park severs all ties with Mr. Hankey, ending the long Christmas association between him and the town. Mr. Hankey leaves town, in search of a place that still accepts objectionable, racist beings like him. He arrives in the fictional town of Springfield, the setting of the animated TV series The Simpsons, where the characters native to that show, in particular Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, welcome him with open arms. A title card is then shown that reads \\"#cancelthesimpsons\\", mocking cancel culture. Reception Jesse Schedeen rated the episode 4.3 out of 10 in a review for IGN, offering the verdict, \\"This episode tries to have its cake and eat it too by attacking badly behaving celebrities and outrage culture at the same time, and it fails to accomplish either. The funny moments this week can't outweigh the jumbled, frustrating narrative.\\" John Hugar with The A.V.

Canada provided the landscape for her second novel The Red Boat (1968), which \\"explores the extent to which a breakdown in childhood filial relationships can damage emotional development and well-being into adult life\\".Bennett, Anthony J. (1988) 'Introduction', in After returning to Armidale, Gwen was appointed Lecturer in English and Philosophy at the Armidale Teachers' College in 1964, and remained at the college until her retirement in the early 1980s. With a colleague, she wrote What is Right? Case Studies in the Ethics of Education (1970), in which \\"[t]rue conflicts between child and teacher are analysed by the authors ..... Conflicts that question the ethics of education; that dispute the teacher's powers in and out of class; that take into account the child's family background and personal behavior.\\" She also wrote two guides to the writings of Henry Lawson (both in 1975), and continued to publish short stories in literary journals including The Literary Review, Southerly, Quadrant and Meanjin. In 1968 she won her first Henry Lawson Prose Award for her short story 'Day at Paffts'. Her third novel, The Middle-Aged Maidens, published in 1976, is set in a private girls' school in a small town, and is narrated by one of the schoolteachers and three successive headmistresses.Berridge, Elizabeth. \\"Recent Fiction.\\" Daily Telegraph, 13 Oct. 1977, p. 15. The Telegraph Historical Archive, http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/7CNCW5. Accessed 8 Oct. 2018. It has been described as a \\"fierce appraisal of small-town shortcomings ... [an] acerbic depiction of a private school for girls in Armidale.\\" Reviewers appreciated that \\"the headmistresses' characters are sketched with sharp and brilliant lines ...... Gwen Kelly draws from us that complexity of response which is normal in life, rare in literature\\"; and described the novel as \\"spiteful, malicious, cunning, intensely readable ..... Delicious, Ms Kelly .... you know your Australia and you've a lovely way with words\\". Also in 1976, her short story 'Country Show' was adapted for screen as a short film called Showtime, directed by Jan Chapman, produced by Sandra Levy, written by Margaret Kelly, with cinematography by Jan Kenny, and starring Jude Kuring and Lorna Lesley. Director Jan Chapman remembered that Showtime, \\"about the school system‚Äôs reaction to an affair between two women teachers\\", was shown at the Sydney Filmmakers Co-op cinema as part of a program about life in school, including Jane Oehr‚Äôs Stirring (1974) .... [and] Ken Cameron‚Äôs first film Sailing To Brooklyn (1974)\\". Always Afternoon (1981) is perhaps Gwen Kelly's best-known work. Set during the years 1915-18, it concerns the lives of those in the small northern NSW town of Arakoon, where German nationals and Australian-born descendants of German migrants were interned in Trial Bay Gaol as enemy aliens. In Kelly's novel, a young local woman, Freda Kennon, falls in love with Franz, one of the internees who is a violinist. While some critics described the romance as a \\"vapid Romeo-and- Juliet scenario\\", other reviewers commented that \\"Kelly depicts very well Freda's adolescence and the conflict between her love and her puritanical upbringing. She is also successful in evoking the claustrophobic atmosphere in a small country town where life is \\"always afternoon\\", and \\"Kelly is good at creating the feeling of life within the jail walls ... [and] depicts the growing hatred in the district, growing to dangerous proportions\\" as local families are affected by the deaths and injuries suffered by their menfolk away fighting in the war. Always Afternoon was made into a TV mini-series in 1988 by SBS TV in cooperation with German network NDR, with actors from Australia, Germany and the UK. In a decade in which Australian male soldiers' experiences of WWI were notably explored in film (eg Gallipoli, Breaker Morant, The Lighthorsemen) and TV series (eg ANZACs), Always Afternoon provided a very different perspective, focusing on the home front and the experiences of civilians, particularly women, and those who had thought they were civilians but suddenly became aliens. Kelly's novel has also been the subject of analysis by several academics exploring responses to WWI in Australian literature.Spittel, Christina. 'Nostalgia for the Nation? The First World War in Australian Novels of the 1970s and 1980s'. In Coates D.

Tilson was the son of Nathaniel Tilson of London, and grandson of Henry Tilson, Bishop of Elphin in Ireland. He was educated at St Paul's School. In February 1685 he became Clerk of the Treasury, a post he held for the rest of his life. He became Clerk of Commissioner of appeal in the excise at ¬£100 p.a. in April 1693, and Receiver General of crown land revenues in 1699. Before 1706, he married Mary Humble (died 30 August 1737), daughter of George Humble. He acquired the manor of Hampton Poyle in 1723.TILSON, Christopher (1670-1742), of St. Margaret's, Westminster and Hampton Poyle, Oxon. The History of Parliament. Retrieved 8 October 2018. Tilson's brother was George Tilson, under-secretary of state for the northern department from 1710 to 1738. At the 1727 British general election, Tilson was returned as Member of Parliament for Cricklade. He voted with the Administration, but did not stand again at the 1734 British general election. He was chosen as a director of the Chelsea Waterworks Company in 1730 and was its deputy governor in 1733. Tilson was questioned on 30 June 1742 by the secret committee of the House of Commons about the expenditure on the secret service during Walpole's tenure at the Treasury. He replied that it was all without account, . . . nor is there any entry in the Treasury of the application of any of these sums of money. Horace Walpole wrote that ‚Äòold Tilson ... was so much tormented‚Äô by the secret committee on Walpole that ‚Äòit turned his brain'. Tilson died on 25 August 1742.

Early life Gore was the eldest son of William Gore and his wife Lady Mary Compton, daughter of George Compton, 4th Earl of Northampton. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 12 July 1729, aged 18. In 1739 he succeeded to Tring Park on the death of his father. He was responsible for diverting the main Aylesbury to Berkhamsted road from a course through the park, which took it straight past the front door of Tring Park Mansion, to its present route following considerably flatter terrain further north. He married Ellen Humfreys, daughter of Sir William Humfreys, 1st Baronet, of London, on 3 December 1741. Career Tring Park Mansion (southern face) Gore was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Cricklade at a by-election on 21 November 1739 caused by the death of his father. He voted against the motion for Walpole's removal in February 1741. At the 1741 British general election there was a double return at Cricklade and he withdrew there as he had also been returned unopposed as MP for Hertfordshire. In 1742 he was one of the opposition Members proposed by the court to sit on the committee of inquiry into Walpole's Administration, although he was not elected to it. He continued to vote with the Opposition until the end of 1744 when he went over to the Administration with his uncle Thomas Gore. He was returned unopposed again in 1747. At the 1754 British general election, Gore was returned for Hertfordshire after a contest. There was another contest at the 1761 British general election, and as he had lost the support of the Dissenters, he was defeated. In May 1762 Newcastle recommended Gore to Nathaniel Ryder for a seat at Tiverton, where he was returned at a by-election on 14 May 1762. Gore was in poor health and spent the winter of 1764 to 1765 in France, returning to England in May 1765. By this time his appearance in divisions was sporadic and his political inclinations unclear.

It tells the story of Maria, an alienated high-school student whose life is turned upside down when she switches places with her sinister mirror image. The film is written and directed by Assaf Bernstein, and stars India Eisley, Mira Sorvino and Jason Isaacs. Plot 17-year-old Maria Brennan (India Eisley) is a timid social outcast at her high school, where she is shunned by her peers and bullied by her schoolmate Mark (John C. MacDonald). Maria has only one friend, the unpleasant Lily (Penelope Mitchell); she also harbours a secret crush on Lily's boyfriend, Sean (Harrison Gilbertson). At home, Maria frequently suppresses her emotions with her parents: her distant father Dan (Jason Isaacs) is a philandering plastic surgeon and a obsessive perfectionist, and her mother Amy (Mira Sorvino), who suffers from depression and nightmares, lives in denial about her husband's affairs. Maria accidentally discovers a sonogram of a pair of twins. Afterwards in the bathroom, her reflection begins to move on its own, terrifying Maria. Shaken, she attempts to discuss it with her parents the following morning; however, they brush her off and send her to school. After dreaming of her own birth, Maria's reflection begins talking to her, calling herself Airam, and telling Maria she can take her sadness away. Although physically identical, Airam is charismatic, assertive, and appears more beautiful than Maria. Maria asks who she is, and Airam simply says she has \\"always been here.\\" A series of tragedies then befall Maria: her father offers to give her an early birthday present; when she arrives at her father's office the next day to receive her gift as instructed, he tells her he's going to perform cosmetic surgery on her to fix her \\"flaws\\". Crushed, she begins to find solace in Airam's presence and support that make her confront her subconscious thoughts and inner feelings. Her mother Amy senses that something is wrong with Maria, but is repeatedly shut down by her husband. Lily then takes her for a skating lesson for the upcoming on-ice winter prom, but after Maria slips and is unable to get back up, Lily simply taunts her, before abandoning her on the ice. Airam again gives her comfort and encouragement. Finally, she is humiliated and physically assualted by her bully Mark at the prom. Devastated, Maria goes into the bathroom to find Airam. Their palms and lips touch, allowing them to switch places. Her mother Amy has a nightmare about giving birth. Home from the prom, Maria's personality has changed totally to that of Airam's. At school, Airam is visibly more confident, standing up to Mark. She then arranges for Amy to run into her husband's mistress as a way of forcing her to acknowledge Dan's affairs and their superficial marriage. Maria, now stuck in the mirror, is appalled by Airam's behaviour, but Airam insists she is only being honest, and that Maria needs to trust her. She tells Maria that all of them must answer for their sins. Airam then lures Mark to the shower and breaks his knee. After secretly practicing figure skating alone, Airam has another lesson with Lily, who soon becomes intimidated by Airam's sinister manner. Airam chases Lily across the ice, and Lily falls into the pavement, fatally crushing her skull. In the bathroom that evening, Maria, frantic, begs to switch again, but Airam reiterates that Lily's death was an accident; and that ultimately, Maria wanted Lily out of their lives. Maria asks again who she is, but Airam only replies, \\"You know me\\". Airam then seduces Sean, and the two begin an intense relationship. As they make love, Airam smiles as she watches Maria's enraptured reflection finally getting what she wants. Airam begins living more wildly, smoking marijuana, skipping school, and drinking hard liquor. While at a motel together, Sean gets a phone call telling him the police want to speak to him and Maria. Airam refuses to go, and Sean becomes suspicious. He picks up his jacket to leave, and in a moment of impulse and fear, Airam hits him over the head with a vodka bottle she brought with her, killing him. Deeply upset, she sits against the mirror in the bathroom and she and Maria cry together. Amy has another dream about giving birth. It is revealed that Maria originally had a twin sister, who was euthanised after birth by Dan due to her supposed physical deformities, against Amy's pleas. Airam leaves the motel and confronts Dan at the clinic after hours, pretending to be heavily intoxicated. She strips naked and demands to know if he would still love her if she were deformed. Clearly perturbed by the question, he avoids it and grabs a robe to cover her with, but she insists he look at her. Finally, he answers \\"yes\\", and she slits his throat with a scalpel. As he lies dying, she begins to cry and asks, \\"Why couldn't you love me?\\" Airam now no longer sees Maria in her reflection. Frightened and alone, Airam returns home and crawls onto the bed next to her mother. A series of mirrored burst shots depicts Maria and Airam on the bed together with their mother reunited as a family, presumably now merged into one.

She is most well-known for co-defining the branch and bound algorithm along with Alison Doig whilst carrying out research at the London School of Economics in 1960. She is married to Frank Land who is also an Emeritus Professor at the LSE.  Education  Land obtained her PhD from the London School of Economics in 1956, her dissertation was entitled An Application of the Techniques of Linear Programming to the Transportation of Coal, supervised by George Morton.  Integer programming  Land worked with Helen Makower, Alison Doig and George Morton in the late 1950s on a number of integer programming problems such as the travelling salesman problem and aircraft scheduling. However these were seemingly too complex to solve. British Petroleum commissioned Land and Doig to investigate using discrete variables within linear programming models. Through this investigation they developed the branch and bound algorithm for solving integer problems. This solution method is now the most prevalent solution method for NP-hard optimisation problems. Land implemented her linear and integer programming algorithms in Fortran. Later, with Susan Powell, she collected her implementations in a book, Fortran Codes for Mathematical Programming: Linear, Quadratic and Discrete (Wiley, 1973).  Awards and honours  Land was awarded with the Harold Larnder prize by the Canadian Operational Research Society in 1994 for achieving international distinction in operational research.

He previously served as a bishop in New Jersey, United States, in the Archdiocese of North America.  Early years and background  Suriel was born in Port Said, Egypt. When he was three his family migrated to Sydney where they were founding members of St Mary and St Mina, the first Coptic Orthodox church in Australia. He was educated at Marrickville West Public School, Tempe High School, the University of Sydney where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science, and the Sydney Institute of Education where he achieved a Diploma of Education. He taught mathematics at Fairvale and Dulwich high schools.  Beginning of vocation  On a pilgrimage to Egypt and the Levant in 1985, Suriel met Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, which had an inspiring impact on the youth. On returning to Australia he began leading youth meetings and conventions in the church and translated one of the Pope's books into English, \\"The Life of Repentance and Purity\\".It was later published as In 1990 Suriel was the youth representative on the NSW Board of Deacons and the following year at the 7th Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Canberra, he once again met the Pope. At this audience Suriel shared his desire for a religious life and the Pope invited him to the Monastery of Saint Pishoy, Egypt, where he was consecrated a monk on 6 July 1991.  Priest and bishop  On 8 June 1993, Suriel was ordained a priest and continued to serve in the monastery before moving to the fledgling St Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Honolulu, US, in 1996. There he lived with and studied with the local Roman Catholic community. On 15 June 1997 he was ordained a bishop and later that year moved to administer the Coptic Archdiocese of North America based in New Jersey where his ministry included touring to connect with churches and further establishing the charity BLESS USA. In 1998 he completed another year of study towards his Masters of Christian Education at Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary. On 10 November 1999, Suriel was appointed the first Bishop of Melbourne, Canberra, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and New Zealand, and was enthroned in his diocese on 4 December 1999. After being appointed to Melbourne he completed his Masters in Religious Education at the Australian Catholic University and received his doctorate from Fordham University on 20 March 2014. His doctoral dissertation was \\"Habib Girgis, Coptic orthodox Educator and A light in the Darkness\\" which was reworked into a book published in 2017. He is now an associate professor and dean at St Athanasius College, a constituent college of the University of Divinity where he lectures in religious education, youth ministry, comparative religions, homiletics and pastoral theology. Under his leadership the church established a new Coptic centre and the theological college in Coburg in 2000 and, having outgrown it in two years, moved to the former Carmelite friary at Whitefriars Park in Donvale. In 2015 the church built a new CBD apartment tower and religious complex. The complex includes the Coptic Orthodox Church of St Verena and St Bishoy and a campus of St Athanasius College. In 2018, a complaint to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission led to an investigation into the diocese of which Bishop Suriel was the ultimate decision maker under the constitution. The commission concluded that there were adequate process, checks and balances in place to ensure the diocese was complying with governance and reporting obligations. He campaigned publicly against the inclusion of inverted crosses in the branding of the Dark Mofo festival in Hobart, saying it was particularly offensive to Christians who \\"witnessed the living reality of persecution, and many other Christians who have lost loved ones or suffered themselves for their faith.\\" On 5 November 2018, Bishop Suriel formally announced his resignation as the bishop of the Diocese of Melbourne and its extended regions, citing the joy of seeing the church more than double in size and the pain of \\"insults, death threats, gossip and back stabbings\\". He announced his resignation via social media. On 15 February 2019, it was announced that Bishop Suriel will begin serving in the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Los Angeles, alongside His Eminence Metropolitan Serapion, and would be permanently discharged from the Diocese of Melbourne, along with any form of pastoral care that came with it.

He joined Bolton Wanderers in 1929, replacing Dick Pym as first choice goalkeeper before going on to make over 200 appearances in all competitions for the club. He joined Cardiff City in 1937 where he finished his playing career before working as a trainer with Southport. Career Born in Everton, Jones began his career as an apprentice with his hometown club, becoming close friends with Dixie Dean. He had written to the club to request a trial while playing as a left half but, when the goalkeeper for the session failed to arrive, he was put in goal and impressed enough to be given a contract. He made his professional debut on 8 November 1924 in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Manchester City. However, he was unable to establish himself in the first team, making two further appearances, before leaving to join Third Division North side Southport in 1926. He made his debut for Southport on 13 September 1926 in a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Chesterfield but made just two further appearances during the 1926‚Äì27 season. Over the following three seasons, he remained a back up goalkeeper, making 13 appearances before leaving the club in 1929. He joined Bolton Wanderers soon after, being signed as cover for long serving goalkeeper Dick Pym. With Pym approaching the end of his career, Jones replaced him in the side for the majority of the 1930‚Äì31 season and established himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper. He went on to make over 200 appearances in all competitions for the club before he was replaced by Stan Hanson. In July 1937, he joined Third Division South side Cardiff City on a free transfer. In his first season, he was ever present for the club, appearing in all 49 competitive matches Cardiff played. However, the following season, he was displaced by Bill Fielding and left the club at the end of the season to rejoin Southport. He returned to Southport in 1939 after being persuaded by a club official to keep playing; Jones was planning on buying a pub to manage. However, the outbreak of World War II brought an end to his professional playing career and, after representing the club in wartime fixtures, he was appointed as a trainer in 1947. He continued to feature for Southport's reserve side until 1950, becoming the oldest player to represent the club at any level at the age of 48. He retired after eleven years as the club's trainer. Personal life His son Bobby Jones later progressed through the youth system at Southport under his father's guidance to become a professional footballer. After retiring, Jones went to live with his son before his death in 1989 from pneumonia.

The Devƒ´s≈´ktam eulogises the manifold manifestations of the fierce goddess (Devƒ´), Ca·πá·∏çƒ´ or DurgƒÅ (‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§æ), in her objective and subjective aspects. This hymn is very popular and is chanted every day in the Devƒ´ temples across India, during the morning and evening ritual worship. It is specially recited during the ≈öarannavarƒÅtri festival which occurs in the Gregorian months of October - November;Encyclopedia Britannica on Navaratri: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Navratri it is also recited during the VasantanavarƒÅtri.

These gods, having been defeated and having lost their power, authority and honour, recall the assurance given by the Devƒ´ of alleviating them from their troubles. They decide to pray for her help, and arrive at the Himalayas.

He was a French Huguenot in Lunenburg, Danish, and Saxon service. Religious persecution forced Marquess de La Forest to leave his homeland, entering into Lunenburg service as captain of horse. In 1683, with permission of King Louis XIV, he moved to Denmark with his son, Jacques-Fr√©d√©ric de la Forest-Suzannet and his half-brother Philippe- Fr√©d√©ric de la Forest-Suzannet. Being commissioned a colonel in 1683, he was given a patent to raise a regiment of horse, which however did not come beyond the first start. In 1686, thanks to the help of the Danish monarchs, he was authorized to bring his wife and daughters to Copenhagen. In 1689, enjoying the favours of the Danish court, he was promoted to major-general and appointed Danish minister at the Court of St James, and advisor to Prince George of Denmark, the husband of the future Queen Anne. His main task was to win the support of King William in Denmark's conflict with the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and in this regard negotiate about Danish military assistance in the war against the Jacobites.Bricka 1887-1905, vol. 5, p. 257.Engelstoft & Dahl 1932-1944, vol. 13, pp. 521-522, Having successfully negotiated a treaty of military assistance, Marquess de La Forest became Major-general of Horse in the Danish Auxiliary Corps sent to Ireland in accordance with that treaty.Jahn 1840, p. 30. In 1694 he was promoted to Lieutenant-general in the Corps by William of Orange, becoming Danish lieutenant-general in 1697. At the end of the Nine Years' War he resigned from Danish service, settling in Ireland on an estate given to him by King William. Two years later, in 1697, however, he is a full general in Saxon service, commanding 8 000 men with orders to support Danemark in its war against Sweden. In 1699, the king of Poland asked the marquis to stay with his regiment in Poland where he dies in March 1701 at the age of 55. Marquess de La Forest was the only child of Fr√©d√©ric de Suzannet and Esther Henry de Cheusses. Once a widower, his father remarried to Elizabeth de Courcillon, sister to the marquis of Dangeau and had four other children. Fr√©d√©ric-Henri de la Forest-Suzannet married his first cousin Ren√©e-Marie Henry de Cheusses. Two of their sons died in the opera house fire in Copenhagen 1689. Jacques- Fr√©d√©ric, their only surviving son, became Groom of the Privy Bedchamber to the king of England. \\"Operahusets brand p√• Amalienborg den 19. april 1689.\\" Christian F.

It was broadcast on BBC One starting in February 2019 and is written by Jack and Harry Williams, who also wrote The Missing. In the United States, it was broadcast by PBS on its series Masterpiece beginning on 12 April 2020. Synopsis The show uses one of the central characters from the TV series, The Missing, that of Julien Baptiste played by Tch√©ky Karyo. Baptiste's wife and daughter are played by the same actors from The Missing, otherwise all other characters and actors starring in the programme are new. After having an operation on his brain tumour, Julien Baptiste claims he is not the man he once was. His old boss persuades him to help the Dutch Police look for a missing sex worker in Amsterdam. While looking, he meets Edward, the uncle of the missing girl. All is not as it seems with Edward, and the show also introduces Kim Vogel, who has a criminal history and Constantin, a Romanian national who is seen murdering and dismembering a victim at the start of the programme.

Most of the action is set in Amsterdam in the Netherlands; although some exterior scenes were shot there, some were actually filmed in Antwerp and Ghent in Belgium. Additionally, a handful of scenes were shot in Deal, Kingsdown, Ramsgate and Sandwich, all in Kent, England. The series is in six episodes, all being broadcast on a Sunday evening. Reception Carol Midgley writing in The Times, gave the first episode three out of five and declared the first 45 minutes to be \\"underwhelming\\", though the last 15 minutes picked up and left her \\"semi- intrigued\\".

It was designed in two stages, by John Whitton as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, in 1870; and by engineering staff of New South Wales Government Railways in 1921; and was built from 1870 to 1921. It is also known as Farmers Creek viaducts. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The viaduct are located approximately west of Central railway station.  History  The Farmers Creek stone railway viaduct, immediately upstream of the 1921 brick viaduct, was built for the Lithgow to Bathurst single-track railway extension, 1869 - 1875. It is one of the oldest railway arch bridges in New South Wales but was bypassed by the 1921 double-track brick arch bridges. By the early 1900s the original single track from Bowenfels to Wallerawang was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves. John Whitton chose to use stone arch construction when denied sufficient funds to use imported wrought iron girders. Economic constraints forced Whitton to build single track bridges. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges. A major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at Homebush and mostly in the form of large brick arch culverts and viaducts. The quantity of bricks used in the program was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \\"era of the brick arch\\". The Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after World War I. The viaducts over Farmers Creek are accessible from a local road that was the original Great Western Highway.  Description  =1870 rail viaduct= A sandstone viaduct built for the original single track Great Western Railway over Farmers Creek west of Bowenfels Railway Station. There are nine semi-circular arches thick. The piers are solid stone, founded at shallow depth into rock. At the piers, the internal \\"V\\" formed by the adjoining arches is filled by stone rubble to about and dished to form a drain. By this arrangement the ballasted tracks are drained and do not get water logged. There is a low stone parapet wall on each side of the viaduct. The abutments are solid stonework. =1921 rail viaduct= A brick arch viaduct comprising six clear spans plus brick wing walls. = Condition = As at 16 March 2006, the viaducts are in good condition.  Heritage listing  As at 16 March 2006, this 1870 viaduct is significant because it is one the oldest stone arch railway viaducts in New South Wales. It is associated with John Whitton the \\"father of New South Wales railways\\", it is an impressive curved sandstone structure on the edge of historic Bowenfels, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to Bathurst and on to western New South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works, particularly for the Zig Zag east of Lithgow and the extension west to Wallerawang. It is a fine representative example of a stone arch railway viaduct and it retains its original fabric. The 1921 viaduct has significance because, it is part of the Bowenfels to Wallerawang duplication, the last of such works dominated by brick arch construction, the curved viaducts, 1870 and 1921, are an impressive pair of structures on the outskirts of historic Bowenfels, the duplication work contributed significantly to the railway extension to Bathurst and to the continued development of Western New South Wales, for land transport to Sydney and with six clear spans on tall brick piers, it is one of the largest brick arch structures on the New South Wales railways system. The viaduct is a good representative example of brick arch construction and retains its original fabric and structure.

From 1893, Hayhurst was a delegate to the Bradford Trades Council, and later in the year, he was elected as general secretary of his union, by now renamed as the Amalgamated Society of Dyers. Under his leadership, membership of the union grew from about 3,000 to well over 10,000. He favoured the amalgamation of all the dyers' unions in the country, but little progress to this end was made under his leadership.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B.

The one-legged team batted first, scoring 93 runs in that innings. The one-armed team scored 42 runs in their first innings but there had been a great commotion while they were batting as a press of would-be spectators broke down a gate and some fencing to get in. Some climbed on top of a stable which collapsed so they were bruised. The one-legged team batted again and scored sixty more runs for the loss of six wickets. The game finished that evening with the one-legged team winning by 153 runs to 42. There was a rematch on the following Wednesday. A one-legged batter lost his wooden leg while making a run. The leg was fielded and thrown to stump him. This was a fine point of rules as the batter's equipment had not disturbed the wicket while making the stroke but he was still given out. Notwithstanding this loss, the one-legged team won again by 103 runs.

A band provided music for the occasion and the cricket players were additionally rewarded with a glass of grog and a fee of ten shillings. The one-legged men had difficulty connecting with the wide bowling, often being got out as they span around like a top. The one- armed team was the betting favourite and won the match, scoring 50 runs in their first innings and 41 in the second.

It was built from 1856 to 1859 by John Blackman. It is also known as Australia Arms Inn. The property is owned by National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The original land grant was issued to William Dwyer in 1837 for Portion 36, Parish Lett and County Cook. In 1856, Portion 36 was purchased by John Blackman. Between 1856 and 1858 the extant Fernhill complex was constructed and was known as the Australia Arms Inn. John Blackman died in 1860 and his widow Elizabeth operated it as an inn until 1873, after which time she lived in it as her home and renamed it Fernhill House. After her death the property passed into the joint ownership of Richard Merrick (Blackman's nephew) and her nephew, James Peacock. From 1910 to the 1950s their descendants continued to live in the property. Eva Merrick died in 1970 and bequeathed her portion and its contents to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). After protracted and financial negotiations the National Trust acquired the remaining shares in 1982.

The doorways are spanned by well-designed three-centred arches, the centre one leading to the coach space and the others to stable and feed and harness room with hayloft over. In the grounds there is a stone privy. The rubble front fence is built from stones of John Blackman's house in the Hartley Valley. The land comprises of predominantly cleared grazing land with a gently undulating fall from the road commencing from behind the barn. There are many fine mature trees in the grounds.Fairway & Sheedy 1975 = Condition = Physical condition is fair. Archaeological potential is medium. = Modifications and dates = Between 1856-1858 the inn complex was constructed. The initial complex included and inn, stables, privy and kitchen block. Between 1910-1930s additional timber outbuildings and services for the separate portions of the property were constructed. An iron garage was constructed s. A new stone fence was built on the front boundary . In 1940 a spring fed dam was constructed and the garden was enlarged. .

It is significant as a group of well constructed buildings set in extensive grounds demonstrating the pattern of land settlement and travel during the late nineteenth century. Fernhill is significant for the collection of makeshift furniture made at and for Fernhill. Fernhill was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Fernhill is historically significant because it once formed part of an important link in the chain of wayside inns that stretched from Sydney to the Western Goldfields. Together with other inns it is a major component of the pattern of land settlement, transport and travel that characterised development along the Western Road, from the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1815 to the opening of the railway to Lithgow in the 1860s.Moore & Walker 1993:7 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Fernhill is of aesthetic significance because it is a well crafted early colonial Georgian roadside inn complete with fine stone barn and other outbuildings, situated in beautiful grounds. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Fernhill is of social significance because it was built by a prominent family of early settlers in the district. It is also associated with major families in its district, that have been resident in the Lithgow, Bowenfels, Hartley area from the early eighteenth century to present, and who have a continuing association and concern about the welfare of Fernhill. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Evolved towards political opposition, in 1915 became a member of the Bureau of the Progressive Bloc. Criticized the situation in the management of the Russian Church, was opposed to the influence of Grigori Rasputin on the decision of synodal affairs, advocated the convening of a local council and reform of church government. In 1915, the opposition considered his candidacy for the post of chief prosecutor of the Holy Synod.  Ober Prosecutor of the Synod  V.N. Lvov, 1917 During the February Revolution, he became a member of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma. He served as the chief procurator of the Holy Synod in the first and the second (first coalition) composition of the Provisional Government. Removed from the Synod of his former members: metropolitans of Petrograd Pitirim (Oknova) and Moscow Macarius (Nevsky), whom the press accused of having links with Rasputin. 14 (27) April 1917 initiated the publication of a decree of the Provisional Government on changing the composition of the Holy Synod, who left from his former members only the Archbishop Sergius (Stragorodsky). Actively supported the activities democratically and reformist clergy (in particular, on his initiative by the editor \\"All-Russian Church Public Herald\\" liberal professor Boris Titlinov was appointed) with his support, the All-Russian Diocesan Congress of representatives of the clergy and laity was held. Was a supporter of the convocation of the Local Council, considering that the majority of its participants will be supporters of reforms (this assumption was not justified). His emotional nature, peculiar authoritarian management style displeased the majority of the representatives of the episcopate. According to Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgievsky), part of the Pre-Council Council, Lvov during his time as ober-prosecutor \\"He was a dictator and he overtook a lot of bishops\\", \\"made the business atmosphere of our meetings annoyed, hysterical tone, prejudiced ill will towards the bishops - he did not help the work, but interfered\\". On July 8 (21), 1917, Lvov resigned, supporting the creation of a new government led by Alexander Kerensky, who, however, did not include him in his cabinet, preferring to appoint the chief prosecutor of a much more tactful and who knew how to find a common language with the hierarchy of professor Anton Kartashev.

Deyaniya. ‚Äî Izdan—ñe Sobornago Sovuta, Pg., 1918, Book III, p. 57.  Lviv and the speech of General Kornilov  In August 1917, Lviv played an unclear role in the events, associated with the performance of general L. G. Kornilov. At first, he achieved a meeting with Kerensky, on which he offered to get in touch with a group of unnamed public figures, which has \\"real enough power\\", to provide his government with support on the right. Kerensky agreed to this. Then Lvov appeared in the rate of Kornilov and speaking as a representative of Kerensky (which did not give him any instructions), began to talk about the possibility of establishing the dictatorship of Kornilov with the approval of the Provisional Government. In response, Kornilov laid out to him his own terms for accepting dictatorial powers, which were previously discussed with the representative of Kerensky B.V. Savinkov (but without the participation of Lvov). After that, Lviv arrived in Petrograd, where he met again with Kerensky, but already in the capacity of ‚Äútruce‚Äù from Kornilov (which, again, this instruction did not give him), and presented an ultimatum to the prime minister \\"to transfer all power, military and civilian into the hands of the supreme commander\\". At the same time, he added his own assessment of the situation, declaring that Kerensky at the headquarters \\"everyone hates\\" and in the case of his appearance there \\"will surely be killed.\\" All these actions of Lvov led to that Kerensky ordered his arrest as an accomplice of the \\"rebel\\" Kornilov, and the commander himself dismissed (the latter provoked the unsuccessful speech of Kornilov, his arrest and the resignation of the government). There are different versions of the motives for Lvov's actions these days - from deliberate provocation to dislodge Kerensky to an unsuccessful attempt to return to big-time politics. According to Nikita Sokolov, For some time Lviv stayed in the Peter and Paul Fortress, and then was transferred under house arrest.  Activities during the period of civil war and emigration  After the Bolsheviks came to power, Lvov secretly left Petrograd and went to Buguruslansky district of the Samara province, did not live long in Samara. The offensive of the Red Army forced the Lvovs family to go to Siberia, where Vladimir Nikolaevich lived in Tomsk and Omsk, moved away from political activity. At the end of 1919, the Lvovs had to be evacuated further east, and Lvov as a former member of the government, unlike other members of his family, refused to take the American Red Cross wagon. He managed to leave by mail train to Vladivostok, where he emigrated to Tokyo in 1920, and soon moved to France. His family settled in China, and he never saw her again. Already at the end of 1920, Lvov delivered a speech in France demanding to stop helping the white troops of general Peter Wrangel and stated that the support of Wrangel by the French government is illegal. In 1921, he joined the \\"Sverovekhovstvo\\", immigrant movement, advocated the refusal of the fight against the Soviet regime and cooperation with it. In November of the same year, he delivered a report in Paris on the topic \\"Soviet power in the struggle for Russian statehood\\", in which stated that only  Life in the USSR  In 1922, Lvov returned to the USSR, where he became manager of the renovation of the Higher Church Administration. Actively participated in the movement of the renovationists, lectured on the history of the church and the current situation in it, published articles in the Living Church. According to historians Anatoly Krasnov-Levitin and Vadim Shavrov, \\"the same noisy, blatant, self-confident, as he was, V.N.

He was involved in editing articles for the forthcoming edition of the \\"Revival and development of industry, trade and finance of the USSR\\". G. M. Katkov writes in his fundamental research \\"The February Revolution\\": In February 1927, he was arrested along with other employees of the publishing cooperative \\"Iskra\\" on charges of \\"economic counterrevolution.\\" By order of the board of the OGPU on April 29, 1927, he was exiled to Siberia for three years \\"with the remaining in one of the provincial cities.\\" He served a link in Tomsk, was released in September 1929, but stayed in residence in this city. Then he was again arrested and died in the Tomsk Prison Hospital \\"from a decline in cardiac activity.\\" A number of reference books claim, that he passed away in 1934, however, researchers of the history of the Lvov clan A.

Command rank flags to denote the commander-in-chief of the English fleet and later Royal Navy were used from as early as 1189. Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy were established during the Elizabethan era to subdivide the fleet into three squadrons or more. There were three classes of admirals and later a fourth that were differentiated by using coloured flags red, white and blue. History File:Royal Arms of England (1154-1189).svgArms of the Kingdom of England to 1198. File:Royal Arms of England.svgArms of the Kingdom of England to 1199-1340. File:Arms of the Kingdom of France (Ancien).svgArms of the Kingdom of France. The earliest known usage of a command flag being used to denote the Commander-in-Chief of the English Fleet was during the reign of Richard I in 1189 that depicted a single gold lion on a red background. In 1198 it was changed to include three red lions against a red background which are still part of the royal coat arms of England till today. In January 1340 Edward III proclaimed himself King of France and adopted the arms of France then displaying (multiple fleur-de-lis or azure semi-of-fleur-de-lis) in the upper left and the lower right cantons with the arms of England in the upper right and lower left cantons to create a new Royal Standard. In 1411 Henry IV altered the French element of the standard to include just three fleur-de-lis. In June 1340 Edward III commanded the English fleet at the Battle of Sluys where the kings standard was flown at top of the main masthead this positioning of the only command flag used during that battle was later reserved for use by monarchs or his deputy commander the Lord Admiral. In 1495 Henry VII authorized the use of his standard during the expeditions of John Cabot. In 1530 Henry VIII instructed Sir Thomas Audley to create a set of instructions that made clear which command flags are to be flown onboard ships and by whom at this time a single command flag was to be used at the top of the masthead. Audley produced the book of instructions called the Book of Orders for the War by Sea and Land. Between 1545 and 1547 Lord Lisle under instructions from the King altered Audley's instructions this time to denote three squadron commanders as follows. > The Lord Admiral shall fly the royal standard at the top of the main > masthead and the flag of the cross of Saint George at the top of fore > (front) masthead displaying two flags every ship in his squadron the > captains were to fly a single Saint Georges flag at the top of the main > masthead. The Admiral of the Van or (Vice-Admiral) of the front squadron > flew two flags of Saint George one at the top of the main masthead center > and the other at the top of the front masthead. All captains of ships in his > squadron fly a single cross of Saint George at the top of the fore masthead. > The Admiral of the Wyng or (Rear-Admiral) of the rear squadron to display > two flags of Saint George one at the top of the main masthead center and the > other at the top of the mizzenmast or rear mast head. All captains of ships > in his squadron fly a single cross of Saint George at the top of the rear > masthead. From 1545, the Council of the Marine debated that it was necessary to identify which ship carried an admiral, and this achieved by flying the St. George Cross flag from the mizzen mast. When English fleets became larger flags started to become used as signals of a squadron to which a particular ship belonged to, this was initially done by flying a flag on either the foremast, or the mizzen mast or the top mast. The royal standards were used to identify which senior naval commander was on board. By 1588, only the royal arms, the national flags, and the squadron ensigns (by this time plain red, blue and white flags, for the first, second and third squadrons respectively) were used. The Navy Royal inaugurated squadron colours during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) to subdivide the English fleet into three squadrons. There were three classes of admirals and differentiated by using coloured flags. In 1620 the official Flag ranks of Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rear Admiral were legally established that arose directly out of the organisation of the fleet into three parts.

The first time a specific flag was designed and flown was for the Lord Admiral of England Sir Lord Howard of Effingham on HMS Ark Royal as Commander-in-Chief of the English Fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588. It would not be flown again until 1623 when the Lord Admiral the Duke of Buckingham was given an ensign depicting the admiralty anchor. However it was rarely used for as a command flag for naval operations instead it became the main flag to signify the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office. =Lord Admirals command flags (1545‚Äì1558)= Included: File:Royal Standard of England (1406-1603).svgFirst command Flag of the Lord Admiral of England under Henry VIII, Edward VI (1545-1553) when on board a ship.

In 1596 the expedition for Capture of C√°diz during the Anglo-Spanish War was led by joint commanders styled as \\"Generalls of the Armies by land and sea\\", Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex in command of land forces and Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham in command of naval forces, the English fleet consisted of four squadrons. Their immediate subordinates were Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk as Vice Admiral of the Fleet and Sir Walter Raleigh as Rear Admiral of the Fleet. They both commanded a squadron and had a vice admiral (second-in-command) and rear admiral (third- in-command) subordinate to them. The command flags issued for that expedition are described as following. > The Lord Admiral fly's the royal standard at the main masthead and the flag > of the cross of Saint George at the fore (front).

Perrin (1922) does note indicate what flag rank these officers were suffice to say there was no admiral of the red in existence until 1805 so we must assume they were vice-admirals. =Admirals command flags expedition to attack Cadiz October (1625)= Included: Admiral of the Fleet and Commander-in-Chief's squadron File:Royal Standard of Great Britain (1603-1649).svgAdmiral and C-in-C attack on Cadiz in October/November (1625) was instructed to fly this command flag at the main mast though he was not Lord Admiral.

Of note: A fleet of 100 ships was assembled for the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R√©, France in 1627, this was the only time an English admiral flew the Scottish saltaire as his command flag. Standardization of command flags after (1627 to 1649) From 1628 following the creation of the Board of Admiralty and the post of Lord Admiral placed in abeyance the Royal Standard was not used thereafter as the command flag at sea for a Commander-in-Chief of the English Navy. The Lord High Admirals office was revived only two more times after this date in 1702 and in 1828 with the office holders functioning in an administrative capacity. = Flag officers small fleets = Included: File:Flag of Great Britain (1707‚Äì1800).svgThe senior admiral to fly the union flag main mast unless he was Lord Admiral in which case the royal standard is flown.

Note: During this period the rest of the commonwealth fleet was divided into nine formations each assigned red, white and blue colours that included plain flags and the coloured ensigns. At the Restoration Previous command flags re- established (1660 to 1702) In 1660 the all previous command flags used during the commonwealth period were changed back to what they were from 1627 to 1649. However during this period we see the introduction of the post of Commodore being initially recognized (though not formally) in November 1674. The Board of Admiralty on the advice of the Navy Board approved the use of the first pendant (later known as a pennant) to denote the command flag of senior officer in charge of a small squadron under a captain as a plain red pendant. The use of the flag became known as The Distinction Pendant to denote a Commander-in-Chief who did not hold flag rank. In January 1684 a proposal was put forward to distinguish two senior officers in a small squadron based on their age difference and relevant naval experience it recommended the issuing of two pendants a plain red of distinction with a white cross for the officer of distinction and a smaller plain red for the officer of the ordinary this separating of two types of commodores would evolve into those of the first class and second class. In 1734 the title of commodore was formally approved by an Order in Council. In 1806 the temporary flag rank of Commodore was to be distinguished by a 'Broad Plain Pennant' of either red, white or blue. The ordinary commodore commanding a ship themselves would have the same coloured pennants but with a single large white ball near the staff. Below for illustrative purpose is what they might have looked like. Note: Perrin (1922) in his descriptions of admirals command flags does not mention the commodore ordinary of the white squadrons pendant in relation to the 1805 changes thus we must assume that as the Red and Blue squadrons officers were changed to large white balls; the white squadron had to have a large red ball.

Changes in command flags from March (1702 to 1864) On 24 March 1702 the First Lord of the Admiralty instructed the Senior Naval Lord Admiral Sir George Rooke and Board of Admiralty to have designed new command flags for flag officers. These would remain in place with some minor changes until 1805 when the rank of Admiral of the Red is introduced and included the following: =Admiral of the Fleet= :Flag of the union flown at main to gallant masthead as his proper flag the union flag was used as a maritime flag in 1606 during the reign of James VI and I (of Scotland 1567-1625, of England and Ireland 1603-1625), though the actual union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland did not occur until 1707, and that with Ireland until 1801.

He spent the twelve Nazi years first in prison and then, after 1940, in a succession of concentration camps, but survived. After 1945 he became a senior party official and author in the German Democratic Republic. Biography = Provenance and early years = Friedrich Wilhelm \\"Fritz\\" Selbmann was born at Lauterbach a small town in the hills to the northeast of Frankfurt. His father worked as a coppersmith. He attended school locally and then in 1915 relocated to work as a miner near Bochum. He also undertook factory work during this period and, in 1916, became a member of the Woodworkers' Union. In 1917 he became a soldier in the First World War, serving in France and Belgium. The next year military defeat quickly degenerated into a series of revolutionary uprisings in German ports and cities, which also spread to army units. In 1918 Selbmann was a member of the soldiers' soviet for his battery. He then joined the workers' and soldiers' soviet in Naumburg and was a member till early in 1920 of \\"Grenzschutz West\\", one of a number of paramilitary \\"Black Reichswehr\\" units made up of former soldiers of the German empire. = Politics = In 1920 he joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany: he then joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1922. Between 1920 and 1924 he undertook a succession of jobs in various places, at one stage working as a miner at Hindenburg in Oberschlesien (as Zabrze had been renamed in 1915). In 1922/23 he was actively involved in opposition to French occupation of the Ruhr region. In 1923 the French authorities took him into \\"protective custody\\". In 1924 Selbmann became organisation leader for the local Communist Party branch in Bottrop. Between 1925 and 1928 he was a local party leader (\\"Gauf√ºhrer\\") in the \\"Alliance of Red Front-Fighters\\" (\\"Roter Frontk√§mpferbund\\" / RFB) in the Ruhr region and a member of the German national leadership with the RFB and of the regional party leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for the Ruhr. He was back in Moscow during 1928/29 when he attended a course of study at the Communist International's \\"Lenin Academy\\" (where he was identified by a party pseudonym as \\"Skowronek\\"). He returned as the party's Trades Union Secretary within the Team Leadership (\\"Bezirklsleitung\\") for the economically crucial Ruhr region. During 1929/30 he also worked as editor in chief of the \\"Ruhrecho\\", a newspaper based in Essen. Within Germany by far the largest state was Prussia, which unlike the other German states still had a large number of provincial parliaments. Provincial parliamentary elections were held on 17 November 1929 and in the heavily industrialised Prussian Rhine Province the Communists won a 12.7% vote share, entitling them to 21 seats in the 163 seat parliament. One of the Communist Party seats went to Fritz Selbmann. Between 1930 and 1932 he served as a member of the Prussian parliament (\\"Landtag\\") itself, taking over a seat vacated through the death in October 1930 of a party comrade. = Crisis years = He combined his membership of the Prussian parliament with other party functions, serving as \\"Polleiter\\" (literally, \\"policy leader\\") with the regional party leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") in Upper Silesia from May 1930. That role ended early in 1931 when he took on the same function with the \\"Bezirksleitung\\" for Saxony which was the party's second largest regional branch, exceeded in importance only by the Greater Berlin region. Meanwhile, national politics were becoming ever more polarised and the national parliament (Reichstag) becoming ever more deadlocked, 1932 was a year of two general elections. The first of these took place in July 1932, and the Communist Party share of the vote increased to more than 14%, equating to 89 seats in a 608-seat parliament. One of those seats went to Fritz Selbmann. He was elected not simply as a \\"list candidate\\", but as a representative of Electoral District 29 (Leipzig). During this period the focus of Selbmann's political energies was on \\"united action by the working class and the triggering of mass struggle against the dangers of fascism\\" (\\"f√ºr die Aktionseinheit der Arbeiterklasse und die Entfaltung des Massenkampfes gegen die faschistische Gefahr\\"). The Communist Party vote share increased further in the November 1932 election and Selbmann retained his Leipzig seat. By contrast, the National Socialist share of the national vote fell back in that election, even though they remained the largest single party in what was by now an extremely fragmented Reichstag. With the parliamentary process still completely deadlocked and increasingly discredited the National Socialists took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. That made political activity (except in support of Nazi policy) illegal, and the authorities quickly became particularly zealous in attending to those with a political past or present that involved the Communist Party. On 7 February 1933 Selbmann was one of the participants at the \\"illegal\\" Sporthaus Ziegenhals meeting, celebrated subsequently (especially during the \\"East German\\" years) as the last meeting held by the German Communist Party leadership before the participants were arrested and killed, or in some cases managed to escape abroad. The focus of Selbmann's (by definition illegal) political work switched to Leipzig which is where, on 11 April 1933, he was arrested. It was around this time that his wife died. Their six-year-old son, who later became a successful author, would grow up with family friends. Selbmann, meanwhile, was held in investigatory custody in Leipzig and Berlin for approximately two and a half years, and then tried at the special People's Court early in November 1935, facing the usual charge under such circumstances of \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (... wegen \\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). He was sentenced to a seven-year jail term. He was held till May 1940 at the Waldheim penitentiary where some or all of his sentence was served in solitary confinement. The sentence having taken account of the time spent in pretrial detention, he was scheduled for release in 1940, but instead he was taken into \\"protective custody\\", and spent the next two years as an inmate at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. At Sachsenhausen there was already a core of communist activists among the inmates who were able (discretely) to welcome another political soulmate. Across Germany, as war deaths took their toll of manpower, administration of daily life in concentration camps was increasingly delegated by the camp guards to trusted inmates; the decisions of \\"friends\\" meant that Selbmann was set to work in the vehicle repair shop of the camp brick making operation where, as he later recalled, the work was \\"not hard or especially dangerous\\". In November 1942, however, he was moved to the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, which supplied labour to local quarries, set in mountains adjacent to the border with what was at that time known as the Sudetenland. According to Selbmann's own recollection the transfer to Flossenb√ºrg involved eighteen prisoners who had been placed in solitary confinement the previous month as a response to their political activities. The move was implemented on the orders of Reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler himself: it represented a punishment \\"for building [Communist] cells in the camp [at Sachsenhausen], organizing revolutionary work, and privileging political prisoners\\". During what turned out to be the final weeks of the war the Flossenb√ºrg camp was closed down and Selbmann was transferred again, this time to Dachau in the suburbs north of Munich. At the end of April 1945, as the authorities raced to clear the concentration camps of their inmates ahead of the arrival of the invading armies, he was sent out on one of the infamous death marches. He managed to escape and made his way back to Leipzig. = Soviet occupation zone = Leipzig had been liberated from Nazi control by United States forces in April 1945, but by that time a different postwar division of Germany had been agreed between the victorious leaders. In July 1945 the Americans pulled back to be replaced by Soviet forces. The central third of what had been Germany was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, to be relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In Leipzig, Fritz Selbmann immediately took on the leadership of the \\"Provisional Central Committee of the Antifascist Bloc\\" (\\"Provisorischen Zentralausschusses des Antifaschistischen Blocks\\"). It is not entirely clear what this involved, but it was in any case only one of several leadership roles within the political structure that came his way, as he joined with like-minded comrades, in the upbeat language of those times, to overcome the destruction of war, develop a national economy and build a socialist future (\\"... beim Aufbau des Sozialismus bedeutende Verdienste erwarben\\"). Another office to which the military authorities appointed him in 1945 was as First Secretary of the Communist Party District Leadership (\\"Kreisleitung\\") for Leipzig. In August 1945 he was appointed president of the Regional Labour Office (\\"... des Landesarbeitsamtes\\") and in September 1945 he was made Regional Vice-president for State Administration in Saxony. In October 1946, as seemingly more long- term political institutions emerged, he was elected a member of the regional parliament (S√§chsischer Landtag), resigning (as his national political responsibilities increased) only on 30 June 1950. Additionally, in December 1946 he was appointed Economics and Planning Minister in the State of Saxony, a position he retained till 1948. (This was part of a tier of government that would cease to exist - formally - by the end of 1952, as an aggressive centralisation of political power took hold.) In April 1946 the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) was successfully launched (if only in Germany's Soviet zone) by means of a contentious political merger which was intended, it was explained, to ensure that political divisions on the left would never again leave the way open for the election to power of a populist right wing political party. It was an irony not lost on western commentators that over the next few years the SED itself became the ruling party in a new kind of one-party German state. During 1946 Fritz Selbmann was one of thousands of Communist Party members who lost no time in signing their party memberships across to the new party. He was a member of the political leadership class: a return to national politics beckoned. In 1948, after stepping down from his regional ministerial position in Saxony, Selbmann moved to (East) Berlin. He was appointed deputy chairman of the German Economic Commission, which can be described as \\"the top administrative body\\" in the Soviet occupation zone. He also enjoyed responsibility during 1948/49 for the \\"National Industrial Department\\" (\\"Hauptverwaltung Industrie\\"). The establishment of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in October 1949 saw the administrative structures in the Soviet occupation zone replaced. Ministers replaced administrators and Vasily Chuikov, till 1949 head of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, became instead head of the People's Control Commission. In some ways the structural changes accompanying the launch of East Germany were more apparent than real. Selbmann was one of several senior administrators who became a government minister. = German Democratic Republic (East Germany) = In the new government Selbmann was appointed Minister for Industry in 1949, and then, as the department was very soon subdivided, Minister for Heavy Industry in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 he served as Minister for Ores Mining and Metallurgy. In 1949 he was also selected for membership of the People's Council (\\"Volksrat\\"), a body mandated to draw up a constitution based on a draft document helpfully provided by the SED. Later that year the People's Council became the People's Parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). Fritz Selbmann served as an SED member of this legislative body between 1949 and 1963. In 1953 Fritz Selbemann headed up the German side in the commission that oversaw the transfer of the final tranche of \\"Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaft\\" businesses to the East German government. This involved around 200 businesses employing approximately 300,000 that the Soviets had requisitioned directly after the war as part of a programme to enforce war reparations, and the 1953 negotiation, concluded shortly after the death of Stalin could be seen as an important step forwards. = 1953 = 1953 was also the year of the East German uprising, and on the afternoon of 16 June 1953 Fritz Selbmann, considered to be more \\"approachable\\" than some of his stony-faced leadership comrades, stood in front of the vast Ministries Building in the Leipziger Stra√üe to undertake discussions with protesters. He displayed considerable courage, walking into the crowd of more than 10,000 angry strikers, and then clambering onto an office desk from which he attempted to address the crowd. However, the protestors were already too worked up for this approach to succeed: even his announcement that the government had withdrawn the previous month's 10% increase in \\"standard production quantities\\" (which was seen to have meant ten per cent more work for the same wages) - one of the issues that had triggered the protests - failed to quell the mood. Selbmann invited his listeners to look at his rough hands, which showed that he was a worker himself (\\"Seht euch meine H√§nde an\\", ruft er der Menge zu, \\"ich bin selber Arbeiter.\\"), but he drew only whistles from those nearest to him. The government needed scapegoats and he had to resign his ministerial post two months later (ostensibly following a serious social indiscretion involving alcohol). The increasingly violent protests that broke out the next day on the streets of East Berlin, and in other industrial centres, threatened to get out of control. A month later, thanks to the fraternal intervention of Soviet tanks and troops, control had been restored. = Central Committee = It soon became clear that Fritz Selbmann's career at the heart of East Germany's political establishment was far from over. The country's constitutional structure had been imported from the Soviet Union after 1945, and under the centralised Leninist system power lay not with government ministries and certainly not with any parliament. Power was concentrated on the Central Committee of the ruling party. The stark reality was to some extent masked by the extent to which members of the Central Committee often found time to serve as government ministers and/or as members of parliament in combination with their Central Committee membership. In 1954 Fritz Selbmann joined the Central Committee. He also served, between 1955 and 1958, as a deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers and, within the presidium of the Ministerial Council, as Chairman of the Commission for Industry and Transport. During 1957/58 he also served as Chairman of the \\"Commission for Technical Progress\\" within the Central Committee's technical section. = Beyond peak career = Selbmann lost his Central Committee membership and the other offices in 1958. (He continued to be listed as a candidate for Central Committee membership, however.) At the party conference in February 1958 he was accused by Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker of \\"managerialism\\" (\\"Managertums\\") and a \\"deviant attitude\\" (\\"abweichender Haltung\\"). The attack came in the context of a wider rift in the party which broke open at that time. Selbmann was accused of having supported the so-called Schirdewan-Wollweber-Ziller faction, at the party conference at which it became clear that the East German leader Walter Ulbricht had changed his mind about implementing a barely perceptible introduction of certain elements of a free market economy into the East German system. He also received a \\"strong reprimand\\" from the Central Committee. This time the fall from grace was permanent and on 9 March 1959 Fritz Selbmann felt it necessary to publish a \\"self-criticism\\". Between 1958 and 1961 Selbmann was employed as a Deputy Chairman in the National Planning Commission, a large and amorphous government agency. The nature of his duties is unclear but those sources that mention this part of his career indicate that the job was an inconsequential one. He was also made head of the Department for Recording and Allocating the Means of Production. He served between 1961 and 1964 as the first chairman of the People's Economic Council (\\"Volkswirtschaftsrat\\" / VWR ) which was created in 1961 (and dissolved/replaced as part of a reorganisation that took place in 1965). = After politics = \\"Die Lange Nacht\\" (\\"The long night\\"), generally regarded as Selbamnn's first novel, was published in 1961. After 1964 he is recorded as a freelance author/novelist, based in East Berlin. He also served between 1969 and 1975 as a vice-president of the (East) German Writers' Association. Along with a number of novels, which enjoyed modest success on the domestic market in their day, there was an autobiography, \\"Acht Jahre und ein Tag. Bilder aus den Gr√ºnderjahren der DDR\\" (\\"Eight years and one day. Images from the foundation years of the German Democratic Republic\\"). This included some trenchant, hitherto little publicised, insights into the events of June 1953. That may be why this book remained unpublished in Selbmann's lifetime, only appearing in 1999, nearly ten years after the social, economic and then political changes that put an end to the stand-alone German Democratic Republic.

It was built from 1837 to 1850. It is also known as Hartley Historic Site and Hartley Township. The property is owned and protected by Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Hartley Valley was first crossed by Europeans during Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson's famous expedition of 1813. Settlement of the region extended during the 1820s and in 1832 Major Mitchell's new line of western road down Victoria Pass took the Bathurst Road through the Hartley area. Soon a town was proposed and, with large numbers of convicts working in the area, the need for a government detention and judicial centre was recognised (at that time no such place existed in all the country between the Nepean River and ). Consequently in 1837 a courthouse was erected at Hartley and the following year the town plan was gazetted. Hartley grew as both a government administrative centre and also as a wayside service centre, it being an important stopping point on the western road to Bathurst and further inland. The railway arrived in the region late in the 1860s and while it led to the growth of places like Lithgow, Hartley declined owing to the reduction in road traffic. Late in the nineteenth century Hartley began to be recognised as a place of historic attraction and the village began to prosper also as a result of the passing tourist traffic to Jenolan Caves. During the interwar period motor car tourism played a particularly significant part in Hartley's history. After the World War II, however, improvements in vehicles and the highway saw a decline as increasing numbers of tourists travelled through town without stopping. During the 1960s and 1970s Blaxland Shire Council acquired many Hartley buildings. In 1972 the Hartley Historic Site was declared under the administration of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. =Structures on the historic site= The courthouse was designed by Colonial Architect, Mortimer Lewis in 1837. St John's Anglican Church, built in 1858-59, was designed by leading Colonial Ecclesiastical Architect, Edmund Blacket. St Bernard's Catholic Church, ,a NPWS post-card gives the date of 1842. and the adjacent presbytery, , reflect Hartley's substantial Irish population in the nineteenth century. The church, Gothic in style, was designed by Alexander Binning. The first mass celebrated in Hartley was by the Rev. Michael Cavanagh, who decided in 1838 that a church should be built to serve the large population of Irish Catholic settlers in the area. Its first priest was Father Dunphy, appointed in 1843. The Royal Hotel dates from the late 1840s and at one time functioned as the Anglican Rectory and as a school. An NPWS post-card states it was built in 1846 and first licensed as the \\"Hartley\\" Hotel by James Nairn. In the 1850s-70s it served as a Cobb & Co staging post for coaches en route between Sydney, Bathurst and Mudgee. Farmers Inn was built by John Finn around 1845-46. The Finn family was significant in Hartley's history, for the family also built the post office (which family members ran for fifty eight years), Ivy Cottage and Old Tralee. Farmers Inn was licensed from about the 1860s until 1895. The Shamrock Inn was built in the mid 1840san undated NPWS post card says 1850s. and occupied as a residence by the Phillips family for a lengthy period. It catered for the needs of the men and women en route to and from the gold fields of Hill End, and the Turon workings.NPWS post card, undated Hartley's former post office was constructed between 1845 and 1852. When the building closed in 1982 it was said to be the longest operating post office in Australia. Old Tralee, named after the Finns' family home in Ireland, was erected between 1846 and 1854. In 1839 John and Mary Finn and their eight children arrived in Australia from Ireland. They set out straight away for Hartley, where they built Old Tralee. Their home town rector had no doubt encouraged their migration with news of his son's progress as Magistrate in Hartley. In 2016 St. Bernard's Presbytery, after major internal restoration now hosts overnight stay guests, along with nearby Old Tralee, for the first time.Lithgow Mercury, 24 June 2016, 4.  Description  Hartley historic site is located on a steep slope above the River Lett. The immediate surrounding country is cleared though the higher country above is timbered. A range of exotic trees are found in the town. The village with its pervasive nineteenth century character has strong aesthetic qualities. Today Hartley remains as a highly intact nineteenth century village. Hartley consists of a fine array of government, church, hotel and residential buildings, displaying a range of forms, materials and styles (several of the following are registered individually). ;The Courthouse Built 1837 in sandstone and a very good example of Old Colonial Greek architectural style, designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis. Its facade is dominated by its pedimented entrance porch with pilasters and columns. ;St John's Anglican Church Built in Victorian Gothic style. A modest yet harmonious church, St John's is built of sandstone and the roof, originally shingle (as were most in the village), is clad with corrugated iron. (privately owned) ;St Bernard's Catholic Church Built is Gothic in style and built of sandstone. Windows are paired lancets with stone mullions. The presbytery is built of sandstone and granite and is single storey on an above ground basement, with a steeply pitched hipped roof. Fluted timber posts support the verandah roof and carved stone pilasters flank the French doors and main front door. ;St. Bernard's Presbytery Built of sandstone in the Georgian style. ;The Royal Hotel Built in 1846 as a single storey, Victorian Georgian hotel of sandstone and the attic floor has several dormers. Fluted timber posts (paired either side of the main door) support the verandah. ;Farmers Inn Built is a single storey, roughcast rendered brick building with a gable and skillion roof, and a verandah with end rooms (which were fairly typical of early inns). ;The Shamrock Inn Built An undated NPWS post card says early 1850s in three stages, the former inn reflects several vernacular building techniques. External walls are brick and there is a slab skillion at the rear. Internal walls are slab and some have lathe and plaster or hessian lining. Original shingles remain under the corrugated iron on both the verandah and main gabled roofs. The verandah also features some pitsawn timber. ;Hartley's former post office Built 1846, consists of a central gabled rendered brick section with skillion wings at either end. ;Old Tralee Built 1846-54 has brick walls, a hipped iron roof (with shingles beneath) and various pit sawn timbers. ;Ivy Cottage Dates from some time between the late 1850s and the early 1870s. Standing on a granite rubble footing, the cottage has brick walls, sandstone front steps, a verandah and a shallow pitched roof which is gabled at the front. ;Brick toilet Built of brick in vernacular style. ;Woolshed Built of galvanised iron and timber in vernacular style ;Corney/Morgan garage Built with modern asbestos cement and galanised iron. ;Timber cottage Built s of rustic timber. ;Concrete block cottage Built s of rustic concrete block construction ;Garage residence Built 1920s in timber vernacular style.  Heritage listing  As at 7 April 2015, Hartley is historically highly significant for its close association with early settlement west of the Blue Mountains, for its role as an early government administrative centre and for its having been a wayside service centre over a lengthy period. The village has an extremely high level of intactness and it contains a rich range of building forms, materials and architectural styles. Having been recognised for many years as a place of historical importance, Hartley has significant social associations among the travelling public. Hartley contains good examples of the work of important colonial era architects, Mortimer Lewis and Edmund Blacket. Owing to the form, materials, styles and alignments of its various buildings and its rural setting above the River Lett, Hartley with its pervasive mid nineteenth century character has significant aesthetic qualities. Hartley historic site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Pupils in Years 11 to 14 enjoy the benefits of a very close collaborative arrangement with Ballycastle High School, which enables both schools to offer a greater choice and a broad, balanced curriculum. In 2018, 71.7% of its entrants achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including the core subjects English and Maths. Also in 2018, 75.9% of its entrants to the A-level exam achieved A*-C grades. in 2019 the school was ranked 9th out of 159 secondary schools in Northern Ireland with 89.1% of its A-level students who sat the exams in 2017/18 being awarded three A*-C grades. Developments Following increasing collaboration between the college and Ballycastle High School, there are now plans for a shared campus. Currently, in excess of 300 pupils from both schools share lessons on a weekly basis. The schools share much of the curriculum at Key Stage 4 & 5\\\\. Pupils from both schools have a Joint Student Council which meets regularly.

It was based in San Francisco and published weekly. The newspaper became a vital part in promoting nationalism amongst Korean immigrant communities and spreading news on the issue of Korean independence. It would be the most influential and longest lasting newspaper for Korean Immigrants in the US.News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media, p. 177 History Nine days after the formal establishment of the KNA on February 1, 1909, the organization launched a newspaper which they would name Sinhan Minbo or The New Korea in English. It would replace the first Korean language paper Konglip Sinbo(The United Korean) and its competing paper, Taedong Kongbo (The New Korean World). As the main organ of the organization, it aimed to revitalize the spirit and commitment of all Korean People towards its goals. It was funded by the Mutual Assistance Society, one of two key organizations that merged to form the KNA. Its publication location was near the KNA's Headquarters in San Francisco, and weekly circulation was approximately 3000, with 700 to 800 distributed throughout the mainland US, 500 to 600 distributed throughout Hawaii, 300 to 400 throughout Mexico, and the rest throughout Siberia and Manchuria.The Quest for Statehood: Korean Immigrant Nationalism and U.S. Sovereignty, 1905-1945 p. 42 Although it initially influenced readers in some parts of Korea in its first year, it was rarely distributed there after 1910 due to censorship following Japan's annexation of Korea. At its peak, it had 33 outlets, including a sales outlet located in Siberia. The first publisher and editor was Choi Jung Ik until May 14, 1910, when Lee Hwan- woo took his place. Lee Hwan-woo attempted to establish an English-language column but poor management resulted in Choi Jung-ik taking charge of editing once again. Despite some management issues in its first few years, improvements were made on March 11, 1915, when KNA member Lee Daewi invented the first Korean typesetting machines to print the newspapers. The title of the newspaper was written on the map of Korea with its name ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôSinhan Minbo‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô in Chinese characters (Hanja) \\"Êñ∞ÈüìÊ∞ëÂ†±\\". In 1925, a new design with Korean letters (Hangul)„ÖÖ„Ö£„Ñ¥„Öé„Öè„Ñ¥„ÖÅ„Ö£„Ñ¥„ÖÇ„Öó (Ïã†ÌïúÎØºÎ≥¥) was developed but only lasted until 1929 when it returned to its original design once again. Like other Korean newspapers of its time, it employed vertical writing and was read from right to left. Sinhan Minbo offices, San Francisco The articles between 1910 and World War II were mainly related to Korean liberation, but also included social and political issues of Koreans living abroad. In its first issue, it explained that as a newspaper for an organization representing all Koreans, it promises that compared with the previous two Korean language newspapers, it would provide a broader scope of news and impartial views.The Quest for Statehood: Korean Immigrant Nationalism and U.S. Sovereignty, 1905-1945 p. 42 In the same year of its establishment, the independence activist Park Yong-man began a year of journalism work there and would publish an article titled \\"On a Universal Draft System, \\" which stressed that military service for Korean liberation was a patriotic duty. Between 1937 and 1946, Sinhan Minbo reserved the fourth page for an English section edited by the Young Korean National Association (YKNA). The articles mainly targeted younger readers, especially second generation Korean Americans. From 1937 to 1940, the independence activist Philip Jaisohn contributed to English columns such as ‚ÄúMy Days in Korea‚Äù and ‚ÄúRandom Thoughts‚Äù. During the year when the March 1st Movement took place, the newspaper began publishing every two days in order to quickly update domestic news to Korean Americans. After that year, it returned to publishing weekly until September 1974, when it was acquired by Kim Un Ha and published monthly in Los Angeles.

The bridges were designed by engineering staff of the New South Wales Government Railways and built in 1870 by day labour. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  By the early 1900s the original single track from Bowenfels to Wallerawang was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves. A major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at Homebush and mostly in the form of brick arch culverts and viaducts. The quantity of bricks used in the programme was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \\"era of the brick arch\\". Normally the clear span would have been bridged by a simple steel plate web girder, but the shortage of steel meant a continuance of brick arch construction. The Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after World War I. This bridge is easily accessible via Springvale Lane which is off the Mudgee Road, south-east of the Wallerawang Power Station.  Description  The bridge is a significant technical accomplishment. It has seventeen stone arch spans totalling and is the longest masonry arch bridge ever built in Australia. Its main span of is also large, being the fifth longest of its type for its age (1870). It is also unusual in having an elliptical arch rib. The main span is flanked by stone buttresses or columns which extend above the deck. The treatment of the spandrel is unusual in that the radial joints of the arch rib are extended out to fill the entire spandrel space The bridge is thus an integral part of a section of the New South Wales rail system of immense historical significance.Register of the National Estate. The brick double track underbridge over Coxs River, 1923. The bridge retains its original fabric.  Heritage listing  As at 15 March 2006, this 1870 bridge is significant because it is one the oldest stone arch railway viaducts in New South Wales. It is associated with John Whitton the \\"father of New South Wales railways\\", it is an impressive sandstone structure on the outskirts of historic Wallerawang, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to Bathurst and on to western New South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works, particularly for the Zig Zag east of Lithgow and the extension west to Wallerawang. It is the largest of Whitton's stone arch viaducts. It is a fine representative example of a stone arch railway viaduct and it retains its original fabric. Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This bridge is part of the Bowenfels to Wallerawang duplication, the last of such works dominated by brick arch construction. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The duplication work contributed significantly to the railway extension to Bathurst and to the continued development of Western New South Wales, for land transport to Sydney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The brick arch was still the most common form of railway bridge in the early 1920s due to the shortage of steel after World War I. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is a good representative example of brick arch construction.

The division began its history as the 13th Tank Corps of the Red Army, formed in April 1942 during World War II and fought in the Soviet counterattack against Case Blue, the Battle of Voronezh, and the Battle of Stalingrad. The corps lost so many tanks that it was reorganized with a mechanized corps structure in November, though it retained the 13th Tank Corps designation. For its actions the corps became the 4th Guards Mechanized Corps in early 1943 and received the Stalingrad honorific. It continued to fight in combat for most of the rest of the war, receiving the Order of the Red Banner for its role in the Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog Offensive of early 1944, the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class for its actions in the Odessa Offensive, and the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class for its actions in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive. In the final months of the war the corps advanced into Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and southern Czechoslovakia before being withdrawn into the reserve. Several weeks after the end of the war, the corps was converted into the 4th Guards Mechanized Division and based at Sofia. In the late 1940s it was withdrawn to Ukraine, and was based at Lugansk by the time it became the 63rd Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1957. It was renumbered as the 4th Guards Motor Rifle Division to preserve its traditions in 1964, and was sent to Termez during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War to replace a division deployed to the latter. When it returned to Lugansk in 1989, the division was reduced to a storage base, which was disbanded in 1991.  World War II  The corps was formed during April and May 1942 in the Stalingrad Military District as the 13th Tank Corps, under the command of Major General Pyotr Shurov. It included the 65th, 85th, and 88th Tank Brigades as well as the 20th Motor Rifle Brigade and support units. The corps saw its first combat on 10 June in the area of Prikolotnoye southwest of Kupiansk as part of the Southwestern Front. During June and July the corps was part of the 28th Army, then transferred to the 21st Army to participate in the Battle of Voronezh (the Voronezh‚ÄìVoroshilovgrad Operation). Shruov was mortally wounded in July and replaced by Colonel Trofim Tanaschishin, who would be promoted to major general on 7 December 1942 and to lieutenant general on 30 August 1943. On 23 July 1942 it was transferred to the Stalingrad Front, with which it fought in the Battle of Stalingrad.

Identification symbol painted on vehicles of the corps' 36th Guards Tank Brigade Transferred to the 3rd Ukrainian Front in mid-January 1944, the corps was attached to the 8th Guards Army for the Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog Offensive. Between 16 and 18 January it was relocated to support a breakthrough of the flanks on the 46th and 8th Guards Armies, with the objective of capturing the critical rail junction of Apostolovo to link up with forces of the 4th Ukrainian Front and cut off German troops in the Nikopol bridgehead. During the offensive, it helped to capture Nikopol and Apostolovo, earning it the Order of the Red Banner for its \\"exemplary completion of combat missions\\" and \\"valor and courage\\" on 13 February 1944. The 4th Guards Mechanized was attached to a Cavalry Mechanized Group commanded by Lieutenant General Issa Pliyev for the subsequent Bereznegovatoye‚ÄìSnigeryovka and Odessa Offensives. For helping to capture Odessa among other objectives during the latter, the corps was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, on 20 April. Among the corps personnel posthumously awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title for their actions in these operations were tank commanders and Junior Lieutenants Boris Grebennikov and Vadim Sivkov, and gunner and radio operator Ryadovoy Pyotr Krestyaninov. Tanaschishin was also killed in action during the Odessa Offensive at the end of March and replaced by Major General Vladimir Zhdanov, who commanded it for the rest of the war and was promoted to Lieutenant General on 13 September. Tankers of the corps preparing for an attack in Romania, 1944 A Soviet tank crew discussing plans during the Budapest Offensive Attacking in conjunction with the 7th Mechanized and 18th Tank Corps during the August Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, the corps reached the area of Hu»ôi and Leova to encircle and destroy a large Axis group of eighteen divisions. For this action it received the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, on 7 September. In early September the corps swept southward into Bulgaria, then west during the Belgrade Offensive to capture the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on 20 October. For their actions in the latter 214 corps personnel received Yugoslav decorations, and Zhdanov was made a Hero of Yugoslavia. The corps was transferred to the 2nd Ukrainian Front in late October, and served with it until February 1945. The corps was successively attached to the 46th Army from 1 November, Cavalry-Mechanized Group Pliev from 28 November, the 6th Guards Tank Army from 23 December, and the 7th Guards Army from 26 January 1945 during the Budapest Offensive. It saw its last combat action during the advance into southern Czechoslovakia on the Hron north of Esztergom, and in late February was withdrawn into the front reserve. The corps then transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command on 15 April, in which it ended the war. For their actions during the war, 16,500 personnel of the corps were decorated, while nineteen others were made Heroes of the Soviet Union.  Postwar  The 4th Guards Mechanized Corps was converted into the 4th Guards Mechanized Division in June 1945; its three mechanized brigades and one tank brigade were likewise converted into regiments with the same numbers. By that time, the division was a separate division of the Southern Group of Forces. It became part of the 10th Mechanized Army when that force was formed in June 1946 while stationed at Sofia. It briefly became part of the Special Mechanized Army there on 20 December 1947, but was withdrawn to the Kiev Military District in early 1948, joining the 14th Guards Rifle Corps. On 4 June 1957 it was redesignated as the 63rd Guards Motor Rifle Division. At the same time, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Guards Mechanized Regiments became the 365th, 367th, and 15th Guards Motor Rifle Regiments, respectively, while the 36th Guards Tank Regiment was renumbered as the 304th Guards. That year, the division became part of the 6th Guards Tank Army, whose headquarters had recently been transferred to the district. In the Kiev Military District the division was stationed at Lugansk by 1957 and renumbered as the 4th Guards Motor Rifle Division to restore its World War II number on 17 November 1964. Its Stalingrad honorific was removed in 1961 and replaced with Volgograd to reflect the name change of that city on 29 September 1964. By 1965, the division was directly subordinated to the district headquarters. It was transferred to Termez and directly subordinated to the Turkestan Military District headquarters during February 1980, replacing the 108th Motor Rifle Division, which had been sent to fight in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. The division left behind the 15th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, which was used to form the 46th Motor Rifle Division at Lugansk, part of the new 64th Army Corps. The 15th Guards were replaced by the newly formed 1213th Motor Rifle Regiment at Termez. When the 4th Guards returned to Lugansk in March 1989 after the 108th returned to Termez when the Soviet Army withdrew from Afghanistan, the 46th Motor Rifle Division disbanded that same month, followed by the 64th Army Corps in July. Later that year, the division itself was reduced to the 5197th Guards Weapons and Equipment Storage Base, where nearly 40 vehicles ‚Äì 26 R-145BM, 3 R-156BTR, 3 PRP-3, 2 BMP-1KSh, 3 1V18, 1 1V19, and 1 UR-67 ‚Äì were stored; the base was disbanded in March 1991.

Born in Elgin, Paterson followed his father in becoming a joiner. He completed an apprenticeship, and then moved to Edinburgh to find work. He joined the Associated Carpenters and Joiners of Scotland union, and was soon elected as branch secretary. In 1867, Paterson was elected as general secretary of the union. He adopted a militant approach, and this led to increased wages and reduced hours for members of the union. As a result, the union's membership increased, and it survived a recession in the late 1870s. Paterson was active in the campaign for universal male enfranchisement; he was the main organiser of a demonstration in Edinburgh in 1866, and was secretary of the city's branch of the Reform League for the following year. He stood for Edinburgh Town Council's Canongate ward in 1870, as a Liberal-Labour candidate, coming only fifty votes behind his opponent. He moved to Glasgow in 1875, when the headquarters of the union were transferred there. From 1881 to 1883, he also served on the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. In 1883, Paterson stood down as leader of the union to become the first working-class factory inspector in Scotland. However, he had long held an interest in fire safety and, at the end of 1884, he instead became superintendent of the Glasgow Fire Brigade. The brigade expanded significantly under his leadership, with six new fire stations, about ninety additional staff, and much new equipment. The Glasgow Herald state that: \\"Among the men under his charge he was very popular. He was a strict disciplinarian, insisted on sedulous attention to duty, but he did everything in his power to provide for the comfort of the staff, nor did he neglect to consider the necessity for facilities for healthful exercise, relaxation and amusement in the laying out of the stations which he had erected\\". In 1903, he was a founder of the Association of Professional Fire Brigade Officers of the British Empire, and he served as its president for the first two years. Paterson's health declined during 1906, but he appeared to recover following an operation in July. In December, he attended a fire in person, but he caught a cold and died less than two weeks later.

It was in operation from 1 March 1884 to December 1977. Establishment Before the nineteenth century, water supplies in Wanstead were from wells and pumps, but in 1857 The East London Waterworks Company extended its water main to Wanstead, though the supply was far from adequate in the early years. Increasing pollution and awareness of its supposed connection with disease, notably typhoid fever and diphtheria, led to public pressure for the establishment of sewage treatment facilities. Two hundred acres of the land belonging to Aldersbrook Manor and farm had already been sold in 1853 to become the City of London Cemetery, and the local board bought an area to the north of this for the establishment of Wanstead Sewage Works. Access to the sewage works site was from the west, via a road that became Empress Avenue in the early twentieth century when houses were built. The original works were shown on an 1894 Ordnance Survey map as a \\"sewage farm\\". The treatment process The original sewage treatment process, described in some detail in October 1884 (a few months after the works opened), was as follows. Incoming sewage was screened and then held in settlement tanks. From here the liquid was passed onto the surface of land which had been specially prepared with under-drainage at an average depth of eight feet. The sewage gradually percolated through the soil into the under drains, and from these the purified liquid, described as \\"clear and bright\\", was released into the River Roding. The sludge from the tanks was run into a sludge bed, and periodically this was dug out and ploughed as manure into land more than a quarter of a mile from the river, in order to minimise the risk of it causing river pollution. Closure and subsequent changes The works operated until December 1977, after which it became derelict, controlled by the Thames Water Authority, and then the site passed to the Department of Transport in the 1980s for use as \\"exchange\\" land for road building and improvement which would affect Epping Forest. In July 1993 they offered two areas totalling about twenty acres to Epping Forest and some landscaping work was undertaken; eleven acres of this was in exchange for forest land used for the M11 link road. In 2007, a borehole was drilled in the remaining portion of the site to extract water from an aquifer about 80 metres underground. Cycle paths and horse riding have also been facilitated through the area.

Description and history The Mead Avenue area was farmland until the 1830s, when William Mead created one of Greenwich's first residential subdivisions, laying out Mead Avenue with half-acre lots. The area was well located, between the commercial centers of Mianus and Cos Cob, which dominated the town's commerce prior to the arrive (in 1848) of the railroad. Despite its good location, only one house was built in the subdivision before the 1860s: the Greek Revival house at 33 Mead Avenue. Before the start of the American Civil War, three more houses were built, all Italianate houses that were built for ship captains. Construction later in the 19th century included houses in River Road which were used primarily as summer residences.

Jerome Baker Designs had been a leading cannabis glass company throughout the 1990s and early 2000s prior to the arrest. The company was founded by Jason Harris, who started his career in glassblowing in 1991 by apprenticing with Bob Snodgrass. Since then, Harris has created blown glass artwork for celebrities, rock stars and sports figures, including celebrity rapper Snoop Dogg, for whom Jerome Baker teamed up with Nastee Glass to produce a $18,000 nug jug capable of holding one pound of cannabis flower.

It was built from 1884 to 1895 by George Raffan and Alexander Currie. It is also known as Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns Precinct, Portland Cement Works Site, Williwa Street Portland. The property is owned by Boral Limited. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 August 2012.  History  = Aboriginal people and colonisation = Aboriginal occupation of the Blue Mountains area dates back at least 12,000 years and appears to have intensified some 3000‚Äì4000 years ago. In pre-colonial times the region around Portland was inhabited by Aboriginal people of the Wiradjuri linguistic group.NBRS&P;, 9 European settlement in this region after the first documented white expedition west of the Blue Mountains in 1813 was tentative, largely because of concerns about resistance from Aboriginal people. There was contact, evidenced by sporadic hostility and by the quantity of surviving artefacts manufactured by the Aborigines from European glass. By 1840 there was widespread dislocation of Aboriginal culture, aggravated after 1850 by the gold rush to the region.HO and DUAP, 1996, 88. Jack Reed, a long-time resident of Portland, recalls how, as a child in the 1930s, he used to go hunting with two Aboriginal men named Jack and Jimmy. He estimated their birthdates as c.1890 and their visits to Portland as quite frequent. As part of the day these men would visit rock engravings (since removed) but never allow Jack to go near them. Neither spoke much English and both hunted with spears and boomerangs. While staying at Portland they camped close to the dam near the Portland Golf Course. Jack also remembers occasional groups of Aboriginal people coming to Portland to hold corroborees for the town's people.NBRS&P;, 10 The National Parks & wildlife Service register lists 19 Aboriginal sites in the immediate area of Portland, typically rock shelters or expanses of rock with archaeological deposits and sometimes with art and / or axe-grinding grooves, open sites with scatters of stone artefacts and carved trees. In 1982 two sites containing scatterings of stone artefacts were discovered in East Portland during an archaeological survey of the Ivanhoe Colliery for Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd but these sites were not conserved for various reasons. There have been no Aboriginal sites associated with the Portland Cement Works and Quarries Site. =Portland and cement manufacture in Australia= In 1824 \\"Portland Cement\\" had been developed in England by Joseph Aspdin, who named it after a pale grey coloured rock associated with Portland, England. Portland Cement is made by mixing limestone with either clay or shale in the right proportions and then burning the mixture at , a point at which the mixture begins to fuse.GML, 2005 The resulting clinker is then ground to produce cement. Portland Cement was a far superior building product and it caught on quickly in Europe and especially Germany but was infrequently used in Australia before the end of the 19th century.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993 There is a reference in Australia that locates the earliest experiments with Portland Cement at the Portland site in NSW in 1884 by the Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company.NBRS&P;, 2003, 17 In 1863 Thomas Murray first used the Portland site for lime extraction and production. During the 1880s, Currie and Raffan with others bought Portion 52 and formed the Cullen Bullen Lime & Marble Works. By 1889, the Cullen Bullen Lime & Marble Works had become the Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company and was producing Portland cement under the brand name of \\"Kangaroo\\". The cement was of variable quality and intermittent and production ceased in 1895. The only remnants of cement production from this era are the two bottle kilns in the north-west corner of Portion 52 and the old brick building known as 'Raffan's Mill'. In 1895 the Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company failed and was taken over by one of the original partners, George Raffan and his brother John, who opened the Ivanhoe Lime and Cement Works & Colliery. In 1898 the Ivanhoe Lime and Cement Works & Colliery also failed. In 1899 these pioneering industrialists sold out to the (British-owned) New Zealand Mines Trust through their agent Dr August Scheidel who bought the land, plant and leases. Scheidel, who \\"is considered the father of the modern cement industry in Australia\\", was born in Heidelberg and had received his PhD from Freiberg University in 1880. He obtained backing for an investment of ¬£100,000 to build a cement production plant, which became the most successful cement manufacturing plant in Australia, and of which he remained Managing Director until 1918.Fenwick & Holmes, 1993, 7-9, NBRS&P;, 2003, 17 The Cullen Bullen Lime & Cement Company plants on the Portland site used eight static charge (bottle-shaped) kilns with millstone grinding, powered by a small steam plant. As high temperatures were necessary, the open end was of small diameter and chimney-shaped to conserve heat and to induce greater draught through the kiln. Layers of limestone, shale and timber were hand-packed in each kiln, leaving space for a flue. The doors were then sealed and the kilns fired. The resulting batch of clinker was then removed. Two of these early bottle kilns - built of brick with iron ties and turnbuckles- and the milling plant in the north west corner of Portion 52 stand as historical monuments to the beginning of the cement industry in NSW. =Timeline for Raffans Mill and the Bottle Kilns at the Portland Cement Works Site= *12,000 BC onwardsKnown Aboriginal occupation of this region. *1828MacPherson family took up a grant of and then another in 1832.

Also rare, the mill consists of three separate areas and appears to have been part of a larger complex. The building dimensions are long, wide and high to the peak of the gable. The roof and half of the northern wall are sheeted with galvanised corrugated iron with all other walls being thick brick laid in English bond. The western side of the building has three large hinged door openings, with the northern end having been utilised as a general store. The southern end was once used as a blacksmiths shop. Internally there is evidence of a mezzanine level supported by timber beams, with windows and a number of unidentified operational openings having been bricked up. Through the southern wall, extends a shaft-driven system of wooden toothed gear wheels and four diameter Burr Stone Grinding Mills. The millstone grinding plant was installed between 1889 and 1895 to grind the cement clinker from the bottle kilns. It is of cast iron with three granite millstones. The large gear wheels have removable timber cogs held in place by pegs. Originally the plant was connected by belt to a small steam engine which no longer remains. Some surrounding structure have also gone.Lithgow LEP listing, 1980 Together these groups stand as historical monuments to the beginning of the cement industry in NSW. This group has been classified by the National Trust and also forms a focus of the local LEP heritage listing. The Fenwick & Holmes 1993 study and the NBRS&P; 2003 study all agree that this group is of State significance as an intact remnant of in situ nineteenth century industrial technology. Old milling machinery = Condition = As at 5 May 2005, the grinding plant is in good condition although exposed to the weather. Since most of the connecting structures have gone, a scheme to protect the plant would help its conservation. The remnant standing remains of the Raffan's Mill are in reasonable condition, with the shaft driven wooden-toothed gear system exposed to the elements. Some surface rust is apparent and the wooden gears need protection. Both Brick Bottle Kilns display signs of wear and exposure, but also remain in reasonable condition. One kiln is in good condition and one has lost some bricks from its top conical section. Cracks are apparent between some brick courses while grass and small shrubs are growing from the upper levels Both the Raffan's Mill building and the Brick Bottle Kilns have lost much of their surrounding infrastructure that was part of the nineteenth century complex. However, the remaining mill and two Bottle Brick Kilns display a relatively high level of integrity and their association to each other and the surrounding landscape remains clear. = Further information = Both Raffan's mill and the Brick Bottle Kilns should be stabilised. This should include the removal of intrusive vegetation, particularly concerning the Bottle Kilns.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 4 July 2013, The Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns are of State significance as outstanding and rare remnants of a nineteenth century lime and cement manufacturing plant in a still legible industrial landscape. Their development is closely linked to the origin of the associated town of Portland and to the later development of the Commonwealth Portland Cement Works. The Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns represent the genesis of the Portland cement industry in NSW and the beginnings of a century of cement production at Portland. Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Raffan's Mill and the Brick Bottle Kilns are of State significance as 19th century remnants of the site of commercial production of lime and the site of the first commercial production of Portland cement. The Cullen Bullen Lime and Marble Works and the Cullen Bullen Lime and Cement Company were the direct forebears of the Commonwealth Portland Cement Works and their early successes encouraged the establishment of the town of Portland. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns are of local significance for their associations with early pioneers in Portland Cement manufacture in NSW, notably George Raffan and John Raffan. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The two bottle-shaped, brick kilns are of State significance for their aesthetic qualities as distinctive examples of nineteenth century kilns and as part of a remnant nineteenth century industrial landscape. They have outstanding local significance and landmark qualities as a picturesque remnant of the first attempt to bring the cement manufacturing industry to the town. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The potential social significance of Raffan's Mill and Bottle Kilns has not been researched. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns are of State significance for their technical values as rare surviving examples of nineteenth century lime and cement production technologies. They have potential to yield further information, through archaeological investigation, of the early Portland Cement industry in NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The two Bottle Kilns in combination with Raffan's Mill are of State significance for being extremely rare as intact, in situ remnants of nineteenth century industrial technology. It is very unusual to find such a legible industrial site of this age in NSW that still clearly displays its relationship to the landscape that provided the raw materials as well as the relationship between milling of limestone and the baking of cement. This rarity and significance is enhanced by the juxtaposition of these relics to the continuing use of the Portland Cement Works Site, nearby, throughout the twentieth century for much larger- scale quarrying and commercial manufacture of the same product. The surviving mill machinery attached to the Raffan's Mill building are rare surviving examples of use of hardwood pegs as teeth in the mill wheels and cogs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Raffan's Mill and Bottle Brick Kilns are of State significance as fine examples of nineteenth-century lime and cement making equipment. They are outstanding remnants of an industrial enterprise interrelated with the genesis and development of a rural town, as well as the precursor to a larger cement- making complex that operated through much of the twentieth century.

She is based out of Atlanta. According to Nick Fulton of the magazine i-D, Bali Baby is \\"one of very few openly gay female rappers with any skin in the game.\\" In March 2018, LA Weeklys Shirley Ju described Bali Baby as \\"the hottest female rap artist to come out of Atlanta.\\" Early life Bali was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but she is from Jacksonville, North Carolina. Bali had a keen interest in music even as a kid. She grew up with an older brother and a younger sister who passed away when she was still a kid. Bali began learning music and became an expert piano player in her teenage years. Although music had a strong influence on her while she was growing up, she had no particular interest in rap music. She played a musical game called \\"Guitar Hero\\". Initially, she was a huge fan of Lana Del Rey. However, Atlanta was the hub of Southern rappers, and as Bali grew up, she could not avoid the influence of rap music. Bali admired Nicki Minaj, and without knowing that she would eventually become a rapper, she started freestyling casually. She played soccer in school and wanted to join a big university through a soccer scholarship. Career Her career as a rapper began in 2016 when she produced the freestyle rap song \\"Designer\\". Her breakthrough mixtape was Bali's Play 2, which was released in 2017. On March 30, 2018, she released the five-track EP Bali Blanco, which represented her sixth release overall. Her debut studio album, Baylor Swift, was released in May 2018. It features a more distorted, rock-centered sound than most of her previous work. She has been named as an influencer by ppcocaine. She has a brother named Andrew and her real name is Kaitlin Fletcher. As of 2020, she is having a baby soon with her current boyfriend.

A 'mulquinier' was the artisan textile designer and weaver as well as the merchant of canvases. The mulquiniers were not only a subcategorization of the tisserand(e) artists (hand loom weavers; French pronunciation: [tis Ä…ëÃÉ]) but were also the traders of their own craft. This activity was predominantly developed within villages as a substantial rural proto-industry, hence mulquiniers working on m√©tiers √† tisser in their home' basement while breathing from \\"bahottes\\" or \\"blocures\\" to obtain the most propitious humidity levels. Rue de Solesmes in alt= A \\"bahotte / blocure\\" (basement window giving light and air to the mulquiniers in left  Origins and etymology  Mulquinerie originated in the 17th and 18th centuries from metropolitan France‚Äôs Northern Departments now constituting the Hauts-de-France region (French pronunciation: [o d(…ô) f Å…ëÃÉs], translating to \\"Upper France\\" in English; Picard: Heuts-d'Franche), following the territorial reform of French Regions (2014) from a merger of Nord-Pas-de- Calais and Picardy. The activity was ubiquitous in the towns of the former Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin, the Cambr√©sis sub-province or the Thi√©rache including Saint-Vaast-en-Cambr√©sis, Saint-Hilaire-lez-Cambrai, Haspres, Saint- Quentin or Neuvilly. This also included Caudry, the medieval capital city of French lace, which remains (in collaboration with Calais) the only town in France where lace is still made. Etymologically, ‚Äòmulquinier‚Äô is derived from the Germanic term \\"mollquin\\" meaning 'thin canvas'. First traces of the term are encountered in the 'Charter of the mulquiniers of Valenciennes' in 1413 through the use of the term 'molekinier'. Among the oldest mulquinerie ancestries are the 'Lecygne' and 'Legueil' families tracing back beyond the XVIIth century being fabric dyers, textile artists, embroiderers, patternmakers or hand-spinners.  Symbolism and patronage  The French mulquiniers' patron was Saint Veronica of Jerusalem whose representations they celebrated biannually (summer and winter) as in many pious Christian countries.

Pi5 inhibits human Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels as well as Drosophila Shaker B potassium channels.  Etymology and source  Pi5 is a peptide that is purified from the venom of the African scorpion Pandinus imperator.Olamendi-Portugal T, Csoti A, Jimenez-Vargas JM, Gomez-Lagunas F, Panyi G, Possani LD. Pi5 and Pi6, two undescribed peptides from the venom of the scorpion Pandinus imperator and their effects on K(+)-channels. Toxicon 2017 Jul;133:136-144. Pi in Pi5 is short for the 5th identified peptide of the scorpion Pandinus imperator. As of July 2017, a total of 7 peptides purified from the venom of this scorpion have been characterized (Pi1-7).  Chemistry  Pi5 is part of the toxin family Œ±-KTx.Tytgat J, Chandy KG, Garcia ML, Gutman GA, Martin-Eauclaire MF, van der Walt JJ, et al. A unified nomenclature for short-chain peptides isolated from scorpion venoms: alpha-KTx molecular subfamilies. Trends Pharmacol Sci 1999 Nov;20(11):444-447. KTx is the abbreviation of kaliotoxin, which is a potassium channel toxin. There are three KTx families: Œ±-, Œ≤- and Œ≥-KTx. The classification of toxins into these families is based on the size of the peptides, their chronological appearance, toxicity to humans, and ion-channel specificity. Pi5 belongs to the Œ±-KTx family because it is a short-chain toxin in the venom of a scorpion. Furthermore, the Œ±-KTx family is divided in subfamilies, classified by the alignment of cysteine. A nomenclature Œ±-KTx m.n. in which m represents the subfamily and n represents the member of that subfamily has been proposed.Miller C. The charybdotoxin family of K+ channel-blocking peptides. Neuron 1995;15(1-5). Pi5 has been given the systematic name of Œ±-KTx 24.1, being the first member in the 24th subfamily of Œ±-KTx toxins. The Pi5 peptide has a molecular weight of 3334.00 Da. and contains 33 amino acids. Eight of the amino acids are cysteines, and they form a total of four disulfide bonds. The amino acid sequence of Pi5 is: VAKCSTSECGHACQQAGCRNSGCRYGSCICVGC.  Target  Pi5 blocks Drosophila Shaker B K+ channels as well as human Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels. = Drosophila Shaker B K+ channels = Pi5 blocks Drosophila Shaker B K+ channels with low affinity. The inhibition of these Shaker B K+ channels is reversible. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the inhibition is 540 nM. = hKv1.2 and hKv 1.3 channels = Pi5 inhibits the human voltage-dependent potassium channels Kv1.2 and Kv1.3. These channels are coded respectively by the genes KCNA2 and KCNA3 and their inhibition is reversible. hKv1.2 is inhibited with a Kd of 92 nM and hKv1.3 with a Kd of 77 nM.  Mode of action  The Pi5 toxin scales down the ion currents through ion channels. The kinetics of the channels remain unaltered. Furthermore, the blockage of the channels is not voltage-dependent, which is often found with Kv channel blocker toxins.  Toxicity  The venom of Pandinus imperator is not lethal to humans.

Specifically, one can compare observational results to experimental findings to calibrate bias. Under ordinary conditions, carrying out an experiment gives the researchers an unbiased estimate of their parameter of interest. This estimate can then be compared to the findings of observational research. Note that benchmarking is an attempt to calibrate non- statistical uncertainty (flaws in underlying assumptions). When combined with meta-analysis this method can be used to understand the scope of bias associated with a specific area of research.  History  The start of experimental benchmarking in social science is often attributed to Robert LaLonde. In 1986 he found that findings of econometric procedures assessing the effect of an employment program on trainee earnings did not recover the experimental findings . Experimental benchmarking is often conducted in medical research, such as Schnell‚ÄêInderst et al. (2017) and Burden et al. (2017) .  Procedural Considerations  The most instructive experimental benchmarking designs are done on a large scale. They also compare experimental and non-experimental work that looks at the same outcome and the same population .  Observational Designs That Can Be Assessed with Benchmarking  Non-experimental, or observational, research designs compare treated to untreated subjects while controlling for background attributes (called covariates). This estimation approach can also be called covariate adjustment. Covariates are attributes that exist prior to experimentation and therefore do not change based on treatment . Examples include age, gender, weight, and hair color. For example, if researchers are interested in the effect of smoking cessation classes on the number of cigarettes smoked a day, they may carry out covariate adjustment to control for ethnicity, income and the number of years the smoker has been smoking. Covariate adjustment can be carried out in a variety of ways. Gordon et al. (2018) illustrate many of these methods by means of online advertising data, such as propensity score matching, stratification, regression adjustment, and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment. They find that despite great variation in variables within their data, observational methods cannot recover the causal effects of online advertising. This study ultimately provides evidence that without a randomized control trial, it is impossible to detect symptoms of bias. Bias is not always going to be in one direction or of the same magnitude.  Selected Examples of Experimental Benchmarking  Bloom et al. (2002) looks at the study of the impact of mandatory welfare-to-work programs to ask which non- experimental methods get closest to recovering the experimentally estimated effects of such programs. They also question if the most accurate non- experimental methods are accurate enough to take the place of experimental work. They ultimately argue that none of the methods approach the accuracy of experimental methods for recovering the parameter of interest. Dehijia and Wahba (1999) examine LaLonde's (1989) data with additional non-experimental findings. They argue that when there is enough subject pool overlap and unobservable covariates do not impact outcomes, non-experimental methods can indeed estimate treatment impact accurately. Glazerman, Levy and Myers (2003) perform experimental benchmarking in the context of employment services, welfare and job training. They determine that non-experimental methods may approximate experimental estimates, however these estimations can be biased enough to impact policy analysis and implementation. Gordon et al. (2018) utilizes data from Facebook to see if the variation in data collected by the advertising industry allows for observational methods to recover the causal effects of online advertising. Specifically, the study aims to analyze the effectiveness of Facebook ads on three outcomes: checkout, registration and page view. They find that despite great variation made possible by the nature of social media, it is not possible to accurately recover the causal effects.  References  Bloom, H. S., Michalopoulos, C., Hill, C.

She writes about topics such as love and loss, about surviving under difficult situations, and about changes within the natural world and in society.  Life and works  Robyn Bolam was born on 20 October 1953 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her father, Charles Hall, was a carpenter and her mother, Margaret Ann Bolam, was a nurse. She spent most of her early life in Northumberland, England and began her poetry writing at a very young age. At the age of 15, one of her poems was first published in an anthology titled Next Wave Poets 1, and more of her poems were later published in Next Wave Poets 2. Bolam married Michael Lomax in August 1974 and began publishing her works under the name Marion Lomax. Sometime after her marriage, she wrote a poem called 'Special Delivery', which was about the death of her father. The poem was accepted for a magazine called New Poetry, published by Norman Hidden. Hidden would continue to be a source of encouragement for Bolam until his death in 2006 at the age of 93. Another source of encouragement for Bolam was the poet Peter Porter, who encouraged her to apply for the Eric Gregory Award, for which she applied in 1980, and for which she was awarded in 1981. In the same year, she also won first prize in the Cheltenham Poetry Competition. In 1993, she was awarded a Hawthornden Castle Fellowship, and spent a month at the retreat for writers in Hawthornden Castle. Robyn's first book, The Peepshow Girl, was published in 1989 by Bloodaxe Books, followed by Raiding the Borders in 1996, and New Wings in 2007. Her most recent publish work is Hyem, published in October 2017. She did not begin publishing under the name of Robyn Bolam until December 2000 after her divorce from Michael Lomax in December 1999.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States.   Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars * liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel) * releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

Preliminary results indicate that a leak occurred at a weld seam on the gas main. Later, Oklahoma regulators filed a complaint over the failure with Oklahoma Natural Gas. The complaint alleged the utility failed to properly inspect its system following eight previous leak failures in the neighborhood going back to 1983. * On January 9, a 30-inch Atmos Energy gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned in Robertson County, Texas. Four families nearby were evacuated. * On January 11, butane leaking from a pipeline storage facility, in Conway, Kansas, forced a closure of a nearby highway for a time. * On February 14, a 6-inch crude oil pipeline broke near Rozet, Wyoming, spilling about 1,500 gallons of crude oil into a creek bed. * On February 16, an explosion and fire occurred at a gas plant in Frio County, Texas. 2 employees at the plant were injured. * On February 24, a 10-inch propane pipeline exploded and burned, near Sulphur, Louisiana.

The contractors were knocked off the platform to the ground, suffering injuries from the fall and severe burns. 7 contractors were injured. * On August 29, a Sunoco pipeline ruptured near Sweetwater, Texas. The leak was not found until September 10. About 361,000 gallons of crude oil were spilled. The pipeline was just over a year old. The cause was from external corrosion of the pipe. * On September 5, a pipeline in Bay Long, Louisiana was hit by a dredger, resulting in a spill of about 5,300 gallons of crude oil into the water. * On September 9, a Colonial Pipeline mainline leak was noticed by workers on another project, in Shelby County, Alabama. At least 252,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from the line. * On October 8, 2016, in Jenkins County, Georgia, a Kinder Morgan Southern Natural Gas pipeline leak which \\"sounded like a jet engine times ten,\\" exploded at 2:30 p.m. and was still leaking 3 hours later.

A farmer living nearby went to find the source of the ammonia, and was killed by entering the vapor cloud. About 50 people were evacuated from their homes. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the pipeline rupture was corrosion fatigue cracking, that grew and coalesced under disbonded polyethylene tape coating. Contributing to the location of the cracking was external loading that caused bending stress in the pipe, in addition to the cyclic stresses in the pipe, from the internal pressure of the ammonia transportedhttps://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB2001.pdf * On October 19, a contractor in Portland, Oregon hit a 1-inch gas pipeline during work. Within an hour, there were 2 explosions, injuring 8 people, destroying or damaging several buildings, and started a fire.

The river was running high at the time. * On October 23, a pipeline ruptured on the Seaway Pipeline, in Cushing, Oklahoma, spraying the area with crude oil. About 319,00 gallons of crude were spilled. The cause was from prior excavation damage. * On October 31, a Colonial Pipeline mainline exploded and burned in Shelby County, Alabama, after accidentally being hit by a track hoe. One worker died at the scene, and 5 others were hospitalized, with one of those workers dying a month later. The explosion occurred approximately several miles from the 9 September 2016 breach. * On November 29, an Enterprise Products pipeline exploded in Platte County, Missouri, burning about 210,000 gallons of an ethane propane mixture. There were no evacuations or injuries.

The metallurgical and root cause failure analysis indicated the failure was caused by compressive and bending forces due to a landslide impacting the pipeline. *On December 12, Transco reported an explosion and fire that severely damaged a facility in Austin, Pennsylvania, resulting in an estimated $15,000,000 in damage to the facility. Internal corrosion was determined to be the cause. * Sometime in December, a natural gas pipeline running beneath Turnagain Arm in Cook Inlet, near Nikiski, Alaska, southwest of Anchorage ruptured, leaking large quantities of natural gas into the water.

He is best known for his two part graphic novel adaption of New York Times bestselling Larry Niven's sci-fi novel Ringworld and a 32-page Pope Benedict manga comic where 300,000 copies were distributed for World Youth Day 2011 in Madrid.  Biography  His first foray into the comic industry was the release of It Takes a Wizard, a 480-page single volume manga, written by German writer Thomas R. Hart, and published by Seven Seas Entertainment, an American publisher of original manga-style comics in 2009. Two years later Macmillan Publishers published his two-part graphic novel adaption of the sci-fi novel Ringworld by Larry Niven, namely Ringworld: The Graphic Novel, Part One and Ringworld: The Graphic Novel, Part Two. He then went on to develop several bible-themed graphic novels with American publisher Manga Hero, which includes Paul: Tarsus to Redemption, Judith: Captive to Conqueror, Many Are Called, and Habemus Papam! manga. He released a 32-page Pope Benedict manga comic which was distributed in August during World Youth Day 2011 in Madrid. This was followed by an expanded version of the graphic novel which went deeper into the life of Pope Benedict XVI. In 2012 he won an award for his bible themed graphic novel, Judith: Captive to Conqueror at Angoul√™me Christian Comics Festival in France. A 48-page paperback, Pope Francis: I Believe in Mercy,, was later created to celebrate the appointment of Pope Francis. In 2015 he collaborated with the Four Lords from San Diego as the main comic artist for The Curseborn Saga manga, and together held a book signing at the Los Angeles Anime Expo for the launch of the first volume, followed by another at the San Diego Comic-Con, where his team got an exclusive interview by ABC 10 News. They are currently in works on the second volume of the comic and an art book with a consolidation of all his current concept arts and character designs for the story planned for release sometimes towards end of 2018 or early 2019. He is also currently working with kingB, an author as well as an artist, to create two new original comic series namely the 'Red Dot' and 'Goddess Punch', both which were introduced exclusively on his social media platform Instagram. Both works aim to appeal to both local Singaporeans as well as the international audience. Apart from working on graphic novels, Sean has held in-house art gallery showcasing his popular online series of 'Red Dot' and 'Silent Night series' artworks which he has also shared on his Instagram. In an interview in 2011, he talked about hopes to bring changes to the art scene in Singapore and to hopefully attract and trigger the creativity in children in comic and manga art, saying ‚ÄúManga can deliver emotions faithfully and carry a vivid message to readers, evoking a sense of reality in the story. Young children are usually fascinated by the art when they pick up the book. I hope that my artwork can help them understand the emotional background of the set and characters, and bring them into that world to learn about the wonderful stories of faith and goodwill.‚Äù  Publications  * Pope Francis: I Believe in Mercy (Manga Hero, 2017) * Many Are Called (Manga Hero, 2017) * Habemus Papam-Pope Benedict XVI (Manga Hero, 2017) * Ringworld: The Graphic Novel, Part Two (Tor/Seven Seas, 2015) * Ringworld: The Graphic Novel, Part One (Tor/Seven Seas, 2014) * Judith: Captive to Conqueror (Manga Hero, 2013) * Paul: Tarsus to Redemption (Manga Hero, 2012) * It Takes a Wizard (Seven Seas, 2009)  References   Bibliography and works  *Sean Lam Author Page from Macmillan Publishers Sean Lam on Amazon Author Page *Sean Lam on Goodreads Author Page  Interviews  Interview with OEL Manga Artist, Sean Lam Manga artist hopes his work inspires S'porean illustrates life of Pope Francis for comic book Fanbase Press interviews Sean Lam on his new graphic novel series, 'Red Dot' Category:Artist authors Category:Original English-language manga Category:Graphic novelists Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Singaporean comics artists ","title":"Sean Lam"},{"id":"58695640","text":"The 1966 Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship was the 72nd staging of the Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Kilkenny County Board.

Life  Guala participated in a capitular meeting in the Basilica di Sant'Alessandro, when the bishop Gerardo was forced by the people to recognize or not the Antipope Victor IV (1159‚Äì1164). In 1166 Frederick Barbarossa descended upon the Po Valley with his army. He devastated the territories of Brescia, Bergamo and Milan, whose city was completely destroyed. Bishop Gerardo of Bergamo, who was supporting Frederick and his Antipope Paschal III (Guido of Crema), was summoned to Rome by Pope Alexander III, but when he refused to appear before the Papal Court, he was deposed. Pope Alexander then appointed a new Archbishop of Milan and Papal Legate for Lombardy, Cardinal Galdino della Sala, and instructed him to deal with the situation in Bergamo. Cardinal Galdino arrived in Bergamo in December 1167, summoned the clergy and people, and formally deposed Bishop Gerardo. Gerardo was driven out. He then ordered the Canons of S. Vincenzo and the Canons of S. Alessandro, led by the Archdeacon Adelardo, to form their usual committee to elect a replacement for Bishop Gerardo. One of the Canons of S. Alessandro, Guala, who was supported by Cardinal Galdino, was elected bishop.

They were arrested in a sting operation in Slovakia conducted by British security agency MI5 in 2001 after they were caught attempting to buy arms for their campaign. They believed they were purchasing weapons from Iraqi intelligence agents and that Saddam Hussein was to play a role in the Real IRA similar to the one Colonel Gadaffi had in its predecessors the Provisional IRA. The three men met in Pie≈°≈•any, a spa town in Western Slovakia, after months of meetings and telephone calls‚Äîall of which were intercepted and overheard by MI6. Believing its case to be now fireproof, MI5 had passed details of the men and their intentions to the Slovak authorities, who ambushed the men on the evening of 5 July 2001 after their meeting. They were arrested and imprisoned in the expectation Slovakia would receive a formal extradition request from the UK. McDonald, Rafferty and O'Farrell were extradited; at Woolwich Crown Court, London, they were tried and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Unusually for IRA men in British courts, they pleaded guilty. In 2006 they were transferred to Ireland to serve the remainder of their sentences in Portlaoise Prison. In 2014, however, it was discovered that some prisoners who had been transferred from the English penal system to the Irish one had not had their warrants adjusted to take into account Ireland's lack of any facility to release prisoners on licence. This resulted in anomalies between the lengths of their original sentences and what they were expected to serve in Ireland; after an appeal, the Irish High Court released McDonald, Rafferty and O'Farrell in September 2014. Background In July 1997 the Provisional IRA, which had been waging an armed campaign against the British government for the previous 30 years, called a ceasefire. Subsequently, at an IRA Convention in County Donegal, the organisation's Quartermaster and Executive member Michael McKevitt denounced the ceasefire and the fledgling Northern Ireland peace process, urging a return to the armed struggle. He was outmanoeuvred and isolated by the Gerry Adams-Martin McGuinness leadership and, along with his supporters, resigned. In November that year, McKevitt and his supporters formed a new group named the Real IRA, which attracted disaffected Irish republicans on both sides of the border. MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall. The rear of the building had been attacked by the Real IRA in September 2001; O'Farrell and Rafferty later claimed to have been part of the team carrying out the operation. McKevitt, as Quartermaster, had access to the IRA's major arms dumps; when he left he took with him a small amount of materiel, including Semtex, weapons including Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74, and detonators and timing devices. Within a few years, the group was able to supplement its equipment with imported arms and explosives, much of which came from the former Yugoslavia, which at the time had a flourishing black market in weaponry following the Yugoslav Wars of the previous decade. The group was not always successful: in July 2000 in Dobranje, the Croatian police seized a large quantity of weapons destined for Dublin. By the following year, a number of RIRA arms dumps in Ireland had been discovered; most of the seized weapons came from Eastern Europe. Ulster loyalist groups also obtained arms from the same region, but by 2001 the national governments of that region were attempting to stem the practice as part of the process of joining the European Union. The RIRA wished to receive the sponsorship of a rogue state and believed that with Saddam Hussein's Iraq they would receive both guns and money for their cause and create a supply line for the future. The previous year, the group had carried out some high-profile attacks in England, bombing BBC Television Centre in White City in March, Hammersmith Bridge in June 2000, and Ealing Broadway in August, In September the same year they launched a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall; the RPG-18 used in the attack may have been purchased in the Balkans. MI5 chose the Iraqi ruse for their sting in the belief it \\"might prove alluring\\". The so-called political wing of the RIRA, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (32CSM), had recently published articles on their website condemning Britain for bombing Iraq in 1998. The fake Iraqi gunrunners first established contact with the republicans through the 32CSM's press officer Joe Dillon, reported The Daily Telegraph. At first they claimed to be Iraqi journalists who were merely interested in the Real IRA and British imperialism; they left a mobile telephone on which they could be contacted. They later claimed to be Iraqi intelligence personnel. =O'Farrell, Rafferty and McDonald= O'Farrell, Rafferty and McDonald were all from the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth: O'Farrell and Rafferty hailed from Carlingford and McDonald was from Dundalk. Their IRA activities were known to the Gardai. An old friendship existed between the three and between their families, and it was later suggested in court that they may have been inspired as much by loyalties to each other as by politics. McDonald had a reputation for using violence and was suspected by the Garda√≠ of at least one killing. He may have been the RIRA second-in-command to McKevitt in Ireland, and also led the team in Slovakia. At their trial, all three were described as being \\"leading figures\\" in the organisation. O'Farrell and Rafferty were 35 and 41 years of age, respectively, when they were arrested. Operation Samnite  Geography of Operation Samnite The Real IRA's plans for the continent were discovered in 2000 by Slovak intelligence, which informed MI5. The British operation, called Operation Samnite, took six months to come to fruition the following year and involved up to 50 members of MI5. The RIRA had \\"an extensive shopping list\\" of weaponry it wished to acquire. Having agreed to meet a man named Sami who they thought was an Iraqi agent, another Louth man‚Äîand close associate of McKevitt‚Äîmade the first trip to Slovakia. He was under surveillance from the beginning. The Irishmen believed they were negotiating with Iraqi intelligence agents sent by Saddam Hussein, from whom they believed they were buying of semtex plastic explosive, 2,000 detonators, 200 grenades and 500 pistols. MacDonald may have hoped to obtain a variety of supergun that the Iraqi government was suspected to possess; such a weapon combined with wire-guided missiles‚Äî also requested by McDonald‚Äîwould have enabled the Real IRA to have pierced everything from armour plating to the bulletproof vests worn by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the British army. Following the purchase, the Iraqis intended to make two shipments to Ireland overland through Central Europe and the Low Countries. The first shipment was to consist of of plastic explosives, 100 grenades, 125 pistols and 125 automatic weapons. The remainder would be sent in another shipment. =The sting= Five meetings between the RIRA team and the supposed gunrunners took place in Dublin, Austria and Budapest; at these meetings the parties established a working relationship. Telephone calls between the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Austria and Hungary were intercepted and the meetings were monitored with bugging devices. The Daily Telegraph later reported that O'Farrell and Rafferty told the agents they had been part of the team that had attacked MI6's headquarters the previous year. Rafferty stated the organisation was held back by its \\"lack of funds and hardware\\", telling the agents, \\"[h]ad we got the proper tools we would have done something more, more worse than that\\", referring to the RPG attack. McDonald suggested they \\"could do better with more advanced kit\\", telling the agents their use of it would \\"bring a smile to your face\\". Two MI5 agents of Middle Eastern appearance arranged to meet the trio in an Arab restaurant in Pie≈°≈•any, western Slovakia, a spa town that had had a large Arabian community since the 1970s. The Guardian noted it is popular with wealthy Arabs and with ex-KGB arms dealers. Afraid of being overheard, the Irishmen presented their list of requests to the MI5 men written on a restaurant napkin. McDonald did not intend to let the agents keep the list but one of them forestalled his attempts to retrieve it by taking it from the table, pretending to blow his nose on it and subsequently pocketing the napkin. Warrants had been issued under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, reported The Daily Telegraph, \\"relating to the illegal membership of a proscribed organisation, entering into arrangements for the purposes of terrorism, fundraising for the purposes of terrorism and conspiracy charges\\". The three Irishmen were arrested on Thursday 5 July 2001 by Slovak police, implementing the British warrants and in expectation of an extradition request; the UK has an extradition treaty with Slovakia. The chief of Slovak Interpol compared the arrests to a scene \\"just like you see in films\\", because Slovak commandos had set up roadblocks that they used to force the Irishmen's car off the road and ambush them. \\"All three were taken down in a matter of seconds\\", he said. Slovak Chief Prosecutor Milan Hanzel did not acknowledge the men were IRA militants for a week. Following questioning in Bratislava, they were imprisoned in Trnava on an international arrest warrant. Their names were not publicly released for more than a week. While in Slovak custody, according to El Mundo, the three men confessed to having met with Osama bin Laden's European finance manager Hamid Aich. According to The Slovak Spectator, they received from him a large amount of money that was \\"to be deposited in banks in Santander, Bilbao and Vitori, likely to be used by the Spanish terrorist organisation ETA\\". Interior Minister Ivan ≈†imko denied any knowledge of the possibility but said that even if he did know he would not have answered. Extradition Slovakia agreed to extradite the three suspects to England in August 2001, although only after a lengthy legal dispute. The men's Slovak lawyer Jan Gereg argued that their rights had been violated while in Slovak custody. The legal team argued there had been insufficient time for the court to reach an independent decision on the extradition request and that the court which examined the request was too minor to make such a decision. Gereg said, \\"\\"Even when you're dealing with the worst kind of terrorist, you have to keep to at least the basic principles of law\\". Their solicitors also claimed MI5 had illegally used covert surveillance devices including bugs and hidden cameras. The Slovak court denied their appeal and allowed the extraditions to go ahead; Alica Klimesova, a justice ministry spokesperson, stated; \\"the court ruled that the extradition of the three is legally acceptable, and now only the minister will decide\\". The men were flown to London on 30 August 2001. On arrival in the UK, the three were held at a \\"central London police station\\" and in November they appeared for arraignment at the Old Bailey's Number Two Court under an armed guard. Their trial was set for April 2002 and was expected to last between six and eight weeks. While in police custody, the three men confessed to attempting to purchase arms for use in terrorist attacks. Garda√≠ searched their homes in Dundalk but did not arrest anyone as a result. = Reactions = The 32CSM accused those involved in the peace process of having a \\"sinister agenda\\" regarding other republicans and announced a campaign to secure the three men's immediate release. Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble welcomed the arrests, saying it could indicate the start of a period of increased cooperation between the UK and Eastern Europe. Trimble also stated; \\"there has been a delay or a reluctance in the past by the Irish authorities to move against\\" dissident republicans. The Slovak government said in the wake of the joint operation, \\"if we ever had such a reputation [for gunrunning] such events [the arrest of the Irishmen] help to make that a thing of the past\\". = Sentencing and imprisonment = McDonald, Rafferty and O'Farrell stood trial at Woolwich Crown Court, London, in May 2002. They were not expected to plead; when on trial in British courts, Irish republicans usually refuse to recognise the court's jurisdiction and ignore the proceedings. On this occasion, however, the defendants pleaded guilty‚Äîpossibly the first time this had happened in the course of The Troubles. Rafferty's counsel called it a momentous occasion and said he urged the judge on their behalf to sentence the men as soon as possible because they were \\"extremely anxious now to know their fate\\". The judge acknowledged that there may have been \\"pressures upon you coming from the accident of where you lived and loyalty to those you know\\", but said this was outweighed by the severity of their intended actions. The three men pleaded guilty to various charges under the Terrorism Act 2000 and conspiracy to cause explosions. They also said they had been planning to bomb either Ireland or London on their successful return. Friends and relatives of the accused were in the public gallery. On 7 May, the defendants were each sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. The 32CSM said it was \\"shocked by the length of the sentence, considering the three men had changed their pleas to guilty just before the trial was due to start\\". Aerial view of Belmarsh Prison in Woolwich, where the men were incarcerated until their transfer While serving their sentences in England they were held in HM Prison Belmarsh; the Irish Republican Prisoners' Welfare Association (IRPWA) protested the conditions in which they said the men were being held. The IRPWA said the men were \\"confined to their cells for 26 hours at a time they are not allowed any exercise periods, use of the gym is also proscribed‚Äîas are visits to the prison shop and library. As a result, all three men are suffering physically with serious weight-loss\\". The three men appealed against their sentences in July 2005. Julian Knowles, one of their solicitors, accused the British government of \\"bypass[ing] fundamental legal principles\\" to secure their extradition from Slovakia and that their extradition had been illegal. Another counsel, Ben Emmerson, described the original sentences as \\"manifestly excessive\\" because the trio were only \\"foot soldiers\\". Emmerson also reminded the court that in Ireland, Michael McKevitt had recently been convicted of leading the Real IRA but was only sentenced to 20 years. Although Emmerson did not accusing MI5 of entrapment, he said it was a \\"ruse conducted in the public interest\\", and called the prosecution of the Slovak Three an \\"abuse of process\\". News outlets at the time said the appeal, if it had succeeded, could have impacted the ability of MI5 to perform similar sting operations in the future. The Court of Appeal did not overturn the convictions but reduced all three men's sentences by two years on account of their original guilty pleas. According to Lord Justice Hooper, the court reduced the sentences \\"not without some reluctance\\". In 2006, under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, McDonald, Rafferty and O'Farrell were transferred to Portlaoise Prison in County Laois to complete their sentences in Ireland.  Aftermath  Operation Samnite was the first operation by MI5‚Äîofficially a domestic intelligence service‚Äîto be based solely on evidence gathered abroad. It has since been described as an illustration of the advantages of close cooperation between national security agencies. It was also said to be in stark contrast to previous operations MI5 had attempted, some of which have been described as \\"too cavalier\\" in their approach. = Release = In July 2014, the three men instructed their solicitors to challenge the legality of their sentencing and continued detention. In September that year, Judge Gerard Hogan ordered the immediate release of O'Farrell, Rafferty and McDonald, declaring that \\"the High Court had no jurisdiction to retrospectively adapt, so as to achieve compatibility with Irish law, the defective warrants under which the three were detained here following their transfer from English prisons in 2006\\". McDonald, Rafferty and O'Farrell were freed within hours of his announcement on the evening of 11 September 2014, having served 12 years of their 28-year sentence. Their relatives were in court to hear the proceedings.The State appealed both the decision and the men's immediate release in an attempt to keep them imprisoned until October 2016. The appeal was held that year. The Supreme Court of Ireland upheld Hogan's ruling by a majority of 4:3. Although the judgment noted that it was a \\"troubling case\\", and said \\"many would say, having committed these very serious crimes\\" the three should be made to serve every year of their sentences, the procedure by which they had had their sentences transferred had been \\"fundamentally defective\\" and incompatible with Irish law as it then stood. It concluded the warrants were void ab initio and stated the legal deficiencies were beyond mend either by the law as it stood or by the Irish courts. The disputing judges had disagreed on the last point, believing it was legally possible to adjust the warrants after the fact; the judgment placed responsibility for resolving potential disparity with the sentencing guidelines of another state with the sentencing state‚Äîin this case England. The fundamental discrepancy was that under English law, any prisoner serving a custodial sentence of between one and 50 years automatically qualifies for release after serving two-thirds of the sentence. Irish law only allows for 25% remission and no release on licence. As such, the trio would have been liable to release after 18 years if they had remained in England. Further, the warrants themselves recorded an incorrect sentence (28 rather than 30 years) and the sentence itself did not exist in Irish sentencing guidelines; conspiracy, while in England carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, has a maximum term of 20 years in Ireland. As a result of the disparity revealed by the 2016 appeal decision, the Irish government ceased processing application requests from Irish prisoners in foreign prisons. In April 2018, the Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan confirmed there were 36 outstanding requests awaiting consideration and that another five prisoners had been released. Flanagan confirmed the High Court's ruling was directly responsible for the delay, saying all such future releases were \\"on hold\\" while the implications of the release of McDonald, O'Farrell and Rafferty were considered and the possibility of adjusting the law was weighed. The Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas, however, said this left prisoners in a legal \\"limbo\\".

Born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Johnson attended local primary schools and preparatory school in Washington, D.C. He graduated summa cum laude from Rollins College in 1934. Three years later, he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He began the practice of law in Pittsburgh in 1937. After he interrupted his legal career to serve in the United States Navy during World War II, at war's end he became a founder of the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart; by the time of Johnson's death, the firm (now K&L; Gates) had become Pittsburgh's largest. During his career, he served as an officer or director of more than 50 companies, as well as on the Rollins College board of trustees. In August 1946, Johnson joined a group headed by Indianapolis businessman Frank E. McKinney that purchased the Pirates' franchise from its longtime owners, the Barney Dreyfuss family. With McKinney initially holding 50 percent of the team's stock, Johnson acquired 15 percent interest. His fellow minority partners included entertainer Bing Crosby (15 percent) and Columbus, Ohio-based real estate magnate John W. Galbreath (20 percent). Four years later, in 1950, McKinney sold his controlling interest and Galbreath became majority owner. Johnson retained his share in the team until selling it to the Galbreath family in 1984 and, as a Pittsburgh resident and leading member of its business and legal circles, played a key role in ownership and management decisions through three Pirate World Series championship seasons (1960, 1971 and 1979). During his tenure as an owner, the Pirates moved from venerable Forbes Field to Three Rivers Stadium in 1970. A committed Pirates' fan who attended 55 Opening Day games, Johnson remained passionate about baseball after 1984 and once again invested in the Pirates as part of a new ownership syndicate headed by Kevin McClatchy in 1996. He died in Pittsburgh from cancer-related respiratory failure at the age of 85.

The police and news outlets have circulated a photo of the suspect. No arrests have been made, and the Duck Walk Killer remains at large. The police maintain that no motive has been established. The gun that was used in the two killings was used in two subsequent shootings on Chicago's West Side. The police have not determined if the subsequent shootings involved the same shooter.  Reward  The community quickly raised a $23,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the Duck Walk Killer. After several weeks without an arrest, the reward was increased to $150,000. This is the largest reward ever raised by a community in the city of Chicago for the capture of a single killer.

He was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where he was forced to help the SS doctor Dr. Carl Clauberg in his sterilisation experiments on Jewish women. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1946 for the medical services he provided to prisoners of war. He became a ship's doctor again and worked for the British Colonial Medical Service in Ceylon, and then in Ghana where he died. Early life Karel Sperber was born in Tachov, western Bohemia, in 1910 to a Jewish family. He completed his studies in medicine at the German University in Prague and Vienna. Second World War In 1939, Sperber escaped to Britain following the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Germany. He was prohibited from practising medicine in Britain because he was considered an \\"alien\\". Instead, he took up a post as a ship's doctor and purser on the British merchant and passenger ship SS Automedon, which was delivering important papers to the British Far East Command concerning Japan's possible entry into the Second World War. On 11 November 1940, his ship was attacked and sunk by the German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis near Sumatra in Indonesia. Sperber and the other surviving members of the ship's crew were taken first to the floating prison, the Norwegian tanker , and then to Bordeaux. Whilst interned at the camp hospital in Marseille, he, along with an Indian Dr Mitra, kept a look out whilst an escape tunnel was being dug. In late 1942, Sperber was sent to a prison in Bremen following a journey through a number of prisoner-of-war camps. He saved the lives of many British prisoners at Stalag X-B, when an outbreak of typhus occurred. On 13 December 1942, he entered Auschwitz as a Jewish prisoner, although, as stated in the Geneva convention, he should have been held as a prisoner of war. The number \\"82512\\" was tattooed on his arm.\\"Auschwitz Horrors\\", The West Australian, 13 January 1947, p. 7. There, he worked among a number of Nazi physicians including Josef Mengele, Eduard Wirths, and Friedrich Entress. In addition, he was forced to assist SS physician Carl Clauberg in sterilisation experiments on Jewish women. While in Auschwitz, Sperber smuggled a letter to Charles Coward, asking him to inform Sperber's relatives in Sunderland of his whereabouts. In 1944, he was sent to work at the prisoner infirmary of the Monowitz concentration camp. On 18 January 1945 he was sent on the death march to Gleiwitz and Buchenwald. After arriving at Buchenwald he and a group of doctors were able to gain admission to the hospital and later worked there as physicians. He subsequently escaped and hid in a forest until he was found by American troops on 1 April 1945. Later life After the war, Sperber returned to England. In December 1945, he sent a deposition to the British war crimes authorities about the atrocities he witnessed at Auschwitz which was subsequently used at the Nuremberg Trials. In 1946, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire for the medical services he provided to prisoners of war and he received British citizenship in 1948. He signed on as a ship's doctor again and worked for the British Colonial Medical Service in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and then in Ghana, where in 1957 he died of Hodgkin's lymphoma in Accra.

She was a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and established the Israeli collection of lichens at Tel Aviv University. Founder of the academic journal Symbiosis, she served as its editor-in-chief between 1985 and 2006. In 1994, she was awarded the Acharius Medal and in 1996 won the Meitner-Humboldt Prize, for her contributions to the field. The International Association for Lichenology grants an award which bears her name to honor scholarship at their quadrennial symposium. Early life Melitta Katz was born on 21 February 1927 in Vienna, Austria to Amalia (n√©e Teitelbaum) and Arie Katz. Originally from Lviv, her father was a merchant and was involved in the Zionist and socialist movements. After completing her elementary school in Vienna and beginning her gymnasium studies, her family decided to immigrate in 1938. They were unsuccessful in leaving Austria and to get their daughter out of the country Melitta was adopted by a Jewish-Swiss family, changing her name to Margalith, in 1939. Her parents were eventually able to join their daughter in Switzerland and in October of that year, the family immigrated to Palestine. In Tel Aviv, Katz completed her secondary studies at Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in 1946, and went to live and work at the kibbutz of Kfar Giladi for several months. When her mother died, she returned to Tel Aviv to be with her father and enrolled in courses at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1947. Within a month, the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war began and Katz interrupted her studies to join the Israel Defense Forces. When the conflict ended in 1949, she returned to her classes and completed her undergraduate degree in 1952, going on to earn a master's degree in botany in 1954. She worked as a teaching assistant during her master's studies and in 1953 married Esra Galun. Her son Eithan was born in 1954 and that year she began working on her PhD at Hebrew University, simultaneously working as a research assistant at the Volcani Agriculture Institute in Rehovot. In 1959, her second son Ehud was born and the following year, she completed her dissertation Die Flechten im Negev, Israel (The lichens in the Negev, Israel) under the direction of Israel Reichart, earning her PhD. Career Joining her husband in Pasadena, California, Galun conducted research at the California Institute of Technology from 1961 to 1962. Returning to Rehovot, she was employed at the Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona from 1962 to 1965, receiving a research grant from the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 1965, she was hired as a lecturer in the botany department at Tel Aviv University. She worked her way up the ladder, being promoted to senior lecturer in 1969, associate professor in 1971, and to professor in 1977. In addition to serving as department chair and on various departmental committees, she served as Dean of Students from 1977 to 1980, as a member of the Admissions Committee from 1978 to 1985; on the Board of Directors from 1989‚Äì1992, as well as other administrative positions. She also served on the Scientific Council at the Institute of Nature Conservation between 1988 and 1991. Margalith Galun around 1985 Simultaneously with her teaching, Galun conducted research on lichens. Establishing a research group, Galun led her students to collect samples and create the collection of lichens from throughout Israel for the university. Eventually their collection became international, including samples from many other countries. Initially her own research focused on identifying the varieties of lichen in Israel, but soon turned her attention to vegetative tissue, or thallus, to evaluate the interaction between algae and fungus during its formation. Studying the signalling molecules with electron microscopy, she wrote over 90 papers about lichen symbiosis and the absorption of metals by lichens, becoming \\"recognized as one of the world's foremost lichenologists\\". In 1985, Galun founded the academic journal Symbiosis and served as its editor-in-chief from 1985 to 2006. Between 1987 and 1993, she was the vice president of the International Association for Lichenology and during her term organized the first International Symbiosis Congress held in Jerusalem in 1991. She served as editor for the three volume work Handbook of Lichenology (CRC Press, 1988), which gave an encyclopedic overview of the research and discoveries in the field from Simon Schwendener's pioneering work to the present date. In 1994, Galun was the recipient of the Acharius Medal presented by the International Association for Lichenology and in 1996, she was awarded the Meitner-Humboldt Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. Death and legacy Galun died on 16 April 2012 after a lengthy illness.

Lanique is often used in classic cocktails to add a unique rose twist to them or due to its high alcohol strength as a drink in its own right with tonic or lemonade. It is now produced in the UK and owned by a Jersey based company. History Lanique traces its roots back to the late 1700s in the Kingdom of Prussia and variations where drunk across parts of Europe including in The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Austrian Empire. The original creator is believed to have been a Princess whose castle overlooked and owned the original distillery in what is now modern day Poland. Lanique was popular through the 1800s and right up to the 1920s at high society balls and was often drunk neat in small tasting glasses. The drink was lost during the Second World War and rise of Communism across Eastern Europe. In 1990 after the opening up of Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe the recipe was traced and reborn. Lanique was then bought in 2013 by a Jersey based company and production moved to the UK to allow expansion to new markets including the UK, Australia and others. In the UK and Australia Lanique is often found in high end cocktail bars adding a twist to classic cocktails as well as being drunk with mixers as its own drink like Lanique Rose & Tonic in bars and restaurants.

It is also one intervention that has been adapted for use in children and adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in response to a demand for guidance on psychological interventions for people exposed to adversity, including humanitarian disasters.  Use in mental health care  PSYCHLOPS is a mental health outcome-measure tool used in primary care or community care settings and is self-completed. It measures mental health problems, quality of life, social functioning and wellbeing. Others include the Beck Depression Inventory, the CORE-OM, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), amongst others. By comparing scores before, during and after completion of talking therapy, the measure enables calculation of a change score. The change score indicates the change (improvement or deterioration) in perceived severity of problems during and following a course of talking therapy. PSYCHLOPS is a patient-generated outcome measure which means that measurement is based on items (issues) selected by patients rather than pre-specified items. By gathering information on patient-generated items, PSYCHLOPS contains a free text record (qualitative data) of the patient‚Äôs own perception of their problems which can be used for qualitative research. =WHO= It is also one intervention that has been adopted by the WHO in response to a demand for guidance on psychological interventions for people exposed to adversity. This includes people caught up in humanitarian crises and incorporates common mental health problems in a variety of countries, cultures and settings. WHO has included it in two of their mental health programmes, Programme Management Plus (PM+) and Self Help Plus (SH+), both of which use locally trained mental health workers to administer mental health support in countries affected by conflict and war. =Children= PSYCHLOPS has been adapted for use in children. Unlike a checklist, \\"PSYCHLOPS Kids\\" allows children to identify their worries themselves. For children taking part in drama therapy, they have the potential to recognise the impact of their therapy. The reliance on the support of school staff has been reported as one limitation. Procedure PSYCHLOPS is completed by the individual person. A specific sequence of questions is included in the questionnaire which address the respondent‚Äôs greatest and least worries. These concerns are then scored. Subsequently, the answers and scores can be used to evaluate their perception of the change in their problems as a result of counselling or other talking therapy. It uses a six- point scale rather than the seven used in its sister questionnaire, MYMOP. The procedure encompasses answering four questions on one sheet, with the first question being ‚ÄúChoose the problem that troubles you most?‚Äù This is followed by scoring it on a six-point scoring range and recording the duration of the problem. An outcome score is calculated using the scores of each of the before, during and after questionnaires. History PSYCHLOPS was designed by a group led by Dr Mark Ashworth, an academic British general practitioner and designed by Jeremy Christey. This work was inspired by the self-report inventory, MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile), another outcome measure first published in 1996 and mainly used for people who present with physical, emotional, or social symptoms.. This measure brings important understanding from psychotherapy research to measure what is important to individuals themselves, to help them track and manage their self-defined difficulties. The PSYCHLOPS measure looks at a trans-therapeutic approach to measurement, that includes the ideas that we manage our difficulties through three different phases These three stages are; Re-moralisation (wellbeing, where mood lifts). Remediation (where problems get better) and rehabilitation (where functioning, the causes of problems are improved). The PSYCHLOPS measure is designed to focus on these stages and phases in measuring mental health from a client-centred perspective. Research There has been debate as to whether to identify and measure individualized outcomes that are unique for each patient (idiographic approach) or to use standardized measures (nomothetic approach). Both measures have their advantages and disadvantages. As a patient-generated measure, PSYCHLOPS appears a more sensitive (responsive) measure of change following a mental health intervention than some other standardised measures.

He is primarily remembered for his role in the \\"coolie riot\\" or \\"Amoy riot\\" of 1852. Life Great King Street, Edinburgh Dean Cemetery - the grave of Francis Darby Syme Little is known of his early life. He was born in Scotland in 1818, probably in or near Edinburgh. In December 1851, 410 coolies on the ship SS Robert Browne, en route from Amoy to San Francisco, rebelled against harsh treatment and killed the ship's captain whilst in Hong Kong Harbour. In an atmosphere of ongoing and growing unrest in the coolie trade, things peaked in August 1852. F D Syme entered the police station in Amoy, in his capacity as Director of Syme Muir & Co, to release a local Chinese \\"broker\\" in prison on kidnapping charges. His authority secured this but caused a wave of protest which spread from this action, accusing the companies of kidnapping and slavery. The resultant protests are generally called the \\"coolie riots\\" of 1852/3. The main perpetrators were seen as being Syme, Muir & Co and Tait & Co (James Tait). Eight protesters and four bystanders were killed by British marines at the peak of the rior in front of the Syme's premises. Syme was fined $200 for his part n the affray.Alien Nation: Chinese Migration in the Americas, by Elliot Young Syme Muir & Co are said to have erected a \\"barracoon\\" in front of their company offices in Amoy where they held the captured coolies, prior to shipping them around the world. This was locally known as the Ho-Ki Hong (Ho-Ki warehouse). Their actions were described in a contemporary report as \\"a disgrace to the British name\\". Their clearly illegal actions simply flaunted the local laws and the British government gave tacit approval of the coolie trade, seeing it as critical to colonial aspirations.Rouledge Handbook of the Chinese Diaspora Many of the coolies were sent to the West Indies to work on sugar plantations. Company practices included encouragement of the use of opium and encouragement of female infanticide. The trade also relied heavily upon a supply chain fed by Cantonese pirates, who would abduct unfortunate young men. Although the coolies were pais a wage in their destination, and therefore some perhaps did volunteer for the work, the wages were low and conditions were poor. The vast majority of coolies are thought to have been pressed into the role.Abolition as a Global Experience, by Hideaki Suzuki In August 1855 the British government introduced the Act for the Regulation of Chinese Passenger Ships, in an attempt to stem the coolie trade. One requirement of the act was that \\"passengers should be clear of their destination and wish to travel there\\". The Act was ineffective in bigger cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore but did act as a warning sign to the companies involved in the trade that their days were numbered. In cities such as Amoy where Syme operated the act was more influential and by December 1857 the export of unwilling coolies was declining. Syme, Muir & Co transferred there ships to Swatow and Macao and trade from Amoy more or less ceased.Abolition as a Global Experience, by Hideaki Suzuki In 1862 he sold his company interests in F D Syme & Co in Amoy to Thomas Deas Boyd, one of his managers, and it was thereafter known as \\"Boyd & Co\\". By this stage the coolie trade in general was in serious decline. The Americans introduced the Anti-Coolie Act in 1862 as a precursor to the abolition of slavery. In 1866 Syme appears in Edinburgh being given a commission as Captain of the Edinburgh Artillery Volunteer Corps.London Gazette 10 April 1866 He lived his final years at 14 Great King street, a huge Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh's Second New Town.edinburgh Post Office Directory 1870 He died on 21 September 1871 and is buried in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. The grave faces south on an east-west path to the north- west of the original cemetery and is marked by a white marble cross. The coolie trade was abolished within the British Empire in 1875. Family He was married to Mary Murdoch (1828-1900) daughter of John Murdoch (1800-1873). He appears related to the publisher John Boyd, but the relationship is unclear. If so, he is also related to John Boyd's son, Francis Darby Boyd, who is perhaps named after Syme.

It stars Sam Smith as a former Australian soldier returning to Afghanistan to seek forgiveness from the family of a man he killed while serving in the war. The film was shot under extreme circumstances, in dangerous locations and with assistance from the local people of Afghanistan. Deemed too politically divisive to be produced in Pakistan the film moved production at the last minute to Afghanistan and shot in one of the most dangerous regions in the world, Kandahar Province. Gilmour sought to create a film which showed the beauty of the Afghan country and people as well as highlight the detrimental impact of the War in Afghanistan on Western and Afghan people. He also wanted to create a film in which line between truth and fiction is blurred. Gilmour stated he wishes to \\"make an audience feel like they're not quite sure if they're watching a documentary or a drama.\\" Plot The Australian army sends a helicopter raid to a small village called Ghazi Ghar in Afghanistan in search of hidden Taliban soldiers. Men in the village seeking to protect their families exchange gunfire with the soldiers. During the raid a soldier named Mike shoots and kills an unarmed man who stepped into the doorway of his home. The man's wife and children pull him back into his house. Three years later Mike returns to Afghanistan in search of the family in order to ask for forgiveness and with a large sum of money as recompense. He lands in Kabul where he comes in contact with a man who had previously arranged to transport him to the family's village. This man now refuses telling Mike it is too dangerous and that he should go back to Australia. Mike hides in an Afghan curiosity shop to escape from a commotion in the street where he purchases a guitar under pressure from the owner. Mike asks a hotel owner to call a taxi driver to bring him to Ghazi Ghar which is in Kandahar Province. The hotel owner refuses as Kandahar is Taliban territory. He says he can arrange for a driver to take him as far south as lake Band-e-Amir but that is all. While at the lake Mike tries to convince the taxi driver to take him the rest of the way to Kandahar, offering him a lot of money. The taxi driver refuses and argues back with Mike. Neither man speaks the other's language and so the argument simply stops. That night Mike plays his guitar. The Taxi Driver sings a Pashtun song and Mike teaches him to sing the notes which correspond to the guitar strings. Lake Band-e-Amir in Afghanistan. Photo by: Carl Montgomery The next morning Mike offers the taxi driver even more money and begs him to drive to the village. The driver accepts and they begin the journey. The pair are stopped at a road block and the taxi driver warns Mike it is the Taliban. Mike gets out of the car and scrambles down a nearby cliff to escape the Taliban who shoot at him but do not follow down the cliff. Mike begins to walk towards the village but collapses from the heat and dehydration. Taliban soldiers find him unconscious in the desert and take him captive, chaining him in a cave. The Taliban men discuss whether to kill Mike but their leader, Sher Khan, wants to interview him first. They speak through an English speaking Taleb, and Mike explains why he is in Afghanistan. Khan tells him that giving the money would be disrespectful and asks \\"your people kill thousands of us. Why do you care about this one man?\\" Khan takes Mike to a bombed building and tells him that his brother and his brother's entire family were killed by an American drone there. Khan agrees to bring Mike to Ghazi Ghar. On the way to the village the English-speaking Taleb teaches Mike how to say \\"\\"I killed someone, please forgiveness,\\" in Pashto as a proper apology. When Mike reaches Ghazi Ghar he explains that he is there because he killed a man in the raid three years prior. He walks the villagers through the village explaining how his team carried out the raid and that they thought the men shooting at them were Taliban. The villagers take him to the family of the man he killed where he apologises in Pashto. The man's widow Sherbano cries and throws shoes at him while the two sons stare at Mike furiously. The community decides to hold a Jirga, a meeting of elders to decide whether to punish or forgive Mike. The Jirga decide Inam Khan, the son of the man who Mike killed, deserves to decide his fate. He steps through the crowd with a dagger, holds it to Mike's neck before sheathing it and deciding to forgive. The Jirga believe he has made the correct decision and one elder says \\"forgiveness is mightier and [more] honourable than taking revenge.\\" Mike assists in the ritual sacrifice of a sheep and then leaves the village.

While Gilmour was shooting his previous two films \\"Son of a Lion,\\" and \\"Paramedico,\\" he spent a lot of time on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Looking at the Khyber Pass Gilmour said he felt drawn towards the country but was unable to make a film there at the time as it was under Taliban control. In Pakistan he met with many refugees from Afghanistan and \\"found them to be the most engaging, generous, kind people.\\" He found they were deeply connected to their culture, music and poetry and that he felt more comfortable in the company of Pashtun men than men of his own country. In 2013 on a trip to Afghanistan Gilmour decided he had to create a film set there. Gilmour also worked as a paramedic in NSW for 20 years. This work brought him into close contact with Veterans of the War in Afghanistan, who shared with him their stories of the war as well as the guilt they experienced as a result of their actions. Gilmour combined the experiences of these veterans and the Afghan refugees he had met in Pakistan into the story of Jirga. He believed it was important to show people seemingly on opposite sides of the war, both suffering the same tragic consequences. Gilmour wrote a draft screenplay in Australia in conjunction with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, in order to create the most realistic story possible. The script was simply an outline which would be rewritten on location with the assistance of local people. \\"You can't sit 10 000 kms away from the country you're going to shoot in and write a script and put dialogue into the mouths of people who are speaking a language which is not your own,\\" Gilmour said. Gilmour was worried he would not find an actor willing to travel to a dangerous part of the world to perform such a role. He was introduced to Sam Smith by a friend who was cast after a \\"brilliant audition.\\" Smith bought his own costume as well as the guitar which was used in the film. In order to achieve the worn look it required, Smith painted it, rubbed it with sandpaper and soaked it in water at Maroubra beach in order to achieve the worn look. = Filming = The original plan was to shoot the film in Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan. Gilmour says the production was \\"lured to Pakistan with promise of considerable finance from a businessman in Islamabad.\\" According to Gilmour this businessman was going to invest \\"$100 000 U.S. dollars, which goes a long way in Pakistan.\\" Gilmour and Smith arrived in Pakistan to begin production. However the production was shut down as the Inter-Services Intelligence deemed the script too politically sensitive and prevented the shoot. The original script was set in a music school and was \\"a lot more campy, a lot more Baz Lurman style\\" according to Gilmour. After this set back ‚ÄúReturning to Australia to make alternative plans would‚Äôve been the sensible conclusion to our adventure. Instead, we went with Plan B and decided to shoot the whole film ourselves in Afghanistan,\\" said Gilmour. Gilmour spoke to his friend George Gittoes who lived in East Afghanistan and ran The Yellow House, an artists collective in Jalalabad, to get in contact with Afghan actors and filmmakers. Gilmour and Smith bought the only Sony A7S in Pakistan and two plane tickets to Kabul and headed to Afghanistan to shoot the film. The camera did not have many of the accessories traditionally utilised in a film production such as stabilisation. However it was compact which Gilmour said \\"was a blessing in disguise,\\" as it better suited their sporadic and dangerous filming schedule. Kandahar Province Once in Kabul Gilmour and Smith sat down with two Afghans, a tour guide and an actor they had hired and talked through the script, which was constantly revised with the assistance of Afghan locals. Gilmour and Smith then went to the Afghanistan Film Commission to acquire permits to film their movie. The Director of the Afghan Film Commission, Ibrahim Arify, was very skeptical, believing Gilmour would create a negative portrayal of Afghanistan. Arify asked to see the script before he granted the permits. Gilmour did not want to do this because the script included violence carried out by the Taliban and was sure the film would be rejected. However, when looking at Gilmour's passport Arify began to converse with him in German, a bond which Gilmour believes eventually convinced him to grant the permits. The Afghan people both added and removed scenes from the original screenplay. Some scenes which were removed included one in which Sher Khan looked longingly at a photograph of Marilyn Monroe and scenes involving the Taliban militants constructing improvised explosive devices. Shooting in Afghanistan was difficult. Without knowing what the security situation is going to be, who will be near the filming or where you're going to be able to shoot pre- planning became almost impossible. \\"People here check the daily security level like people back home check the weather forecast,\\" said Gilmour. Gilmour described the production as almost \\"like a news crew,\\" filled with constant tension and adrenaline. Additionally, the crew had to pay the Afghan Police and army in order to prevent their information being sold to Taliban forces. The harsh landscape and small crew and budget also presented numerous challenges. Gilmour had to be the camera operator and director, which he said took away from his ability to focus on either task completely. Plus, scenes which involved Smith sliding down a mountain of shale became very dangerous as Gilmour had to follow him doing the same thing while holding a camera. Gilmour said he does not believe the shots could have been completed on any other film set due to occupational health and safety requirements. A real Hotel was used as the set of the Hotel scenes in Kabul. The crew built their own reception in order to curtail their impact on the business, but had a few people attempt to check in at their fake desk. The receptionist was played by a Pashtun comedian Naqibullah Shinwari. The bellboy was played by a homeless gang leader called \\"Steel.\\" Gilmour had seen him in the film 'Snow Monkey,' and cast him for his stark appearance. Steel was 14 years old and had the nickname because he hid razorblades in his mouth, which he used to rob tourists. The script also went through large changes as Sher Alam Miskeen Ustad, who played the Taxi Driver, could not speak English. In the Screenplay the Taxi Driver and Mike conversed often. However, Gilmour found the fact Ustad could not speak English a refreshing change. \\"We were blessed by the way things went downhill for us,‚Äù he said. Instead the crew decided to focus on forms of non-verbal communication such as music. This change was amplified as Smith asked Gilmour if they could do many scenes without words. ‚ÄúI learned a lot from Sam about what an actor can do that doesn‚Äôt require dialogue. And I found that very interesting,‚Äù Gilmour said about the experience. Sher Alam was a former Mujahideen, and the head of Afghan Palace guards for President Daoud Khan. He had fought the Russians and was a revered Jihadi. However, when the American army invaded Afghanistan he said he would not fight for the Taliban and had to flee the country due to threats against his life and family. As a result, Sher Alam had to carefully consider reentering Afghanistan to film the movie, but eventually joined the cast. Village in Afghanistan Additionally, Sher Alam could not drive which was a requirement of his role. However, he said he would learn, \\"If I can fire and RPG, driving a car will be easy,\\". When Gilmour asked Sher Alam to sing while driving he almost crashed the Taxi and Smith had to steer the car from below the frame of the camera while Sher Alam pretended to drive. The lake scenes were filmed at Lake Band-e-Amir which Gilmour had visited in 2012. Standing by the lake he was inspired to share its beauty with the world and wrote the scenes which take place there in order to do so. While filming in Jalalabad the crew stayed at a hotel called The Spin Ghar. This hotel is the usual choice for Westerners staying in the city and is a frequent target of attacks and kidnapping attempts. The last foreign guest was an Australian aid worker, named Kerry Wilson, who was kidnapped. Smith said the hotel reminded him of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining. While staying at The Spin Ghar the Second Secretary at The Australian High Commission in Kabul, David Timbs, called Gilmour and said there were threats against the crew and that they needed to leave Jalalabad. Timbs suggested that Gilmour finish shooting the film in Morocco or Turkey but without the necessary funds Gilmour, Smith and the crew decided to continue shooting in Afghanistan. Gilmour asked Timbs to tell the American forces where the crew would be filming so that they weren't attacked by military helicopters or drones. The crew were going to shoot actors dressed as Taliban, carrying AK47's and kidnapping an Australian man, which would look extremely dangerous to surveying military vehicles who were not aware of the film. Timbs asked for the coordinates of the filming locations and passed the information on to American forces to help protect the crew. The Taliban actors were cast in the Rose Garden of the hotel. The first choice to play Sher Khan, the Taliban leader, was an actor from Nangahar. However, the village he was from was controlled by both Taliban and Daesh, and the actor was unable to work in the film as his clan would potentially be endangered by his collaboration. As a result, Basheer Safi, who had been cast as a Taliban henchman was moved to the role of Sher Khan. Production was postponed because the Provincial Governor of Nangahar had not signed for the police and army escorts the crew required. The mountains of Tora Bora where the crew wished to shoot was only 20 km from Daesh positions and it would have been extremely dangerous to film there without the army and police protection. While waiting for the escorts to be approved, Gilmour and Smith purchased two Fosters beers. Possession of Alcohol is illegal in Afghanistan, and especially dangerous in the strictly Islamic, Jalalabad. As a result, the beers had been purchased on the black market, smuggled in the floor of a taxi and discovered by Afghan Police who had to be bribed in order to reach the two Australians. After this journey the two beers cost U.S. $114. However, the small taste of home relaxed the two Australians, and Gilmour said it was well worth the price. The next day the escorts were approved and the crew began to film the Taliban scenes in Buddhist caves in the mountains of Tora Bora. Smith had Gastroenteritis and as a result refused to eat the chicken prepared for the scenes. He ate some bread and pretended to eat the chicken to avoid ingesting harmful bacteria. Two men were seen running away from the caves on the last day of shooting at the location. The police believed the men had placed I.E.D's in the cave and forced the crew to abandon the scenes left which took place in those caves. The crew had only two days to film all of the scenes which take place in the village of Ghazi Ghar which concludes the film. Many of the real villagers were used as actors in the film, which delayed shooting as they would often look directly into the camera and force a shot to be started again. However, Gilmour was glad that they used the actual villagers for actors, as the children who had been suggested by casting agents in Pakistan had all looked like \\"pudgy private school kids in Shiny clothes.\\" Instead, for the part of Ana Gul, the son of the man killed by Mike Wheeler, Gilmour cast Inam Khan, a child in the village whose face showed the signs of his hard life. A View of Spin Ghar The end of the film in which Mike Wheeler places himself at the hands of the Jirga was planned to be as real as possible. The crew briefed the actual village elders that this was a story about a former soldier who was returning to apologise for killing one of the men of their village. As a result, the Jirga scene played out like a real Tribal Council, with the elders debating how they would deal with such an event if it had actually occurred. Due to miscommunication some of the elders were not aware it was a fictional film and believed Smith was a real soldier returning to their village to confess to killing their people. After this scene the script called for Smith to carry a small lamb on his shoulders to be sacrificed for the village. However, Amirshah got a full sized sheep, which Smith could not carry on his shoulders. Amirshah said he got the large sheep because the animal was actually to be sacrificed and it was a hungry village that he wanted to be able to feed. The crew filmed the sheep being sacrificed by the village. While filming the final shots of a bus leaving the village the crew saw a U.S. army convoy approaching along the road, and a drone directly over their position. Gilmour ran for their car but was told to slow down as he looked suspicious and had to calmly walk to the car. The crew was able to finish shooting safely. Production was completed in 2017.  Release  Jirga premiered at the Sydney Film Festival on 8 June 2018 where it was the only Australian film in competition. Afterwards it was screened at the New Zealand Film Festival and then various other Film Festivals across Australia including CinefestOz, Melbourne International Film Festival and the Adelaide Film Festival. Jirga had its North American premier at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in Australian cinemas on 27 September 2018. = Critical reception = Jirga has a mixed but mostly positive critical reception. The film currently has a 67% critic rating on Rotten tomatoes and an 86% audience enjoyment. Luke Buckmaster of The Guardian gave the film 4/5 Stars. Harry Windsor of the Hollywood Report said the film \\"feels a little obvious and even patronizing: a redemption story by an Australian filmmaker that lets its Australian protagonist off the hook in a manner too neat to be dramatically interesting.\\" Paul Byrnes of the Sydney Morning Herald gives the film 4/5 and calling Gilmour a film maker \\"with a strange combination of talents: he‚Äôs very passionate about trying to make a better world; a little redemptive perhaps, being the son of an Anglican preacher, but crazy brave.\\" = Box office = Jirga has grossed $110,056 across 9 cinemas as of 14 October 2018. In the first week of release in Australia it was only screened in one cinema, where it made $2 495 in its first weekend, placing it as the 33rd highest-grossing film of the weekend within Australia. In its second weekend of release it expanded to eight cinemas and grossed $13 859, placing it as the 30th highest-grossing film of the weekend. = Accolades = Jirga won the Best Film Prize at CinefestOz, receiving $100 000 in prize money. The Jury Chair, Sigrid Thorton, said the film was a ‚Äúvisceral insight into an age- old culture [and] explores the nature and definition of forgiveness, leaving us with truly unforgettable cinematic moments.‚Äù It was also chosen as Australia's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.

They are aimed at listeners who prefer strong bass and are rated as one of the best earphones in its price range by CNET. The earphones contain single dynamic and 2 balanced armature drivers (Knowles BAs in the case of the F9 Pro) and come with two cables that use standard MMCX connectors. Both F9 and F9 Pro received overall highly positive reviews. However, it was mentioned that MMCX connectors are too tight.  Sound, design and accessories  F9 and F9 Pro have V-shaped yet reasonably well-balanced signature with increased bass and they utilize almost identical technological design. Both F9 and F9 Pro have a three-driver design with a single 9.2mm dynamic driver and two balanced armature drivers, however F9 Pro employs Knowles TWFK-30017-000 balanced armature drivers which results in further improvement of sound quality. Both versions come with two replaceable 1.2-meter cables, one is a standard MMCX 3.5mm TRRS with an inline mic and controls, made with tin-plated copper, the other is MMCX 2.5mm balanced cable made with woven core 5N purity oxygen-free copper, for use with some models of Astell & Kern portable music players as well as FiiO's players, DACs and amplifiers such as Q1 Mark II DAC & AMP. https://headfonics.com/2017/11/fiio-f9-review/ The structural design of the earphones includes ridges that were inspired by ripples that occur in water.https://www.androidguys.com/reviews/accessory-reviews/fiio-f9-pro- headphones-review/ The ridges were utilized for better aesthetics, improvement of structural strength while creating more space inside, securing the drivers better and eliminating internal resonances in sound. F9 Pro comes with a hard waterproof carrying case and a water-resistant neoprene carrying case, and includes 12 sets of tips, 3 bore sizes of silicone and 3 sets of memory foam tips. The F9 earphones come in two colors: grey and red whereby F9 Pro comes in titanium color.  Reception  Steve Guttenberg reviewed the Fiio F9 for CNET, remarking favorably on its build quality and design: \\"Build quality and design really are first rate, frankly the best I've seen for the money.\\" He also remarked favorably on the sound mentioning that bass is bold and stereo imaging is wide open. However, he added: \\"It won't please persnickety audiophiles\\" who are looking for an absolutely neutral and clinical sound. He also added: \\"The F9 was a pleasure to listen to with well- recorded music, the sound was positively vivid, lively, and fun. The bass was terrific, and there was lots of it, but it was well-behaved and tuneful.\\" Gabby Bloch reviewed the Fiio F9 Pro for MajorHiFi remarking favorably on the bass: \\"The lows might be the defining quality of the FiiO F9 PRO. While I wouldn‚Äôt call these headphones incredibly bass heavy, they do a fantastic job in the bass department.\\" He also noted that the imaging is precise, however soundstage doesn't have much width. He concluded: \\"But in general, these F9 PRO are great value for money and can compete with the higher priced market.\\" Berkhan reviewed the F9 Pro for Headfonia. Referencing his earlier F9 review, Berkhan noted the additional content: \\"The F9 Pro has a secondary zipped case other than the weatherproof case provided and this is a nice addition... Another addition is that foam tips are provided, and this is really nice if you like foams like me, and I think the F9 Pro blends very well with them.\\" He opened the discussion about sound quality with \\"The difference between the F9 and the FiiO F9 Pro lies in the Balanced Armature drivers. FiiO managed to get the Knowles BA drivers and put them inside the Pro. I was a little skeptical about whether these drivers would make a big difference or not but in the end, it actually turned out to be a bigger difference than how I imagined it.\\" After a detailed description of the sound signature he concluded with \\"I recommend everyone to skip the F9 and get the F9 Pro.

Elmore Court, Gloucestershire Guise was the only son of Sir John Guise, 2nd Baronet and his wife Elizabeth Howe, daughter of John Grubham Howe, MP of Compton Abdale, Gloucestershire and Langar, Nottinghamshire. He was granted the office of Constable of Gloucester Castle in May 1690, at the age of 12 and his father put him forward at the1695 general election for Cirencester. He was unsuccessful there. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father on 19 November 1695 and he tried to replace his father as MP for Gloucestershire by standing in the ensuing by-election. Despite spending ¬£1,000, he was defeated. Guise married by licence dated 4 June 1696, Elizabeth Napier, daughter of Sir Nathaniel Napier, 2nd Baronet, MP of Critchell More, Dorset. His father's estate was in a parlous financial state, and he was bound by his wife's trustees in a tight marriage settlement which forced him to retrench. He was still involved in politics but wavered between his Tory uncle Jack Howe and the local Whig gentry. His wife died in 1701 and he stood at the 1702 general election at Gloucestershire. Although he won more votes than his uncle, the Sheriff discounted many of them leaving him to petition unsuccessfully. Guise was finally elected Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire at the 1705 general election. He was re-elected at the 1708 general election but started to become disenchanted with his Whig colleagues. He was defeated in 1710. He and his estates were in poor health and to restore his financial situation, he married a wealthy twice-married widow. She was Anne, the daughter of Sir Francis Russell, 3rd Baronet MP of Strensham, Worcestershire whom he married by licence dated 2 January 1711. Her former husbands were Richard Lygon of Madresfield, Worcestershire, and Sir Henry Every, 3rd Baronet, of Egginton, Derbyshire. He was bound again in a strict marriage settlement and was also forced to give up the post of Constable of Gloucester Castle in 1711. In 1719 Guise bought the manors of Harleyford and Great Marlow from Sir James Etheridge, MP thus acquiring a strong political interest there. He was elected MP for Great Marlow at the 1722 general election. He was defeated in 1727 and did not stand for Parliament again. Guise died on 16 November 1732 leaving an only son by his first wife, John, who succeeded to the baronetcy.

History  Lantum was started by Melissa Morris in 2012. who previously worked at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Morris came up with the idea of Lantum in 2012 when she was working at McKinsey & Company and then at NHS London. She saw how expensive and wasteful the staffing industry was in healthcare and wanted to improve it. Lantum removes manual steps through automation and costs a fraction of a recruitment agency. The business started out in 2012 as a blog for doctors and named #1 healthtech start up to watch. The business now works across staff types, UK-wide and can be used in any healthcare organisation. In 2016 Network Locum changed their name to Lantum to reflect their strategy to becoming a software business rather than a labour marketplace. Their investors include Piton Capital, BGF Ventures, Samos and Beringea. In November 2017, Lantum was selected by NHS England to join the NHS Innovation Accelerator, a program which highlights leading technologies within the NHS and helps them scale. It is said to have has saved the NHS ¬£7.7 million and enabled more than 4.2 million GP appointments since 2012. The company claims it could save the NHS ¬£1 billion every year by cutting out traditional recruitment agencies. It has expanded beyond GP practices to 13 hospitals and plans to cover more. Lantum acquired Leicester-based rLocums in 2016 and popular GP invoicing tool Locum Organiser in 2017 to expand the product offering to its users. In 2018 it had 50 full-time employees.

Life  Sidonie Am√°lie Vilem√≠na Karol√≠na Julie Marie N√°dhern√° von Borut√≠n was the youngest child of landowner Karel Boromejsk√Ω Jan Ludv√≠k (1849‚Äì1895), Knight N√°dhern√Ω of Borut√≠n, and his wife Amalie Klein von Wisenberg (1854‚Äì1910), a daughter of the businessman Albert Klein von Wisenberg. Her older brothers were Jan Karel Ludv√≠k Sidonius Adalbert Julius Otmar Maria and Karel Maria Ludv√≠k Hubert Adalbert N√°dhern√Ω von Borut√≠n. N√°dhern√° gained literary fame through her friendship with the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, with whom she corresponded from 1906 until his death in 1926, and her friendship and later romantic relationship with the writer Karl Kraus. N√°dhern√° met Kraus on September 8, 1913, in Vienna's Caf√© Imperial. Their relationship, often filled with intensity and conflict, lasted until his death in 1936.Alexandra Pontzen: Retuschen am Bild der Geliebten from literaturkritik.de, March 2006 Kraus would likely have married her, but Rilke objected to Kraus' \\"unrepeatable difference\\" (a reference to his Jewish heritage).Rainer Maria Rilke ‚Äì Sidonie N√°dherny von Borutin: Briefwechsel 1906‚Äì1926, ed. In 1914, N√°dhern√° sought to make an influential marriage to a count that could have helped hinder World War I. She reconciled with Kraus in 1915, who wrote much of his drama The Last Days of Humanity at her residence, Janowitz Castle, but they separated again at the end of the war. In 1920, N√°dhern√° married the Austrian physician Maximilian von Thun und Hohenstein (1887‚Äì1935) at Heiligenkreuz Abbey, but the relationship did not last.Thun- Hohenstein from Genealogie.eu retrieved on 20. They separated a year later, and divorced in 1933. N√°dhern√° and Kraus reunited and split several more times, eventually reconciling one last time in 1927, although their relationship was no longer romantic. Sidonie von N√°dhern√°'s correspondence with Rilke and Kraus, now published, reveals her significance as a discussion partner, \\"creative listener,\\" and as a representative of late Habsburg culture. N√°dhern√° is not solely defined by her relationships with influential men; she was also an independent and culturally-invested woman. She organized many political and cultural salons at her family's estate near Prague. In addition to Rilke and Kraus, her circle also included the architect Adolf Loos, the writer Karel ƒåapek, the composer Dora Pejaƒçeviƒá, and the painter Max ≈†vabinsk√Ω. Janowitz Castle, ca. 1933In 1942, Janowitz Castle was seized by German troops and converted into the SS-Truppen√ºbungsplatz B√∂hmen, training grounds for the Waffen-SS. After the war, N√°dhern√° tried to reclaim her family's property, but was unsuccessful. The castle continued to be used by the army, and in 1948 was confiscated by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. N√°dhern√° was briefly arrested before fleeing to Great Britain through Bavaria.Beatrice von Matt: Vertrieben aus der Mitte der Welt. In 1950 she died impoverished while still in exile. In 1999, N√°dhern√°'s remains were brought back to Janowitz Castle and buried on the grounds. The castle and its surrounding lands were restored between 2000 and 2007, in a cooperative effort between the Czech Republic and Germany. Today it has become a cultural and scientific meeting place, much as it was during N√°dhern√°'s lifetime.  Literature  = Biography = * Alena Wagnerov√°: Das Leben der Sidonie N√°dhern√Ω.

His parents could not afford to send him to school, so he worked on the family farm until he was 17 years old and could support his own education. He studied medicine at Williams College, then studied theology at Andover Seminary. After graduating from Andover, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. Soon, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent him to establish missions for the Choctaw tribe in Mississippi, where he met and married Harriet Bunce. In 1831, all mission activity ceased while the Choctaws fulfilled an agreement with the United States government to sell their Mississippi homeland and relocate to Indian Territory (the present state of Oklahoma). Late in 1832, the Wrights decided to locate a new mission near present-day Eagletown, Oklahoma. From then until 1846, they built and operated a church and a school to minister to Choctaws living in the surrounding area. Wright named the mission Wheelock, in honor of Eleazar Wheelock, a friend and first president of Dartmouth College. Trained in medicine, Alfred Wright often needed to tend Choctaw patients who lived some distance from the mission. Harriet took on both teaching and administrative duties for the school, with only one other teacher to assist her. When Alfred was at the mission, he was often busy either preparing sermons or translating religious texts from English to the Choctaw language. Moreover, his physical health was compromised by illnesses through much of his life. Attacks of illness increased in frequency and intensity as he grew older, but he maintained a hectic pace as much as possible. He died on March 31, 1853, and was buried near the mission. Harriet tried to keep the mission going throughout the next year, but soon found her own health was failing. She returned to the East to live with members of her own family, and died in Florida in 1863. Early life and education Alfred Wright was born in Columbia, Connecticut on March 1, 1788. His parents were Jeriah (1788-1828) and Temperance (d. 1832) Wright, who were both professors of religion. The family owned a small farm and had eleven children, so could not afford to send Alfred to school. Instead he worked on the family farm until the age of seventeen. By then, he decided to earn his own education. His parents consented to his enrolling in Bacon Academy in Colchester, Massachusetts. Despite his frail health, he was also able to obtain a job teaching school part-time. He enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1810. Although he initially intended to study medicine and become a doctor, before he finished at Williams, he felt the call to study theology. After graduating from Williams College in September, 1812, he was employed as a preceptor of an academy at Hadley, Massachusetts until November, 1813, when he enrolled at Andover Seminary.\\"Alfred Wright.\\" In:Memoirs of American Missionaries formerly connected with the Society of Inquiry Respecting Missions in the Andover Theological Seminary.

Soon after his ordination, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions assigned him to establish a Presbyterian mission with the Choctaws in Goshen, Mississippi where he remained until 1823, when he was sent to the Mayhew Mission. While at Mayhew, Alfred met Harriet Bunce (1779-1863). They married in 1825. In 1826, Alfred's sister and two of his brothers died of typhus. Their father contracted the same disease, but his case was not fatal. =Move to Indian Territory= All mission operations ceased in 1831, as the inhabitants of the Choctaw Nation were required to move to their newly designated land in Indian Territory (present-day Southeastern Oklahoma). Alfred and Harriet, along with another missionary, Rev. Loring S. Williams, joined a group of Choctaws led by Thomas LeFlore to make the trip. The party did not reach Indian Territory until September 14, 1832, where they stopped overnight at the Bethabara Mission, near the community of Eagle (now known as Eagletown, Oklahoma, in present-day McCurtain County, Oklahoma. Alfred had taken ill again, and could not continue to travel the next day. Deciding to remain at Bethabara Mission, he told Harriet to go ahead with the rest of the party, and he would catch up with them later. The McCurtain party moved out as planned along the Military Trace toward Fort Towson. After the group crossed what is now called the Little River (known to the Choctaws as Boklusa or \\"Black River\\"), they found a piece of land about a mile beyond the river and above the flood level, which also had a spring flowing generously with cold water. Harriet decided to camp there with Anna and other travelers who wished to stay with her. The others helped Harriet build a cabin. This would become the site for the Wright's mission.Green, Len. \\"Wheeler Academy\\" Mike Boucher's Web Page. 1979. Accessed October 8, 2018. =Building the first Wheelock School= Alfred recovered slowly, and finally caught up with Harriet and her companions in late November, 1832. He conducted his first service at the new site on December 9, 1832. Since there was no church building yet, the service was held outdoors under a large oak tree. The congregation sat on logs that had been arranged in rows, and Rev. Wright used an empty 100-gallon barrel, turned upside down, as his pulpit. Concurrently, the Wright party decided to build a small log church and a larger log house for the family. Harriet insisted that a large room be attached to the house to serve as a day school. Rev. Wright decided to name the new mission church and school Wheelock, in honor of Eleazar Wheelock, who was not only a friend of Alfred, but, years later, also the first president of Dartmouth College. =Conversion to boarding school= The day school operated until 1839. By then, Harriet realized that this mode was failing to reach enough Choctaw children who needed and wanted to pursue an education. She persuaded Alfred that Wheelock should become a boarding school, because many of the potential students lived at such a distance that it was impractical to attend daily classes on foot. In bad weather, travel became nearly impossible, even on horseback. A log dormitory building was erected in 1839, then expanded over the next three years. A separate classroom building was also built. Instead of paying tuition, the children performed many of the chores need to operate the school: cooking, cleaning, providing firewood, etc. Class time was devoted to learning English, arithmetic, reading, writing and studying the Bible. In 1842, the Choctaw Nation adopted Wheelock into its school system, designating it as Wheelock Seminary, a school exclusively devoted to teaching Choctaw girls. =Rock Church= Rev. Wright began building a new Wheelock Rock Church in 1845. Stones were dragged by from the banks of Little River by teams of oxen. These were used to make the church walls thick. The floor and belfry were made from cypress wood and the roof was covered with sun-cured oak shakes. Wright carved a slogan, \\"Jehovah Jireh\\" (meaning \\"the Lord will provide\\") into the gable of the church. Rev. Wright delivered the first sermon in the new church during the late spring or early summer of 1846. Deaths of Alfred and Harriet Rev. Alfred Wright's attacks of illness increased in frequency and intensity as he grew older, yet he persisted in maintaining a hectic pace. He spent as much time as he could translating religious documents from English into the Choctaw language until he died on March 31, 1853, and was buried very near Wheelock church. Harriet tried to keep on with the school during 1854, but found her own health failing rapidly by the end of the school year. She went back east to live with members of her own family, and died on October 3, 1863 in Madison, Florida.

She is the Coordinator of the Association of Peul Women and Autochthonous Peoples of Chad (AFPAT) and served as the co-director of the pavilion of the World Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Initiative and Pavilion at COP21, COP22 and COP23.  Activism and advocacy  Ibrahim is an environmental activist working on behalf of her people, the Mbororo in Chad. She was educated in Chad's capital city of N'Djamena and spent her holidays with the indigenous Mbororo people, who are traditionally nomadic farmers, herding and tending cattle. During the course of her education, she became aware of the ways in which she was discriminated against as an indigenous woman and also of the ways in which her Mbororo counterparts were excluded from the educational opportunities she received. So in 1999, she founded the Association of Indigenous Peul Women and Peoples of Chad (AFPAT), a community-based organization focused on promoting the rights of girls and women in the Mbororo community and inspiring leadership and advocacy in environmental protection. The organization received its operating license in 2005 and has since participated in international negotiations on climate, sustainable development, biodiversity, and environmental protection. Her focus on environmental advocacy stemmed from her firsthand experience of the effects of global climate change on the Mbororo community, who rely on natural resources for their own survival and for the survival of the animals they care for. For years, they have been experiencing the effects of Lake Chad drying up; the lake is a vital source of water for people from Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, and is now 10% of its size from the 1960s. In a written testimony to the International Organization for Migration, Ibrahim emphasized that her people, and indigenous communities like her own, are \\"direct victims of climate change,\\" which has worked to displace them, forcing them to abandon their own lands in search of ones that can sustain their way of life. In that testimony, she also spoke of the consequences of climate change migration, which disproportionately leaves migrant communities vulnerable. Ibrahim has written on the importance of recognizing indigenous people's rights when crafting global climate change for a variety of outlets, including Quartz and the World Economic Forum's Agenda. Of particular concern to Ibrahim is the legal right of indigenous peoples to own and manage the lands where they live. Such legal rights guarantee that indigenous community have legal agency in economic developments that might displace them, such as oil drilling projects, mining, and hydropower plants. Ibrahim has worked collaboratively with UNESCO and the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee (IPACC) on a project to 3D map Chad's Sahel desert region, where 250,000 Mbororos currently live, relying on subsistence farming. The project combined 3D mapping technologies with indigenous scientific knowledge to develop a tool to sustainably manage the environment and empower indigenous voices‚Äîparticularly those of women‚Äîto make decisions on planning for a future of climate adaptation and mitigation. In an interview with BBC for BBC's 100 Women project, Ibrahim noted: \\"Every culture has a science. So it's really important for the indigenous voice to be there.\\" In 2016, Ibrahim was selected to represent civil society at the signing of the historic Paris Climate Agreement on April 22, 2016. In her statement at the signing, she noted: \\"Climate change is adding poverty to poverty every day, forcing many to leave home for a better future.\\" In 2019, she became one of the 17 people to be appointed as a advocate of Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations . SDG which is made up of 17 goals, adopted in 2015, is the United Nations way of trying to make the world a better place while the advocates were appointed to help spread awareness and seeing to it that these goals are achieved by playing their assigned roles.  Leadership  Ibrahim serves in a number of leadership capacities advocating for the importance of indigenous knowledge in mitigating the effects of climate change. She is co-Chair of the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change, representing the group at the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and of the Pan- African Alliance Climate Justice (PACJA), where she also acts as the chair of recruitment. She is also a member of the Policy Board United Nations: Indigenous Peoples Partnership (UNIPP) and of the Executive Committee for the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee (IPACC).  Awards and honors  In 2017, Ibrahim was recognized as a National Geographic Society Emerging Explorer, a program that recognizes and supports outstanding scientists, conservationists, storytellers, and innovators. In 2017, she was also featured as part of the BBC's 100 Women project, recognizing 100 influential and inspiring women every year. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women.

The main entrance of the cavern is located in the middle of the Cerro del Caballo of the Sierra de Nombre de Dios, approximately ) from the Sacramento River, northeast of the state capital Chihuahua City. This elaborate cave system came to official attention during the sixteenth century. The location might have previously been used for ceremonial purposes by Apache, Comanche and others of the many local indigenous people.  Cave structure  The site has been made accessible for the public. A secure trail has been made, that includes ramps and stairs and extends to almost ) in length and descends to a depth of around . Temperatures inside the caverns generally range from with a humidity of 30 to 70 %. A few tiny rivulets that drain mineralized water can be found. The site consists of 12 to 17 sizeable chambers and numerous small floors and galleries, primarily made of limestone. Other minerals, such as aragonite and selenite can be found in smaller quantities. Elements, such as zinc, iron, and sulfur have accumulated in walls. Over the course of 5 Million years, extended periods of water seepage have caused the formation of countless and often very illustrious speleotherms (Stalagmites and Stalactites). Some are bizarrely recognizable and as in many other places, these have been popularly named, like the La Torre de Pisa (Leaning Tower of Pisa) and El Quixote, a stalagmite shape that resembles the side view portrait of Miguel de Cervantes' famous novel character Don Quixote. Other notable deposit structures, that are open for the public include La Cocina (the Kitchen) - a cavern with formations, that have striking similarities to that of certain kinds of food. The walls are, among others, shaped like popcorn and dripping beer foam, a large stalagmite of almost height is shaped like an asparagus, and another, in height resembles a chicken leg. A massiv stalagmite nearly high, is called El Castillo (the Castle) with a curious side protrusion in the shape of a dragon's head.  History  The limestone of the Nombre de Dios Grottoes have formed since approximately 160 million years ago during the Late Jurassic, when the region of modern Chihuahua represented the sea floor of the Tethys Ocean. After the sea had slowly shifted and retreated, erosion played a defining factor in the formation of the huge caverns. The caverns were named in the sixteenth century, probably after the city of Chihuahua's Nombre de Dios suburb alongside San Juan Bautista del Norte, established by the Basque adventurer and later governor Francisco de Ibarra during one of his expeditions north of the Mexican state of Zacatecas. Another source claims that the name 'Nombre de Dios' relates to a group of Franciscans, who had travelled and survived a journey to what is now the city of Chihuahua, thanking God when they reached the settlement. The caverns were exploited by the Gambusinos - non trained, mineral seekers and small-scale miners, who extracted silver and other precious minerals, though of the poorest quality, from the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century. Prior to the official launch of the Nombre de Dios Grottoes Project at the end of the twentieth century, two groups of people were trapped due to poor preparations and died while attempting to explore the caves. Since 1996 professor Manuel Reyes of the Faculty of Engineering of the Autonomous University of Chihuahua made several visits to explore the chambers and do preliminary studies in order to prepare the caverns for public access, which he completed on the 5th July 1999. Organizations involved in the development of the project were the state government, the city hall, and the Autonomous University of Chihuahua. On October the 25th 2000, the Nombre de Dios Grottoes were opened to the public, welcoming over 3,000 visitors. The day of the inauguration was promoted via the local media on television, radio and in newspapers.

Main roles in the Italian repertoire were Bartolo in Rossini's Der Barbier von Sevilla, Dulcamara in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, Malatesta in his Don Pasquale, Fiesco in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, and the Inquisitor in his Don Carlos. He appeared as Pimen in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, Pommersfelden in Hindemith's Mathis der Maler, Schigolch in Alban Berg's Lulu, and Oberlin in Wolfgang Rihm's Jakob Lenz. In the premiere of the chamber opera Gest√∂rte Frequenzen by Harald Weiss in Braunschweig, he appeared as one of the Four Voices. He toured, mainly with the Oper Frankfurt, to London, Paris, Copenhagen, Athens, Barcelona and Rio de Janeiro. Morbach was also active in concerts and oratorios. He sang the bass solo in Bach's Christmas Oratorio in a concert which Karl Richter conducted at the Salzburg Gro√ües Festspielhaus on 10 December 1966, with Ursula Buckel, Hertha T√∂pper and Ernst Haefliger. He recorded the bass part in Beethoven's Missa solemnis, with G√ºnter Wand conducting the chorus and orchestra of the G√ºrzenich in Cologne, alongside Leonore Kirschstein, Jeanne Deroubaix and Peter Schreier. He is remembered as an actor with stage presence who charmed even in small roles. Morbach died on 4 August 2009. In 2010, the Braunschweig theatre showed a photo exhibition in his memory.

Key cutting (after cutting, the metalworking term for \\"shaping by removing material\\") is the primary method of key duplication: a flat key is fitted into a vise in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise, and the original key is moved along a guide, while the blank is moved against a wheel, which cuts it. After cutting, the new key is deburred: scrubbed with a metal brush to remove burrs which, were they not removed, would be dangerously sharp and, further, foul locks. Different key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators. Key duplication is available in many retail hardware stores and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available. In the UK, the majority of the mobile locksmiths will have a dual key cutting machine on their van. The key duplication machine will be able to cut both cylinder and mortise keys, as these are the most popular types of keys in circulation. However, very few will carry a laser key cutting machine, which is sometimes needed to cut high security keys. Certain keys are designed to be difficult to copy, for key control, such as Medeco; while others are simply stamped \\"Do Not Duplicate\\" to advise that key control is requested, but in the US, this disclaimer has no legal weight. Helping Notes Rather than using a pattern grinder to remove metal, keys may also be duplicated with a punch machine (the Curtis key clipper is a recognised example). The key to be duplicated is measured for the depth of each notch with a gauge and then placed into a device with a numeric slider. The slider is adjusted to match the corresponding measured depth and a lever is depressed, which cuts the entire notch at once. As the lever is raised the key automatically advances to the next indexed position and the slider is adjusted appropriately to the next measured depth. This cycle is continued until the key is complete. Duplicating keys by this process is more labor intense and requires somewhat better trained personnel. However, keys made in this fashion have clean margins and the depth of the notches are not subject to wear induced changes encountered when heavily worn keys are duplicated using a pattern grinder. Keys may also be made in this fashion without an original as long as the depth of each notch and the type of key blank are known. This is particularly useful for institutions with a great number of locks for which they do not want to maintain a wide variety of archived copies. Code books or on-line resources may be used to program the key clipper/punch settings from the code stamped on the lock, listed in the owner's manual, or available from the vehicle's VIN. Mechanical key duplicating machine invented in 1917 A machine permitting rapid duplication of flat metal keys, which contributed to the proliferation of their use during the 20th century, may have been first invented in the United States in 1917 (image to the left): In recent years, dual key cutting machines have come on to the market, enabling cutting of both mortice and cylinder keys on one machine. These machines are primarily manufactured in the Far East and save a key cutter a significant amount of money compared with using two separate dedicated machines. Do not duplicate key A minuteKEY fully-automated self-service key duplication kiosk at a Menards in Gillette, Wyoming A \\"do not duplicate\\" key (or DND key, for short) is one that has been stamped \\"do not duplicate\\", \\"duplication prohibited\\" or similar by a locksmith or manufacturer as a passive deterrent to discourage a retail key cutting service from duplicating a key without authorization or without contacting the locksmith or manufacturer who originally cut the key. More importantly, this is a key control system for the owner of the key, such as a maintenance person or security guard, to identify keys that should not be freely distributed or used without authorization. Though it is intended to prevent unauthorized key duplication, copying DND keys remains a common security problem. = U.S. restrictions = There is no direct legal sanction in the US for someone who copies a key that is stamped do not duplicate (unless it is an owned key), but there are patent restrictions on some key designs (see \\"restricted keys\\"). The Associated Locksmiths of America, ALOA, calls DND keys \\"not effective security\\", and \\"deceptive because it provides a false sense of security.\\" deals with United States Post Office keys, and deals with United States Department of Defense keys. Restricted key A restricted keyblank has a keyway for which a manufacturer has set up a restricted level of sales and distribution. Restricted keys are often protected by patent, which prohibits other manufacturers from making unauthorized productions of the key blank. In many cases, customers must provide proof of ID before a locksmith will cut additional keys using restricted blanks. Some companies, such as Medeco High Security Locks, have keyways that are restricted to having keys cut in the factory only. This is done to ensure the highest amount of security. These days, many restricted keys have special in-laid features, such as magnets, different types of metal, or even small computer chips to prevent duplication. Another way to restrict keys is trademarking the profile of the key. For example, the profile of the key can read the name of the manufacturer. The advantage of a trademark is that the legal protection for a trademark can be longer than the legal protection for a patent. However, usually not all features of the profile are necessary to create a working key. By removing certain unnecessary features, a non restricted profile can be derived, allowing the production and distribution of non restricted key blanks.

The forest is nearby the city of Onamia and is along the Rum River, just downstream (south) of Mille Lacs Lake. The forest is managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The forest is home to many Northern hardwoods such as maple, oak, ash, elm and basswood that occupy most of the upland areas while tamarack and black spruce are found in lowland and marshy areas.https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/forest.html?id=sft00043#homepage History The original landscape consisted of predominately virgin White pine, red oak, and white oak. Much of the original forest was cut down for timber and floated down the Rum River and Ann River to sawmills downstream. Following the deforestation of the area, farms were established along the Rum River area. However, many of these farms failed in the 1930s and were abandoned. In 1935, the Minnesota Legislature established both the Rum River and Mille Lacs State Forest. In 1963, both of these forests were combined into the Rum River State Forest.http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/state_forests/sft00043.pdf Recreation Popular outdoor recreational activities in the forest include dispersed camping. Trails are designated for such varied uses such as mountain biking and hiking. In the wintertime, trails are designated for cross-country skiing and snowmobiling.

He is the creator of the websites Contrail Science and Metabunk, for which he investigates and debunks pseudoscientific claims such as chemtrails, UFOs, and conspiracy theories. He has appeared in various media as an expert analyst and science communicator. He lives in Sacramento, California. Career =Neversoft= West co-founded Neversoft Entertainment in July 1994 with Joel Jewett and Chris Ward. The video game development company, known for Spider-Man and the Tony Hawk's (West was heavily involved in the programming of the first five games of this series) and Guitar Hero video game franchises, was acquired by Activision in October 1999, its studio merged with Infinity Ward on May 3, 2014 and was made defunct on July 10, 2014. =Websites= West became interested in the chemtrail conspiracy theory while studying aviation weather for his pilot‚Äôs license. He created the website ‚ÄúContrail Science‚Äù with the aim of explaining contrails and debunking chemtrail theories. He believed initially that he could explain and debunk these theories quite quickly, but they were more resilient than he‚Äôd anticipated: he has now spent more than 10 years covering the topic. The discussion on the ‚ÄúContrail Science‚Äù website eventually expanded to include other conspiracy theories, including that of 9/11. So West decided to create another website, ‚ÄúMetabunk‚Äù, to expand the discussion to other alternative beliefs. Metabunk covers such topics as pseudoscience, UFOs and the paranormal. The website also includes a forum, ‚ÄúSkydentify‚Äù, where West invites people to send photos and videos of UFOs and supposed ghosts. He analyses these using his background in video game programming and Photoshop, and then he and other forum members attempt to explain what the photos and videos are actually depicting. They also discuss the best way to communicate the results of their debunking investigations. Analysis from West and other experts on Metabunk has been cited in generalist publications. West describes the objective of his work as attempting to get people out of the ‚Äúrabbit hole‚Äù of conspiratorial thinking. ‚ÄúChemtrails is a surprisingly popular theory; it‚Äôs right up there with things like the 9/11 conspiracy theories,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt all stems from a fundamental distrust of science and authority. You are always going to get a percentage of people who are true believers. My goal is to minimize that as much as possible, stop people falling for it, and help them get out as easily as possible.‚Äù He also created the online forum morgellonswatch.com to dispel the myths and misinformation surrounding the unconfirmed skin condition, Morgellons. =Academic work= West speaking at CSICon in 2018 In August 2016, West co-authored a paper with climate scientists Ken Caldeira, Christine Shearer, and Steven J. Davis published in the journal Environmental Research Letters titled Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program (SLAP). The objective of the paper was to produce a peer-reviewed expert response to the chemtrail theory. The authors surveyed experts on atmospheric chemistry and deposition to scientifically evaluate the claims of chemtrail conspiracy theorists. Upon publication, it was recognized as the first study by a major science organization on the topic. Its conclusion reported that ‚Äú76 out of 77 (98.7%) scientists that took part in this study said there was no evidence of a SLAP, and that the data cited as evidence could be explained through other factors, such as typical contrail formation and poor data sampling instructions presented on SLAP websites‚Äù Data science company Altmetric, rated the paper in the top 5% of all research, in terms of interest generated and it has been cited many times by scientific publications and news outlets. This included the New York Times, where West said the new study should help sway people who might otherwise be convinced by a chemtrails website. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to hold back the tide to a certain degree, and hopefully have less people fall into that way of thinking.‚Äù West has written articles for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's journal Skeptical Inquirer, such as ‚ÄúCurated Crowdsourcing in UFO Investigations‚Äù where he discusses the Skydentify forum and ‚ÄúIn Defense of Debunkers‚Äù in which he talks of the role of skepticism and of debunking and the importance of communication. In 2016, West delivered a presentation at CSICon titled ‚ÄúExpert Elicitation vs. Chemtrails‚Äù in which he discussed his 2016 scientific paper on climate engineering. = Books = In 2018, West authored Escaping the Rabbit Hole. How to Debunk Conspiracy Theories Using Facts, Logic, and Respect with the goal of helping people understand and explain conspiracy theories, and then pass those explanations onto others. In a review of the book, British actor Stephen Fry wrote ‚ÄúMick West demonstrates with exquisite style, wit, and insight how those three rare and valuable species, Fact, Logic and Respect (each now on the very brink of extinction) have in harness the power to shine light into darkness and dispel the miasma of bias, superstition and balefully proud ignorance that is threatening to poison our age.‚Äù An extended excerpt from this book was published in Salon. The book was featured in an analysis released by the University of McGill Office for Science and Society in 2018. Celestia Ward points out that \\"Debunking conspiracy theories is a lot of work. But it's worthwhile if you are helping a loved one out of a mindset that can cause them harm. Mick West has shouldered a tremendous amount of the work himself, summarizing some conspiracy beliefs and demonstrable facts to refute those beliefs....\\" = Podcast = West started a podcast in April 2019, \\"Tales from the Rabbit Hole,\\" in which he interviews \\"conspiracy culture\\" guests. = Media = West is often cited as an expert analyst on chemtrails and UFOs by the media. In 2010, he appeared on CBS evening news and KPCC radio news to comment on a viral video of what appeared to be a \\"mystery\\" missile launch. In September 2016, Radio New Zealand profiled West as a science writer and someone who ‚Äúis dedicated to the art of debunking wild theories that circulate online and helping other people do the same, with his website, Metabunk.‚Äù In the interview he described how his passion for debunking comes from a concern that real problems are being ignored because science is ignored. In particular he talked about the harm conspiracy theorists can cause when they accuse the families of victims of gun massacres as being crisis actors. He also explained that when ‚Äúdealing with conspiracy theorists the best thing is to be polite. You‚Äôve got to be a kind of gentleman scientist. If people are polite then you will get listened to. Never misrepresent yourself, never lie, never fake evidence, never indulge in hoaxes. You‚Äôve got to be 100% beyond reproach at all times.‚Äù He has also made a number of appearances on podcasts discussing his life and debunking career. These include being interviewed by Richard Saunders on the Skeptic Zone and Benjamin Radford on Squaring the Strange, as well as Something You Should Know. He has made several appearances on the Joe Rogan Experience to discuss various conspiracy theories. In 2013, West appeared in the documentary film \\"Overcast‚Äù as a rebuttal to promoters of chemtrail conspiracy theories. =Approach to debunking= West grew up in the small town of Bingley, on the outskirts of Bradford, England. As a child he was fascinated by the paranormal, UFO's and stories of alien abductions, also believing he had psychic abilities. As he grew older, he began to realise that these phenomena weren't real, and instead, that there were rational explanations to explain them. \\"I used to believe in all this stuff and then I stopped believing in all this stuff, and I guess just figuring out why this stuff was wrong became interesting to me.\\" In early adulthood, he found himself using a pre-internet, modem-based bulletin board called FidoNet to argue with people who were using it to spread conspiracy theories. In 2003, after resigning from Neversoft, his interest in debunking took hold. \\"I retired, I had lots of spare time, I didn't have vast other interests that I was pursuing, and so I was able to focus on these things. I could focus on Morgellons, and I wrote like a hundred little articles on Morgellons. Because I have this background in video game programming and debugging and investigating things, I was able to do fairly deep technical investigations of things.\\" He attempts to interact with his interviewees and his audience on his various media with empathy to help them see reality. These people, he says, see a different version of reality: \\"They prefer the one where the government is evil. Now, it doesn't mean the government isn't evil, it doesn't mean that people in power aren't corrupt, it doesn't mean politicians aren't corrupt, but it also doesn't mean that they planted bombs in the World Trade Center. Just because politicians are corrupt, it doesn't necessarily follow the World Trade Center was a controlled demolition.\\" References External links * Metabunk * Contrail Science * Morgellons Watch * Mick West on YouTube * Mick West on Twitter  Podcast: Tales from the Rabbit Hole Category:Living people Category:British sceptics Category:Critics of conspiracy theories Category:UFO skeptics Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People in the video game industry Category:Video game designers ","title":"Mick West"},{"id":"58697896","title":"I'll Never Love Again"},{"id":"58697901","text":"220px Merry Company is a c.1620-1622 painting by the Dutch artist Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech, now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.

Hirsh. She was born in Waltham, Massachusetts and raised in nearby Newton. Hirsh is best known for her \\"critically-acclaimed\\" novel Kabul and Dreaming Back, and for her work in championing cultural causes in Boston's South End.  Personal life The fourth of six siblings, Mimi Hirsh was born in Waltham, Massachusetts and raised in nearby Newton, attending Catholic schools and then Boston College where she became an editor for the student magazine, The Heights. Her father, Edward Hirsh had been the chairman of the English Department at Boston College, and her mother, Margaret (n√©e Kelly) had worked as an administrator at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, a community teaching medical centre in Newton. Hirsh met her future husband, poet and composer, David Montenegro in 1980 and married him in 1985. They shared a studio work space at Boston Center for the Arts. She spent most of her adult life in Boston's South End, moving to Dorchester in Boston around 2014. Ms. Hirsh died aged 68 on Friday 8 April 2016 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, after a brief illness, due to complications from an ulcer.  Career  Until around 1986, shortly after her father died, Hirsh worked as a press aide to the welfare commissioner in the state government. Though Hirsh told the Boston College magazine, at the time, that she loved this work, with its politics, writing and excitement, she wrote that she \\"was about to turn 30 and mortality loomed large\\" and that she \\"didn‚Äôt want to dodder off into the sunset mumbling about the novels I could have written if I'd tried.\\" In 1986, Hirsh had her first novel set in Afghanistan, Kabul published, followed in 1993 by Dreaming Back, which was set in New Mexico and drew its title from a passage by poet W. B. Yeats: \\"In the Dreaming back, the Spirit is compelled to live over and over again the events that had most moved it.\\"  Reception  The Boston Globe described Hirsh's stories, and her own decision to devote herself to writing, as \\"layered in nuance and context.\\" =Kabul= Kirkus Reviews expressed the opinion that Kabul is \\"A meaty, invigorating, politically speculative first novel‚Äîwith a rich ambiance of place and mores, the drama of dusty perils and rumbling tanks, and a clutch of giant family members‚Äîintelligent, aching and doomed.\\" Wendy Smith, in The New York Times was satisfied with the factual background presented in Kabul, but was of the opinion that the principal characters are too \\"spoiled and egocentric\\", and that though this may be historically accurate, the author fails to \\"elicit our sympathy for such unappealing characters.\\" Theodore L. Eliot Jr., who was United States Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1973‚Äì78, replied to the review in The New York Times. Eliot stated that he had been asked to read the book and check the accuracy of historical facts. He refuted the reviewer's assertion that the last pre-Communist government had \\"collapse[d] in corruption\\", and stated that M. E. Hirsh had written no such thing. Eliot defended the author, saying that he \\"found her treatment of the overthrow of that government impressively sensitive to the subtle forces that were in play.\\" He added that the author \\"does a fine job of portraying the tensions felt by younger, middle-class Afghans, torn between their sense of duty and responsibility to a traditional culture and their modern values (women's rights, for example) derived from their exposure to the West.\\" Debra Denker, reviewing the book for the Los Angeles Times described it as engrossing, dramatic, excellently researched, and tightly woven, though ‚Äì for her ‚Äì some elements, such as strings of coincidences, strained credulity. The reviewer pointed out that \\"fiction can often make remote realities more immediate, and M. E. Hirsh's novel is a heartfelt and commendable attempt to personalize and make sense of the Machiavellian intrigues leading up to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\\" Author, reporter and columnist Marjorie Williams, writing in The Washington Post, said that \\"it is Kabul's chief virtue that it is the genuine article‚Äîthe fully imagined, closely researched, energetically written story fixed in a¬∑distinctive place and time,\\" (PDF containing embedded review). and that though the book is \\"inconsistently dramatic, [...] it's never hard to pick up, and often hard to put down.\\" Williams was, however, of the opinion that the scenes set in Afghanistan, which occupy half the book, are not as successful as those set in Moscow and New York. =Dreaming Back= Reviewing Dreaming Back, Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"The links between CIA experiments with LSD back in the 50s and superconductors that could revolutionalize contemporary computer technology are slow to emerge in this dense, opaque story, but the weighty sense of individual consequence is well worth the wait. Smaller in scale than Kabul (1986) but just as resonant.\\" Publishers Weekly expressed the opinion that \\"Readers who want a straightforward, gripping yarn are advised to look elsewhere; those interested in the issues Hirsh raises‚Äîand able to bear the prose's intermittent elliptical pretentiousness‚Äîmay find this mystery-with-a-message worth their while.\\"  Works  = Novels = *Kabul (Atheneum, 2 June 1986) *Dreaming Back (Atheneum, 11 October 1993) = Reviews = * Kara Kush by Idries Shah (Los Angeles Times, 24 August 1986) Page 2 is also archived here on the Wayback Machine. * Soviet Expansion in the Third World: Afghanistan: A Case Study by Nasir Shansab (Los Angeles Times, 28 June 1987)  References  Category:People from Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Boston College alumni Category:Writers from Massachusetts Category:20th-century American novelists Category:2016 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Mimi Hirsh"},{"id":"58697927","text":"The 1985 Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship was the 91st staging of the Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Kilkenny County Board.

Kirschner is an NBC News/MSNBC legal analyst and former U.S. Army prosecutor. Education Kirschner attended Washington and Lee University, where he studied journalism. While at Washington and Lee, he was awarded an Army ROTC scholarship and joined the Virginia Beta chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He played for the Washington and Lee Generals football team as an offensive lineman-center all four years and was elected by his teammates as one of three team captains for his senior year. Kirschner earned Old Dominion Athletic Conference all-conference honors his sophomore, junior and senior years and was named a first-team Kodak All-American college football player his senior year. He was inducted into Washington and Lee University's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009. Upon graduating in 1984, Kirschner obtained an educational deferment of his military service to attend law school. While attending New England Law Boston he earned two American Jurisprudence awards (in trial practice and will, estates and trusts) and was designated a Board of Trustees Scholar after his 2L year. He received his J.D. degree cum laude in 1987 and entered active duty with the Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army in January 1988. Career Upon entering active duty as an Army JAG, Kirschner served his first tour at Fort Richardson (Alaska), serving as an Army prosecutor. In that capacity he investigated and prosecuted court-martial cases and served as legal advisor to the post's many commanding officers. After three years in that assignment, Kirschner was transferred to the U.S. Army's Legal Services Agency in Falls Church, Virginia, where he served as a government appellate attorney handling criminal appeals of court-martial convictions. In that assignment, Kirschner handled espionage and death penalty cases among others. After more than six years active duty service, Kirschner was honorably discharged from the Army and, in June 1994, joined the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia office as a federal prosecutor/Assistant U.S. Attorney. After a few early rotational assignments, Kirschner joined the USAO's Homicide Section led at the time by Robert Mueller, III. Kirschner spent 24 years at the DC USAO, prosecuting lengthy RICO trials in DC Federal Court and murder/conspiracy/obstruction of justice cases in DC Superior Court. Kirschner prosecuted more than 50 murder trials, served as Deputy Chief of the Homicide Section for four years and Chief of the Homicide Section from 2004 ‚Äì 2010. He retired from the DC USAO on June 1, 2018. Kirschner received the Harold J. Sullivan Award for Fairness, Ethics and Trial Excellence in 2017 and the John F. Evans Award for Trial Excellence in 2001, both from the Assistant U.S. Attorney's Association; the John F. Evans Award for Trial Excellence the Chief of Police Medal of Honor in 2009 and 2010 from the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department, and; was inducted as a fellow into the American College of Trial Lawyers in 2018. Notable cases include: U.S. v. London Ford - A landmark gang case involving the District of Columbia's first urban warfare theory of homicide liability. U.S. V. Andre Burno - Motivated by a desire to steal a police officer's Glock firearm, the defendant ambushed an on-duty police officer, shooting him in the neck. The case/defendant is the subject of an Emmy-Award-winning HBO documentary titled, ‚ÄúThug Life in DC.‚Äù U.S v. Jose Rodriguez-Cruz - In 2009, EPA employee Pam Butler disappeared. In 2016, the cold case was revived and enough evidence was developed to charge Ms. Butler's boyfriend with her murder. Although Ms. Butler's body was never found, the defendant pleaded guilty in 2017. The case is the subject of a Dateline NBC documentary set to air in November 2018. U.S. v. Albrecht Muth - A controversial case involving a highly skilled conman in elite DC political circles who murdered his elderly, socialite wife. Kirschner tried the defendant in absentia from his hospital bed after he had starved himself into physical incapacitation. The case is the subject of a major motion picture directed by and starring Christoph Waltz titled, \\"Georgetown\\" and released in April 2019. Film portrayal In the 2019 film Georgetown, directed by Christoph Waltz, Kirschner is portrayed by Paulino Nunes in his role as the prosecutor in the Albrecht Muth case. Described by the website ComingSoon.net, Georgetown is inspired by the true story of Albrecht Muth, who was convicted in 2011 for murdering his much older socialite wife in Washington, D.C. Based on one of the city's most sensational scandals of recent times, the film will tell the story of an unconventional love affair, an outsider striving for acceptance and the desperate struggle for significance on every level.‚Äù Media commentary For developments with the Special Counsel investigation (2017‚Äìpresent), Kirschner has provided legal commentary on national news media programs such as MSNBC‚Äô s Morning Joe, MSNBC Live and Hardball with Chris Matthews, CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper and The Stephanie Miller Show. In mid-September 2020, Kirschner argued that grand juries should be convened and President Donald Trump charged with manslaughter or murder for deaths due to his mishandling of the COVID pandemic.

Its central panel of the Madonna and Child, signed \\"OPVS CAROLI CRIVELLI VENETI\\", is now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. The altarpiece's other panels (Michael the Archangel, Saint Jerome, Saint Peter Martyr and Saint Lucy) were seen in Rome by Luigi Lanzi in 1789 before being moved to Florence with the Rinuccini family. In 1868 it moved from the Demidov collection to the National Gallery in London, where they still hang. The four panels entered the National Gallery with a central panel. The four panels were topped by four semi-circles and a Neo-Gothic cusp above Mary. Above this register was a final one of four more full-length saints. In time the work was recognised as an arbitrary assembly of panels from different altarpieces. Orsini and Lazzari mention an altarpiece produced in 1476 for the church of San Domenico in Ascoli Piceno - Dominican saints in the lower two registers of the Demidov polyptych confirm that they come from the so-called 1476 Altarpiece. Lazzari (1724) and Ricci (1834, on Bartoli's earliest testimony) also mention a second altarpiece by the artist in the same church, also dating to 1476, now known as the Saint Peter Martyr Altarpiece'. It is therefore theorised that the altarpieces were both dismantled during rebuilding of the church in 1776, then sold to the antiquarian Grossi who sold all the panels separately and grouped some of them into the altarpiece that Cardinal Zelada bought from him. Federico Zeri and Rodolfo Pallucchini then joined the altarpieces together, initially referring to the first (the high altarpiece), the Piet√† in the Metropolitan Museum, and then to the Madonna in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, already in the Esterhazy collection. The altarpieces also had to have a predella each, now all lost. In 1961 the National Gallery dismantled the panels by reconstructing them into two separate altarpieces.

The book is the author's compilation of the account's best tweets from its first ten years, alongside new original illustrations. The tweets are sorted into sections by topic. The book was self-published in paperback and ebook formats. According to the preface, dril published the book in print so that his tweets would survive a future societal collapse and digital dark age. The book received generally positive reviews, with praise directed at dril's distinctive humor and creativity. Although the book's written material was already available online for free, critics generally agreed that the compilation's quality and dril's influence justified its publication.  Development and publication  The @dril Twitter account began posting in September 2008; in the years that followed, dril became well-known for his idiosyncratic humor and accrued a cult following. In January 2017, dril opened a Patreon account for fans to make monthly payments in support of his tweets and future projects, including \\"video, illustration, and long-form writing.\\" On the Patreon, dril described his plans for two book projects: dril self- published the compilation project as Dril Official \\"Mr. Ten Years\\" Anniversary Collection in August 2018. It was released in paperback and ebook formats. It was initially made available to download for Amazon Kindle, but was subsequently withdrawn from that format. On his Patreon, dril explained that the Kindle version was withdrawn because it was \\"displaying incorrectly\\". Afterward, the book became available as a PDF.  Content  The 420-page book compiles 1,500 of the account's best posts from its first ten years, as selected by the author. The compiled tweets are sorted into topic areas by chapter, which are presented alphabetically. Individual tweets do not include the date they were originally published. The book features 70 new illustrations by dril. According to dril's preface, he published the book to preserve his posts in the event of a societal collapse that takes Twitter's servers offline. dril predicts a \\"miserable, Offline Hell\\" of the future in which his posts have been \\"Permanently Decommissioned by FEMA due to some Jade Helm 15 bull shit\\", referring to conspiracy theories about FEMA camps and the Jade Helm 15 military training exercise. dril says the book is a means to preserve his content in the aftermath of a civilization collapse and digital dark age: The book is sorted into 72 sections, sorted alphabetically by topic or theme:  Reception  In an article for Vice, Peter Slattery wrote \\"[o]rdinarily, throwing together a book full of old tweets would seem pretty lazy, but given how much legit influence dril has had on Twitter humor and online culture at large, everybody probably owes the account at least 20 bucks.\\" Reviewing the book for Vice, Rachel Pick concluded that the book was worth it \\"so that one day, centuries from now, after the bombs go off and EMPs take out the electrical grid, long after Twitter has died, a solitary wanderer may find a scrap of paper buried in the ruins of my Brooklyn apartment building, and they will lift it up to the dying sun and squint through their protective goggles to read\\" a dril tweet. Bijan Stephen at The Verge said that, \\"[d]espite literally being a book of tweets, Mr. Ten Years chronicles Dril's rise from a funny writer to a writer who's defined the way people write and think about internet culture.\\" Writing for HuffPost, Sean T. Collins called the book \\"simply too funny for me to read for more than a page or two at a time without laughing so hard, I feel physically ill.\\" At Geek.com, Jordan Minor called the book a \\"glorious exception\\" to the expectation that online jokes taken offline can only result in \\"cursed\\", mediocre \\"nightmares like Shit My Dad Says: The TV Show\\".

In its territory lay an important necropolis.  Etymology  According to Pausanias the name of the deme came from Ceramus, son of Dionysus and Ariadne, while Herodotus claims that the name derives from the term Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ (k√®ramos, \\"terracotta\\" or \\"ceramics\\"), due to the numerous clay deposits and potters' shops in the area.  Description  The place was called one of the most beautiful places in Athens, and it was important for the festival of Panathenaic Games, whose procession stopped at the outside the Dipylon Gate, for the procession of the Eleusian Mysteries and for the torch of the Promethians, which passed through here before reaching the Acropolis. According to tradition, Androgeus, son of Minos, was murdered here; his murder led to the custom of sacrificing seven boys and seven girls a year to the Minotaur. Diogenes lived here for a long time and, according to a legend, once prayed to the many statues present in the deme to be able to endure a defeat. Also in this deme the tyrant Hipparchus was killed by Harmodius and Aristogeiton: in their honor a statue was erected near the Gate. The site of Ceremeis is located northwest of Dipylon.

Born into a wealthy family, Karelin became radicalized in his youth and trained as a lawyer. Passing through a series of radical political affiliations, he was subjected to political persecution, leading him to flee into exile in Paris from 1905 to 1917. There, Karelin founded a group of expatriate Russian anarchists, the Brotherhood of Free Communists (Bratstvo Vol‚Äônykh Obshchinnikov), which numbered Volin among its members. The Brotherhood split acrimoniously in 1913 over questions of leadership, accusations of antisemitism, and rumors of infiltration by the Okhrana. After the Russian Revolution, Karelin returned to Moscow. There, in 1918, he founded the All- Russian Federation of Anarchists, and he became editor of its press organ, Vol'naia Zhizn (Free Life), published in Moscow from 1919 to 1921. Controversially, Karelin urged anarchists to cooperate with the Bolshevik government, gaining a seat on the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. Karelin died of a cerebral hemhorrage in 1926.  Writings  Karelin was a prolific writer and theorist whose interests ranged from economics to mysticism. In 1921, he published a utopia, Rossiia v 1930 godu (Russia In 1930).

The son of a Norman hosier, he took holy orders in Rouen, took up his first post as a teacher of rhetoric at Vernon and in 1768 moved to the royal college in Nancy. He may also have been a tutor to the younger Lameth brothers, and in 1782 was appointed curate of Cergy. When the Estates General were summoned, he was elected to sit for the First Estate representing Senlis. In December 1789 he became secretary of the new National Assembly and joined the ecclesiastial committee, and in December 1790 he took the oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. He was elected constitutional bishop of Oise on 21 February 1791. On 4 September 1792 he was elected to represent Oise in the National Convention, receiving 315 out of 627 votes. During the trial of Louis XVI he voted against appeal to the people, for the death penalty and against reprieve. In 1793 he was sent as a representant en mission first to Ardennes and then to Marne. He renounced his religious vows while he was away from Paris, and shortly afterward married the daughter-in-law of the mayor of Givet, Marie-Odile Briquelet. His main task in the North was to deal with traitors and counter-revolutionaries, and he also erected a temple to Reason in Sedan. In April 1794 he returned to the Convention, joined the public education committee, and worked on new primary school textbooks. Like many representants en mission who had made themselves unpopular outside Paris, he was denounced after the Thermidorean reaction and arrested on 9 August 1795, at the same time as Joseph Fouch√©. However thanks to an amnesty decree he was freed again 4 Brumaire Year IV (26 October 1795). He was employed for some months as a geographer by the War Ministry and then took up a post as a school teacher in Versailles. In 1797 he was given a new post as archivist at the War Ministry, which he occupied until 1815, building, cataloguing and storing its collections. His work in the archive yielded more than 800 volumes of collected papers and 8,000 books added to the collection. Proscribed as a regicide in 1815, he went into exile in Brussels, leaving his wife behind in Paris. Despite his petitions and the support of the duc de Richelieu, he was never given permission to return to France. He fell ill in 1818 and his wife obtained a passport to join him; he died in poverty on 6 June 1818.

After attending Amherst College and earning a Ph.D at Columbia University, Fuess taught English at Phillips Academy from 1908 to 1933. As Headmaster he successfully guided the school in a new era as it faced the Great Depression and Second World War. Concurrent with his teaching and Headmaster roles, Fuess led a successful writing career spanning several decades. He is credited as the author or editor of over 30 books and articles and well known for his biographies, including those of Caleb Cushing, President Calvin Coolidge, Rufus Choate, Daniel Webster, and Carl Schurz.  Early life  = Family and ancestry = Alpha Delta Phi House, Amherst College Fuess was born on January 12, 1885 in Waterville, New York to Louis Phillip Fuess and Helen Augusta Moore. His paternal grandfather Jacob Fuess was from Annweiler am Trifels, Germany in the Bavarian Palatinate. He fled Germany during the Revolution in 1848 and emigrated to the United States, landing in New Orleans and making his way to New York City. He had one younger brother named Harold L. Fuess, an active member of local government in and around Waterville including Town Clerk of Sangerfield, New York. Originally spelled F√ºsz, the family changed the spelling to Fuess due to its difficult pronunciation for Americans. According to Fuess, he and his family pronounce their name Fease. Oftentimes he would go by one his nicknames. Those he knew in high school and at Amherst College called him \\"Dutch.\\" At Phillips Academy he was known as either \\"Jack\\" or \\"Claudie\\" or once Headmaster \\"B.D.\\" (Bald Doctor). Someone even wrote the following poem titled \\"Fuess Please\\" in 1930 to illustrate the difficulty of his name: > He'll exclaim, \\"Oh what's the use!\\" When he hears you utter \\"Fuess.\\" And > he'll like it even less If you say it's Mr. Fuess. If you want to hear him > cuss Just be sure to call him Fuess. All his wonted calm he'll lose If > perchance you murmur \\"Fuess\\"; But he'll thank you on his knees If you will > but call him \\"Fuess.\\" Despite such difficulty Fuess decided not to simplify his name because of the legal obstacles he would face and the honor it held to him personally and in Bavaria. = Education = Fuess was an avid reader at an early age. He played football for Waterville High School's first team and cycled for the school's first track team. Cycling events included half and one-mile races around a half-mile dirt track. He entered Amherst College in the autumn of 1901 at the age of 16 and graduated in 1905. While at Amherst he grew interests in forensics, debate, and public speaking. He continued to train for Amherst's cycling team but was unable to race when the New England Committee abolished the cycling races from its athletic program. He was a member of the fraternity Alpha Delta Phi. He took courses in debate, public speaking, and German. In the fall of 1905 he entered Columbia University. After earning his M.A. in 1906, he accepted in 1908 an invitation to be an assistant in Columbia's English Department. He earned his Ph.D at the same institution in 1912, his thesis titled \\"Lord Byron as a Satirist in Verse\\". He was awarded a Doctorate of Letters, an honorary degree from Amherst College in 1929 for his career as an English teacher and author. Fuess continued to keep close connections with Amherst for the rest of his life. He was Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Alumni Council, President of the Society of the Alumni, for two years National President of Alpha Delta Phi, and President of the Amherst Corporate Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. In addition, he published Amherst, The Story of a New England College in 1935 to illustrate the evolution of educational thought. Frederick Allis, who discusses Fuess in his book Youth From Every Quarter: A Bicentennial History of Phillips Academy, Andover characterizes his relationship with Amherst \\"clearly a love affair.\\" Fuess earned a total of eight honorary degrees over his lifetime.  Career  Fuess began his career in teaching while a student and assistant in the English Department at Columbia. He took the advice of his mentor, Professor William P. Trent, and took a year off from school to teach at the George School, a coeducational secondary school in Pennsylvania, before making his way unexpectedly to Phillips Academy where he would settle. = Phillips Academy = The Andover Battalion, 1918 Fuess spent a substantial portion of his career at Phillips Academy, a coeducational secondary boarding school which was at the time an all boys school. Fuess received an invitation from the current headmaster Alfred E. Stearns to a position in the English Department. At first he declined, convinced he would join the faculty at Columbia University. Stearns knew their English Department was short one teacher and needed someone in the area with a college degree. After making a convincing job offer, $1200 a year with room and board, and receiving a telegram from a professor at Columbia urging him to take the job, he accepted. He began his tenure in the fall of 1908 living in Draper Cottage. As an English teacher he focused on teaching his students to articulate themselves and nurturing their natural instincts of curiosity and a desire to learn. In 1913 he assumed editorship of the quarterly publication Phillips Bulletin. In the summer of 1918 he was asked by John Pershing to commission 200 of his students as Second Lieutenants to serve in the First World War, which he did. That September Fuess himself was commissioned as a Major in the Quartermaster Corps at Camp Johnston in Jacksonville, Florida. He soon caught influenza and was honorably discharged in January 1919. He soon became a popular figure among the younger alumni who knew him and known as one of the best English teachers of his time. John U. Monro, Class of 1930 and later Trustee of Phillips Academy, found himself throughout his life \\"dependent for survival\\" on the \\"solid growing pleasure he takes in the use of language he traces back easily to Jack Fuess.\\" Alfred Ernest Stearns In March 1933, Alfred Stearns was forced to resign in the midst of a scandal. He was a widower and married his housekeeper, someone \\"beneath his social class.\\" Upon the resignation of Alfred Stearns, Fuess was appointed acting headmaster of the school which had just begun a new era. The successful banker Thomas Cochran had worked closely with architect Charles Platt over the past several years to transform the campus and construct a number of new buildings, notably the Addison Gallery of American Art. At the same time however, the Academy was in the middle of a traumatic moment in its history. Professor and Judge James Hardy Ropes, President of the Board of Trustees, died suddenly; Thomas Cochran, now considered a driving force of the school, was in poor health among others on the Board of Trustees. Similar to when Fuess accepted the job as an English teacher in 1908, he was reluctant. This time he was interested in a job as Professor of Biography at Amherst College, which would allow him to continue his writing career more freely. For the next month, the Board of Trustees interviewed a number of candidates for Headmaster outside of the school. They soon concluded to \\"stick with someone whom they knew and respected, someone, furthermore, who knew Phillips Academy thoroughly and whose election would reassure the Andover community.\\" On May 28, 1933, Fuess was formally elected 10th Headmaster by the Trustees. During the first few years of his administration Fuess worked to acquire funds to renovate Bulfinch Hall to house the school's English Department. In the past it had served as a gym and at that point a dining hall. With a gift totaling $725,000 from Edward Harkness he was able to renovate the building and install English classrooms as well as provide five teaching foundations including on- campus residences for each. \\"My heart is very full over these gifts from Mr. Harkness,\\" he said announcing the project at Commencement in June 1936. The gift sparked a boost in morale for the school amidst the Great Depression. By the time if his retirement in 1948 the English Department had grown from four to sixteen faculty members. As Headmaster, Fuess received mixed reviews from the student body. Some had much respect for Fuess while others less so. One student said the following of him: > \\"We thought Claudie was born to be a college president...and I think we > admired him for putting up with the likes of us so patiently and so affably > while he was waiting for the lightning to strike. I have no idea what his > \\"policies\\" were. I just know he always performed as we thought he > should....I can see him now, dressed like a banker with pince nez in place, > standing in the middle of a gym floor crowded with students, saying just the > right thing. The charisma was several layers down, but it was there, and we > knew it was there, and we loved him for it.\\" Another was much less favorable: > \\"One thing is definite, however. He hadn't the slightest interest in boys. > Out of roughly 700 boys at Andover, I would doubt that Mr. Fuess could name > a hundred. Fifty had parents so rich that he could not ignore them in his > money raising activities. Fifty were such hell raisers that he couldn't > ignore them. I was in the latter category.\\" Just months after George H. W. Bush and family friend Godfrey A. Rockefeller graduated in 1942, Fuess without warning announced his plan to ban secret societies. Having been in place since the 1870s, the plan caused an uproar among alumni and the issue gained some newspaper attention. Fuess and the Trustees, including President of the Board Henry Stimson, never disclosed why they decided to act at that moment, but they cited an incident in 1934 that resulted in the death of a student, described as such: > \\"In 1934 one undergraduate had been killed during the course of a Society > initiation. A group of alumni had joined the undergraduates for part of the > ceremonies that were held in a barn on the outskirts of Andover. On the way > back the initiate rode on the running board of a car driven by one of the > alumni. The roads were slippery, and the car crashed into a telegraph pole, > crushing the boy, who died in Dr. Fuess's presence in the hospital a few > hours later.\\" Fuess also said, \\"the purpose for which the secret societies were founded no longer seems apparent.\\" At the time of the incident Phillips Academy brushed it aside, not blaming the secret societies. While alumni against the decision accused Fuess of \\"facism\\", those who agreed with him noted that secret societies \\"promoted exclusiveness\\", operated \\"on a special privilege basis,\\" and created \\"social cleavage.\\" Attention on the issue settled over the next few years and in 1949, the school quietly enacted a ban, two years after Fuess stepped down from Headmaster. By 1947, Fuess knew he wanted to retire. He would have served a total of 40 years at Phillips Academy, 25 as an English teacher and 15 as Headmaster. In addition his hearing began to fail, requiring a hearing aid. In 1948 Fuess officially retired and was succeeded by John Mason Kemper. = Authorship = Mathew B. Brady Fuess specialized in political biography, completing his first on Caleb Cushing in 1923. At that point he had already been writing and editing for over a decade, mostly school textbooks and compilations of other works. He wrote another biography in 1930 on Daniel Webster, further establishing his writing career in that field. He continued to author a number of biographies afterward. Fuess was also a historian. He wrote several books on New England academic institutions including Phillips Academy and Amherst College and their respective towns. The following is an excerpt from his obituary in the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society on his writing style: His writing career no doubt had its failures. Fuess received a request from Frank Waterman Stearns to write a biography of Stearns himself. He died in 1939 and in 1941 his family requested the project be abandoned. In 1933 he was elected to the American Antiquarian Society but his first paper was met with dissatisfaction among its members. His biographies on Calvin Coolidge and Caleb Cushing were criticized for painting the men in too favorable a light. According to the authors of an unauthorized biography of George H. W. Bush, Fuess failed to mention the opium trafficking industry that brought both families (Coolidge's and Cushing's) their wealth. They described Fuess in their book as \\"the designated chief liar for the 'Bostonian Race'\\" and \\"one of the most skillful liars of the modern age.\\" Upon his appointment as Headmaster in 1933 Fuess decided to finish his current projects, notably a history of Amherst College and a biography of President Calvin Coolidge, instead of devoting his time completely to the school. He finished both projects by 1940. Allis argues in his bicentennial history of Phillips Academy that Fuess' occupation with his writing career hindered his effectiveness as Headmaster.  Later life  Fuess remained an active author and figure after his retirement from Phillips Academy in 1948. He published over five books in this time before his death. In 1952 he published an autobiography titled Independent Schoolmaster. The New York Times wrote in a review in 1952 that the word \\"independent\\" was \\"something of a pun\\", pointing at Fuess' forty-year connection with Phillips Academy and the more common word \\"private\\" to describe such schools. In 1957 he spoke at the 150th anniversary celebration of the Andover Newton Theological School, formerly known as the Andover Theological Seminary before moving to a campus in Newton in the early twentieth century. Phillips Academy and the Seminary had shared a long history together in Andover as neighbors, the former founded in 1778 and the latter in 1808. In his speech titled \\"Escape from the Dead Hand\\", Fuess believed in a bright future for the seminary, in part because it had moved on from its rigid past. He declared that \\"Andover Seminary is no longer the Citadel of Orthodoxy but the Home of Protestant Freedom,\\" concluding \\"the cherished orthodoxies of one age are rightly rejected by the next.\\" In 1962, a year before his death, Fuess attended and spoke at the dedication of the Claude M. Fuess dormitory on the Phillips Academy campus. In the same year, he was interviewed by Frank W. Rounds of the Columbia University Oral History Research Project, focusing on his time at Andover.  Personal life and death  Fuess married Elizabeth Cushing Goodhue, a relative of politician Caleb Cushing, on June 27, 1911. They had one child named John Cushing Fuess in 1912. She died on July 26, 1943. He remarried to Lulie Anderson Blackfan (born November 28, 1886) on December 15, 1945. She died on November 6, 1956. They had no children together. Fuess' health declined in his last year and died in 1963 a widower. He is buried in the Phillips Academy Cemetery along with both of his spouses. His epitaph reads:  Publications and further reading  Fuess is credited as the author or editor of over 30 books and articles.

He is thought to have had a homoerotic (although not necessarily sexual) relationship with the emperor. In 1598 he sat in the Bohemian Estates as a member of the knighthood. As a Calvinist, he was thought to have fed the emperor's mistrust of the Capuchins brought to Prague under the leadership of Lawrence of Brindisi. He also dabbled in the occult, and in 1601 it was rumoured that he had used dark arts to bewitch the emperor. In the same year, Rudolph awarded him the hamlet of V≈ôesce, in the parish of Ratibo≈ôice (now part of Ratibo≈ôsk√© Hory, T√°bor District), and its associated mining rights. In 1603, when he was 38 years old, his portrait was engraved by Aegidius Sadeler.

The focal point of the event was a Relevos incre√≠bles tag team match between the teams of Aram√≠s/Drag√≥n Bane and Demonio Infernal/Freelance. The first two wrestlers pinned in the tag team match would then face off against each other in a traditional Lucha de Apuestas (\\"bet match\\"), risking either their wrestling mask or their hair on the outcome of the match. The show ended with Demonio Infernal pinning Freelance, forcing Freelance to have all his hair shaved off afterward. The Relevos Incre√≠bles de M√°scaras y Cabelleras show featured six additional matches. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. =Storylines= The event featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event The \\"surprise wrestler\\" in the fourth match of the night turned out to be S√∫per Nova, who returned to his \\"S√∫per Nova\\" ring character after having worked under the name \\"Bengala\\" for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) since 2016. His match ended in a disqualification when Herodes Jr. and El Hijo de Sangre Chicana to attack the tecnico team of S√∫per Nova, Imposible and Toscano, causing a disqualification. Afterward, the two, and El Hijo de Pirata Morgan declared that they collectively would be known as \\"Los Masters Juniors. The masked team of Aram√≠s and Drag√≥n Bane faced off against the unmasked team of Demonio Infernal and Freelance in the first stage of the Relevos incre√≠bles featured match. Aramis and Drag√≥n Bane almost lost the match due to their ongoing storyline feud, but in the end won the match, which in turn forced Demonio Infernal and Freelance to face off in the last match of the night. In the end, Demonio Infernal pinned Freelance to win the match. After the match Freelance stood in the middle of the ring as his hair was shaved completely off.

It was located on the outskirts of the city in sight of the Great Western Railway main line that crossed the River Tamar by the Royal Albert Bridge.  Infrastructure The Plymouth Devonport and South Western Junction Railway in 1892 As stated the halt was named after a local pub and although it officially opened on 1 November 1906 it may have had services from Wednesday 26 September when the suburban service was actually launched. This difference could be the result of a complaint by the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway to the London and South Western Railway that while they had constructed the halt, the LSWR had not provided any service, with a subsequent report that services commenced before the official opening date. Camels Head Halt closed on the Sunday 4 May 1942. A 1964 photograph shows one platform, still with its nameboard, as a short wooden platform of a single carriage length, with fencing, ramps and no shelter. The halt was located on an embankment and the second similar platform was staggered, standing some distance away next to the road with a small brick built shelter and a second building, possibly a ticket office, backing on to the line. The Camels Head girder bridge stood close by on the route towards St Budeaux Victoria Road via Weston Mill Halt. Ford Station stood on the line to the east of the halt.  History  Officially opening on 1 November 1906 as one of a number of new halts that were opened to allow a suburban service to be operated between Plymouth Friary and St Budeaux for Saltash station in response to competition from tram lines. Despite this initiative Camels Head closed on 4 May 1942. The 1964 photograph shows the station, still standing and it was still present in 1970, long after the closure and lifting of the line. The halt was the site of the first death after the new Halts were opened in the Plymouth area when on Friday 9 November 1906 Edna Martin was killed whilst playing with her older brother Stanley Martin, aged 8. Both were truanting from Johnston Terrace Elementary School and she ran onto the line when a train was approaching. The trains were third class only and no Sunday service was provided. In 1922 five to seven trains called in the Down direction and seven in the Up. In 1942, twenty years further on, only one Up and Down train called with two on Saturdays. The wooden platforms supposedly posed a fire threat to the local houses and this was the official reason for the closure of the station, however this was over a year after the Blitz on Devonport and photographs show that the platforms were not removed at all during the time that the line was in use. The site today Nothing remains of the station and most of the old line, bridges and embankments have been removed and built over.

Though many had questionable loyalty to Lumumba, most did not openly contradict him out of political considerations or fear of reprisal. He dominated the Council of Ministers, and most of the ministers did respect his abilities. MNC-L members controlled eight ministries, including four major portfolios: national defence, interior, economic coordination, and agriculture. Tshombe objected to the fact that the former two were held by MNC-L members, while the majority of PUNA and MNC-K members were extremely displeased that their party leaders had not been included in the government. European circles were displeased that the portfolio for economic affairs, controlled by a CONAKAT member, was undercut by the positioning of nationalists in control of the Ministry and Secretariat for Economic Coordination, and that mines and land affairs were placed under separate portfolios. Tshombe declared that it rendered his agreement to support the government \\"null and void\\".  Prelude  By the end of July opposition to the Lumumba Government had solidified in Parliament. Lumumba's absence from the country allowed these elements to organise and advertise their position. Belgian Ambassador Jean van den Bosch had taken advantage of the time to establish contacts with the moderate ministers: Bomboko, Delvaux, Kabangi, Kanza, and Mbuyi. Bomboko became the ambassador's most frequent contact and was relayed messages from Wigny. Van den Bosch also developed a relationship with Joseph Il√©o, the President of the Senate, who pledged that he would work in tandem with other senators to remove Lumumba from power. On 9 August Albert Kalonji announced the secession of the \\"Mining State of South Kasai\\". Dissension and subversion campaigns, including the dissemination of anti-Lumumba leaflets and inciting of army mutinies, were organised in Brazzaville with the support of President Fulbert Youlou, Belgian intelligence services, the French Service de Documentation Ext√©rieure et de Contre- Espionnage, and the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Batshikama, though a secretary of state in the Lumumba Government, spent two hours every evening in Brazzaville hosting an anti-Lumumba radio programme. Wigny directed the Belgian agents there to encourage the Congolese opposition to remove Lumumba through presidential revocation, as a parliamentary motion of censure was deemed too likely to fail. In a meeting with his advisers on 18 August President Eisenhower suggested that he wanted Lumumba to be killed; the CIA subsequently organised an assassination operation. Belgium made similar plans. By the end of the month rumors were circulating in the capital of Western overtures to Kasa-Vubu to replace Lumumba's government. Lumumba returned to the Congo on 8 August and soon thereafter met with the Council of Ministers. The following day he proclaimed an √©tat d'exception throughout the Congo, and his government carried out its expulsion order against Ambassador Van den Bosch. Mandi personally informed the ambassador of the direction, but insisted that his ousting did not signify a permanent rupture between Belgium and the Congo. Lumumba soon arrived to oversee Van den Bosch's departure and announced that all other Belgian diplomatic staff would face arrest if they did not leave the country. He also recalled all Congolese students residing in Belgium. The Prime Minister subsequently issued several orders in an attempt to reassert his dominance on the political scene. The first outlawed the formation of associations without government sanction. A second asserted the government's right to ban publications that produced material likely to bring the administration into disrepute. On 11 August the Courrier d'Afrique printed an editorial which declared that the Congolese did not want to fall \\"under a second kind of slavery\\". The editor was summarily arrested and four days later publication of the daily ceased, followed shortly thereafter by the delivery of shut-down orders against the Belga and Agence France-Presse wire services. The press restrictions garnered a wave of harsh criticism from the Belgian media. Another order stipulated that official approval had to be obtained six days in advance of public gatherings. On 16 August Lumumba announced the installation of a r√©gime militaire esp√©cial for the duration of six months, including the establishment of military tribunals. He also initiated the arrest of public figures who opposed him. Throughout August Lumumba increasingly withdrew from his full cabinet and instead consulted officials and ministers he trusted, such as Mpolo, Mbuyi, Kashamura, Gizenga, and Kiwewa. Kasa-Vubu's wishes frequently went unheeded by the government. Kasa- Vubu faced criticism from ABAKO and President Youlou for not curbing Lumumba's authoritarian actions. He resisted their pressure, and on 13 August he broadcast an appeal for unity and support for the government. Nevertheless, he cautioned the government against arbitrariness and excess: > If I am under a moral obligation to support and defend the government within > the limits set by the law, the members of the government themselves have a > duty to work together as a team. Their policy must be the policy of the > government and not that of one party, one race, or one tribe. It must be a > policy which reflects the interests of the nation and which allows > humanitarian values to flourish in freedom. This imperative excludes all > feelings of hatred, suspicion, and bad faith towards those who have > collaborated loyally with us. It is also the duty of the government to > respect the institutions which have been set up and to abide by the normal > rules of democratic practice.  Dismissal of ministers  Joseph Il√©o, appointed by Kasa-Vubu to replace Lumumba = Kasa-Vubu's decision = Throughout August President Kasa-Vubu became increasingly bothered by Lumumba's growing authoritarianism, the collapse in administration, and the enlarging prospects of civil war. On 3 September he summoned Andrew Cordier, the interim head of ONUC, to communicate that he was considering dismissing the Prime Minister. Cordier reported the development back to Hammarskj√∂ld, who noted that a \\"complete disintegration of authority\\" could follow such an action. Kasa-Vubu's full motives behind his decision are not agreed upon. He told a parliamentary commission on 9 September that members of the government were becoming authoritarian and complained that he was not consulted in their actions. According to M. Crawford Young, he feared a pro-Lumumba coup d'√©tat would take place and sought to preempt it. Young further stated that there is evidence to suggest that Lumumba was growing impatient with the parliamentary system and was seeking to institute his own centralised presidency to achieve his agenda, but did not begin to formulate such plans until he grew suspicious of his opponents' own intentions to depose him. Political scientist Catherine Hoskyns wrote that Kasa-Vubu was becoming increasingly agitated by Lumumba's style of governance and, facing pressure from ABAKO, Adoula, and Il√©o, sought to curtail what he perceived as the Prime Minister's harmful actions. Hoskyns further posited that by dismissing Lumumba Kasa-Vubu only wished to exercise a measure of control over him and that he was prepared to then negotiate a political compromise with Lumumba that would potentially lead to his inclusion in the next government. According to Stephen Weissman, classified United States Central Intelligence Agency documents indicated that Kasa-Vubu was bribed by the American government into firing Lumumba, as part of a larger plot that would involve a no-confidence vote in Parliament on 8 September rigged by Adoula and Il√©o followed by the resignations of all ABAKO and PUNA ministers and public protests. He also wrote, \\"It appears unlikely that Kasa- Vubu would have gone ahead [with the dismissal] without outside support.\\" = Revocation of Lumumba's ministerial mandate = At 20:12 on 5 September Kasa- Vubu announced the dismissal of Lumumba, along with Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, Minister of Justice Mwamba, Minister of Interior Gbenye, Minister of Information Kashamura, Secretary of State Bolamba, and Secretary of State Lumbala over the radio. He stated that the President of the Senate, Joseph Il√©o, would form a new government. After Lumumba heard of the firing he held heated discussions with his ministers and made three broadcasts, defending his government and declaring Kasa-Vubu to be deposed. Kasa-Vubu had not declared the approval of any responsible ministers of his decision, making his action legally invalid. Lumumba noted this in a letter to Hammarskj√∂ld and a radio broadcast at 05:30 on 6 September. Later that day Kasa-Vubu managed to secure the countersignatures of Delvaux and Bomboko to his order. With them, he re- announced his decision at 16:00 over Brazzaville radio. The former's signature was unsurprising to most observers, but the latter's was unanticipated. Through his actions at the UN Security Council meeting he had attended and the Pan-African conference, Bomboko had appeared to concur with Lumumba's programme. Bomboko explained to the press in late September that he felt Lumumba had failed to cooperate with the UN and \\"tolerated\\" the ANC's harassment of ONUC personnel, \\"thus disqualifying our young nation in the eyes of the world\\". He also claimed that Lumumba did not stem the mistreatment of foreigners and bypassed him in seeking bilateral aid outside of the UN effort. While the dismissals were recognised, the reigning government was, according to Belgian tradition, legally in place until a full administration was formed that could replace it‚Äîthough Lumumba's opponents disputed such a view. Kasa- Vubu theorised that Il√©o could work with the ministers that had not been revoked until he had a government ready for a parliamentary vote. As Il√©o was no longer serving as President of the Senate, Lumumba hoped his ally, Okito, would assume the position, which would then place him next in the line of succession to the presidency in case of Kasa-Vubu's removal from office. On the evening of 6 September Kasa-Vubu summoned prosecutor Rene Rom and pressured him to draft a warrant for Lumumba's arrest. Cordier and ONUC Commander Carl von Horn ordered peacekeepers to shut down the airport and restrict access to the radio station, fearing Lumumba would fly in loyal troops from Stanleyville to regain control of the capital and provoke a civil war. Despite the confusion, Lumumba was still able to exercise his powers and resumed the military campaign against South Kasai and Katanga. Lumumba and the ministers who remained loyal to him ordered the arrest of Delvaux and Bomboko for countersigning the dismissal order. The latter sought refuge in the presidential palace (which was guarded by UN peacekeepers), but early in the morning on 7 September the former was detained and confined in the prime minister's residence by Lumbala. Rom was also detained and questioned by Mwamba. Meanwhile the Chamber convened to discuss Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order and hear Lumumba's reply. Delvaux made an unexpected appearance and took to the dais to denounce his arrest and declare his resignation from the government. He was enthusiastically applauded by the opposition. Lumumba then delivered his speech. Instead of directly attacking Kasa-Vubu ad hominem, Lumumba accused obstructionist politicians and ABAKO of using the presidency as a front for disguising their activities. He noted that Kasa-Vubu had never before offered any criticism of the government and portrayed their relationship as one of cooperation. He lambasted Delvaux and Nkayi for their role in the Geneva negotiations and for their failure to consult the rest of the government. Lumumba followed his arguments with an analysis of the Loi Fondemental and finished by asking Parliament to assemble a \\"commission of sages\\" to examine the Congo's troubles. The Chamber, at the suggestion of its presiding officer, voted to annul both Kasa-Vubu's and Lumumba's declarations of dismissal, 60 to 19. The following day Lumumba delivered a similar speech before the Senate, which subsequently delivered the government a vote of confidence, 49 to zero with seven abstentions. Several senators also lodged an interpellation against Bomboko and Delvaux, requesting an explanation for their signing of the dismissal order. = Constitutionality of the dismissals = The constitutionality of the revocation is disputed. Sociologist Ludo de Witte described Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order as \\"clearly not constitutional\\" and labeled the invoked Article 22 as a \\"totally obsolete\\" provision which could only be resolved \\"by a law or revision of the constitution, passed by a parliament with confidence in Lumumba.\\" International relations scholar Evan Luard wrote, \\"Of Kasa-Vubu's move [...] it can reasonably be said that by the way he used his power without referring to Parliament amounted to an abuse of the constitution\\". Historians Emmanuel Gerard and Bruce Kuklick noted that in August 1960 Baudouin, operating within the confines of the extremely similar Belgian Constitution, had asked Prime Minister Eyskens to resign, but that Eyskens, having a solid parliamentary majority, refused and retained his office. However, the relevant article was never formally invoked in the request. Bomboko released a statement in late September that asserted that while \\"normally\\" a government under the constitution would be unseated by a censure from Parliament, \\"On occasion [the President] can revoke a government when this measure is deemed necessary for any grave reason. In this case, the Parliament is not, and cannot, be invited to vote its confidence or lack of confidence in the government.\\" Hoskyns wrote, \\"From a legal point of view it would seem therefore that Kasa-Vubu's initial action was in accordance at least with the letter of the Loi Fondamentale\\". = Attempts at reconciliation = Though Parliament had rejected Kasa-Vubu's action, many were still upset by Lumumba's style of governance. The legislature felt that an understanding needed to be reached between the two to facilitate the return of stable government. Deputies were also displeased that Il√©o had agreed to work with Kasa-Vubu in a move undertaken without Parliament's consent. The Chamber thus voted to establish a seven-person commission of reconciliation to seek a compromise between the President and the Prime Minister. The commission exacted a promise from Lumumba to reshuffle the Council of Ministers and govern with the assistance and supervision of another parliamentary commission (which never materialised). Other attempts at reconciliation were under taken by African diplomats in L√©opoldville and UN diplomat Jean David. The latter acted on his own initiative without official sanction until he was recalled. Over the next few days little activity was undertaken by Parliament or the Council of Ministers. Lumumba spent his time touring the streets, at Camp Leopold II, and on the radio, declaring himself to still be the legal Prime Minister and employing rhetorical attacks against his political opponents. He ignored Serge Michel's urges that he secure a formal vote of constitutional interpretation from Parliament in rejection of the Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order. On 9 September he announced that he had assumed the responsibilities of the Head of State, taken command of the ANC, and dismissed Bomboko, Delvaux, and Nkayi from his cabinet. Il√©o proclaimed his completed government on 10 September. According to Belgian tradition, an administration could assume its responsibilities as soon as it was proclaimed, before being subject to parliamentary approval. Among the declared ministers he retained from Lumumba's cabinet were MNC-L members Alo√Øs Kabangi, Alexandre Mahamba, and Alphonse Songolo and CEREA member Marcel Bisukiro. Kabangi subsequently refused to accept the post. Kisolokele remained a minister of state and Bolya was made Minister of Health. Kalonji, though he did not retract his secessionist project, accepted the post of Minister of Justice. Il√©o did not present his government to Parliament for a vote of confidence, and even if he did it was unlikely that he would secure its support. Kasa-Vubu issued an ordinance relieving Kamanga, Rudahindwa, and Lutula of their duties. The next day he, at the behest of Western interests, ordered the army to detain Lumumba. General Lundula foiled the attempt and Kasa-Vubu, acting on Belgian advice, summarily dismissed him and announced that Mobutu would replace him. Lumumba separately declared Mpolo commander-in-chief of the ANC. Bolikango, who had been chosen as Il√©o's Minister of Information, arrived at Kashamura's office with several gendarmes and ordered him to vacate the building or face arrest. Meanwhile the presiding officers of the Senate and the Chamber agreed that Parliament should convene in a joint session to discuss the political impasse. During a meeting on 13 September a number of parliamentarians spoke in favor of compromise and reconciliation. Lumumba then appealed them to grant him \\"full powers\\" to manage the country's crisis but assured that he was ready to seek an understanding with rival political factions. Parliament passed a resolution in accordance with Lumumba's wishes but also established a commission to oversee the government's implementation of the powers. However, the authenticity and legality of the vote was highly questionable. The legislature also instituted a new commission to modify the composition of the Lumumba Government. It recommended that Adoula be made Deputy Prime Minister, that Vital Moanda, Bolikango, and Kalonji be given ministerial portfolios, and that Kashamura (who was strongly disliked by the deputies), Bomboko, and Delvaux be excluded. The next day Kasa-Vubu rejected Parliament's action in a communique, declaring the joint session to be illegal. Fearing that the Il√©o Government would never secure a vote of confidence, he proceeded to adjourn Parliament for one month in an order that was countersigned by Il√©o. Parliament rejected it because Il√©o had never presented himself for confirmation. A presidential adjournment of Parliament also required consultation with the Council of Ministers and the presiding officers of each house, which Kasa-Vubu never sought.  Mobutu's coup  On 14 September Mobutu announced over the radio that he was launching a 'peaceful revolution' to break the political impasse and therefore neutralising the President, Lumumba's and Il√©o's respective governments, and Parliament until 31 December. He stated that \\"technicians\\" would run the administration while the politicians sorted out their differences. In a subsequent press conference he clarified that Congolese university graduates would be asked to form a government and further declared that all Eastern Bloc countries should close their embassies. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu were both surprised by the coup. That evening the former traveled to Camp Leopold II in search of Mobutu to try and change his mind. He spent the night there but was attacked in the morning by Luba soldiers who blamed him for the atrocities in South Kasa√Ø. A Ghanaian ONUC contingent managed to extricate him from the fray but his briefcase was left behind. Some of his political opponents recovered it and published documents it supposedly contained, including letters from Nkrumah, appeals for support addressed to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, a memorandum dated 16 September declaring the presence of Soviet troops within one week, and a letter dated 15 September from Lumumba to the provincial presidents (Tshombe excepted) entitled \\"Measures to be applied during the first stages of the dictatorship\\". Some of these papers were genuine, while others, especially the memorandum and the letter to the provincial presidents, were almost certainly forgeries. Meanwhile, Mobutu terminated the ANC campaign against Katanga and withdrew the army from South Kasai, where the UN established a buffer between the belligerents. President Kasa-Vubu with the College of Commissioners-General On 20 September Mobutu announced the formation of the College of Commissioners-General under the chairmanship of Bomboko. Soldiers expelled the remaining politicians from their offices and escorted the new government into them. Of the Commissioners-General, Ndele, Joseph Mbeke, and Martin Ngwete had all been chef de cabinet to a minister in the Lumumba Government. Kandolo, chef de cabinet to Lumumba, was also made a commissioner. Both Kanza and Mandi were invited to join the College, the former at work in New York when he was approached with the request. Though the latter attended the College's early sessions, both became disturbed by the body's inclination towards Kasa-Vubu and summarily refused to participate in the administration. Their abstention allowed the government's anti-Lumumba slant to worsen without restraint. Meanwhile, Mpolo attempted to undermine the College and rivaled Mobutu for control of the army. Despite the coup, African diplomats still worked towards a reconciliation between Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu. According to the Ghanaians, a verbal agreement of principle concerning closer co-operation between the Head of State and the government was put into writing. Lumumba signed it, but Kasa-Vubu suddenly refused to reciprocate. The Ghanaians suspected that Belgium and the United States were responsible, though Kasa-Vubu was also eager to re-integrate Katanga back into the Congo through negotiation, and Tshombe had declared that he would not participate in any discussions with a government that included the \\"communist\\" Lumumba. Mobutu, after consultation with Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba, announced that he would summon a round table conference to discuss the political future of the Congo. His attempts to follow through were disrupted by Lumumba who, from his official residence, was acting as though he still held the premiership. On 23 September Mpolo and Gizenga were arrested and plans were made to send them to Katanga. The UN put pressure on Mobutu to release them, which he did the following day. Upon his release, Gizenga left by road for Stanleyville, where he would arrive in October. Meanwhile, Lumumba continued to hold meetings with members of his government, senators, deputies, and political supporters and issue public statements. On numerous occasions he left his residence to tour the restaurants of the capital, maintaining that he still held power. Frustrated by the way he was being treated by Lumumba and facing intense political pressure, by the end of the month Mobutu was no longer encouraging reconciliation and had aligned himself with Kasa-Vubu. He ordered ANC units to surround Lumumba's residence, but a cordon of UN peacekeepers prevented them from making an arrest, and Lumumba was thus confined to his home. On 1 October Songolo led several MNC-L deputies in denouncing both Lumumba and their party and declaring support of the Commissioners-General. They were probably moved to do so in part due to the circulation of the alleged documents from Lumumba's briefcase and the injuring of numerous tribal leaders in Orientale by the administration while attempting to restore order. Sixteen days later the group arrived in Stanleyville and was immediately arrested by local officials. On 7 October Lumumba announced the formation of a new government that included Bolikango and Kalonji. Mpolo, who had been designated Minister of Defence, told the press that he believed that a reconciliation among the conflicted parties in the government would eventually be reached. Deeply angered by the development, Mobutu dispatched troops to his residence to arrest him. He was not present and was able to return unmolested by the end of the day. Lumumba soon thereafter proposed that the UN supervise a national referendum that would settle the split in the government. On 11 October Kasa- Vubu issued a \\"constitutional decree-law\\" officiating the establishment of the College of Commissioners-General, asserting his right as Head of State to appoint and dismiss its members, adjourning Parliament indefinitely, and conferring all legislative authority prescribed to Parliament by the Loi Fondementale to the College. In time, the College would come to bring about the restoration of some order to the administration that had been lost during the Lumumba Government's tenure. Lumumba frequently attacked the body's credibility. As the end of the year approached Mobutu backed away from his promise of restoring democratic processes after December and postponed a return to normal governance indefinitely. = Lumumba's attempted escape and the flight of his ministers = Once confined in L√©opoldville, Lumumba began drafting plans to reassert his authority. In a letter dated 17 September addressed to Nkrumah, he stated his intention to relocate his government to Stanleyville. By October, Lumumba's supporters were convinced that few of their goals could be achieved through the College of Commissioners. In New York Kanza reunited with his delegation to represent the Lumumba Government at the UN. His appearance surprised the College of Commissioners, which had been unaware of his whereabouts for weeks, and also generated hope among Lumumba's supporters that the domestic crisis could be resolved in their favour. Kasa- Vubu dispatched his own delegation. On 20 September the Congo was officially admitted into the UN, but its seat in the General Assembly was left vacant and the issue over which delegation should be seated was referred to the Credentials Committee. Several African states urged the immediate recognition of Lumumba's delegates, but on 8 November Kasa-Vubu flew to New York to plead his case. After several delays, on 22 November the General Assembly resolved to seat Kasa-Vubu's delegation, 53 votes to 24 with 19 abstentions. The extension of UN recognition to Kasa-Vubu's delegation definitively ended Lumumba's hopes of a legal return to power. The Lumumbists also began to fear that the peacekeepers would no longer provide them protection from arrest. Following his return to the Congo from New York, Kanza avoided arrest by taking refuge in his apartment in a building used by the UN (and guarded by them). He was able to communicate with Lumumba from his apartment via a telephone installed at the latter's residence by UN peacekeepers. The loyal members of Lumumba's government that remained in the capital frequently visited Kanza's apartment to make phone calls to Lumumba. On a 26 November phone call Lumumba shared his intention with Kanza and several other ministers to escape house arrest and go to Stanleyville. Kanza and a few other politicians attempted to dissuade him from leaving, the former convinced that popular demand would force the authorities to negotiate a compromise. Less than an hour later Kanza received a written message from Lumumba affirming his decision to flee and containing instructions to release a diversionary communique in 24 hours to confuse search parties. Lumumba (center), detained by Mobutu's soldiers, before transport to Thysville Lumumba left the capital in a convoy of nine cars with Mwamba, Mulele, his wife Pauline, and his youngest child. Instead of heading with all haste to the Orientale Province border‚Äîwhere soldiers loyal to Gizenga were waiting to receive him‚ÄîLumumba delayed by touring villages and making conversation with the locals. On 1 December Mobutu's troops caught up with his party as it crossed the Sankuru river. Lumumba and his advisers had made it to the far side, but his wife and child were left to be captured on the bank. Fearing for their safety, Lumumba took the ferry back, against the advice of Mwamba and Mulele, who both, fearing they would never see him again, bid him farewell. Mobutu's men arrested him and returned him to L√©opoldville. He was subsequently imprisoned at the army camp in Thysville and it was stated that he would be tried for inciting the people to rebel. Mwamba and Mulele spent several days in the bush before reaching Stanleyville. Other members of the Lumumba Government fled to the east, some simply because they felt threatened in L√©opoldville. Kashamura, Lutula, and Gbenye reached Stanleyville without much difficulty. A few days after Lumumba's capture, Kanza was warned by ONUC chief Rajeshwar Dayal that some of the Commissioners planned on arresting him for his refusal to participate in their government. He shortly thereafter fled to Brazzaville and sought asylum in Guinea, where he was recognised by President Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© as an official representative of the Lumumba Government. Kanza was later joined there by Kiwewa. Mandi was smuggled out of the Congo by Mobutu, a personal friend, who feared for his safety. Mbuyi and the Governor of the Central Bank, Barth√©lemy Mujanay, both attempted to rendezvous with the Lumumbists in Stanleyville but were killed in the Charlesville region. Mpolo also intended on reaching the city, but before he left he addressed a crowd of Lumumba's supporters at Lac L√©opold II. With Mobutu's government fearing Mpolo's potential to rally support for his cause, troops were dispatched to find him and arrested him in Mushie. He was later transferred to the base in Thysville, along with Joseph Okito. Believing Lumumba to no longer be of much political importance, the United States and Belgium suspended their assassination operations.

At the ceremony, Smith declared that he ‚Äúpray[ed to] God it may stand here through the ages as a testimonial to the people of this great commonwealth.‚Äù The building opened in October of 1930, and was originally home to the New York State Departments of Taxation, Finance, and Motor Vehicles.

In 2002, the State transferred the building to the City of New York, which began using it for marriages in 2009. The City moved the Manhattan Marriage Bureau to the Lefkowitz Building's ornate first floor lobby in order to better compete with wedding destinations such as Las Vegas.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/nyregion/marriage-wedding-rikers- island-jail-nyc.html These matrimonial duties later rendered the Lefkowitz a monument to LGBTQ New Yorkers, as 293 couples wed there on the day same-sex marriage became legal in 2011.

The film stars Lucy Hale and Leonidas Gulaptis. The film was released video on demand on July 17, 2020, by Vertical Entertainment. Plot Lucy Neal disappoints her boyfriend Jeff, with her lack of intimacy. While he is asleep, Lucy looks at Jeff‚Äôs laptop and finds that he is a porn addict. They have an argument over this and they break up, with Jeff moving out of the apartment. Lucy, with her group of four violinists, Nessa, Priscilla, and Paul, perform at a wedding, but she breaks down in the middle of it and tells them that Jeff left her because she won‚Äôt satisfy him. After some comforting and encouragement from the three, Lucy decides to make a sex list of things to improve her intimacy problems. Lucy is at a wedding where she gets drunk and begins to yell by herself in frustration to not being able to use word cock in a sentence. She is overheard by a wedding guest, Grant. He comes in to comfort her and helps her get back outside after some friendly chatting. Lucy starts off with her list by watching a lot of porn at home first and also reads a very racy novel. The next morning, Nessa and Priscilla come over to help Lucy get over Jeff, but she instead invites them to go to a sex store. Lucy meets Grant there. They chat some more and Lucy finds herself attracted to the man. Same night, Lucy joins Paul at a strip club he visits regularly. She finds herself impressed by the dancing onstage, but when she sees that all she has is a $20 bill for a tip, Lucy awkwardly tries to take change from the dancer, which gets her and Paul kicked out. Lucy attends an event with her group to perform. She meets Grant there and he asks Lucy to dance. Later, Grant asks her out to dinner which she accepts. Lucy goes on her dinner date with Grant, and they later attend a live taping for talk show host Dr. Becker since Priscilla gave Lucy tickets. Dr. Becker‚Äôs guest is sex expert Madame Swarovska, who brings Lucy up to speak with her. She senses the lack of sexual experience in her and basically encourages Grant to show her a good time. She meets up with Grant again where they hook up and have good sex. In the morning, Grant is put off when he sees the amount of sexual paraphernalia in her room, along with pregnancy pants that Lucy bought purely for comfort. He ends up leaving, which Lucy sees. She is embarrassed and throws away all the sex stuff. Lucy practices for her audition. She tries but doesn‚Äôt feel at her best. She later finds that Jeff is getting married and that he wants the group to perform at the wedding. Lucy agrees. Lucy and Paul go to a bar. Lucy‚Äôs name is signed up for a talent show, and she plays the violin. Grant finds her and they reconcile and hook back up. Grant explains that earlier he freaked out because he thought Lucy was pregnant since he saw the pregnancy pants. Lucy gets a message that she didn't get her spot with the Philharmonic, but she doesn‚Äôt care because she‚Äôs happy with Grant. At Jeff's wedding, Lucy hires Honey, a porn star, to show up, since she knows Jeff is a fan. He freaks out and worries that his new wife will see her, and he runs away. Honey then goes to dance with Paul. Lucy goes back to Grant so that she can try the last thing on the list with him.

He fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War and was killed in action during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Early life  Ji was born in Fugou County, Henan Province, at his ancestral home in Hancheng, Shaanxi. He completed his education in Advanced Studies at the Republic of China Military Academy. Second Sino-Japanese War Ji became famous across China for his presence at the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the battles that followed. As a colonel, Ji was the regimental commander of the 219th Regiment, 110th Brigade, 37th Division, 29th Route Army. Ji received a telephone message from the commander of Japanese forces in the area regarding a Japanese soldier that went missing after a military exercise. The Japanese commander claimed that his soldier, Private Kikujiro Shimura, was missing and that they suspected the soldier had been abducted by the Chinese. In fact, he had gotten lost while relieving himself on his way back from the exercise and found his way back to his unit hours later. The Japanese commander demanded permission to enter Wanping to investigate. Colonel Ji refused the search demand. The Japanese Army had fabricated several similar incidents during that period in order to encroach on Chinese territory. With the Japanese demand unfulfilled, at about 5:30 am on July 8, the Japanese began shelling the bridge and Wanping, launching an assault on the Chinese position at Wanping. When the Japanese attacked the bridge from the rear, Ji led defenses with about 100 men and was ordered to hold the bridge at all costs. By the afternoon, the Japanese had managed to occupy the southern end of the bridge. Chinese reinforcements arrived, and on the morning of July 9th, the Chinese retook the bridge under cover of mist and rain.  Legacy  On 23 August 1958, he was mortally wounded during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis bombardment of Kinmen by the People's Liberation Army. Memorials to Ji are found in the war museums of Taipei and Beijing. His son, Ji Mingli, has made appearances to commemorate his father and memorialize the wars he fought in.

Description Ballon Hill is an archaeological site, listed as an Irish National Monument, which sits on a low hill near Ballon village. Predominately used as a burial site from the bronze age, the features of the site were only discovered during excavations in the 19th century and in a more recent archaeological survey using Lidar. History The site appears to have been used for burials from 2200 BC, with at least three burial sites dating from that time. Excavated by John James Lecky and J. Richardson Smith from 1853 to 1855, the site yielded one of the largest assemblies of pottery ever discovered in Ireland. The use of the site seems to have been at its height from 2020 to 1920 BC. Much of the pottery from the site is now housed in the National Museum of Ireland and the British Museum. In 1997, the Carlow County Museum received an unsolicited donation of razor knife and two polished stones from one of the excavated graves. In 2012 the Ballon Hill Archaeology Project was established to conduct a new survey of the site, funded by the Carlow Historical and Archaeological Society and Carlow County Development Partnership, using Lidar and other modern surveying tools. The results of this work were published as a report in 2014, and as an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland.

It was said that she had initiated Heracles to the Eleusian Mysteries and some sources portray her as the mother of Heracles' son, Hyllus.Scoliast. ad Aristophanes, The Frogs 504. In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the name had a Phoenician influence, in fact it is homophone of the ancient names of the island of Malta and of Samothrace; today, however, it is believed that the toponym derives from the word \\"honey\\" ().  Description  Besides the Pnyx and the public buildings of the agora, in Melite there was also the Temple of Hephaestus. There was also a sanctuary of Heracles, with a statue by Phidias or his teacher Ageladas erected to commemorate the end of an epidemic in 429 BCE. Eurysaces, son of Ajax the Great, was the owner of a sanctuary in which he was venerated along with his father.Plutarch, Solon 10. It was said that he migrated with his brother to Athens and granted to the Athenians the island of Salamis in exchange for citizenship; this myth was probably current in the 6th century BCE to justify the Athenian conquest of Salamis. Among the descendants of Eurysaces were many priests and important aristocrats, including Alcibiades. In the deme there was also a temple of Theseus, which it was said contained his grave. Tradition said that the original inhabitants of the deme emigrated to Diomea, where they brought with them the cult of Heracles. Melite was a very populous place: among the non- native inhabitants of here there were Epicurus, who left his home to the successive heads of his school; Callias II; Phocion; Themistocles, who had a temple built to Artemis built near his house.Plutarch, Themistocles 22.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 The Appalachian Trail and Virginia Creeper Trail follow Whitetop Laurel Creek through a gorge with rich cove hardwood forests and thick rhododendrons. The area is one the most popular recreational hubs in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area.. Whitetop Laurel Creek is a popular wild trout stream with wildlife viewing platforms and streamside access by wheelchair. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 4.2 miles east of Damascus, Virginia between Va 859 (Grassy Ridge Road) on the east, US 58 on the north, and Va 726 (Chestnut Mountain Road) on the south. It lies on the east side of the Feathercamp wild area. The Appalachian Trail extends for 9.2 miles through the area, entering from Va 859 on the east and exiting onto US 58 on the west. The Virginia Creeper Trail, a 34-mile trail following an old railroad grade, is used by horse-back riders, bicyclers and hikers. From Abingdon, it runs to Whitetop, Virginia near the North Carolina border. The original railroad carried lumber from Konnarock, Va where a sawmill employing more than 400 workers with 20 logging camps produced more than 15 million board feet of lumber annually. Little remains of the sawmill, which operated from 1906 to 1928.. Other trails into the area include: *Chestnut Mountain Trail, FS 4566, 2.4 miles, has been decommissioned *Taylors Valley Trail, FS 4555, 2.6 miles *Saunders Trail, FS 4628, 2.1 miles Parker Road also provides access to the area. Boundary of the Whitetop Laurel wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society.The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 786 (Mount Rogers). and Map 318 (Mount Rogers High Country) A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Whitetop Laurel wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Konnarock and Grayson. Natural history Whitetop Laurel Creek provides habitat for many unusual and threatened wildlife. These include the greenfin darter, the sharphead darter, the fatlips minnow, and the hellbender, the largest salamander found in the U. S. Unusual flora includes the umbrella leaf and the streambank mock-orange, and possibly the Carolina saxifrage. There may be 150 acres of old growth forest.. About 2.7 miles of Whitetop Laurel Creek is classified as an ‚ÄúExceptional State Water‚Äù thus protecting its water quality from new or increased point source discharges. Topography As part of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains Subsection within the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province, there are tectonic uplifted mountain ranges composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with many high gradient, deeply incised streams. Whitetop Laurel Slopes is a special biological area with underlying calcium bearing rocks that supports a fertile forest ecosystem. Parts of Whitetop Laurel Creek and Green Cove Creek pass through geological formations composed of tillite and rhythmite, rare sedimentary rocks associated with past glacial activity. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Whitetop Laurel was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is part of the ‚ÄúWhitetop Laurel Special Area‚Äù. On the south there are two areas designated as ‚ÄúMix of Successional Habitat‚Äù.

It was established by David and Simon Reuben. By 1996 TransWorld was the world's third-largest aluminum producer, behind Alcoa and Alcan. In 1997 it controlled smelters across the former Soviet Union with revenues estimated in at $5-7 billion. In early 2000, Trans- World sold most of its aluminum holdings to Roman Abramovich, who merged them with Oleg Deripaska's company to create Russian Aluminum (today Rusal). In 2010 Rusal went public. The following year, 2011, the British mining giant Glencore, which is headquartered in Baar, Switzerland, acquired an 8.8% stake in Rusal and became one of the firm's largest clients. Until 2015, Rusal was the world's largest aluminium company, based on output, until it was overtaken by China Hongqiao Group. On the 3rd of April 2020 Reuters reported that Rusal had signed a $16.3 billion contract with Glencore to supply aluminium until at least 2024. History The aluminum sector was one of the most contested industries during the Russian privatization process. David Reuben had been buying aluminum from the Soviet state since the late 1970s. In the post-Soviet turmoil, Reuben that found he could get the finished metal at low Soviet-era prices and then sell it at market rates. To set up the scheme, he established a partnership with Lev and Michael Cherney. Lev Chernoy's top aide was Vladimir Lisin, who, during the Soviet era, had been second-in-command to Oleg Soskovets when he was a steel-works executive. Oleg Soskovets, now Deputy Prime Minister, helped the firm in getting official approval for a tolling agreement. Under the system, both the raw material and the finished product were the property of TransWorld. The scheme maximized the cost of plant inputs and minimized the selling price for the metals. Trans World concluded its first tolling agreement in 1992, with the BrAZ smelter in Bratsk. By 1994, Trans-World was selling more than 600,000 tons of aluminum a year, or a quarter of Russia's total exports. As more of Russia's industry was privatized, Trans World bought stakes in the country's largest smelters, to prevent the rise of competitors which also might be interested in signing tolling deals. In the late 1990s TransWorld acquired the Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Factory, Russia's second-largest smelter, in cooperation with Anatoly Bykov. In 2002 the New York Times dubbed Bykov \\"one of Russia's most infamous mobsters\\", after he was convicted of conspiracy in a contract killing plot. However, in 2009 the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Russian government to pay him 26,000 euros (approximately $30,000) for illegally detaining him. Oleg Soskovets was dismissed from his government post in 1996, after falling out of favor with Yeltsin. In 1997 the company was investigated by the Russian police and the National Criminal Intelligence Service of Britain, but no charges were brought. By late 1997 Trans-World Group was being squeezed out by Russia-based financial groups, and had lost control of parts of its holdings, including Novolipetsk Steel.

Zhuang Ji flourished in the second century BCE as an early Han dynasty writer of literature and court attendant. He is notable for being one of the most published poets ever, due to having authored the piece \\"Ai shi ming\\", or \\"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\\", collected in the repeatedly re- published Chuci collection of verse: although just because Zhuang Ji's work was prolifically published as being included in a popular and early anthology does not necessarily mean that he has been notable for his poetic excellence. None of his other works are known to have survived. Zhuang Ji's biography is also sparse, although he is known to have been born in Wu state and later found refuge in Liang state. Both Wu and Liang were then semi-independent states, regions of the Han dynasty, directly controlled by their local ruler, in these two cases members of the royal house of Han. Zhuang Ji pursued a literary career, from which he attained his fame, though he seems to have at least initially made a living attending his local ruler's court, though in what function is unknown. During Zhuang Ji's life, political turmoil and social upheaval greatly informed his contributions to literature, indeed this kind of state of affairs is very evident in \\"Ai shi ming\\". Whether Zhuang Ji aspired to eventually join the central imperial court of Han to further his career or literary pursuits is unknown; however, it is known that he found patronage in two different regional state courts, in his native Wu, and later in Liang, then a center of literary activity. Zhuang Ji experienced turbulent and dangerous events which happened to occur in the places in which he dwelt, yet still found time and energy for a literary calling. Biography Little is known about the life of Zhuang Ji.Hawkes 1985, 262 However, there are historical records from the time which indicate the environmental background of his times. This was during the early Han dynasty, which was divided up into semi-autonomous states ruled by princes of the Liu family, the royal dynasts of Han. His two main patrons were both princes of the Liu dynastic family, and rulers of semi-autonomous states (under nominal loyalty to the emperor  vassal states of the early Han); and, both of his patrons ended up on the bad side of their relative, the Han emperor of the time, who was consolidating his imperial authority. Zhuang Ji's first patron was Liu Pi, who reigned as King/Prince of Wu from 216‚Äì154 BCE. Wu (Âê≥) was Zhuang Ji's home state. Zhuang Zhu, a son or nephew of Zhuang Ji, became a courtier to the emperor Han Wudi, initially chosen by tested merit through the imperial examination system, and later becoming personally promoted by Wudi to be Palace Grandee (zhong dafu), Zhuang Zhu became one of Wu's favorite courtiers.Chan and Lo, 48-49 Early life Zhuang Ji was a native of Wu, now southern Jiangsu,Hawkes 1985, 262 born in Kuaiji Commandery.Knechtes and Chan 2014, 2311 Wu had formerly been part of the Warring States kingdom of Chu, for which the Chuci poetry anthology was named, and largely inspired by. =At the court of Liu Pi, prince of Wu= Zhuang Ji eventually served at the court of Liu Pi, Prince of Wu (reigned 195 BCE - 154 BCE).Hawkes 1985, 262 He served there with his two friends Zou Yang and Mei Sheng.Hawkes 1985, 262 They presumably found some use for their literary skills, or perhaps they served as advisors of some sort; however, Zhuang Ji's patron in Wu, Liu Pi, has shown to history little interest in literature, and left no surviving works, in contrast with his second patron in Liang, who had quite the literary scene going on at his court.Chan and Lo, 43 =The beginning of troubles= Earthenware figures playing liubo, Han dynasty Emperor Han Wendi was the father by his wife Wang Zhi to Liu Pi and to crown prince, heir apparent to the empire. According to Sima Qian, prince Pi's son Liu Xian and his brother crown prince Qi became involved in a game of liubo \\"chess\\", which ended in the crown prince killing his nephew, Liu Pi's son, with the game board (which were often made of stone or bronze). Wendi died in 157 BCE and Qi became the emperor now known as Han Jingdi. Out of revenge and growing distrust of his brother, the emperor, Pi started building up wealth and military strength in Wu state. Jingdi then fell under the influence of his warmongering, trouble-making, and unwavering advocate of the Legalist school of thought minister Chao Cuo. This was followed by an imperial campaign to at least reduce the strength if not eliminate the semi-independent regional princes of Wu, Liang, Chu, and so on, thus to consolidate power in the central imperium. Perceiving the threat, and already so inclined due to the emperor (as crown prince) having killed his son, in 154 BCE prince Pi convinced six other ruling princes of the royal blood to rebel against the Han emperor; however, some of the rulers such as Liu Wu of Liang remained loyal vassals to Jingdi. This was the beginning of what is known as the Rebellion of the Seven States, or the Vassals' Rebellion. Later life Zhuang Ji would go on to develop his literary career at the patronage of the Han emperor's younger brother, the literally-inclined Liu Wu, ruler of Liang. He would thus avoid the disaster which would soon befall his former patron, as a result of his rebellious actions. However, danger affected Liang also, as it ended up as target of attack by Liu Pi and allies. =At the court of Liu Wu, prince of Liang= Zhuang, Zou, and Mei seem to have taken the opportunity to leave Wu at some point during the process of the developing troubles, perhaps in 157 BCE, before things got too perilous, and actual warfare broke out.Hawkes 1985, 262 Furthermore, Zhuang Ji's companions Zou Yang and Mei Cheng had memorialized Liu Pi advising him to not revolt against the Han emperor, advice which was rejected.Chan and Lo, 42 The three went to Liang, where they obtained the patronage of Liu Wu, Prince of Liang, the Han emperor's younger brother,Hawkes 1985, 262 and a great patron of the literary arts. =Princes' Rebellion= Map depicting the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BCE, under the influence of minister Chao Cuo, who came up with many excuses or reasons for doing so, emperor Jingdi ordered punishing reduction of many of the states, including carving out the commanderies (areas directly under imperial control) of Huiji and Yuzhang from the state territory of Wu, Zhuang Ji's home state. Jingdi lost his enthusiasm for his trouble-making minister Chao Cuo, after his minister Yuan Ang persuaded the emperor that Chao Cuo's claims of the vassal princes' disloyalty was overstated. Jing had minister Chao Cuo executed. However, events had already been set in motion. Uprising The seven rebel dynast princes then rose in armed rebellion, with the support of allied southern independent kingdoms of Donghai (modern Zhejiang) and Minyue (modern Fujian), which sent troops in aid. This was known as the Rebellion of the Seven States or the Vassals' War. Allied princes including Zhuang Ji's former patron Liu Pi. After some dispute between them as to the proper course of action, some, including Liu Pi, and the ruler of the state of Chu, decided to attack the state of Liang, ruled by emperor Jingdi's vassal, his younger brother, Zhuang Ji's new patron Liu Wu, Prince of Liang (ÂäâÊ≠¶/ÂàòÊ≠¶ of Ê¢Å). The rebel armies particularly those of Wu and Chu besieged Liu Wu's capital Suiyang (Áù¢ÈôΩ). Presumably both patron and client were at court to suffer through the siege. Response The empress dowager Xiaowen urged her son the emperor to send the imperial army to relieve Liang and her younger son, where presumably Zhuang Ji was located at the time at the prince's court, along with his two friends. The emperor appointed Zhou Yafu as general commander. General Zhou was a highly disciplined and effective general. After taking up his command, Zhou Yafu took advantage of the disorder among the rebel princes to establish a strong camp at Xiayi (, modern Dangshan in Anhui) athwart the rebel's line of supply and communication along the Si River, formerly a large and important watercourse. Ignoring Liu Wu's pleas for help and imperial orders to advance to the city, general Zhou used his discretion as field commander to refuse the orders and instead concentrate his resources at his base in Xiayi, where he made defenses, meanwhile disrupting the rebel supply lines from Chu, by sending the Marquess of Gonggao, Han Tuidang, who was the son of Han Xin (ÈüìÁéã), someone who had spent quite a bit of time learning the mobile military techniques of the Xiongnu. The rebels meanwhile continued their unsuccessful assault on Zhuang Ji's new home in the capital of Liang Suiyang. With their supply lines cut by general Zhou's subordinate Han Tuidang's efficient cavalry, the rebels fell back from their attack on Liang, deciding to attack general Zhou, at his by then well-fortified defensive base in Xiayi. In the event, the vassal prince's were easily defeated due to general Zhou's disciplined and effective preparations; indeed, Zhou initially refused even to be woken out of bed, upon the attack. The rebellion soon came to an end, after a fierce three months of fighting, with the defeat of the rebels. Aftermath tomb of emperor Jing and has second wife, namely Wang Zhi, mother of Han Wudi. The rebel princes generally came to a bad end: Zhuang Ji's former patron Liu Pi, ruler of Wu fled and was killed in flight by native Yue (a term used for various non-Han Chinese peoples), which people his duty had been to suppress, and his territory of Wu divided up among Liu Wu's sons. In contrast Zhuang Ji's patron Liu Wu was rewarded for his loyal support through the rebellion, his brother emperor Jingdi giving him honors and privileges. Liu Wu's private gardens rivaled the emperor's and he increased the number of his retinue, bringing in people whose actions would end up losing the favor he had gained with the emperor and leading to his eventual fall from grace. When Jingdi demoted his son Liu Rong from crown prince (taizi, heir apparent), in 150 BCE, Liu Wu and Jingdi's mutual mother, empress dowager Dou took this opportunity to lobby for her son Jingdi to name her other son, Liu Wu, as crown prince and successor, rather than Jingdi promoting one of his sons to this position. Jingdi agreed initially, but was then talked out of it by advisors. For example, minister Yuan Ang warned strongly against this breaking of the laws of succession as a destabilizing precedent, appointing a brother rather than the usual practice of choosing a son. Proceeding in support of their patron, some of Liu Wu's new retainers then went out and murdered this minister, Yuan Ang, going on to commit a series of killings in the effort to regain their patron, Liu Wu's, position as crown prince and the opportunity to become emperor, if Jingdi were to suddenly die. When Jingdi found out about this intrigue, Liu Wu had his two retainers commit suicide, presenting their bodies to the emperor, in appeasement. Nevertheless, Liu Wu failed to regain favor after this, he was seldom received at court, and his half-nephew (the future emperor, Han Wudi) replaced him as crown prince. In another and related dangerous turn of events for Liu Wu, the new crown prince's mother Wang Zhi was promoted to first lady, consolidating power against him at court. However, Liu Wu did not loose support of all the powerful court females. His mother, empress dowager Dou, still supported him, refusing to eat until he was cleared of charges. After an official investigation, the report back to emperor Jingdi was that Liu Wu had been found to have been involved, that \\"sparing the Prince of Liang would break the law of Han\\", yet, \\"killing him would deeply distress the Empress Dowager and upset the Emperor even more\\", counseling Jingdi to drop the issue. In discussion with the women, he blamed the murders solely upon Liu Wu's two courtiers, now dead and already lawfully punished. After returning from an unsuccessful trip to Chang'an, Liu Wu died at home in Liang, in 144 BCE. =Literary patronage= Liu Wu, prince of Liang, became a famous patron, particularly notably of the fu author Sima Xiangru. More generally, his court was a center of the development of fu poetry/prose style, rivaling that of his brother Jingdi, in Chang'an. Zhuang Ji was able to continue his literary efforts. His companion Zou Yang had one particularly influential piece was the \\"Memorial from Prison to the Prince of Liang\\", whereby Zou Yang successfully pleaded his case against the slander of other courtiers and freed himself from a death sentence not by addressing the charges against him but by multiplying historical examples of the disaster of gossip and libel. Zhuang Ji and Mei Sheng were said to have been too frightened to protest Zou's arrest and consequent narrowly-avoided death sentence.Hawkes 1985, 262 Liu Wu's death was at about age forty, at which time he still retained his court in Liang, and the feudal possessions thereof, despite being out-of-favor with the emperor. Prince Liu Wu of Liang left behind an estate estimated to include 400,000 catties of gold and an equivalent amount of wealth in land. It is not known whether Zhuang Ji outlived his patron.Hawkes 1985, 263 Works The archetypal sao poet, alone in the wilderness: Qu Yuan Zhuang Ji is known as the writer of the Chuci anthology piece \\"Ai shi ming\\", or \\"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\\".Hawkes 1985, 262 \\"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\\" is one of the poems anthologized in the ancient Chinese poetry collection, the Chu ci; which, together with the Shijing comprise the two major textual sources for ancient Chinese poetry. \\"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\\" is an example of the Sao type of Chu ci poetry, in the \\"O tempora o mores!\\" vein. \\"Ai shi ming\\" is written in the sao style initiated by Qu Yuan in his \\"Li sao\\", Zhuang Ji is also credited with writing 24 pieces in the fu-style by the Book of Han.Chan and Lo, retrieved 14 October 2018, 43 Despite the mention of 24 fu in Hanshu, the only known surviving piece of Zhuang Ji is \\"Ai shi ming\\".Knechtes and Chan 2014, 2310 Critical reception for Zhuang Ji's \\"Ai shi ming\\" has often been less than enthusiastic, despite his contemporaries nicknaming him \\"the Master\\", and even going so far as to extensively recycle parts of it as their own work. David Hawkes says that the poem incorporates all of the elements of the sao style: introspective grief, the symbolic structure, parallelism as a poetic device, and even a very brief shamanic-style spirit journey. However Hawkes finds the \\"inspiration dead\\" and the effect \\"monotonous and oppressive\\". Another point which he notes is to oppose the modern take on the poem to that of Zhuang Ji's contemporaries, whose taste for the poem was enhanced by their ability to particularly identify the \\"objects of his scorn and hatred\\", which is no longer possible due to lack of detailed information surviving into modern times.Hawkes 1985, 263 David Knechtes and Taiping Chan find that for the time in which it was written \\"Ai shi ming\\" has \\"eremitic sentiments\\" which were \\"rare in early Han\\" and that almost seem to be looking forward to Six Dynasties poetry.Knechtes and Chan 2014, 2311 See also *Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast *Chuci *Empress Wang Zhi *Empress Dou (Wen) *Han dynasty *Liu Pengli *Sima Xiangru Notes References *Hawkes, David, translation, introduction, and notes (2011 [1985]).

Elsewhere in South Australia the Local Board of Main Roads was the precursor to local government, but in the South East it was district drainage boards.\\" The original South-East Drainage District was formed in April 1876. Over the next five years parts were split off to form new drainage districts. The Tantanoola Drainage District was established in 1882 in the vicinity of Tantanoola township. Six years later in January 1888 the drainage district was declared a council district and expanded to included all of the Hundred of Hindmarsh not already a part of the council area. The District Councils Act 1887 was a statewide legislative push to ensure all settled areas of the state be under local governance. It stated that all existing drainage districts (and the accompanying drainage boards) were to effectively become district councils. Effective 23 May 1932, Tantanoola annexed a western part of the abolished District Council of Benara and District Council of Mount Gambier West.

This mosaic is a reflection of daily life and an explicit communication of the status and wealth of the owners, and what their life consisted of. It is composed of three registers, and focuses on an image of a dwelling in the center, surrounded by images of leisurely activities of the owners. First register The first of the three registers is an image of a woman sitting and fanning herself. She is dressed in a simple gown that is draping off her shoulder, decorated with bracelets on each wrist, and being served olives, a duck, and a lamb by a servant of the estate. The garment that falls from her shoulder is a possible connection to the Venus of Genitrix, the goddess of marriage and family. This focal point is surrounded by smaller images of figures picking olives from an olive tree. Second register It is not fully known what the purpose of the woman is. She is perhaps the lord of the estate's wife, but may just be pictured as a symbolism of an elite woman's status.. Elite women were higher than slave women, but still considered lower class citizens in comparison to men. This image of a woman being served acts as a statement that represents women, both slaves and the elite, in a positive manner. The middle register pictures a man on horseback riding towards the estate's house, accompanied by a servant on foot. The central house is built of powerful walls, an arcade along the facade, and four domes representing the baths. This type of home would have been a luxurious country mansion. The right side of this register is of two figures with dogs going hunting.  Third Register  The estate central in the mosaic The third register contains a woman leaning against a column, standing next to a chair that she has recently risen from. She holds a mirror, wears a fillet, earrings, and a dress with a jeweled neckline. A servant stands on her left carrying a basket of roses. Another is on his knees offering fish, and a female attendant gifts her a necklace. The image on the right end of the register is the master of the house lounging on a backless chair. A servant is bringing him grapes, a rabbit, and a message that reads \\"Julio Domino.\\" \\"Dominus\\" translates to mean property owner or master, indicating his role in the estate, and more powerful position over the woman's more leisurely activities. Overview This mosaic is part of the Pre-Vandal Invasion (c. 313-429) period of mosaics in Christian art at this time, and is purposed to reflect daily life and make a statement about the wealthy power of the elite. The mosaic as a whole is designed to display a picture of the great estate watched over by its master and mistress. The images of every season surrounding the estate represent the constant flow of lavish produced on the estate year round. This image communicates an ideal self image that aristocratic masters of an estate wanted to edify for themselves. The mosaic is very clear in communicating its message, both in the images it contains, and its placement in the home, where it would be seen by all masters, guests, and servants. It has since been removed from the home in Carthage, and is now kept at the Bardo Museum in Tunis.

These people often have complex, multiple and interdependent problems (multimorbidity) which make their care more challenging than in younger people, or those with just one medical problem. CGA is the core work of specialists in the care of older people, although many other health care practitioners either have not heard of it, or are not aware of what it actually is. It is also called \\"multidimensional geriatric assessment.\\" The use of CGA improves the outcomes for people who are older and frail. For example, people who undergo CGA whilst in hospital are more likely to remain in their own home (and less likely to be admitted to a nursing home) up to a year after discharge from hospital when compared with people who received standard medical treatment. \\"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults admitted to hospital\\", Cochrane, 12 September 2017. Retrieved 4 October 2018.  History  Geriatricians have focused on holistic assessments of their patients since the early days of the specialty. Dr. Marjorie Warren was the first doctor in the UK to systematically assess older people, categorizing them into those who could be got better with appropriate treatment and then discharged, and those who needed continuing (usually institutional) care. Over the past 30 years, CGA has evolved greatly, becoming much more explicit and better defined, and it has been implemented in a number of ways. One of the first formal models was the orthogeriatrics service set up in Hastings in the 1960s. The collaboration between Devas, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Irvine, a geriatrician, laid the foundation for a template for managing orthopaedic problems in older patients with concurrent medical problems. Subsequent collaborative models between geriatricians and other specialists have been described, for example managing cancer in people who are older and frail. In acute medicine the involvement of early CGA has been shown to reduce length of stay and improve management of people over the age of 70.  Rationale  Two thirds of older people have two or more long- term medical problems. \\"Multimorbidity ‚Äì the biggest clinical challenge facing the NHS?\\", NHS England, 25 November 2016. Retrieved 4 October 2018. This makes determining the cause of any deterioration more difficult, and thus deciding the best treatment plan is also challenging, since it depends on accurately diagnosing the underlying medical problem. CGA is a systematic approach to identifying the problems that are limiting a person's ability to thrive and make the most of their life, in order to try to remedy as many of the problems as possible. The aim is to maximize quality of life.  Assessment domains  * Physical health issues (e.g. heart failure, osteoarthritis) * Mental health issues (e.g. depression, vascular dementia) * Functional issues (e.g. unable to shower herself, or do shopping) * Social issues (e.g. lives alone, only child lives 200 miles away) * Environmental issues (e.g. many rugs in the house [trip risk], only heating is coal fire) Each of these domains is assessed (where possible using validated and reliable instruments and then a list of problems is compiled in the patient's record. This potentially allows solutions to be identified for each of the identified problems. However, it is not a simple tick box exercise, but depends to some extent on the expertise of the clinicians involved. The various members of the geriatric medicine multidisciplinary team (MDT) assess different domains. The physician (usually a geriatrician or GP) assesses physical and mental health; the pharmacist may undertake a medication review (deprescribing; the nurse assesses various aspects of personal care (for example skin integrity and continence); the physiotherapist, balance and mobility; the occupational therapist, activities of daily living; and the social worker, social aspects of the case. Other paramedical health care professionals may be involved as needed, on a case by case basis - for example a speech and language therapist if there are concerns about language or swallowing, a dietician if there are concerns about nutrition, and so on. Usually, the MDT meet regularly to integrate the information from the various assessments in order to formulate a list of problems and potential solutions. Then, recommendations about how to proceed can be explained to the older person (and to relatives or close friends, if the person wishes) to see what their preferences are. Since the person's condition may change over time, the process is iterative, working towards a final management plan. In the case of hospital in-patients the aim is to devise a robust discharge plan.  Evidence for its benefit  A Cochrane systematic review of studies looking at CGA found 29 relevant randomized controlled trials done in nine countries. They included a total of 13,766 people over 65 who were admitted to hospital, and compared CGA with routine care. This provides a fairly powerful body of evidence on which to base clinical practice, and is the basis for National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending its use in older people with complex needs admitted to hospital. It is widely accepted that CGA provides the benefits cited in the introduction above, except for people who are too well, or too frail. There is also evidence of its benefit with respect to functional status, social activity, satisfaction with life and health, and mood when used in primary care. However, the evidence for its use in the community was low quality, and the NICE recommended further research in specific groups of people, before making strong recommendations for its use.  Areas in which it is used  CGA has been shown to be useful for treating people who are hospitalized, in care homes, \\"Does Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment have a role in Care Homes?\\", Gordon, Adam L. PhD Thesis. 2012. Retrieved 9 October 2018. in case management (in the U.S.), in cancer treatment for older people, and in primary care (i.e. in the general community). \\"Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Toolkit for Primary Care Practitioners\\", BGS, 4 February 2016. Retrieved 9 October 2018. There is a relative lack of geriatricians with the training and expertise to contribute to a CGA, therefore, a significant proportion of people who are older and frail and who may benefit from CGA do not have access to it. \\"Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Position Statement\\", American Geriatrics Society, 5 September 2008.

It may be considered a \\"sister\\" division to the 363rd Rifle Division. After forming, it was assigned to the 39th Army, and played a major role in the near-encirclement of the German 9th Army around Rzhev in the winter counteroffensive of 1941-42. In recognition of its successes it was reorganized as the 21st Guards Rifle Division in March 1942. A new 361st was formed in November 1944, in the far east of the USSR. It saw action during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, staging several crossing operations of the Amur and Songhua Rivers during the first days of the offensive, in recognition of which one regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. 1st Formation The division began forming on August 1, 1941 in the Urals Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 at Ufa. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1200th Rifle Regiment * 1202nd Rifle Regiment * 1204th Rifle Regiment * 925th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 94 Col. Denis Vasilevich Mikhailov was assigned to command of the division on the day it began forming, and he continued in command through the existence of this formation. While the division was not known officially as a Bashkiri national division, given that it was formed in the Bashkir ASSR in the southern Urals, it probably had a large percentage of Bashkirs in its ranks, which numbered about 11,500 by the end of September.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 94 In November the division was assigned to the 39th Army, which was forming in the Arkhangelsk Military District. In the dying days of the German offensive on Moscow, the units of this Army were assigned to build defenses along the line of the Sheksna River. They later consolidated in the Torzhok area, and in late December the 39th was assigned to Kalinin Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 94 Beginning on January 8, 1942, this Army took part in the Sychevka-Vyasma Offensive Operation, which was planned \\"to encircle, and then capture or destroy the enemy's entire Mozhaisk - Gzhatsk - Vyasma grouping\\",Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 26-27 that is, what later became known as the Rzhev salient. The 361st was one of the spearheads of this thrust behind the German lines, reaching a point almost 50km due south of Rzhev by January 15; only the Soviet cavalry units made a deeper advance during this period. The division was recognized for its achievements in this counteroffensive on March 17th when it became the 21st Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 94 2nd Formation It was not until November 22, 1944, that a new 361st was formed, this time in the 15th Army of the Far Eastern Front; it was not officially \\"on the books\\" until December.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 38 It was under the command of Lt. Col. Arakel Karapetovich Oganezov until September 3, 1945. Its basic order of battle was as follows: *345th Rifle Regiment *355th Rifle Regiment *394th Rifle RegimentSharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 128 Due to its planned role in the upcoming offensive against the Kwantung Army, the division may not have had an artillery regiment formed. Prior to the offensive, the division was deployed near Leninskoye. According to the plan, it would link up with the 34th and 388th Rifle Divisions at Chiamussu on the Songhua River following the crossings. When the offensive began on August 9, 1945, the 361st made an assault river crossing of the Amur (over 1,000 metres wide at this point) with support from the 1st Brigade of the Amur Flotilla of the Red Navy. The reconnaissance and advance detachment, attacking without artillery support and in a heavy rainstorm, secured Tartar Island early that day. On August 10, ships of the Flotilla with elements of the division embarked, approached Tungchiang. After a two-hour battle with a Japanese rearguard, the town was secured. It was then joined by the 388th. The two divisions, supported by the 171st Tank Brigade and a rifle battalion as a forward detachment, moved south on the road to Fuchin, with the Amur Flotilla providing artillery support. Fuchin fell in a coordinated assault, with Japanese and Manchukuan defenders either surrendering or fleeing south or east to the next fortified areas. These held out until August 13, when they surrendered. The 345th and 394th Rifle Regiments had been ordered to load a battalion each on board the ships for future landings to assist the ground forces. The advance southwest from Fuchin towards Chiamussu was difficult, owing to Japanese resistance, bad roads and bad weather. The resistance was broken in part by landings of the 394th Rifle Regiment near Huachuan on the east bank of the Songhua, 40km north of Chiamussu. Outflanked, the Japanese forces had no choice but to fall back to the city.David M. Glantz, August Storm, The Soviet 1945 Strategic Offensive in Manchuria, Kindle edition, ch. 8. Note that Glantz twice mis-numbers the 394th Rifle Regiment as the 349th. For its role in these crossing operations, on September 14 the 394th Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. The division was disbanded in early 1946, after being transferred to the Transbaikal-Amur Military District following the disbandment of the 15th Army headquarters.

Early life and education Born Marion Hannig in New York City, she was the daughter of William A. Hannig and Carolyn Exner Hannig. Her father was a public school principal and later a member of the Board of Examiners (1921‚Äì53), an agency in New York City that set personnel standards for administrators and educators. Her mother operated a successful family-owned sand and gravel company. In 1950, Marion Hannig married John A. Ranyak; they divorced in the mid-1970s In 1946, after an unsatisfactory educational experience at Wheelock College, Marion Ranyak spent six weeks in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she studied with the painter Hans Hofmann. The result, she said, was a \\"very strong feeling of the two- dimensionality of the surface\\" which was \\"always there\\" in her paintings. Ranyak also began to travel‚Äîto California, France, and eventually Italy. While her husband was enrolled at MIT and she was raising their three children, Ranyak had little time to paint; she ceased for 14 years but resumed work in 1962. Reading Betty Friedan‚Äôs The Feminine Mystique, as she later noted, \\"gave me a support that I got nowhere else in my life.\\" Ranyak identified as a feminist and supported many liberal causes. Work Ranyak was a founding member of SOHO20 (est. 1973), the second all-women, artist-run art gallery in New York City. At SOHO20, she initially exhibited painted geometric abstractions and cement \\"sandcastings,\\" but an interest in photography led her to explore more realistic views of nature. Her small paintings of pebbles, stones, rocks, grass, and leaves‚Äîexhibited at SOHO20 in 1978‚Äîemphasize flatness through simplified but precise forms. Ranyak‚Äôs acrylic paintings were positively reviewed in The New York Times by Vivian Raynor, who described her landscapes as \\"modest\\" but with \\"an air of authority.\\" Raynor later wrote that Ranyak \\"makes Neil Welliver look like an Expressionist.\\" Ranyak was praised by another critic for her ability to suggest texture while using flatly applied acrylic paint, as in Nova Scotia‚ÄîGrassy Slope (1985). Her later paintings of fields in upstate New York were well-received by Michael Brenson, who wrote, \\"She touches the canvas as delicately as a bird ‚Ä¶ The light in her paintings is always at that point of gray heat that sets everything in a landscape in motion.\\" Ranyak remained a full member of SOHO20 until 1988 and continued as an associate member until 1995. In later years, she lost interest in the urban art scene and exhibited primarily in Westchester County, New York.

After the death of Agatha's father, her mother married Joseph Bailly, a fur trader of French descent originally from Nova Scotia who came to some prominence. They lived in the Mackinac area and Agatha continued to have a close relationship with her mother after her marriage. Marriage and family Biddle House, Mackinaw Island Edward Biddle arrived on Mackinac Island shortly after the conclusion of the War of 1812 and it is after this date that Agatha and Edward married. By marrying Agatha, Biddle made a connection to the prominent Bailly fur trading family. Details of their wedding were recorded, and guests included many prominent members of Mackinac society, including Madeline La Framboise. Agatha and her mother were recorded by contemporary Elisabeth Baird as wearing the traditional dress of the M√©tis women of the area at the wedding. This included layers of broadcloth, leggings, moccasins, ribbons and beads, all elaborately embroidered.Farrell Racette, Sherry. Sewing Ourselves Together : Clothing, Decorative Arts and the Expression of Metis and Half Breed Identity. Aug. 2004. mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca, https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/xmlui/handle/1993/3304. Biddle continued to wear traditional clothing through her life. Fleming notes the marriage of Edward and Agatha was not unusual for the time. However, while it was typical for M√©tis women to marry outside their home community, Edward Biddle was an English-speaking, Protestant American in a community that was primarily Indigenous and French Canadian. Together Agatha and Edward Biddle had seven children: Sophia, John, Sarah and Mary and together they built their business.Billock, Jennifer. Ghosts of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Arcadia Publishing, 2018. Their youngest daughter Mary died at the age of eight after falling through the ice while travelling between Mackinac Island and St. Ignace and her grave is the oldest in the St. Ann cemetery. Fur trade and later life on Mackinac During the early period of the fur trade the Mackinac and surrounded area were primarily inhabited by First Nations people, but by the middle of the nineteenth century their numbers were greatly reduced due to war, including the War of 1812, and treaties which saw many of the local Odawa and Anishinaabe people relocated to tiny parcels of land. Biddle was made chief of the Mackinac band in the mid 1800s. Biddle took on a number of community roles, including taking in sick or orphaned Anishnaabe children and offering food and other charity. She is recorded as serving as undertaker on the island. She supplied coffins and carried out burial services. Biddle is cited as an example of the way Metis women used their connections between local First Nations communities as well as settler communities to advantage in the fur trade society of the Great Lakes. Fleming notes that there is archeological evidence to support the fact that Biddle worked with birch bark, as well as engaging in quill work and basketry.

Yamada opened the first Ramen Jiro in Meguro, Tokyo in 1968. As of 2018, there are approximately 40 locations across Japan, over 30 of which are in the greater Tokyo area. Ramen Jiro is known for its large portions and its distinctly flavored broth, which enthusiasts call \\"Jirorian style.\\" In 2009, The Guardian included Ramen Jiro on its list of \\"The 50 best things to eat in the world\\".  History  Ramen Jiro was founded by Yamada in 1968 in the city of Meguro, Tokyo, located near Tokyo Metropolitan University. According to Yamada, the restaurant initially served a thinner, lighter style of ramen. However, with the help of a neighboring Chinese restaurant, Yamada developed the new, distinctive flavor that became known as \\"Jirorian style.\\" This style is characterized by a salty shoyu and tonkotsu soup base, with thick dense noodles and fatty pork chunks. During Tokyo's redevelopment in the early 1970s, the first Ramen Jiro shop moved to Mita, Tokyo. During the move, there was an error in painting the sign, using the characters instead of for Jir≈ç, a common boy's name. Instead of correcting it, Yamada decided to change the characters of the name to . Ramen Jiro quickly gained popularity among Keio students due to its close proximity to Keio University. In 1995, the shop in Mita was forced to relocate due to the city's redevelopment. As a result, students petitioned the university to move the restaurant to the Keio campus. The University administration declined the petition, but Yamada managed to move the shop to another location in Mita, where the flagship shop now stands. Additionally in 1995, Ramen Jiro opened its second shop in Meguro and the franchise has steadily expanded since. = Nutrition = One small-sized bowl of Jiro's ramen is estimated to contain a combined 300g of broth and noodles with an estimated 1600 kcal, whereas the average small-sized bowl at a typical Japanese ramen shop contains under 200g of broth and noodles and 600 kcal. Since Jiro's ramen is high in carbohydrates and fats and has little nutritional value, it is often described as a junk food by food critics.  Reception  = Aficionados = Ramen Jiro has an avid fan base called Jirorian (). According to Noriko Arai, an economics professor at Sophia University, Ramen Jiro employs a \\"worshipper\\" type of marketing, relying on a small group of enthusiastic customers, typically students and salarymen. Some Jirorians make a pact to visit all 40 Jiro franchises and regard the first shop in Mita as \\"the sacred place.\\" = Internet culture = Twitter user @habomaijiro, known for his unique daily reviews of Ramen Jiro, gathered more than 35,000 followers.

After the Communist takeover, he was jailed, but managed to escape the country shortly after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and settled in Canada. Life Koch's sanatorium Koch was born in Brno, then Austria-Hungary, in 1890, the son of a railway worker. After studying medicine in Brno, Prague, and Vienna, he moved to Bratislava in 1919 (shortly after the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic). In 1927, he became a member of the Faculty of Medicine at Comenius University. Between 1929 and 1931, Koch had a sanatorium (cs, sk) designed by his friend, architect Du≈°an Jurkoviƒç, and surrounded with a garden with 130 species of plants. The expense left him in debt for the rest of his life. Among his patients were R. W. Seton-Watson and Andrej Hlinka. He argued for the rehabilitation of disabled children, and was a strong supporter of the liberal ideals of President Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk. In 1939, the Slovak State declared independence and Nazi Germany invaded the Czech lands, establishing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. As an ethnic Czech, Koch faced discrimination in the Slovak State and was dismissed from his faculty post. In 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo and spent a three months imprisoned in Brno and Vienna. Koch belonged to the Czech anti-fascist group Obrana n√°roda and saved the lives of several Jews from Nazi persecution. During the wave of deportations in 1942, he helped some hide in various hospitals until the deportations had stopped. In 1944, when the Germans invaded and resumed deportations, Koch built several bunkers around Bratislava. One of these was used by Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl after he jumped from a train headed for Auschwitz concentration camp, where his family was murdered. Koch personally brought Weissmandl food and other necessities. He convinced some of his friends to hide other Jews in their homes. Wanted by the Gestapo, Koch evaded arrest until the liberation of Bratislava by the Red Army in April 1945. After the war he married Josef√≠na Kellen, one of the Jews that he had saved. Garden outside the sanatorium In 1946, he performed surgery on the chief rabbi of Slovakia, Armin Frieder, who died two days later at the age of 34. At the time, some Jews blamed Koch for Frieder's death, but the accusation had no merit according to Armin's brother Emanuel. The same year, Koch published a book, stating that the antisemitic incidents that he witnessed in Bratislava in the summer of 1945 were \\"not antisemitism, but something far worse‚Äîthe robber‚Äôs anxiety that he might have to return Jewish property,\\" a view that has been endorsed by scholar . In his book, Koch did not capitalize words such as \\"germans, germany, hitler, himmler, mein kampf,\\" \\"ss\\", and \\"f√ºrer\\" [sic]. Pynsent finds it strange that Koch could \\"stoop to such a petty device\\". After the 1948 Communist coup, Koch remained in Bratislava. In 1951, he was arrested and accused of espionage; he was imprisoned between 1951 and 1963. Following the Prague Spring and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Koch fled the country with his wife and son and settled in Canada. He died in Toronto in 1981. Legacy For many years, Koch was little-known compared to his achievements as a doctor and humanitarian. In 2008, a biography, Zabudnite na Kocha (\\"Forget about Koch\\") was published. He was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations in 1971. There is a tree planted for Koch in the Avenue of the Righteous at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.

He is a member of the hip hop group City Morgue and a former songwriter for 6ix9ine. Biography Rogers was born in Bay Shore, New York in 1999. In his teens, Rogers formed a punk rock band with some of his friends from school, influenced by the sound of Gorilla Biscuits. His involvement in hip hop music began by ghostwriting and developing the image for fellow New York rapper 6ix9ine, even coming up with the idea for his rainbow-based aesthetic. During this period, he wrote a song which he intended to feature two vocalists, to which 6ix9ine responded by telling him that he should feature on the track, which would eventually be released under the name \\"Yokai\\", and the pair followed up with by releasing another collaborative track called \\"Hellsing Station\\". However, in August 2017, the pair had a falling out when Rogers posted a photo of 6ix9ine engaging in a sexual act with a girl that he claimed was thirteen, and bringing to light his prior guilty plea to using a child in a sexual performance. On 30 April 2017, he released his debut EP \\"LifeIsAHorrorMovie\\", which he later took down due to him no longer feeling a connection with the music that is contained. Soon after, ZillaKami got in contact with the son of the owner of the tattoo parlour that his older brother Righteous P worked at, who went by the stage name SosMula. A few days after his release from prison on drug charges, SosMula formed City Morgue with ZillaKami. In August 2018, after numerous singles scattered throughout the couple years before, they released their debut EP as a group, titled \\"Be Patient\\". On 5 September 2018, he featured on the track \\"Vengeance\\" from Denzel Curry's third album Ta13oo, which also featured JPEGMafia, which was followed, in the same month, by a feature on Lil Gnar's track \\"Man Down\\". On 12 October 2018, City Morgue released their debut album \\"City Morgue Vol 1: Hell or High Water\\", and soon after, their headline tour in support of it sold out. On 29 November 2018, he featured on Powers Pleasant's track \\"Please Forgive\\", along with Jay IDK, Zombie Juice and Denzel Curry. From July 24 to August 23, he joined Suicideboys' Grey Day tour as a part of City Morgue, along with Turnstile, Denzel Curry, Trash Talk, Pouya, Germ, Shoreline Mafia and Night Lovell. On 13 December 2019, City Morgue released their second album \\"City Morgue Vol 2: As Good As Dead\\". The deluxe version of said album, featuring several new tracks, was released on May 15, 2020. On 31 July 2020, City Morgue released their third studio album \\"Toxic Boogaloo\\". Musical style and influence ZillaKami's music has been described as merging elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal with trap music, by incorporating guttural shouted vocals and aggressive lyrical themes. His lyrics often depict themes of extreme violence, death, masochism and drug-use. In an article by Complex magazine, writer Jacob Moore described his music as \\"the most merciless rap music since Necro\\". Many aspects of his music would also be borrowed by 6ix9ine, both during and after Rogers' period of writing for him. He cites his biggest influences as Title Fight's albums Floral Green and Hyperview, DMX, as well as Radiohead's album In Rainbows and Onyx.

He acceded on the death of Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi. His rule was tumultuous and unpopular, marked by internecine conflicts and public discontent and saw the final disintegration of the Al Qasimi's joint rule over Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah. Deposed as Ruler of Sharjah in 1924, he went on to become ruler of Dhaid and Kalba (itself recognised by the British as a Trucial State) and a highly influential figure in the Shamaliyah (the east coast of the peninsula).  Accession  Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi nominated his cousin, Khalid bin Ahmad, as his successor shortly before his death, as his own sons were still minors. One of Khalid bin Ahmad's first acts on becoming Ruler of Sharjah was to settle the question of Jazirat Al Hamra. Home to some 500 houses of the Za'ab tribe (the Emirati family name Al Zaabi derives from the singular of Za'ab), Jazirat Al Hamra was normally regarded as a dependency of Ras Al Khaimah (although it was frequently an unwilling one) and Khalid confirmed this in a formal division of dependencies between the two emirates. In 1919, Khalid bin Ahmad appointed his brother Rashid bin Ahmad as wali of Dibba, which led to a prolonged dispute over the fiefdom after Khalid was deposed as Ruler of Sharjah in 1924.  Loss of Ras Al Khaimah  Khalid bin Ahmad's rule was characterised by a number of challenges, not the least of which was losing Ras Al Khaimah as a dependency. He had inherited a problematic situation in Ras Al Khaimah, where Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, the former Ruler of Sharjah and, briefly, Ras Al Khaimah, had established virtual independence. Salim's son son Muhammad took over the leadership role in Ras Al Khaimah after Salim became paralysed and then, in July 1919 renounced his position in favour of his brother, Sultan. Salim died in August 1919, leaving Sultan as leader in his place. The British were initially reluctant to recognise Sultan bin Salim as a Trucial Sheikh (and therefore independent from Khalid bin Ahmad) as they believed his tenure would be short-lived. However, on 7 June 1921, he was confirmed as such by the British Political Resident. Khalid's impotence in the face of this act was striking, as was his weakness at managing the rebellious headman of Heera, Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi. In June 1920, Abdulrahman seized the fort of Ajman and was only removed after the intercession of the British Residency Agent. Khalid bin Ahmed raised a force, together with Humaid bin Abdulaziz Al Nuaimi of Ajman and together they attacked Abdulrahman in Heera. Again, the British intervened and an agreement was made that recognised Abdulrahman as a subject of Khalid's and bound him to cause no further trouble. This annoyed Humaid bin Abdulaziz of Ajman who gained nothing by it. In early 1922, along with the other Trucial Sheikhs, Khalid signed an agreement with the British that any oil concessions would be granted only to a British government appointee. However, no such concession was signed during his rule. He also entered into an agreement with the headman of Hamriyah to grant the town independence, signed in the presence of the British Resident Agent (to the fury of the Political Resident in Bushire) on 9 August 1923. Khalid's successor considered the agreement void.  Deposed as Ruler of Sharjah  Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Saqr bin Khalid's son, petitioned Ahmad for the restitution of property and money that Khalid had seized on assuming power, but in vain. Embittered, he left Sharjah in 1921 and settled in Dubai. In 1923, he married the daughter of Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi. Khalid bin Ahmad took this as a challenge and once again moved against Abdulrahman at Heera, but Abdulrahman appealed to the Residency Agent who negotiated a peace and put two of his own men to guard the fort at Heera. Khalid then appointed a wali over Heera, who, Abdulrahman arrested. Khalid then moved against Heera, which Abdulrahman now prepared to defend against a combined force from Sharjah and Ajman. Another British intervention followed and Abdulrahman went to Dubai to join his son-in-law. By now, the people of Sharjah had had enough. Khalid was unpopular and was seen as weak, having lost Ras Al Khaimah and oppressed Heera. His actions towards Sultan, the son of the former ruler, were widely deprecated and his taxes and levies were resented. On 1 November 1924, Sultan bin Saqr was welcomed into Sharjah and deposed Khalid in a brief, 11-day conflict. Khalid took refuge in Dubai and then Umm Al Qawain.  Ruler of Dhaid  Although removed as Ruler of Sharjah, Khalid had considerable influence over Sharjah's eastern dependencies, Dhaid, Dibba and Kalba. On taking control of Sharjah, Sultan bin Saqr removed Khalid's brother Rashid bin Ahmed as wali of Dibba. However, he was restored in 1926 after leading a popular revolt and remained as wali until his death in 1937. In June 1927, an agreement was reached between Sultan bin Saqr and Khalid bin Ahmad to provide for the upkeep of the deposed ruler's family. This ceded the fort at Dhaid and the revenues of the inland oasis town to Khalid bin Ahmad. Dhaid, in 1906, generated some 228 Marie Theresa Dollars annually in water rates, as well as revenue from the sale of dates. Although he had Sultan bin Saqr's agreement, Khalid remained in Umm Al Qawain and sent some of his men to Dhaid to occupy his newly acquired property as the Bedouin who had manned the fort for Sultan were still active in the area. With the support of the Sheikhs of the Bedouin Bani Ka'ab and Na'im tribes, who favoured any scheme which would weaken Sharjah, it was agreed that the ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi, would possess Dhaid 'on behalf of Khaled bin Ahmad'. This arrangement was not fully supported by Sultan bin Salim himself, who feared antagonising Sultan bin Saqr and also believed Khalid bin Ahmad would represent an ongoing financial burden with little hope of any return other than conflict. Khalid bin Ahmad finally took full possession of Dhaid in his own right in July 1928.  Ruler of Kalba  In April 1937, Khalid bin Ahmad married Aisha, the daughter of the former wali but now Ruler of Kalba, Sheikh Said bin Hamad Al Qasimi. Said bin Hamad had been recognised as a Trucial Sheikh by the British in 1936 in return for his agreement to confer landing rights for a backup airstrip to support the Imperial Airways airfield in Sharjah. Said bin Hamad died suddenly at the end of April 1937 while visiting Khor Fakkan. Said bin Hamad's son, Hamad, was still a minor and therefore Aisha moved quickly to establish a regency, travelling to Kalba and organising the town's defences. For many years Said bin Hamad had lived in Ajman and entrusted a slave by the name of Barut to manage Kalba on his behalf and Aisha now arranged for Barut to once again take charge as Wali. She sent a message to Khalid bin Ahmad, who was in Ras Al Khaimah at the time. A period of intense political infighting and negotiation between the many involved parties now followed. In June 1937, the notable residents of Kalba selected the slave Barut as Regent for the 12-year-old Hamad, but this solution was not accepted by the British and Khalid bin Ahmad was selected as regent. Khalid was increasingly seen as an influential and unifying figure by the Bedouin and the townspeople of the East Coast, to the point where his old foe, Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah, was forced to ask Khalid bin Ahmad for help in pacifying the tribes of the interior, particularly the Bani Qitab, paying Khalid 1,500 Rupees for his intercession. Khalid ruled over Dhaid and Kalba (delegating his rule in Kalba to Barut and choosing himself to live in Dhaid and Heera) until 1950, when he was too old and infirm to take a further role in affairs. He died that year.

He was the founder of the Makiki Christian Church in Honolulu, Hawaii, the \\"Okumura Boys and Girls Home\\", and some of Hawaii's first Japanese language schools.  Early life  Okumura was born to a family of samurai in Kochi prefecture, Japan in 1865. He married Katsu Ogawa in 1886. He converted to Christianity on September 9, 1888, and studied at Doshisha University. During his time at university he was supported by John Thomas Gulick. After graduating in 1894, he traveled to Hawaii as a missionary assisting Reverend Jiro Okabe. He took over Okabe's ministry in 1895 when Okabe returned to Japan.  Career  Makiki Christian Church One of the first things Okumura did after taking over Okabe's congregation in 1895 is start a Japanese kindergarten. His goal was to teach Japanese children living in Hawaii the Japanese language, because many spoke pidgin, English, or Hawaiian. He established the Honolulu Japanese Elementary school a year later in 1896. The school later expanded and was renamed the Hawaii Chuo Gakuin. The schools he founded were the first Japanese language schools in Hawaii. In 1896 Okumura founded the \\"Okumura Boys and Girls Home\\" after taking in a young man attending school in Honolulu. The dormitory housed 1,400 students, mostly from neighbor islands. While staying at the dormitory, students had to attend church. Spark Matsunaga was one notable resident. In 1899 he founded a baseball team made up mostly of students living at the \\"Okumura Home\\". The team was called the \\"Excelsiors\\", and was the first Japanese baseball team in Hawaii. Okumura founded the team in order to provide a wholesome entertainment venue, away from the \\"vice\\" in town. In 1904 Okumura established the Makiki Christian Church. The modern church building, which is well-known for its architectural similarity to a Japanese castle, was not constructed until 1932. Okumura chose that architectural style as a symbol of peace and security. After the Oahu sugar strike of 1920, Okumura traveled to every island to encourage nisei to \\"Americanize\\", and give up their dual citizenship with Japan. He believed that this would solve the \\"Japanese problem\\", a term coined by European sugar plantation owners. Needless to say, many Japanese plantation workers were not pleased with his decision to side with the sugar plantation owners during this tense time between the management and laborers. During this time, and later when the American government tried to impose legislation restricting foreign language schools, Okumura clashed with Fred Kinzaburo Makino. Okumura retired from the church in 1937, but remained head of the \\"Okumura Home\\" until he died on February 10, 1951.

The water downstream is also used for irrigation. . Technical characteristics It was constructed between 2005 and 2010, specifically as a multi-purpose project, but with a major part of construction involving the hydropower plant, 11.8 km headrace tunnel from Lake Tana, and 7.2km tailrace tunnel to the Jehana river (minor tributary of the Beles River) . While Lake Tana and the Beles River are both in the Blue Nile/Abbay basin, water would not usually flow from the lake through this river. The interbasin transfer project therefore provides substantial additional water within the Beles River region (on average 77 m3/s ), enabling irrigation development, notably of sugarcane . Social and environmental impacts The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Tana-Beles interbasin water transfer is not available. The social impacts of the Tana-Beles water transfer have been studied and results published in the high-profile Journal of Hydrology: the dangerously high increases in discharge of Beles river have led to the drowning of 250 people between 2010 and 2018. The negative impacts on rural livelihoods are however overshadowed by national development goals (electricity production). The external costs (coping with damage) are borne by local people, who have low bargaining power.
