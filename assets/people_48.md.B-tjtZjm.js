There are two types of withdrawal: mandatory and voluntary. Mandatory withdrawal occurs where a circumstance arises under which an attorney must terminate the representation, while voluntary withdrawal occurs where circumstances permit the attorney to terminate the representation at the attorney's election. Where litigation has been filed and an attorney is representing the client in court, permission of the court must usually be sought in support of an attorney's withdrawal. Mandatory withdrawal There are many circumstances which require that an attorney must withdraw from a case: # The client fires the attorney. # The attorney determines that he is not competent to continue representing the client in a matter. # A conflict of interest arises under which the attorney's continued representation of multiple clients impairs the attorney's obligations to the individuals. # The client insists upon advancing a frivolous claim. # Continued representation would violate the rules of professional responsibility. # The attorney is in a physical or emotional state that seriously impairs the attorney's ability to continue the representation. # It is likely that the attorney will be called as a necessary witness as to a contested issue in the proceeding, and that testimony cannot be obtained elsewhere. # The attorney discovers that the client is using the attorney's services to further a criminal act. Voluntary withdrawal An attorney may voluntarily terminate the attorney-client relationship at any time and without reason, if this will not have a material adverse effect on the interests of the client. Even if the withdrawal will be adverse to the client the attorney may still withdraw for a number of reasons: # The client is engaged in illegal or fraudulent activity. # The client fails to pay fees as agreed. # The financial burden on the attorney of continuing the representation is too great. # The client refuses to follow the advice of counsel, or engages in acts relating to the representation without informing the attorney or seeking the attorney's advice. # The attorney is engaged with co-counsel of the client's choosing, and is unable to work with that co- counsel. Rules governing withdrawal Where the attorney withdraws from representation, he has a continuing duty to maintain the confidentiality of information provided by the client during the relationship, except to the extent that the attorney may need to reveal confidences in a lawsuit to recover unpaid fees owed. However, the attorney must refund any portion of the retainer or other fees paid that exceeds what the attorney has earned during the representation. The attorney must notify the client of the withdrawal prior to ceasing his work on the case, must make a reasonable effort to assist the client in obtaining new counsel, and must cooperate with that new counsel during the transition to the new representation. The attorney must also, on request, deliver the client's file to the client or the client's new counsel.

He is most notable for his role in the events that led to the Great Schism in 1054. Biography Michael Cerularius was born in Constantinople around 1000 AD, being ordained into the Church from a young age. He is noted for disputing with Pope Leo IX over church practices in respect of which the Roman Church differed from Constantinople, especially the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist.Michael C√¶rularius - Catholic Encyclopedia article Notable disagreements were also exchanged over other theological and cultural issues, ranging from the issue of papal supremacy in the Church to the filioque clause and other disagreements between the Patriarchates. In 1054, Pope Leo IX sent a letter to the Patriarch, citing a large portion of the Donation of Constantine believing it genuine.Migne's Patrologia Latina, Vol. 143 (cxliii), Col. 744-769. Also Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova Amplissima Collectio, Vol. 19 (xix) Col. 635-656. :\\"The first pope who used it [the Donation] in an official act and relied upon it, was Leo IX; in a letter of 1054 to Michael C√¶rularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, he cites the \\"Donatio\\" to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly imperium, the royal priesthood.\\" Some scholars say that this letter of September 1053, the text of which is available in Migne, Patrologia Latina, vol. 143, coll. 744-769, was never actually despatched, but was set aside, and that the papal reply actually sent was the softer but still harsh letter Scripta tuae of January 1054. Leo IX assured the Patriarch that the donation was completely genuine, not a fable or old wives' tale, arguing that only the apostolic successor to Peter possessed primacy in the Church. This letter of Pope Leo IX was addressed both to Michael Cerularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and Leo of Ohrid, Archbishop of Bulgaria, and was in response to a letter sent by Leo, Metropolitan of Achrida to John, Bishop of Trani (in Apulia), that categorically attacked the customs of the Latin Church that differed from those of the Greeks. Especially criticized were the Roman traditions of fasting on the Saturday Sabbath and consecration of unleavened bread. Leo IX in his letter accused Constantinople of historically being a center of heresies and claimed in emphatic terms the primacy of the Bishop of Rome over even the Patriarch of Constantinople. Cerularius would have none of it. It can be argued that in 1054, the Patriarch's letter to Pope Leo IX initiated the events which followed, because it claimed the title \\"ecumenical patriarch\\" and addressed Pope Leo as \\"brother\\" rather than \\"father.\\" Pope Leo IX sent an official delegation on a legatine mission to meet with the Patriarch. Members of the papal delegation were: cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida, papal secretary Frederick of Lorraine, who was Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica, and Peter, Archbishop of Amalfi. Soon after their arrival in Constantinople, news was received that Pope Leo had died on 19 April. Since the official position and authority of papal legates was dependent upon the pope who authorized them to represent him, the news of Leo's death placed his envoys in an awkward position. In spite of this, they decided to proceed with their mission, but even before any religious discussions were held, problems arose regarding some basic formalities and ceremonies. During the initial audience, Cerularius refused to meet with papal envoys in their official capacity and left them waiting with no further audience for months. During that time, from April to July 1054, cardinal Humbert and his colleagues continued with their activities in Constantinople, taking part in informal religious discussions on various issues. This was seen as inappropriate by the Patriarch. Despite the fact that their legatine authority officially ceased after popes death, Cardinal Humbert and his colleagues decided to engage in open dispute with the Patriarch. On Saturday, 16 July 1054, they produced a Charter of Excommunication (lat. charta excommunicationis), directed against Patriarch Michael of Constantinople, Archbishop Leo of Ohrid, and all of their followers. On the same day, Cardinal Humbert and his colleagues entered the church of the Hagia Sophia during the divine liturgy and placed the Charter on the altar. Soon after that, the Patriarch decided to react. On 20 July 1054, a synod of 21 metropolitans and bishops was held in Constantinople, presided over by Cerularius. The council decided to excommunicate Cardinal Humbert and his colleagues. Only the three men were anathematized, and a general reference was made to all who support them, but there was no explicit excommunication of the entire Western Christianity, or the Church of Rome. On Sunday 24 July the conciliar anathema was officially proclaimed in the Hagia Sophia Church. The events of 1054 caused the Great Schism and led to the end of the alliance between the Emperor and the Papacy, and caused later Popes to ally with the Normans against the Empire. Patriarch Michael closed the Latin churches in his area, which exacerbated the schism. In 1965, those excommunications were rescinded by Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras, when they met in Jerusalem. Although the excommunication delivered by Cardinal Humbert was invalid, this gesture represented a significant step towards restoring communion between Rome and Constantinople. The short reign of the Empress Theodora then saw Michael intriguing against the throne. Michael Psellus notes that while their initial relations had been cordial, once Theodora took the Imperial throne, they entered into open conflict, as Michael \\"was vexed because the Roman Empire was being governed by a woman\\", and on this topic \\"he spoke his mind freely.\\".Psellus, p. 269. The historian suggests that Theodora would have deposed Michael for his open effrontery and sedition, had she lived longer. Cerularius had a hand in negotiating the abdication of Michael VI Stratiotikos, convincing him to step down on 31 August 1057, in favour of the rebellious general Isaac, for whom the army declared on 8 June.Norwich, pg. 332 The emperor duly followed the patriarch's advice and became a monk. Having had a role in bringing him to the throne, Cerularius soon quarrelled with Isaac I Komnenos over confiscation of church property. Michael went so far as to take the highly symbolic step of donning the purple shoes ceremonially reserved for the Emperor. Michael apparently planned a rebellion, to overthrow the Emperor and claim the Imperial Throne for himself or for his relative Constantine Doukas. Isaac exiled Michael to Proconnesus in 1058 and, as Michael refused to step down, had Psellus drew up accusations of heresy and treason against him.Psellus, p. 315. Editor's n. I.

He was forced to flee Germany for Prague, Poland in 1933 to escape Nazi persecution, and by the 1940s, he had moved to Russia. Early life and amateur career Stein was born on January 20, 1905 in Bytom, East Prussia, currently part of Poland to Jewish parents. He was the German Amateur Flyweight Champion from 1922-3. His primary residence was Berlin, Germany from 1924-33, while he established and pursued his boxing career. Maccabee boxing club trophy inscription, name at bottom In the 1920s Stein was recognized by the German Maccabee organization, boxing club, 'J√ºdischer Boxclub Maccabi' of Berlin with a boxing trophy on the occasion of his 30th fight. The Maccabee organization managed a few German gyms for Jewish youth in Germany, which included a club in Berlin that featured boxing training. The sizable Macabee organization would move its headquarters from Berlin to London in July 1933, around the same time Stein would move to Poland to escape the rise of the Nazis who had come to power in Germany that January. Early conquest of the BDB and VDF German Flyweight championships, 1925-6 He took the BDB German Flyweight Championship from Friedrich Schmidt in a twelfth-round knockout on June 16, 1925, in Platz, Germany. In a defense of the title on June 18, 1926, Stein also took the VDF German National Flyweight Championship in a tenth- round knockout of Schmidt at the Radrennbahn in Treptow, Germany. He had first defeated Schmidt on August 15, 1924, in Hannover, Germany in an eighth round points decision. Facing one of his most competitive opponents, Stein lost to 1931 Canadian World Bantamweight Champion, Norwegian-American Pete Sanstol on July 13, 1926 in a fourth-round newspaper decision at Luna Park in Halansee, Germany. According to the German publication, Jahrbuch des Deutschen Boxsport, Stansol won decisively. He first fought for the German Bantamweight championship on May 8, 1927 against Felix Friedmann losing in a twelfth-round technical knockout at Stadion Radrennbahn, in Frankfurt, Germany. Though there was no official decision, Stansol was reported to have won decisively. =Relinquishing the German flyweight championship due to VDF ruling, March 1928= Stein fought a German featherweight championship bout on March 1, 1928 against Eric Kohler losing in a fourth round disqualification at Ausstellungshalle, in Dresden. The exact nature of the foul that led to the disqualification is unknown. The fight was not officially considered a featherweight championship bout at the time because Stein was not within the featherweight limit at the weigh-in. Stein was forced to relinquish the title on March 17, however, when the German Boxing Federation (V.D.F.) ruled that because of the disqualification, Kohler would be adjudged the winner and take the German featherweight title. The ruling seems peculiar, since by current rules, if both boxers are not within the necessary weight class range at weigh in, no title can change hands. Fighting in Paris and Belgium Frankie Genaro Stein fought primarily in Paris, and Belgium, between May and December 1929, meeting quality opponents but no world champions, where he established an impressive record of 12 wins and 3 losses. He met the incomparable reigning World Flyweight champion, Italian-American Frankie Genaro in an eighth round no decision bout on February 26, 1930 at the Sportpalast, in Schoeneberg, Germany, which he won by disqualification. In the original decision, Genaro was disqualified for a low blow in the eighth round. The German Boxing Federation (V.D.F.), however, annulled the ruling five days later, believing the referee had acted too hastily and not according to V.D.F. rules. In theory, had the bout been for the world flyweight championship, Stein could have taken the crown with a knockout or decision win. =Taking the German Featherweight Championship, April, 1932= On April 22, 1932, in one of his most important victories, Stein won the VDF National German Featherweight Championship in a fifth-round technical knockout against Paul Noack in Spichernsaele, Germany. He did not relinquish the German Featherweight title until March 3, 1933, in a seventh-round knockout loss to top German featherweight contender Hans Schiller. Though little is known of any extenuating circumstances concerning his loss of the title, the Nazis had come to power in January of that year, only three months prior to the championship match. By July, 1933, the Maccabee organization, which had over 40,000 Jewish athletes using their athletic clubs in Stein's future home of Poland, had relocated its world headquarters from Berlin to London.Silver, Mike (2016). Stars of the Ring, Published by Roman and Littlefield, Los Angeles, pps. 98-99. Only months after relinquishing the German Featherweight Title, Stein was forced to flee Germany for Prague, Poland, to escape Nazi persecution in 1933, where he continued to box at least through 1937. Another top Jewish German boxer, Eric Seelig a German national middle and light heavyweight champion, had had his titles stripped by the Nazis, and had been forced to flee Germany the same year for France. Stein fought a bout in Carracas, Venezuela, on April 22, 1933, which he lost in a fifth-round knockout. One of Stein's first fights in Poland was against Tomas Berlina at Lucerna Hall on December 12, 1933, in Prague, Poland where he fought a three-round exhibition no-decision bout. He fought at Prague's Lucerna Hall through 1934, but the frequency of his bouts, the quality of his competition, and his percentage of wins diminished after he was forced to flee Germany, possibly because of advancing age, his need to find other work, or because he had less time or resources to train. Stein appeared as himself in the 1930 film Liebe im Ring (Love in the Ring), along with the boxers Jose Santa, and handsome German heavyweight phenomenon Max Schmeling, in the lead role as a boxer. Up until his death, he trained Russian amateur boxers, likely in the area of Moscow, where he had fled by the 1940s. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it is believed to have been prior to 1948.Der Spiegel ‚Ññ 21, May 21, 1952 Siege ohne Retusche in German and jungle world, 2012 Further reading * Martina Lang: \\"Zur√ºck im Ring!\\" J√ºdische Boxer im √ñsterreich und im Deutschland der Zwischenkriegszeit, in transversal.

It belongs to the jurisdiction of Eparchy of Mukachevo and Uzhhorod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). It is a female monastery, headed by hegumenia Epistimiya Sherban. History The exact date of its founding is unknown, though some believe it was founded in the late 11th century.Magocsi, Paul Robert and Ivan Pop. Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture. University of Toronto Press, 2002. pg 333-34 In the 14th century the monastery was under the patronage of Fedir Koriiatovych.Mukachiv Saint Nicholas's Monastery. Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 3 (1993). In 1491 it was made the seat of the Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo that had jurisdiction was the whole of Transcarpathia. In 1537, the monastery was burned during war though it was rebuilt soon after with permission of Emperor Ferdinand I. After the Union of Uzhhorod in 1646, the monastery joined the Greek Catholic Basilian monastic order. From then on the archimandrite was also the superior general of the order in Transcarpathia. The bishop's residence was transferred to Mukachiv in 1751, but the monastery remained the administrative center for the Basilians. During the years 1798‚Äì1804 the Saint Nicholas Church was constructed in a Classicist style. In 1862 much of it was again destroyed by fire, but rebuilt within three years. The monastery ran a school and library which became important to the cultural and religious life of the region. It also maintained contacts with the Orthodox of the Balkans and eastern Europe. Hegumen Anatol Kralytsky was a prominent Transcarpathian writer in the 19th century. In the 1920s, the monastery was restructured and reforms were introduced by Basilian monks from Galicia. In 1946 the Soviet regime liquidated the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and the monastery was forced to become Eastern Orthodox. All of the monks refused to convert and were exiled. The collection of over 6,000 rare books and manuscripts and its archives were transferred to local museums and archives. The monastery was transformed into a convent for Orthodox nuns from other monasteries that were closed by the Soviets.Nathaniel Davis.

It is an economically important sector, and along with agriculture and forestry contributed $24,744 million to Australia's GDP in year 2007‚Äì2008, out of a total GDP of $1,084,146 million. Commercial fisheries in Commonwealth waters are managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, while commercial and recreational fishing in state waters is managed by various state-level agencies. The sustainable seafood movement is growing in Australia as consumers become more aware of conservation issues and the importance of maintaining fish stocks. Organisations such as the Marine Stewardship Council and Australian Marine Conservation Society's GoodFish: Australia's Sustainable Seafood Guide have released guides helping consumers make sustainable seafood choices. Overview =Production by State= The largest share, 22%, of the whole gross value generated by seafood production in the Commonwealth area ‚Äì not only in Australia ‚Äì is attributable to Tasmania, while South and Western Australia follow with 21% and 20% each. Australia has special rights over the exploitation of an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline, exceeding that of its land mass. Within the EEZ seazone free use of marine resources is allowed (Geoscience Australia. 2005. Maritime Boundary Definitions). Australia's fishing zone is the third largest in the world, covering 11 million square kilometres, yet Australia is only the 52nd largest producer in terms of volume. =Composition= Fisheries production consists mainly of seafood goods which are marketed for human consumption, but also of non-edible fisheries products, such as pearls and fish meal. Australian seafood product, like most of other countries', includes both wild catch fisheries and aquaculture production. The national product, finally, encompasses also the portion addressed to export, but it does not include the amount of fishery imported by Australia from abroad. =Exports= Monthly export value (A$ millions) of seafood and preparations thereof since 1988 In the year 2007‚Äì2008, Australia exported fisheries products for a value of $1.3 billion, approximately 80% of which was derived from edible fishery export, such as shellfish and fish; the remainder was non-edible products, being predominantly pearls. Despite the still considerable share of the domestic product resulting from export, the purchases of Australian seafood from foreign countries has fallen by 10%, if compared to the rates of the previous year. Such a fall is estimated to be due to a general fall in the whole volume of edible fisheries production. So, since most of exports concern fish and shellfish, a decrease in the production of these goods (coming from both wild catch and aquaculture) affects the amount which can be exported. =Imports= Monthly import value (A$ millions) of seafood and preparations thereof since 1988 Fisheries products imported by Australia within the year 2007‚Äì2008 accounted for a value of $1.4 billion; exactly like Countries towards whom Australia aims its own exports, even Australian imports derive mainly (approximately 80%) from edible fishery products; the remainder is due again to pearls and fishmeal, i.e. non-edible goods. During previous year, imports in the fishery sector declined by 5%, mainly because of a fall in the demand of imported crustaceans, molluscs ( ‚Äì 14%) and non-edibles (- 6%); notwithstanding, the share of expense assigned to imports has recently come to exceed the amount of income coming from exportations: $1.4 billion > $1.3 billion. In fact, in 2007‚Äì2008 Australia became a net importer of fisheries products, both in terms of volume and in terms of value, although the composition of its exports differs from the imports‚Äô, being Australian fisheries exports dominated by high value species, while its imports consist of lower value products such as frozen or canned fish. Seafood Trade Flow =Most important species produced in Australian oceans= Amongst all species sold on the Australian fish market 2007‚Äì2008, Australian sardines took the biggest share in terms of volume with 33,600 tonnes landed and traded. Salmonoids, including salmon and trout, were the second most dominant portion of the market, at 25,500 tonnes, followed by prawns at 22,400 tonnes, tuna at 14,700 tonnes and rock lobster at 13,800 tonnes.ABARE Fisheries Statistics 2008 In the Australian fishery market the rock lobster brought the largest revenue; exchanged for a value of $407 million. Salmon and trout kept the second position with $299 million, with prawns third at $268 million and tuna fourth at $210 million. Finally, abalone is the fifth commercially most important species for the Australian fish market, generating $189 million. =Exports and imports of the most commercially important species= In 2007‚Äì2008 the export of rock lobster generated a $401 million income, followed by abalone at $217 million and prawns at $69 million. Most exports are sent to Asia, with a minor amount going to the United States.http://www.abareconomics.com/publications_html/fisheries/fisheries_08/08_fishstats.pdf ABARE Fisheries Statistics 2008 Regarding Australian fish imports: canned fish is estimated to be the most imported at $257 million, frozen fish fillets at $228 million, prawns (fresh, chilled and frozen) at $167 million and canned crustaceans and molluscs at $128 million. According to the Seafood Importer's Association of Australasia (SIAA), Hoki, Hake, Nile perch and Basa are the most relevant species of fish imported to Australia, in terms of volumeSIAA Seafood Consumption =Total seafood consumption per capita in kg= In the 1990s seafood consumption was 14.7 kg per capita in Perth and 15.1 kg in Sydney. In 2005, seafood consumption in Melbourne was 12.49 kg per capita.http://www.frdc.com.au/pub/news/142.01.php Fisheries Research and development Corporation =Seafood consumption by species in tonnes/value= In FY07/08: Tuna was 6.2% of the domestic catch and 9.6% of total revenue Salmonoids (salmon and trout) were 10.8% of total catch and 13.6% of revenue Prawns were 9.5% of total catch and 12.2% of revenue Rock lobster was 5.8% of total catch and 18.5% of revenue Abalone was 2.2% of total catch and 8.6% of revenue Oysters were 4% of catch and 5.2% of revenue Scallops were 4.3% of total catch and 1.4% of revenue *Catch includes aquaculture seafood =Recent developments and trends of seafood consumption= By 2006, out of home seafood consumption had grown substantially, with a shift from 'whole' to 'convenience' fish bought for home use. Consumers preferred seafood that is easily prepared including canned and pre-prepared varieties.http://www.frdc.com.au/pub/news/142.01.php Fisheries Research and Development Corporation =Cultural seafood consumption patterns and peak times of seafood consumption= People of Asian descent tend to have unique preferences for different fish varieties, with demand for imported species such as milkfish, tilapia, snakehead and pomfret. Issues in fisheries management =Emerging issues= McPhee in Fisheries Management in Australia identifies a number of emerging issues that are not yet recognised in mainstream fisheries management but which are likely to be of increasing importance. Demographics, population growth and \\"sea change\\" Population growth and ageing population as likely to significantly increase domestic demand for seafood and the increased population in fishing ports and along the coastal fringe as likely to cause stresses on fisheries. Increased development is also likely to lead to environmental degradation of coastal fisheries. Marine and estuarine stocking There are ongoing calls from parts of the recreational fishing sector for increased marine and estuarine stocking in view of increasing recreational fishing pressures. Freshwater stocking has been carried out in some freshwater fisheries for many years Climate change Climate change is expected to have impacts on water temperatures, coral reefs and rainfall patterns which will in turn impact on local ecologies and habitat, breeding cycles and range of fish populations. Opportunities may be created as fish populations shift southward. Fuel use and price Fuel prices are a significant factor in profitability of fishing. Total fuel use by the fishing industry is equivalent to that of the Netherlands, the 18th largest national user of fuel. As more accessible stocks become overfished, fuel costs per ton will rise. Internet Increased availability of information to amateur recreational anglers is likely to increase their efficiency, further increasing pressure on fisheries in populated areas. Market Structure Overview In 2003, from a random sample size of 1004 Australian adults, approximately half the sample at 49% purchased seafood in supermarkets, with 26% at specialist seafood stores, 20% directly from fresh fish markets and 16% catching their own seafood. Restaurants, hotels and clubs seem to be the main source of fish for approximately 14% of the sample, as well as fish and chips shops at 13%, 4% by family or friends who fish and 2% relying on other fast food outlets. =Wholesalers= *Australian Ocean King Prawn Company *Blue Harvest - Aquaculture Sales and Marketing Agency *De Costi Seafoods *Cairns Ocean Products *Five Star Seafoods *Joto Fresh Fish *Mackay Reef Fish Supplies Pty Ltd *Mackay Reef Export Pty Ltd *Marine World Seafood *Mooloolah River Fisheries *Ocean Exports Pty Ltd *Perkins Island Oysters *Poulos Bros Pty Ltd *Roccos Seafood *Seabest International *Southern Yabby Farm *Urangan Fisheries *Wood Fisheries Pty Ltd See also * Australian Fisheries Management Authority * Aquaculture in Australia * Fisheries observer * Agriculture in Australia ‚Äì Fisheries * Conservation in Australia (see protected areas that would otherwise be fisheries) * Environmental issues in Australia (see section on Marine conservation) * Australian Marine Conservation Society References Further reading * External links * Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics * GoodFish: Australia's Sustainable Seafood Guide Category:Agriculture in Australia Category:Australian cuisine Category:Fishing industry Category:Fishing in Australia ","title":"Seafood in Australia"},{"id":"23870831","text":"Everett Virgil \\"Pid\\" Purdy (June 15, 1904 - January 16, 1951) was an American professional athlete who played in both Major League Baseball and the National Football League.

He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 and became a King's Counsel in 1938. Denning became a judge in 1944 when he was appointed to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and transferred to the King's Bench Division in 1945. He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1948 after less than five years in the High Court. He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1957 and after five years in the House of Lords returned to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls in 1962, a position he held for twenty years. In retirement he wrote several books and continued to offer opinions on the state of the common law through his writing and his position in the House of Lords. Margaret Thatcher said that Denning was ‚Äúprobably the greatest English judge of modern times‚Äù. Mark Garnett and Richard Weight argue that he was a conservative Christian who \\"remained popular with morally conservative Britons who were dismayed at the postwar rise in crime and who, like him, believed that the duties of the individual were being forgotten in the clamour for rights. He had a more punitive than redemptive view of criminal justice, as a result of which he was a vocal supporter of corporal and capital punishment.\\"Mark Garnett and Richard Weight, The A-Z Guide to Modern British History (2003) p 143. However, he changed his stance on capital punishment in later life. Denning was one of the most publicly known judges thanks to his report on the Profumo affair. He was noted for his bold judgments running counter to the law at the time. During his 38-year career as a judge he made large changes to the common law, particularly while in the Court of Appeal, and although many of his decisions were overturned by the House of Lords several of them were confirmed by Parliament, which passed statutes in line with his judgments. Although appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the individual, Denning was also controversial for his campaign against the common law principle of precedent, and for comments he made regarding the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, and also as Master of the Rolls for his conflict with the House of Lords. Early life and studies Denning was born on 23 January 1899 in Whitchurch, Hampshire, to Charles Denning, a draper, and his wife Clara Denning (n√©e Thompson). He was one of six children; his older brother Reginald Denning later became a noted staff officer with the British Army, and his younger brother Norman Denning became Director of Naval Intelligence and Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Intelligence).Heward (1990) p.8 Denning was born two months earlier than expected and almost died at birth; he was so small and weak that he was nicknamed 'Tom Thumb' and could fit in a pint pot.Heward (1990) p.6 He was named after Alfred the Great by his sister Marjorie, and was baptised on 23 April 1899 at All Hallows Church, Whitchurch. Denning, along with his older brother Gordon, began his schooling at the National School of Whitchurch, one of many set up by the National Society for the Education of the Poor. Both boys won scholarships to Andover Grammar School, where Denning excelled academically, winning four prizes for English essays on the subjects of \\"The Great Authors\\", \\"Macaulay\\", \\"Carlyle\\" and \\"Milton\\".Freeman (1993) p.23 The outbreak of the First World War saw most of the schoolmasters leave to join the British armed forces, being replaced by female teachers. At the time Denning wanted to become a mathematician, but none of the new teachers knew enough mathematics to teach him; instead, he taught himself.Heward (1990) p.10 He qualified to study at University College, Southampton, but was advised to stay at school and apply to Oxford or Cambridge in a few years. He sat the Oxbridge examination when he was sixteen and was awarded a ¬£30 a year exhibition to study mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford; the money was not enough to live on, but he accepted nevertheless. Although he had been accepted by a college he still needed to gain entry to the university as a whole, which meant passing exams including Greek ‚Äì which had not been taught at Andover Grammar School. Denning managed to teach himself enough of the subject to pass, and matriculated to Oxford in 1916.Freeman (1993) p.38 In addition to his Magdalen Scholarship he had a scholarship from Hampshire County Council worth ¬£50 a year. After arriving he made a favourable impression on Sir Herbert Warren, the President of Magdalen College, who upgraded the exhibition to a Demyship of ¬£80 a year and arranged for the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to give Denning a ¬£30 a year scholarship. Despite military training in the early morning and evening, Denning worked hard at his studies, and obtained a First in Mathematical Moderations, the first half of his mathematics degree, in June 1917.Freeman (1993) p.53 War service Denning was told he would be ineligible to serve in the Armed Forces because of a systolic heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was old enough to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.Freeman (1993) p.5 54 In March 1918 the German Army advanced closer to Amiens and Paris, and Denning's unit was sent to France to help stop the advance. Under continuous shell fire for three months, the company and the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division held their section of the line, with a unit under Denning's command building a bridge to allow infantry to advance over the River Ancre.Heward (1990) p.11 Denning went two days without sleep while building these bridges; shortly after one was completed, a German aeroplane dropped a bomb on it, forcing them to start again. The unit advanced over the River Ancre and the Canal du Nord, but Denning fell ill with influenza and was in hospital for the last few days of the war.Heward (1990) p.12 When writing of his experiences in World War I in The Family Story, Denning summed up his war service with characteristic pithiness in just four words: \\"I did my bit\\". Denning's oldest brother, Captain John Edward Newdigate Denning, was killed near Gueudecourt on 26 September 1916 whilst serving with the Lincolnshire Regiment. His brother, Sub-Lieutenant Charles Gordon Denning, who saw action in the Battle of Jutland, died of tuberculosis on 24 May 1918 whilst serving with the Royal Navy on HMS Morris. Denning would describe his dead brothers as the best of him and his siblings. Return to Oxford Magdalen College, Oxford, where Denning studied between 1916 and 1918, 1919 and 1920 and from 1921 to 1922 Denning was demobilised on 6 February 1919, and returned to Magdalen College four days later.Freeman (1993) p.52 He initially thought about turning to applied mathematics, but decided on pure mathematics. He studied hard, not participating in any of the university's numerous societies or clubs so that he could better focus on his work, and graduated in 1920 with a first in Mathematical Greats.Freeman (1993) p.65 He was offered a job teaching mathematics at Winchester College for ¬£350 a year, which he accepted. As well as mathematics, he taught geology, despite not having studied it; instead, he \\"read up on [it] the night before\\".Freeman (1993) p.86 He found the job boring,Heward (1990) p.13 and after viewing the Assize Court at Winchester Castle decided he would like to be a barrister.Freeman (1993) p.70 On the advice of Herbert Warren, he returned to Magdalen to study Jurisprudence in October 1921. Thanks to Warren, Denning was elected to the Eldon Law Scholarship, worth ¬£100 a year, to finance his studies; when the news of Denning's election was brought, Warren wrote \\"you are a marked man. Perhaps you will be a Lord of Appeal some day\\".Heward (1990) p.14 Denning took his final examinations in June 1922 and impressed the examiner, Geoffrey Cheshire, by correctly answering questions on the Law of Property Act which had been given Royal Assent only a few days before. Denning gained a high grade in all his subjects except jurisprudence, which he described as \\"too abstract a subject for my liking\\". He did not return to read for a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) but instead attempted to gain a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford; he failed to be accepted, something he put down to his poor pronunciation of Latin.Heward (1990) p.15 The Bar Denning was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 4 November 1921, choosing it because the Under Treasurer was a graduate of Magdalen College.Heward (1990) p.20 On the advice of his brother's friend Frank Merriman he applied to 4 Brick Court, Middle Temple Lane, a small set of chambers run by Henry O'Hagan. He was accepted and began work there in September 1922, before he had taken his final bar exam. He finished his final exam in May 1923 and came top in the bar examination, with the Inn awarding him a 100 guineas a year studentship of three years. He was called to the Bar on 13 June 1923, and was offered a tenancy by O'Hagan. His first few years were spent receiving small briefs from a variety of clients, including work prosecuting those who failed to pay rail tickets and fines.Heward (1990) p.21 During this time he also wrote a manual for the railway police giving guidance on incidents such as taxi drivers who refused to take a customer to a destination within the area specified by the Public Carriage Office (which they were legally obliged to do).Freeman (1993) p.92 He wrote his first article in 1924 titled \\"Quantum Meruit and the Statute of Frauds\\" on the decision in Scott v Pattison [1923] 2 KB 723; it was accepted by the Law Quarterly Review and published in January 1925. His work steadily increased in amount and quality throughout the 1920s and '30s. By the 1930s he was making most of his court appearances in the senior courts such as the High Court of Justice; in 1932 he was advised by his clerk that he should not be seen in the county courts, and that he should leave this work for lesser members of the chambers.Heward (1990) p.22 In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division.Heward (1990) p.25 In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over ¬£3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [1934] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an exemption clause was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate you want your client to win. If you are a judge you don't care who wins exactly. All you are concerned about is justice'.Heward (1990) p.26 From 1937 until 1944 he worked as Chancellor of the Diocese of Southwark, and from 1942 to 1944 was Chancellor of the Diocese of London. He applied to become a King's Counsel on 15 January 1938. The appointments were announced on 7 April; he \\"took silk\\" on 9 April and received letters of congratulation from, among others, Rayner Goddard.Heward (1990) p.29 After the start of the Second World War, Denning volunteered; he was too old for active service, and was instead appointed legal advisor to the North East Region. In 1942 he took the case of Gold v Essex County Council [1942] 2 KB 293, which changed the law to make hospitals liable for the professional negligence of their staff.Freeman (1993) p.94 In December 1943 a judge was taken ill, and Denning was asked to take his place as a Commissioner of Assize. This was regarded as a 'trial' for membership of the judiciary, and Denning was appointed Recorder of Plymouth on 17 February 1944. On 6 March 1944, while arguing a case in the House of Lords, Denning was taken aside by the Lord Chancellor and told that he wanted Denning to become a judge at the High Court of Justice in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. Denning accepted, and the announcement was made before the conclusion of the trial.Heward (1990) p.33 High Court The Royal Courts of Justice, where Denning sat between 1944 and 1956 in the High Court and Court of Appeal and again from 1962 to 1982 as Master of the Rolls Denning was officially appointed on 7 March 1944 with a salary of ¬£5,000, and received the customary knighthood on 15 March 1944. After becoming a judge Denning was also elected a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn, and became its Treasurer in 1964.Heward (1990) p.34 Denning had little experience with divorce law and disliked it; it was seen as an inferior type of law.Heward (1990) p.35 There were few good barristers specialising in divorce law; two other barristers were sworn into the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division along with Denning, and of the three only one had ever practised divorce law.Freeman (1993) p.147 His work as a divorce judge was relatively sound; his decisions were overturned only once, in Churchman v Churchman [1945] 2 All ER 190.Freeman (1993) p.150 With the appointment of Lord Jowitt as Lord Chancellor in 1945 Denning was transferred to the King's Bench Division, where Jowitt thought his talents would be better put to use (with Hildreth Glyn-Jones QC, later a High Court judge, greeting him with the words 'welcome home').Heward (1990) p.39 In 1946 he travelled the Western Circuit but was recalled by the Lord Chancellor to chair a committee looking at the reform of procedure in divorce cases. He continued working as a judge while chairing the daily committee. The committee was appointed on 26 June 1946 and published its first report in July, which reduced the time between decree nisi and decree absolute from 6 months to 6 weeks.Heward (1990) p.40 The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending the establishment of a Marriage Welfare Service. The reports were well received by the public and led to Denning being invited in 1949 to become President of the National Marriage Guidance Council.Freeman (1993) p.176 His appointment to the King's Bench Division allowed him to hear pension appeals, and he attempted to reform the principles applied by the government minister and the Pensions Tribunals. In Starr v Ministry of Pensions [1946] 1 KB 345 he ruled that it was up to the tribunals to prove that an injury was not due to war service, reversing the previous state of affairs where a claimant would have to prove their injuries were due to war service before they would be granted a pension.Heward (1990) p.44 In James v Minister of Pensions [1947] KB 867 he also allowed for judges to approve time extensions for the claimant to gather more evidence when such extensions had been rejected by the Tribunal. These two cases made a large difference to applicants, and he received praise from both the British Legion and the public.Heward (1990) p.45 The government refused to do anything about those servicemen who had been rejected by the courts prior to Denning's judgment, which provoked public outcry under the slogan 'Fit for Service, Fit for Pension'.Freeman (1993) p.170 The British Legion chose 73 cases and asked Denning to let the Legion present them while the courts were not sitting; Denning heard all 73 cases on 11 July 1946.Freeman (1993) p.171 In 1947 he decided in Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130 (known as the 'High Trees' case), which was a milestone in English contract law.McKendrick (2007) p.118 It resurrected the principle of promissory estoppel established in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1876‚Äì77) LR 2 App Cas 439 and has been both praised and criticised by lawyers and legal theorists.Freeman (1993) p.181 As a High Court judge Denning sentenced people to death, which he said at the time \\"didn't worry [him] in the least\\". Denning maintained that for murder, death was the most appropriate penalty, and that in cases where mistakes had been made there was always an appeals system.Freeman (1993) p.231 In the 1950s there was growing opposition to the use of the death penalty, and a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate abolishing it. Denning told the Commission in 1953 that \\"the punishment inflicted for grave crimes should adequately reflect the revulsion felt by the great majority of citizens for them\\". He later changed his mind about capital punishment, regarding it as unethical.Mortimer (1984) p.11 In 1984 he wrote \\"Is it right for us, as a society, to do a thing ‚Äì hang a man ‚Äì which none of us individually would be prepared to do or even witness? The answer is 'no, not in a civilised society'\\".Freeman (1993) p.232 Court of Appeal After less than five years as a judge, Denning was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. Bendall v McWhirter [1952] 2 QB 466 ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there.Heward (1990) p.50 The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: > Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up > homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have > worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same > trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy > Head and don't come back.Heward (1990) p.52 This was effectively nullified with the case National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [1965] AC 1175 in 1965, which ruled that the deserted wife had no licence to stay. The decision was very unpopular and led to the passing of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967. Much of his work in favour of the deserted wife was based around his interpretation of the Married Women's Property Act 1882, which the House of Lords unanimously overruled in Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] AC 777 in 1970.Heward (1990) p.54 Further notable decisions by Denning in this area were Heseltine v Heseltine [1971] 1 WLR 342 in 1971 and Wachtel v Wachtel [1973] Fam 72 in 1973,Freeman (1993) p.365 which created basic rules for dividing family assets in a divorce case, something which had not previously been established in the law.Freeman (1993) p.366 In 1951 he gave a noted dissenting judgment in the case Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co regarded as a 'brilliant advancement to the law of negligent misstatements'Freeman (1993) p.208 and which was later approved of by the House of Lords in Hedley Byrne v Heller & Partners Ltd [1963] 2 All ER 575. In Combe v Combe in 1952 he elaborated on his resurrected doctrine of promissory estoppel, saying that it could be a 'shield' not a 'sword'; it could be used to defend a claim, but not to create a cause of action where none existed.McKendrick (2007) p.113McKendrick (2007) p.114 In 1954 his decision in Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 AER 131 altered the grounds on which hospital staff could be found negligent, a legal precedent he himself had set in Gold v Essex County Council in 1942. In 1955 his leading judgment in Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation [1955] 2 QB 327 implemented a way to judge the moment of acceptance in an instantaneous or near-instantaneous method of communication; like the 'High Trees' case it is still valid.McKendrick (2007) p.43 House of Lords After the resignation of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered a job as a Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court.Heward (1990) p.86 During his time in the House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. Denning did not enjoy his time in the House of Lords and clashed frequently with Gavin, Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge.Heward (1990) p.89 Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex. Master of the Rolls In 1962 Lord Evershed resigned as Master of the Rolls, and Denning was appointed to replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of ¬£9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords.Heward (1990) p.110 Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so it was suggested that to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law. As Master of the Rolls he selected cases he felt to be particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating ways to reduce the archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving.Freeman (1993) p.306 The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'.Freeman (1993) p.308 The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.Freeman (1993) p.309 =Contract law= Denning gave the leading judgment in D & C Builders Ltd v Rees [1965] 2 QB 617 in 1965. D & C Builders Ltd (the respondent) had been hired by Rees (the appellant) to do some construction work at his shop, where he sold building materials. The respondent finished the work and repeatedly phoned the appellant to request the money they were owed. After three phone calls spread out over several months the appellant's wife spoke to the respondents; she said there were several problems with the work that they had done, and she would only pay ¬£300 of the ¬£482 owed. The respondents replied that ¬£300 would barely cover the costs of the materials, but that they would accept it anyway. If the respondents had not received the money they would have gone bankrupt, something the appellant's wife was well aware of. In his judgment, Denning modified English case law on part payment and accord and satisfaction, saying that the rules on part payment can be set aside in situations where one of the parties is under duress.McKendrick (2007) p.380 The fact that D & C Builders were effectively forced into accepting the lesser amount meant that the payment was not valid. In Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd [1971] 2 QB 163 in 1971 the Court of Appeal under Denning ruled that when dealing with offer and acceptance between a person and an automated machine the offer was made by the machine.McKendrick (2007) p.42 In Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd [1979] 1 WLR 401 in 1979 Denning reformed case law in relation to the so- called 'Battle of the Forms'. =Tort law= Denning gave the leading judgment in Letang v Cooper [1964] 2 All ER 929 in 1964. Mrs Letang, on holiday in Cornwall, decided to lie down and rest in grass outside a hotel. Cooper drove into the hotel car park and, not seeing Letang, ran over her legs. More than three years after the events, Letang brought a tort case against Cooper, claiming damages for her injuries. The standard tort for personal injuries is that of negligence, which has a three-year statute of limitations, and Letang instead claimed damages under the tort of trespass to the person. In his judgment, Denning stated that the tort of trespass could only be used if the injury was inflicted intentionally; if it was unintentionally, only negligence could be used.Hodge (2004) p.2 In Spartan Steel and Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co. Ltd [1973] 1 QB 27 in 1973 he delivered a leading judgment on the subject of the recovery of pure economic loss in negligence. Spartan Steel were a company that manufactured stainless steel in Birmingham, and their factory was powered by electricity. Less than a mile away from the factory Martin & Co were doing maintenance work on a road when they accidentally unearthed and damaged the power cable providing the factory with electricity. Due to the power being off the factory lost a large amount of money; ¬£368 on damaged goods, ¬£400 on the profits they would have made from those goods and ¬£1,767 for the steel they could not make due to the power outage. The question was what Spartan Steel could claim money for. Martin & Co agreed they were negligent, and offered to pay for the damaged goods and the profit that Spartan Steel would have made on those goods, but refused to pay damages for the steel Spartan Steel could not make due to the power outage. In his judgment Denning agreed that they would only have to pay for losses associated with the damaged goods, not the money lost on the steel that could not be made due to the power outage because it counted as pure economic loss. For public policy reasons Denning would not allow the recovery of pure economic loss, stating in his judgment that: #Statutory utility providers are never liable for damages caused by their negligence. #A blackout is a common hazard and a risk which everyone can be expected to tolerate from time to time. #If claims for pure economic loss in such cases were allowed, it might lead to countless claims, some of which may be spurious. #It would be unfair to place the entire weight of many comparatively small losses upon the shoulders of one person in such cases. #The law does not leave the claimant without remedy by allowing him to recover the economic losses that are directly consequential upon physical damage. The Court of Appeal's decision in Spartan Steel has been criticised, firstly for being based on public policy rather than any legal principle,Oughton (1987) p.374 and secondly because the main public policy ground for their decision (that allowing claims of pure economic loss would lead to countless claims) has never been backed up by evidence. The House of Lords eventually ruled in Junior Books v Veitchi [1982] 3 All ER 201 that pure economic loss was recoverable. =The Profumo affair= Denning became best known as a result of his report into the Profumo affair. John Profumo was the Secretary of State for War with the British government. At a party in 1961 Profumo was introduced to Christine Keeler, a showgirl, and began having an affair with her. At the same time she was in a relationship with Yevgeni Ivanov, a naval attach√© at the embassy of the Soviet Union. On 26 January 1963 Keeler was contacted by police on an unrelated matter and voluntarily gave them information about her relationship with Profumo.Heward (1990) p.125 The police did not initially investigate; no crime had been committed, and the morals of ministers were not their concern. Although the relationship lasted only a few weeks it became public knowledge in 1962. Keeler attempted to publish her memoirs in the Sunday Pictorial in January 1963 but Profumo, still insisting that he had done nothing wrong, forced them to back down with threats of legal action should the story be published.Heward (1990) p.126 Profumo made a statement in the House of Commons on 22 March, saying that \\"there was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler\\". On 4 June 1963 he contacted the Chief Whip and the Prime Minister's private secretary and informed them that he had indeed been having an affair with Keeler; therefore, he sent a letter of resignation to the Prime Minister, which was accepted.Heward (1990) p.129 On 21 June 1963 Harold Macmillan, the Prime Minister at the time, asked Denning to lead an enquiry into the \\"circumstances leading to the resignation of the former Secretary of State for War, Mr J. D. Profumo\\".Heward (1990) p.130 He started work on 24 June and began speaking to witnesses a day later. This period of the inquiry took 49 days and involved his speaking to 160 people. He concluded that the primary responsibility for the scandal was with Profumo, for associating with Keeler and for lying to his colleagues, with the greatest error being his false statement in the House of Commons. He also said that the situation had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.Heward (1990) p.131 Denning's final report was 70,000 words long and was completed in the summer of 1963. He signed it on 16 September and it was published ten days later. It was a best-seller; 105,000 copies were sold, 4,000 in the first hour, with people queuing outside Her Majesty's Stationery Office to buy copies. The full report was published in The Daily Telegraph as a supplement and was described as \\"the raciest and most readable Blue Book ever published\\". The report was criticised as a \\"whitewash\\", a claim Denning rejected; he said that \\"while the public interest demands that the facts should be ascertained as completely as possible there is a higher interest to be considered, namely the interest of justice to the individual which overrides all others\\".Heward (1990) p.132 =National security= In 1977, Denning upheld the deportation of Mark Hosenball, a journalist who had worked on a story which referred to the existence of GCHQ, which was considered to be a state secret. In the ruling, he argued that the government's decisions in these cases were beyond legal review, writing: > \\"There is a conflict here between the interests of national security on the > one hand and the freedom of the individual on the other. The balance between > these two is not for a court of law. It is for the Home Secretary. He is the > person entrusted by Parliament with the task. In some parts of the world > national security has on occasions been used as an excuse for all sorts of > infringements of individual liberty. But not in England.\\"\\"R v Secretary of > State for the Home Department, ex parte Hosenball\\", ruling on March 29, > 1977. =Illness and controversy= In 1979 he began to experience hip and leg problems; one of his legs had shortened an inch and a half and he had to learn to walk again.Freeman (1993) p.384 Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. In the UPW's anti-apartheid boycott of postal services to and from South Africa, The Freedom Association sought an injunction to prevent the boycott. Denning granted a temporary injunction, and years later wrote of \\"bad workers\\" (who joined the boycott) and \\"good workers\\" (who worked normally). In 1980, during an appeal by the Birmingham Six (who were later acquitted), Denning judged that the men should be stopped from challenging legal decisions. He listed several reasons for not allowing their appeal: > Just consider the course of events if their action were to proceed to trial > ... If the six men failed it would mean that much time and money and worry > would have been expended by many people to no good purpose. If they won, it > would mean that the police were guilty of perjury; that they were guilty of > violence and threats; that the confessions were involuntary and improperly > admitted in evidence; and that the convictions were erroneous. ... That was > such an appalling vista that every sensible person would say, \\"It cannot be > right that these actions should go any further.\\"Elliott (2007) p.157 In 1982 he published What Next in the Law; in it, he seemed to suggest some members of the black community were unsuitable to serve on juries, and that immigrant groups may have had different moral standards to native Englishmen.Freeman (1993) p.392 His remarks followed a trial over the St Pauls riot in Bristol; two jurors on the case threatened to sue him and the Society of Black Lawyers wrote to the Lord Chancellor to request that Denning \\"politely and firmly\\" be made to retire.Freeman (1993) p.393 Denning apologised for his remarks on 21 May and handed a letter to the Lord Chancellor detailing his resignation, effective as of 29 September. On 5 July George Thomas held a dinner in Denning's honour at the Speaker's House. Attending were Margaret Thatcher, Robert Runcie, Quintin Lord Hailsham, Geoffrey Howe, Geoffrey Lord Lane, Willie Whitelaw, Michael Havers and Christopher Leaver.Denning (1983) p.15 On 30 July 1982, his last day in court, Denning prepared four judgments and, dressed in his official robes and in the company of the Lord Chief Justice, delivered his farewell speech to over 300 lawyers crowded into the court. He delivered his last judgment on 29 September in George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd [1983] 2 AC 803 and, characteristically, dissented.Freeman (1993) p.400 Retirement and death In retirement Denning moved to Whitchurch and continued the work he had done outside court hours, lecturing and presenting awards. He also on occasion dispensed legal advice; in February 1983 he advised Patrick Evershed on the statutory duties of water suppliers.Freeman (1993) p.407 Further hip troubles were resolved with a full replacement in March 1983, although a fall later that year forced him to stay at home for six weeks. With free time on his hands Denning spoke in the House of Lords on matters that interested him, supporting an amendment to the Abortion Act 1967 and bills designed to allow the administration of companies in financial difficulties. In 1983 he published the final volume of his autobiography The Closing Chapter and a year later published Landmarks in the Law. His final book titled Leaves from my Library was published in 1986; it was a collection of his favourite pieces of prose, and was subtitled \\"An English Anthology\\".Freeman (1993) p.410 He appeared in an episode of the children's television programme Jim'll Fix It, helping to grant a thirteen-year-old girl's wish to be a barrister for a day. By 1989 his health was failing; he was suffering from dizzy spells, and after falling from a train at Waterloo station he was advised he should not visit London again unless he was driven.Freeman (1993) p.411 In the summer of 1990 he agreed to a taped interview with A.N. Wilson, to be published in The Spectator. They discussed the Guildford Four; Denning remarked that if the Guildford Four had been hanged \\"They'd probably have hanged the right men. Just not proved against them, that's all\\".Freeman (1993) p.412 His remarks were controversial and came at a time when the issue of miscarriage of justice was a sensitive topic.Freeman (1993) p.413 He had expressed a similar controversial opinion regarding the Birmingham Six in 1988, saying: \\"Hanging ought to be retained for murder most foul. We shouldn't have all these campaigns to get the Birmingham Six released if they'd been hanged. They'd have been forgotten, and the whole community would be satisfied... It is better that some innocent men remain in jail than that the integrity of the English judicial system be impugned.\\"Whitton (1988) p.117de Burgh (2000) p.117 On 25 November 1997 he was appointed to the Order of Merit; by this point he was too weak to travel to London to receive it, so instead a representative of the Queen travelled to Whitchurch to present it to him. He celebrated his 100th birthday in Whitchurch on 23 January 1999, receiving telegrams from both the Queen and Queen Mother. A male choir sang \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" and the local church had a new bell named \\"Great Tom\\" cast in his honour specifically for the occasion. By this point his health had deteriorated even further; he was legally blind and required a hearing aid. On 5 March 1999 he fell ill and was rushed to Royal Hampshire County Hospital, where he died of an internal haemorrhage. He was the last veteran of World War I to sit in the House of Lords. Denning was buried in his home town of Whitchurch, in the local churchyard. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 17 June 1999; among the tributes received, one was from the Lord Chief Justice Lord Bingham, who described Denning as 'the best-known and best loved judge in our history'. Other work As well as his work as a barrister and judge, Denning was involved in supporting student law societies and other groups; at various times he was Vice-President of Queen's University Belfast Law Society and a patron of the Legal Research Foundation, the United Law Clerks' Society and the Commonwealth Legal Education Association. He also spent time as the Vice- President of the Society of Genealogists, Honorary President of the Council for the Protection of Rural England and Honorary President of the Glasgow University Dialectic Society.Heward (1990) p.122 From 1950 he acted as an administrator and fund-raiser for Cumberland Lodge. After being made aware of the Le Court charity for invalid ex-servicemen by Geoffrey Cheshire, Denning became the chairman of the organisation in 1952.Freeman (1993) p.217 In 1953 he was elected President of Birkbeck College, University of London and on 18 March presented the 1952 Haldane Memorial Lecture on the subject of the rule of law and the welfare state.Freeman (1993) p.227 In 1964 he was made President of the English Association in recognition of his contributions to English prose.Freeman (1993) p.304 He became Chairman of the Historical Manuscripts Commission in 1962, resigning in December 1982. In 1949 he gave the inaugural Hamlyn Lectures at the Senate House, University of London under the title Freedom under the Law.Freeman (1993) p.200 The success of these lectures led to his being invited to speak at many more events; in early 1950 he spoke at University College, Dublin and in June spoke at the Holdsworth Club meeting at Birmingham University.Freeman (1993) p.212 In February 1953 he gave a speech on 'the need for a new equity' to the Bentham Club at University College London, and in May gave the thirty-third Earl Grey Memorial Lecture at King's College, University of Durham (now, part of Newcastle University), on the influence of religion on law. Towards the end of his judicial career he gave the 1980 Richard Dimbleby Lecture on the subject of \\"Misuse of Power\\".Freeman (1993) p.385 In addition to being a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1944 he was made an Honorary Bencher of Middle Temple in 1972, Gray's Inn in 1979 and Inner Temple in 1982, making him the only person to be elected a Bencher or Honorary Bencher of all four Inns of Court. In 1963 he was made a Doctor of Civil Law by the University of Oxford.Freeman (1993) p.313 In 1977 he was awarded with an honorary doctorate in the Netherlands, by Tilburg Law School, part of Tilburg University. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire on 2 June 1978. Foreign travels Throughout his career Denning travelled to a variety of foreign countries to lecture and learn more about other legal systems. In 1954 he was sponsored by the Nuffield Foundation to travel to South Africa and visit the universities there in the court vacation. He visited all six universities, accompanied by his son Robert and wife Joan, lecturing on the role of the judiciary and the press in safeguarding freedom.Freeman (1993) p.228 In 1955 he travelled to the United States at the behest of the American Bar Association and was elected an honorary member, followed by a trip to Canada a year later as a guest of the Canadian Bar Association, where he was awarded an honorary law doctorate by the University of Ottawa and made a life member of the Canadian Bar Association.Heward (1990) p.173 In 1958 he visited Israel and from there travelled to Poland, where he was surprised by both the number of female judges and how badly they were paid.Freeman (1993) p.252 In 1961 he travelled again to Israel to give the Lionel Cohen Lecture at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Freeman (1993) p.262 In January 1964 he and his wife Joan travelled to India and Pakistan, visiting major cities such as Madras (now Chennai) and Jaipur, meeting eminent jurists and speaking with Jawaharlal Nehru.Freeman (1993) p.299 He again visited Canada and the United States in the long vacation of 1964 and addressed a full conference hall in New York. On 14 August 1965 he and his wife flew to South America for a month-long tour of the continent sponsored by the British Council. The couple visited Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Peru before flying north to visit Mexico City.Freeman (1993) p.315 On 6 January 1966 they flew to Malta, where Denning spoke at various legal conferences and lectures. In the same year they flew to San Francisco, Fiji and finally to New Zealand to take part in the law conference at Dunedin, New Zealand. His lecture at the conference so impressed an Australian visitor that he was invited in 1967 to speak at the Australian Law Society annual conference. On the way home the couple made a stop at Delhi, where they gave a dinner for members of the Indian Bar who had welcomed them during their visit in 1964. In 1968 they again visited Canada, and Denning was given an honorary degree by McGill University.Freeman (1993) p.323 In 1969 he again travelled to India, this time on an official visit with Elwyn Jones and Sir John Widgery.Freeman (1993) p.327 In August 1969 he travelled to Fiji to arbitrate in a dispute between a majority of Fijian sugarcane growers and the Australian owners of the refining mills, which he was permitted to do on the condition he did not take a fee. Denning refused to have any contact with the government as a way to emphasise his neutrality in the situation. The agreements between growers and millers had been based on a contract written in 1961 due to end in March 1970. The growers were convinced that they were getting a bad deal; in response to their demand for better terms the mill-owners threatened to leave Fiji. Despite criticism from both sides at the beginning of the arbitration process Denning came up with a solution which redressed matters in favour of growers, creating a new formula for working out prices and requiring that the mill owners have an accountant inspect their accounts and report back to the growers.Freeman (1993) p.328 Denning's decision impressed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who invited him to report on the banana growing industry in Jamaica in the vacation of 1971.Freeman (1993) p.329 His foreign travels to lecture on English law led to him being described as the \\"Ambassador-at-Large for the common law\\". Judicial style Denning was noted for his excellent memory, repeating notes almost verbatim in his exams at Oxford and on one occasion identifying the exact book, page and paragraph of text in a judgment that covered a particular situation.Heward (1990) p.27 As a judge he attempted to make his decisions and the law publicly understandable, believing that the public would not want to follow the law unless they believed and understood that it was just. In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as \\"plaintiff\\" and \\"defendant\\" and used short sentences and a \\"storytelling\\" style of speech shown in the case Beswick v BeswickBeswick v Beswick [1966] Ch 538 where his judgment started: > Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He had no > business premises. All he had was a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to > take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal > and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John > Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick > and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in > good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the > old man died. So they went to a solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an > agreement for them.Heward (1990) p.36 In court Denning preferred to let counsel talk on for as long as they wanted to so that he could get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.Heward (1990) p.80 Denning was also known for his long working schedule; when he served as Master of the Rolls he sat for five full days a week, and required reserved judgments (about one case in ten) to be written during the weekend. He expected the other justices to keep to the same schedule as him, and was repeatedly warned about overwork. Fellow judge Richard Henn Collins wrote him a poem: > My brother pray be warned by me > And always rise in time for tea > And when you feel you must sit late > Remember my untoward fateCollins 'untoward fate' was his early retirement > due to heart difficulties. > Don't go on sitting until seven > But sit next morning at elevenHeward (1990) p.116 Unlike most of the judiciary Denning firmly believed that the press should have access to the courts and freedom to criticise magistrates and judges. He believed all legal proceedings should be held in public, quoting Jeremy Bentham when he said that \\"in the darkness of secrecy all sorts of things can go wrong. If things are really done in public you can see that the judge does behave himself, the newspapers can comment on it if he misbehaves ‚Äî it keeps everyone in order\\".Heward (1990) p.117 For many years Denning was the president of the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship, and he once wrote that \\"Without religion there is no morality, and without morality there is no law.\\" His Christian beliefs sometimes affected his judgments, particularly on the subject of the sanctity of marriage. In Re L (infants) he reversed a decision to give the children of a couple to the wife in a divorce case, believing that should the wife get custody of the children there would be no chance of saving the marriage.Freeman (1993) p.347 Legacy Denning has been described as the most influential judge of the 20th century, in part because of his changes to the common law and also due to his personalisation of the legal profession. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher referred to Denning as \\"probably the greatest English judge of modern times\\" and former Prime Minister Tony Blair lauded him as \\"one of the great men of his age\\". The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, said \\"Lord Denning was the best-known and best-loved judge of this or perhaps any generation\\" and \\"a legend in his own lifetime\\". With his judgments on war pensions and his role in the enquiry into the Profumo affair, Denning became possibly the best-known judge ever to belong to the English judiciary, with the public treating Denning and the Court of Appeal as synonymous.Freeman (1993) p.223 He was equally well-loved and controversial, appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the common man and disliked by elements of the bar and judiciary for 'uncertainty in the law' created by his broad judgments. Denning made sweeping changes to the Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception is that most of his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.McKendrick (2007) p.223 Several law-related things have been named after Denning due to his reputation as a judge, in particular the Lord Denning Scholarship of Lincoln's Inn and the Denning Law Journal of the University of Buckingham. The law library of Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied, is known as the Denning Law Library. Personal life Denning's shield of arms Denning met his future wife Mary Harvey on 25 October 1914 aged fifteen at his confirmation; she was the daughter of the Vicar of Whitchurch. Denning attempted to court her for many years, but for a long time his love was unrequited, with Mary wanting them to be only friends.Freeman (1993) p.67 After a dance at Beaulieu on 18 January 1930 she told him of her love for him, and he returned to Hampshire with her to pick out an engagement ring.Freeman (1993) p.99 Barely six months away from the set date for their wedding Mary was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but she recovered and the couple were married on 28 December 1932, with the wedding officiated by Cecil Henry Boutflower, Bishop of Southampton.Heward (1990) p.17 The couple moved to London in 1933 but the city at the time was sooty and foggy. This affected Mary's health, and after treatment at Guy's Hospital she was transferred to Brompton Hospital, where she had a lung removed. After recovering, she moved to Southampton to stay with her parents for two years, with Denning visiting every weekend. By 1935 she had fully recovered, and the couple bought a house in Tylers Green, Cuckfield, called Fair Close. Their son, Robert, was born on 3 August 1938; he later became a Dean at Magdalen College, Oxford, teaching inorganic chemistry. Mary developed gallstones in 1941, and after an initial recovery had a haemorrhage on 21 November, dying the next morning.Heward (1990) p.31 In 1945 Denning met Joan Stuart, a widow with three children: Pauline, Hazel and John. They married on 27 December 1945, and were by all accounts happy together. On 19 October 1992 she suffered a massive heart attack; although she survived the initial attack she died a few days later on 23 October.Freeman (1993) p.415 See also *List of cases involving Lord Denning References Bibliography      Further reading  * External links *1963 Denning Report - Parliament & the 1960s - UK Parliament Living Heritage * Category:1899 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:English Queen's Counsel Category:Burials in Hampshire Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Hampshire Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Sussex Category:Disease-related deaths in England Category:English Anglicans Category:English centenarians Category:English judges Category:English legal writers Category:Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:Law lords Category:Masters of the Rolls Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:Members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Members of the Order of Merit Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People associated with Birkbeck, University of London Category:People from Whitchurch, Hampshire Category:Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division judges Category:Queen's Bench Division judges Category:Queen's Counsel 1901‚Äì2000 Category:Royal Engineers officers Category:Lords Justices of Appeal ","title":"Tom Denning, Baron Denning"},{"id":"23870873","text":"Nidra Poller is an American writer and translator who has lived in Paris since 1972.

He recorded almost one hundred 78-RPM records for the Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States and The Gramophone Company (HMV) in England. Williams gave more than 1,000 performances and recitals during his 25-year professional career across the United States and in England and Wales. Williams was praised most highly by critics for his interpretations of Handel. Biography Evan Williams was born on 7 September 1867 in Mineral Ridge, Ohio, the son of David Williams and Gwendolyn Harris. His parents were recent poor Welsh immigrants from Pembrokeshire, Wales. They were married in 1867 in Trumbull County, Ohio. When Evan was 13 years old, his Mother died in childbirth, and he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Thomas and Sarah Davis in Thomastown, a Welsh immigrant mining community near Akron, Ohio. While he was working in his youth in coal mines in the Akron area, the quality of his voice was discovered when he was singing in a local church choir. He began voice lessons with Madame Louise Von Feilitsch in Cleveland. He began rising to prominence as a singer when he participated in a Welsh choir in Galion, Ohio, in 1891. By 1894 he was performing in London and began dividing his career between appearances in the United Kingdom and in the United States. At this time in his career he was hired to be the soloist at the Marble Collegiate Church in New York City. He was reputed to be the highest-paid church singer in the world at the time. In 1896 he gave his first performance at the well known Worcester Music Festival in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1907 he returned to the United States for most of the rest of his performing career, where he sang as a tenor soloist for various choral societies and in concerts all over the country. His recording career with Victor Red Seal records was very successful. Williams was a great draw at many music societies and events, among them the Orpheus Club of Springfield, Massachusetts, from the 1890s until his death in 1918.Orpheus Club 1873 1923 Fiftieth Anniversary. He died on 24 May 1918 in Akron, Ohio from blood poisoning, the result of a boil.

Recordings Williams voice recorded prodigiously for the Victor Talking Machine Company Buy Vinyls site. See also the Cheyne Records site. and he was reported to be the Victor Company's third most popular recording artist after Enrico Caruso and John McCormack as ranked by total record sales. His two best selling titles were \\"Open the Gates of the Temple\\" and \\"A Perfect Day\\". For two publicly available (pre-1923) recordings of his singing, click and ‚Äîboth composed by Carrie Jacobs-Bond (1862‚Äì1946).Evan Williams' recording of \\"A Perfect Day\\" became his most widely selling and reciprocally helped to popularize that parlor song composed by Carrie Jacobs-Bond. Evan Williams also made many records for Victor's British affiliate, His Master's Voice (HMV). Legacy According to his obituary in The New York Times, Williams was fondly remembered for his singing of \\"Tim Rooney's at the Fighting\\" to audiences of soldiers during World War I. H. Evan Williams is buried in Ohio's East Akron Cemetery in the Williams family plot.Historical obituary article on Williams in the Akron Beacon Journal, 2007 May 14. The gravestone on Evan Williams grave reads: :God grew near to his children through the singing heart of Evan Williams. A world that laughs and loves and sings has enshrined the memory of this gentle soul whose song restored and brightened the deep places. An antique oil portrait of Evan Williams was given in 2009 by his descendants to the University of Akron. In his lifetime Evan Williams was sculpted by the famous American sculptor Jo Davidson. ( It was said at the time about celebrities that they were not truly famous unless Davidson had sculpted them) Evan Williams' family house still stands as of 2020. He built the substantial house circa 1914 at 105 Mayfield Avenue in Akron with his record royalties and concert proceeds. It was quite commodious and had a billiard room and a music room with a Mason and Hamlin piano and also a lovely rose garden. After Evan Williams' premature death in 1918, his widow Nona built a smaller house in the side lot at 97 Mayfield Avenue where she subsequently moved. She died in 1944. Evan Williams performed at the White House at a State Dinner hosted by President and Mrs.Taft in 1910. The Tafts were also from Ohio and were introduced to Williams by U.S. Senator and Mrs. Charles W.F. Dick of Akron, whose daughter Grace Amelia later married Williams's son Edgar Morgan in 1917.

He was a founder and president of the Institut M√©tapsychique International, and edited and wrote theoretical and experimental reports for its journal. Biography Warcollier was born on 8 April 1881 at Omonville-la-Rouge in Paris. He obtained a degree in chemical engineering in 1903 from the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Chimie. He patented several processes related to the synthetic production of precious stones, and invented special screens for movie projection.Pleasants, H. (Ed.). (1964). Biographical dictionary of parapsychology. New York, NY, US: Helix. In parapsychology, Warcollier first served as treasurer of the Institut M√©tapsychique International (1929‚Äì1938), then editor of its journal, the Revue M√©tapsychique, (1938‚Äì1940), and then as its president (1951‚Äì1962). He died on 23 May 1962. Studies Warcollier's main parapsychology studies involved experiments using a telepathy design in which one or more \\"agents\\" observed a target image while one or more \\"percipients\\" attempted to \\"blindly\\" reproduce it. Much of his work following from 1922 involved \\"batteries\\" of senders and receivers stationed across France; and he also used sender-receiver teams stationed between France and New York, and France and Great Britain. He worked with Gardner Murphy.Jesse Hong Xiong. (2009). The Outline of Parapsychology. University Press of America. p. 90. Supporters of Warcollier say that his experimental method was an advance in terms of evidence and informativeness on earlier studies using drawings of real objects as target stimuli. A major contemporary critic was the British parapsychologist Samuel Soal. He argued that Warcollier's method was sub-optimal as the targets were not sufficiently selected at random, and correspondences between targets and responses were identified without formal and objective limitations.Soal, S. G. (1932). Experiments in supernormal perception at a distance. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 40, 165-362. Warcollier discarded the statistical method and attempted to obtain direct evidence for telepathy. He claimed from his experiments that men transmit thoughts better than women but that women are better receivers. He also stated that younger people are more sensitive to mental impressions than the elderly. His experiments were well received by parapsychologists such as Harry Price but were criticized by the scientific community.Price, Harry. (1940).

The Problem of Disenchantment: Scientific Naturalism and Esoteric Discourse, 1900-1939. Brill Academic Publishers. pp. 352-354. Warcollier reported his experiments in numerous articles, principally within 56 articles in the Revue M√©tapsychique published between 1924 and 1962, including \\"La t√©l√©pathie exp√©rimentale\\" (1926) and \\"√âtude de dessins t√©l√©pathiques de M.

Results and reflections upon them were also published in his several books, including La T√©lepathie (1921) and La M√©tapsychique (1940; 1946).

It is more commonly played on a computer than as a physical tabletop game. Its name comes from the four- player game mahjong, but it is played entirely differently. Play An untouched turtle formation, with exposed \\"free\\" tiles highlighted in blue The 144 tiles are arranged in a special four-layer pattern with their faces upwards. A tile is said to be open or exposed if it can be moved either left or right without disturbing other tiles. The goal is to match open pairs of identical tiles and remove them from the board, exposing the tiles under them for play. The game is finished when all pairs of tiles have been removed from the board or when there are no exposed pairs remaining. Tiles that are below other tiles cannot be seen. But by repeated undos or restarts which some programs offer, one gradually gets more and more information. Sometimes, tiles are only partially covered by other tiles, and the extent to which such tiles can be distinguished depends on the actual tile set. =Mathematical analysis= Playing Mahjong solitaire optimally in the sense to maximize the probability of removing all tiles is PSPACE-complete, and the game gets NP- complete when looking below tiles is allowed.http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/hard.html Eppstein's page on computational complexity of games. It has been proven that it is PSPACE-hard to approximate the maximum probability of removing all tiles within a factor of n^\\\\epsilon, assuming that there are arbitrarily many quadruples of matching tiles and that the hidden tiles are uniformly distributed. The perfect- information version of this puzzle is where the player knows, before the game starts, the position of every tile. In this case, however, it is NP-complete to decide whether all tiles can be removed. A sample of 10^7 games with the default layout, \\"the turtle\\", revealed that between 2.95 and 2.96 percent of the turtles cannot be solved even if looking below tiles is allowed.http://www.math.ru.nl/~debondt/mjsolver.html Solitaire Mahjongg solver. Variations Mahjong solitaire can be played using genuine tiles and a special wooden frame for set-up. Usually though, it is played in an electronic form as a computer game. This removes the tedium of set-up and the temptation to cheat. Some electronic Mahjong solitaire games offer extra options, such as: # Shuffling the tilesIn these 3 the tiles can be shuffled, but not always # Changing the tile set and patterns from the traditional tiles to flowers, jewels or other items that may be easier to match up at a glance # Playing a series of different layouts with varying levels of difficulty (usually given Chinese-looking names such as 'the ox' or 'the snake') # Adding \\"wildcard tiles\\" and other tiles that have special functions. These games often have a time limit which is sometimes optional. Most also offer hints or undo options which provides the ability to have a match found for the player or to backtrack and undo already made moves. Additionally, most implementations of the game arrange the tiles in such a way that the game is solvable in at least one way. Mahjong solitaire can be played either solo or with a partner, in which case the aim is to accumulate the most pairs, to be the last one to match a pair, or to score the most points. Points are gained for each pair removed, with bonus points for removing matched pairs in sequence or removing pairs in sequence that are parts of sets. Using traditional mahjong tiles, the sets include the dragons, the flowers, the seasons, and the winds. The winds are usually worth the most bonus points when paired individually, but the most bonus points are achieved by matching all of the seasons followed by all of the flowers (or vice versa). With the advent of online gaming, some computer mahjong games offer \\"clash\\" style player vs player challenges where each opponent solves the same board and shuffle, and the best score wins. Some implementations offer to shuffle the tiles when there are no exposed pairs remaining, making it almost always possible for the player to complete the game. Computer game history The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 on the PLATO system and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \\"the Turtle\\". There is a children's game in China named ÊãÜÁâåÈæú (\\"Demolish the Tile Turtle\\") of unknown age.Á∞°ËÄåÊ∏ÖÔºå„ÄäÈñãÊ™Ø„ÄãÔºå1988ÔºåÂçöÁõäÔºåÁ¨¨‰πùÁâà. p.151. . Reprinted 1999Ôºå‰∏ÄÊú¨Â†Ç. . The computer game was released for free and was played using a CDC-721 touch screen terminal. Control Data Corporation released a new version as a paid online game in 1983. The first version remained available for free. The KDE game Shisen-Sho However, it was Activision's release of Shanghai in 1986 for the IBM Personal Computer, Amiga Computer, Macintosh, Atari ST and Apple IIgs that popularised the game. The Macintosh version was created by Brodie Lockard (programming and graphics) and the Apple IIGS version was ported from the Macintosh by Ivan Manley with Brad Fregger as the producer. The game became very successful, and around 10 million copies were sold. It has been ported to many different platforms. The name \\"Shanghai\\" was trademarked by Activision. A similar game, known as Gunshy, was also released in 1987 for the Macintosh. As the game is based on mahjong tiles, some confusion arose with the 4-player mahjong game. Although the name mahjong solitaire is generally accepted, other names include The Turtle as well as brand names Shanghai Solitaire, Taipei, Kyodai and Moraff's. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans (known in Vista build 5219 as Shanghai Solitaire). Mahjong Solitaire was added to Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics for Nintendo Switch.

Plot summary In the introduction, seven wizards use a mummified reptilian creature to cast a spell to raise Yole from the depths. Meanwhile, the main characters are in Valles, where a magical blue bridge has appeared where there hasn‚Äôt been a bridge for hundreds of years. Upon seeing it Tenoctris ascertains that while it is dangerous, it is not associated with the evil Throne of Malkar. While investigating the bridge and the mysterious happenings associated with it, a massive bird appears, snatches up Sharina, and disappears with her. Cashel immediately determines to find Sharina and rescue her. Tenoctris uses her art and determines that whoever sent the bird to kidnap Sharina means her no harm. She sends Cashel to Landure, a wizard on another plane who can help him. Cashel arrives next to an ajar door; a beautiful woman rushes out, pursued by an angry wizard. Cashel fights the wizard, using his quarterstaff, and kills him. The woman, Colva, takes Cashel to Landure‚Äôs castle where she puts him into a drug-induced stupor through which he discovers that she is actually a demoness. When Cashel recovers, he returns to the body of the wizard, who was in actuality Landure. Cashel discovers that Landure‚Äôs sapphire ring contains a powerful demon, named Krias. Krias informs Cashel that he must take a small wafer from Landure‚Äôs body which can be used to animate a new body and bring Landure back‚Äîbut he must travel through the Underworld to reach Landure‚Äôs extra bodies. Cashel takes Krias with him. Eventually Cashel reaches the entrance to the third level of the underworld where Colva originally stayed. While there, Cashel eats some of the fruit of the Tree of Life. At Krias' suggestion, Chashel puts one of the fruit in his satchel. Cashel comes to Landure's castle where he puts the wafer under the tongue of one of the paintings of Landure. Cashel gives Krias back to Landure. When Landure begins insulting Cashel, Krias refuses to serve him anymore, prompting Landure to give Krias back to Cashel. In exchange for his freedom from the sapphire, Krias helps Cashel to cross the Chasm and reach Sharina. Garric, Liane, and Tenoctris stay in Valles to deal with the problem of the bridge. Garric also faces possible rebellion from several lords and bickering among others. Hoping to kill two birds with one stone, Garric assigns Lord Tadai to be ambassador to Sandrakkan. Garric has several dreams about Klestis, a city destroyed at the same time Yole was, and the wizard, Ansalem. Ansalem possessed many objects of power, including a mummy of a reptilian creature, a foot-wide fossilized ammonite, and a powerful amphisbaena. King Carus reveals that he once sought Ansalem‚Äôs help in unifying the isles, but Ansalem refused. Ansalem had seven acolytes (the most dangerous of which was Purlio) who used the ammonite to imprison him while he was weak after rescuing Klestis from the destruction of Yole. Anselm reveals that he has nothing to do with the bridge, but if he can get his amphisbaena back, he can repair it. Tenoctris determines that she needs to visit a wizard named Alman and borrow his viewing crystal. Katchin the Miller, who raised Cashel, appears begging Garric for a job, but Garric turns him away (and he is later captured by Colva). Tenoctris takes them to the end of time. They find Alman in a ruined city and he discovers that his viewing crystal has been stolen from him. The group returns to their own time, leaving Alman in his solitude. After spending a few days tending to matters of state in Valles, Garric receives news that his uncle has helped someone to kidnap Tenoctris. Garric and some of the Blood Eagles cross through a portal to ancient Klestris, to retrieve her but are thwarted. Before returning to Valles, they rescue a woman who claims that she is Colva, wife of Landure, the Guardian, and warns them that seven necromancers intend to do battle with them. She opines that they have kidnapped Tenoctris in order to sacrifice her and increase their own magical powers. At midnight they cross the bridge which showed up at the beginning of the story, to attack the seven necromancers on Klestis. They are confronted with an army of undead under the control of three necromancers, whom they slay. They find Tenoctris unconscious in Ansalem's chambers. Purlio and another of the acolytes are casting spells on her. Purlio takes the fossil ammonite and merges it with himself, replacing his head with it. Armies of undead begin entering Klestis, coming across bridges similar to the one that first set these events in motion. Ilna determines that she can be of no further help in Valles, so she negotiates passage to Sandrakkan with Lord Tadai. Ilna reluctantly makes friends with Lord Tadai‚Äôs niece, Merota. The first night on the ship, Ilna and a tough-looking sailor named Chalcus, witness the beginnings of a mutiny. Ilna tries to warn the captain and Lord Tadai of the imminent mutiny, but they ignore her. The mutiny takes place, as Ilna had warned, and the sailors put everyone except Merota and Ilna ashore on an island. Eventually they arrive at Yole and put ashore. That night they are attacked by a monster. Frightened, the sailors put Ilna, Merota, and Chalcus ashore to reconnaissance. In the interior of the island they discover a harbor bordered by a polis full of reanimated dead people. As they watch, a swarm of Great Ones tow their now-empty ships into the harbor. As they make their way around the island, a creature called the Tall Thing (which was once Ansalemn's child) kidnaps Merota. While pursuing it, Ilna is captured by a wizard named Ewis (one of Ansalem's apprentices) who has the Lens of Rushila. In trying to escape, Ilna releases the Tall Thing which kills and eats Ewis. They meet back up with Chalcus and make their way to the harbor. There they discover that the crews of their ships have been murdered and then reanimated. They flee and spend the night in a cavern. They come to a chasm with a bridge which takes them to a frozen Klestis. There they find Purlio (with his ammonite head) performing incantations using the Dragon. A second necromancer attacks them with three ice beetles. Chalcus defeats the ice beetles while Ilna subdues the necromancer long enough for Merota to bash in his head with a rock. Then they attack Purlio. Sharina is carried by the bird through several planes of existence, including some which are disturbing and grotesque. Finally it deposits her on a beach next to a forest and promptly disappears. Inside a broken-down temple covered with images of serpents she meets a reptilian creature, the Dragon. He reveals that he has brought her back to the past to send her on a mission to recover his mummy which is being used to raise Yole and reanimate the dead. He gives her a snakeskin which she is to take with her back to her own time. Then she goes through a portal and finds herself centuries into the future. She hires a graceful, large bird-like being, named Dalar, as her bodyguard. The pass through several more portals. The last takes them to Klestis at the time when Ansalem was rescuing it during the destruction of Yole. They climb to Ansalem's chambers where they find his seven acolytes and the Dragon. Ansalem is bound and his son has been vivisected and is being transformed into the Tall Thing. Sharina and Dalar are locked out, but at that moment Cashel appears and uses his quarterstaff to punch open the door. When they come through, though, instead of the seven necromancers, they find Garric and Tenoctris. Purlio has escaped. Tenoctris casts a spell which takes them to the frozen time where they encounter Purlio as well as Ilna and her companions. Together they defeat Purlio, but he flees and takes refuge in the land of the dead. The companions are whisked back to Ansalem's chambers. There Sharina burns the mummy and gives the snakeskin to Tenoctris‚Äîit is from an amphisbaena. While everyone is distracted, Colva attacks and kills Garric. Liane then kills Colva. In the land of the dead, Garric encounters Purlio and severs his connection to the living world, thus killing him completely. Cashel revives Garric using the fruit from the Tree of Life in his satchel. Using the amphisbaena snakeskin, Tenoctris frees Ansalem from the cyst he was trapped in. Ansalem returns everyone to their homes‚Äîincluding Dalar‚Äîand then destroys the bridges that connect the different planes of existence. =Major Characters= Garric‚Äîthe Prince of Haft and future Lord of the Isles.

The station generates power using parabolic trough technology. It became operational in January 2012\\\\. The Valle plant is owned by Torresol Energy, a joint venture between SENER (60%) and the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (40%). It was built by SENER between December 2009 and December 2011, at a cost of ‚Ç¨540 million (US$700 million). Construction on Valle 1 and Valle 2 began in December 2009 and was completed in December 2011. Roughly 4,500 workers dedicated over 2.7 million labor hours over the two years of construction until the plants were commissioned and connected to the Spanish national grid. Each 50 MWe has the capacity to supply 160 Gwh of safe, clean power per year, to supply 40,000 homes. Together they reduce emissions by 90,000 tons every year. Their molten salt storage system allows them to continue producing electricity even without solar radiation. In addition to providing a manageable source of clean power, they can also supply electricity to the power grid based on demand. The power station consists of two adjacent plants, Valle 1 and Valle 2\\\\. Each one has a nameplate capacity of 50 MW, using SENER parabolic trough collectors creating solar fields of 510,120 square metres on a total surface area of . Net electrical output for each section is expected to be 160 gigawatt-hours (GW¬∑h) per year. Each plant will have a molten salt thermal storage system containing 28,500 tons of molten salt (60% sodium nitrate / 40% potassium nitrate), capable of storing enough heat to generate 750 MWh of electricity ‚Äî enough to operate at full power for 7.5 hours without sunshine. Valle 1 and Valle 2 use SENERtrough parabolic trough collector technology, which concentrates solar radiation into a central collector tube with circulating thermal oil. They also have high precision optical sensors which track the sun from east to west. The hot oil is used to vaporize water, which through expansion in a steam turbine, propels a power generator that sends power to the electrical grid.

Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. It is located in the northwest of the Black Land of Mordor and close to Barad-d√ªr. Alternative names, in Tolkien's invented language of Sindarin, include Orodruin (\\"fiery mountain\\") and Amon Amarth (\\"mountain of fate\\"). The Sammath Naur (\\"Chambers of Fire\\"), located high up in the mountain's cone, were made by the Dark Lord Sauron in the Second Age. They comprised a tunnel leading to an interior platform with molten lava below it, known as the Cracks of Doom. It was here Sauron forged the One Ring during the Second Age. The mountain represents the endpoint of Frodo Baggins' quest to destroy the Ring, which is recounted in The Lord of the Rings. The mountain's chambers are the site where the One Ring was originally forged by Sauron, and the only place it can be destroyed. Fictional history When Sauron began searching Middle-earth during the Second Age for a permanent dwelling place, his attention was immediately drawn to Mordor, and especially to Orodruin, whose power he believed he could use to his advantage. He subsequently established his kingdom based around Orodruin and \\"used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging\\". The most famous of Sauron's creations forged at Mount Doom is the One Ring. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf explains that the materials of which the Ring is made are so durable and the enchantments with which it is imbued so powerful that it can only be destroyed in the Cracks of Doom where it was made. Orodruin is more than just an ordinary volcano; it responds to Sauron's commands and his presence, lapsing into dormancy when he is away from Mordor and becoming active again when he returns. When Sauron is defeated at the end of the Third Age, the volcano erupts violently.  Concept and creation  The volcano of Stromboli off Sicily According to the fanzine Niekas, Tolkien \\"caught a glimpse of Mount Doom\\" when sailing past the volcano of Stromboli off Sicily. Another possible source of the name is a long story by Algernon Blackwood. Reviewer Bart Higgins noted the similarity between Tolkien's Mount Doom and the volcanic caverns under Venus depicted in Perelandra by Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis. \\"In both cases, the book reaches a cataclysmic scene of a struggle in a cavern, ending with an evil being falling into volcanic fire and being consumed. Since it is well known that Tolkien and Lewis frequently shared with each other their respective works in progress, it is reasonable to assume that the resemblance is no coincidence\\".Bart Higgins, \\"Common Themes and Issues\\", in Barbara Brown-Smith (ed.) \\"Modern Mythologies\\".  Adaptations  Mount Ngauruhoe was Peter Jackson's inspiration for Mt. Doom In Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, Mount Doom was represented by two active volcanoes in New Zealand: Mount Ngauruhoe and Mount Ruapehu. In long shots, the mountain is either a large model or a CGI effect, or a combination. The production was not permitted to film the summit of Ngauruhoe because the MƒÅori hold it to be sacred, but some scenes on the slopes of Mount Doom were filmed on the slopes of Ruapehu.Sibley, Brian.

He is the co-founder and CEO of Reddit, a social news and discussion website, which ranks in the top 20 websites in the world. He also co-founded the airfare search-engine website Hipmunk. Early life and education Steve Huffman grew up in Warrenton, Virginia. At age 8, he began programming computers. He graduated in 2001 from Wakefield School in The Plains, Virginia. At the University of Virginia (UVA), he studied computer science, graduating in 2005. Career During spring break of his senior year at UVA, Huffman and college roommate Alexis Ohanian drove to Boston, Massachusetts, to attend a lecture delivered by programmer- entrepreneur Paul Graham. Huffman and Ohanian talked with Graham after the lecture and he invited them to apply to his startup incubator Y Combinator. Huffman came up with their original idea, My Mobile Menu, which was intended to allow users to order food by SMS. The idea was rejected, but Graham asked Huffman and Ohanian to meet him in Boston to pitch another idea for a start- up; it was at this brainstorming session that the idea for what Graham called the \\"front page of the Internet\\" was created. Huffman and Ohanian were accepted in Y Combinator's first class. Huffman coded the entire site in Lisp. He and Ohanian launched Reddit in June 2005, funded by Y Combinator. The site‚Äôs audience grew rapidly in its first few months, and by August 2005, Huffman noticed their habitual user-base had grown so large that he no longer needed to fill the front page with content himself. At 23, Huffman and Ohanian sold Reddit to Cond√© Nast on October 31, 2006, for a reported $10 million to $20 million. Huffman remained with Reddit until 2009, when he left his role as acting CEO. Huffman spent several months backpacking in Costa Rica before co- creating the travel website Hipmunk with Adam Goldstein, an author and software developer, in 2010. Funded by Y Combinator, Hipmunk launched in August 2010 with Huffman serving as CTO. In 2011, Inc. named Huffman to its 30 under 30 list. In 2014, Huffman said that his decision to sell Reddit had been a mistake, and that the site's growth had exceeded his expectations. On July 10, 2015, Reddit hired Huffman as CEO following the resignation of Ellen Pao and during a particularly difficult time for the company. Upon rejoining the company, Huffman's top goals included launching Reddit's iOS and Android apps, fixing Reddit's mobile website, and creating A/B testing infrastructure. Since returning to Reddit, Huffman instituted a number of technological improvements including a better mobile experience and stronger infrastructure, as well as new content guidelines. These included a ban on content that incites violence, quarantining some material users might find offensive, and removing communities \\"that exist solely to ... make Reddit worse for everyone else\\". Shortly after returning, Huffman wrote that \\"neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen.\\" In a 2012 interview, Ohanian had used the same phrase to describe Reddit, as noted by The New Yorker and The Verge. Huffman also worked to make the site more advertiser-friendly and led efforts to host video and images on site. In late 2016, Huffman was the focus of controversy for altering posts on a subreddit popular with supporters of Donald Trump, /r/The Donald. Following criticism from Reddit users, he undid the change and issued an apology. Beginning in 2017, Huffman led the redesign of Reddit's website with its first major visual update in a decade. Huffman said the site had looked like a \\"dystopian Craigslist\\" whose outdated look deterred new users. Development of the new site took more than a year, and the redesign launched in April 2018. In 2020, Fortune magazine included him in their '40 Under 40' listing in the technology category. Net neutrality activism Huffman is an advocate for net neutrality rules. In 2017, Huffman told The New York Times that without net neutrality protections, \\"you give internet service providers the ability to choose winners and losers\\". On Reddit, Huffman urged redditors to express support for net neutrality and contact their elected representatives in Washington, D.C. Huffman said that the repeal of net neutrality rules stifles competition. He said he and Reddit would continue to advocate for net neutrality. Personal life Huffman lives in San Francisco, California. He mentors aspiring programmers at coding bootcamps including Hackbright Academy. Huffman was an instructor for e-learning courses on web development by Udacity. He is on the board of advisors for the Anti-Defamation League's Center for Technology and Society. Huffman is a ballroom dancer. At the UVA, Huffman competed in intercollegiate competitions.

It was replaced by the app Find My in iOS 13. The service itself was integrated into iOS and macOS, while enabled devices could be tracked using either an iOS app or the iCloud website. On iOS 8 and older, the app could be downloaded from the App Store free of charge. Starting with iOS 9, the app has been bundled with the operating system. For the app to work, both the tracker device and the device being located had to be supported devices with the Find My iPhone app installed and Location Services turned on, and both must have been connected to the same iCloud account.  Features  Find My iPhone allowed users to locate their iOS devices using either the iOS app or iCloud on a computer (such as a desktop). In addition to locating a device, the service provided three additional options: * Play sound ‚Äì makes the device play a sound at maximum volume, makes flashing on screen even if it is muted. This feature is useful if the device has been mislaid, and is equivalent to finding a mislaid phone by calling it using another phone. * Lost mode (iOS 6 or later) ‚Äì flags the device as lost or stolen, allowing the user to lock it with a passcode. If the device is an iPhone and someone finds the device, they can call the user directly on the device. * Erase iPhone ‚Äì completely erases all content and settings, which is useful if the device contains sensitive information, but the device cannot be located after this action is performed. Starting with iOS 7 or later, after the erase is complete, the message can still be displayed and the device will be activation locked. This makes it hard for someone to use or sell the device. An Apple ID password will be required to turn off Find My iPhone, sign out of iCloud, erase the device, or reactivate a device after a remote wipe. The update with iOS 6 added the ability to check the device's battery level. Since the release of iOS 7, users complained about the link between GPS, WiFi, and the app itself. Some handset owners had noted the app enables and disables itself when passing between cellular protocol bandwidths. = Requirements = For the Find My iPhone app to work, the user must had to set up an iCloud account to create the user's Apple ID. Each device to be tracked must have been linked to the same Apple ID, and the Location Services feature must also have been be turned on on each device to be tracked. Location was determined using GPS in the iOS device when Location Services are turned on, but the location of the iOS device was only approximate. To turn Location Services on, users needed to go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services, then selecting the Find My iPhone app in the list and selecting the \\"While Using the App\\" option. To deactivate the app, selecting the \\"Never\\" option instead. The user could also track the device by signing in to iCloud.com. , Find My iPhone was supported on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac computers running OS X 10.7.5 \\"Lion\\" or later. In addition to a compatible device, a free iCloud account was required to use Find My iPhone. Users also can track their Find My iPhone enabled devices through iCloud on Windows, but cannot use it the other way around to track their PC.  History  Find My iPhone was released initially as an app in June 2010 for users of MobileMe. In November 2010 with iOS 4.2, Find My iPhone was available for free for such devices. With the release of iCloud in October 2011, the service became free for all iCloud users. Also, the service was made available as \\"Find My Mac\\" for Mac computers running OS X 10.7.2 \\"Lion\\" or later using iCloud. With the release of MacOS Catalina, the Find My Mac app was combined with the Find My Friends app to create the new Find My app. =Incidents= *In November 2011, police in Los Angeles, California were able to find an armed robbery suspect by using Find My iPhone on the victim's stolen iPhone. *On September 14, 2012, two suspects were arrested in Atlanta, Georgia for robbing five women at gunpoint. Police were able to locate the suspects by using Find My iPhone to find one of the stolen iPhones. *Since early 2011, some Sprint users who used the app to find their lost device were sent to a 59-year-old man's house in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Anti-sidereal time has about 364.25 days per year, one day less than the number of days in a year of solar time, 365.25. Thus each anti-sidereal day is longer than a solar day (24 hr) by about four minutes or 24 hr 4 min. Extended-sidereal time has about 367.25 days per year, one day more than the number of days in a year of sidereal time, 366.25.

Kolterman, \\"A harmonic analysis of the large scale cosmic ray anisotropy\\", 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference (2007). Amplitude modulation sidebands Cosmic rays received on Earth exhibit daily variations in amplitude in solar time due to the distribution of cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere and to the Compton-Getting effect caused by Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun. Other daily variations in amplitude in sidereal time are caused by the anisotropy in the direction from which cosmic rays are received relative to the plane of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Both are contaminated by an annual seasonal variation. The daily solar variation is amplitude modulated by the seasonal variation of , producing sidebands on either side of the solar frequency, about , of and . Similarly, an annual amplitude modulation of of the sidereal frequency, about , produces sidebands of and . The upper sideband of the solar frequency contaminates the amplitude of the sidereal frequency, while the lower sideband of the sidereal frequency contaminates the amplitude of the solar frequency. Because the magnitudes of the two sidebands produced by amplitude modulation of the solar frequency are the same and no known natural phenomenon recurs at , the spurious amplitude at the sidereal frequency can be corrected by subtracting any signal present at the anti- sidereal frequency.

The objective is to aid the lay person to witness to Gospel values, be formative in the faith and an agent of change. Established in 1971 as a catechetical-pastoral training body, the institute has since developed into a multifunctional center. The staff includes two foreign Dominicans and three lay people, two of them women.Kelly, G. and Saunders, K. The Dominican Approaches in Education. ATF Press, Adelaide. 2014 The institute has a 12-member board of directors: the Catholic Bishop of Multan, director of the Pastoral Institute; the Bishop of the Church of Pakistan in Multan; four representatives of other Christian institutions involved in lay formation; two members appointed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Multan; a nominee of the Dominican vice provincial and two members co-opted by the chairperson. Although a diocesan institution, the pastoral institute serves the church more at the national level than at the local level. Programs are planned with priorities and goals in mind. There have always been those regular courses for religion teachers, catechists, basic Christian formation and inter-community formation for religious sisters. Also run are regular short programs for youth, women, nurses, primary health care and school-going boys and girls. Focus, the publication of the pastoral institute for the past 16 years, is an organ of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors. This English review carries articles on selected themes chosen by a board of editors as well as information about local Church activities. Achchha Charwaha (Good Shepherd), an Urdu magazine, is meant to aid catechists, religion teachers and other part-time church workers. It keeps them in touch with current techniques and approaches in their area of work and knowledge. Christian-Muslim dialogue is another function of the institute. A group of Christians and Muslims meets monthly during which members share ideas and experiences on a selected topic. This provides an opportunity to the members of the two religions to meet and understand one another, thus lessening their differences and misunderstandings. The general manager of the Institute in 1987 was Francis Daniel. From 1980 to 1996, Father Chrysostom Macvey OP was director of the Institute. From 1996 on Father Raphael Mahanga OP was director. In 2007, Father James Channan OP was director of the Institute. In 2015 Fr. Dr. Jamshed Albert OP is appointed new director of the Pastoral Institute. The Pastoral Institute celebrated its silver jubilee in 1995. The Institute also runs a nine-month training course for religion teachers. By 2001, 15 batches of teachers had been trained.

Plot A 15-year-old boy, Hiroshi Kuzumi, has recently moved into a new town in the mountains. The town is separated into new and old streets by the river, and many mysterious local customs and practices still remain, and the townspeople are unusually friendly towards him. Although Hiroshi is confused but enjoying his new life, one person has kept her distance from him: class committee member Nemuru Kushinada. In their few encounters she gives him a word of advice: \\"Stay away from the old streets.\\" As the story goes on, Hiroshi learns about the town's local traditions and legends‚Äîmost prominently the ones about the local Wolf Spirits. However, something mysterious is going on in the background; people mysteriously \\"move away\\" and students suddenly \\"transfer schools\\" while none of the locals pay any attention. Hiroshi initially tries to ignore it, but he soon sees a girl with an enormous scythe along with people in strange masks killing someone who is said to have \\"moved away\\" the following day. Hiroshi is soon drawn into the dark secrets long hidden by the townsfolk, and uncovers a plot to destroy the town. Main characters ; : :Hiroshi is a 15-year-old boy and is the main character of the story. Originally from Tokyo, his family moved to the city of J≈çga due to reasons relating to his father's line of work. The kanji for his name can also be read as \\"Professor\\", so many people call him Hakase (Professor) as a nickname. Hiroshi is not fond of this nickname, because it makes people believe that he is smarter than he is. Despite this, he still allows Kaname to call him by it. Hiroshi later learns from Nemuru that all humans (known as \\"Fallen\\" as opposed to the Godmen as the Jouga wolves call themselves) emit a trace of a scent (undetectable by humans) that is intoxicating to Jouga wolves but emitted in small enough quantities that most of them can resist it without much difficulty (in high enough concentrations this scent can cause them to succumb to their predatory natures and to attack the Fallen). Hiroshi happens to be a Temptation, one human in 100,000, who emits the scent at such concentrations that resistance is almost impossible. ; : :Nemuru 15 years old and the only daughter of the head of the Kushinada clan, the family with the most political power and presence in J≈çga. Nemuru, as part of her role as the Hunter, patrols the city at night clad in an elaborate ceremonial outfit and wolf mask and wielding a scythe, hunting for Godmen who have succumbed and started to attack the Fallen, whom she is charged with executing. She is the class president of Hiroshi's class. Nemuru is initially very cold to Hiroshi because she considers him to be a danger. Despite this, she eventually warms towards him and they become friends. ; : :Isuzu is a 15-year-old girl who lives close to Hiroshi. She is tomboyish and extremely affectionate towards Hiroshi, sometimes to his dismay. She had an older brother named Issei, who attended university before succumbing to his predatory instincts and attacking Hiroshi. He was killed by Nemuru. She herself starts to submit and attacks Hiroshi, but manages to stop herself and is spared her brother's fate. ; : :Mana is Hiroshi's 12-year-old sister. She is wheelchair-bound due to a car accident. In spite of this, she strives to be independent, and becomes quite annoyed when her brother rushes to her side to help her with the smallest of tasks. ; : :Kaname is a 16-year-old girl who moved to the J≈çga with her family a few months before Hiroshi and she is Isuzu's best friend. Being the eldest of their circle of friends (Kaname, Hiroshi and Isuzu), she tends to act as the voice of the reason for the group. Kaname has somewhat of a dark personality, and does not hesitate to tease or trick her two friends. She is interested in the occult and loves city legends and folklore. ; :She is a local deity who prowls J≈çga, carrying out the god of the land's will to rid it of the regressed \\"wolves\\". She appears as a young girl wearing an elaborate white outfit and wolf-like mask. She is named after the bodhisattva Kannon. Her true form is later revealed to be Kaori, a lady who Hiroshi and Mana met while taking a walk. ; : :The eccentric school teacher of Hiroshi's class. He appears to very popular with his students. ; : :A resident of Jouga; she is known in the series for her talent in playing the violin. She's also Mana's music teacher. ; : :A mysterious young man who has made his life's mission on unraveling the mysterious incidents occurring in Jouga. Following the tragic death of his girlfriend Mieko, his ultimate goal is to destroy the entire town-(including the citizens who live there) by creating a huge flood; but he is stopped by Hiroshi and Kaori to prevent him from making that mistake. ; : :Isuzu's older brother and Hiroshi's next-door neighbor. He's a college student at a private university. ; : :Hiroshi and Mana's father. After his wife died a few years prior, he and his two children moved to Jouga due to his work transfer; he works for a book publishing company as a writer.

He was considered an \\"ardent and outspoken defender\\" of the independence and constitutional authority of the Senate.Oakes L. Senate clerk Harry Evans bares his teeth, Herald Sun, Melbourne, 30 August 2008  Early life and background  Harry Evans was born on 7 February 1946 in Lithgow, New South Wales. He studied at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours. He was a resident of Canberra, and had three children with his wife, Rhonda.  Australian Senate  In 1967, Harry commenced as a librarian-in-training with the Parliamentary Library. By 1969, he had come to the attention of Jim Odgers, Clerk of the Senate, who wanted to bring out a new edition of his Australian Senate Practice. Odgers was looking for a good researcher to work with him on the project. Harry, with his strong interest in history, applied for and got the job. He was first employed as Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, then became The Usher of the Black Rod, later moving on to become Assistant Clerk in 1983. In 1987 he became Deputy Clerk and, in 1988, achieved the position of Clerk of the Senate. He became highly regarded as secretary to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for many years and cut his teeth on executive accountability to the parliament. Upon his leaving in 1981, the committee chair, Victorian Liberal Senator Austin Lewis, said of him: ‚Äò‚Ä¶ on behalf of the committee, I wish to pay a special tribute to our former secretary, Mr Harry Evans, who has taken up other duties within the Senate. His vast knowledge, dedication and efficiency have been of inestimable value to the committee. Members of the committee congratulate Mr Evans on his advancement, and look forward to his further progress as an officer of the Senate.‚Äô In the early 1980s, Harry set up what is now the Procedure Office, in response to the emergence of minor parties in the Senate and their needs for procedural advice and legislative drafting support in addition to the requirements of the opposition and the government. In 1983, the Appropriations and Staffing Committee approved a new departmental structure as a result of the growth of Senate committee work and the emergence of new functions such as procedural support for minor parties. Several positions of Clerk Assistant were created. Harry was one of the first of these new Clerk Assistants, and was responsible for the Committee Office until he returned to the Procedure Office in 1985, before being promoted to Deputy Clerk in 1987 and Clerk of the Senate the following year. These were incredibly productive years during which Harry was Senate adviser to the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege; was secretary to the two select committees on the conduct of a judge; was the principal critic of the New South Wales Supreme Court decisions in the case of R v Murphy, which provided the immediate catalyst for the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987; was principal instructor in the drafting of the Parliamentary Privileges Bill; revised and redrafted the standing orders to bring them up to date and to delete archaic, unused and contradictory provisions; was secretary to the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, which provided the blueprint for the system of referral of bills to committees which commenced in 1990; and initiated the Procedural Information Bulletin, which continues to provide authoritative commentary on those interesting and unusual procedures with which the Senate abounds. He also found time to be an adviser to the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House. As Clerk, a small sample of Harry‚Äôs achievements include: rewriting Australian Senate Practice as Odgers‚Äô Australian Senate Practice in 1995 and publishing five further editions; devising innovative procedures for senators, including the bills cut-off order and devising many accountability measures such as the contracts order and the codification of procedures for making public interest immunity claims; championing the independence of the Senate and the Senate‚Äôs rights under sections 53 and 57 of the Constitution; being a fearless critic of lack of accountability on the part of the executive; leading by example and fostering in the Department of the Senate a culture of excellence in supporting and promoting the work of the Senate; and, importantly, arguing successfully for the abandoning of the old-fashioned wigs and gowns for the clerks. He is the last Clerk to serve longer than ten years, as term limits were imposed in 1999. As Clerk, he was responsible for advising senators on the procedural operation of the Senate. As a strong defender of the rights of the Senate, including the controversial power to subpoena witnesses, he raised the ire of governments and prime ministers of all persuasions, in particular Paul Keating and John Howard.Grattan M. Senate's sentinel, The Age (Melbourne) 30 May 2009 Evans has stated on numerous occasions that he believes the Senate works best when it has a \\"non-government party majority\\". His reasoning is that the strength of political party discipline prevents most senators exercising a conscience vote and so a government majority means \\"government control\\".Evans H.

The Supreme Court of the United States has found child pornography to be \\"legally obscene\\", a term that refers to offensive or violent forms of pornography that have been declared to be outside the protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Federal sentencing guidelines on child pornography differentiate between production, distribution, and purchasing/receiving, and also include variations in severity based on the age of the child involved in the materials, with significant increases in penalties when the offense involves a prepubescent child or a child under the age of 12. U.S. law distinguishes between pornographic images of an actual minor, realistic images that are not of an actual minor, and non-realistic images such as drawings. The latter two categories are legally protected unless found to be obscene, whereas the first does not require a finding of obscenity. Definition of child pornography under federal law Child pornography under federal law is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age). Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor. Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that images created by superimposing the face of a child on sexually explicit photographs of legal adults is not protected speech under the First Amendment. Notably, the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant; any depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct is illegal. Federal prosecutors have secured convictions carrying mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment for producing visual depictions of individuals above the legal age of consent but under the age of 18, even when there was no intent to distribute such content. The legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity. A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive. Federal law prohibits the production, distribution, reception, and possession of an image of child pornography using or affecting any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2251; 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2252; 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2252A). Specifically, Section 2251 makes it illegal to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of producing visual depictions of that conduct. Any individual who attempts or conspires to commit a child pornography offense is also subject to prosecution under federal law. Federal jurisdiction is implicated if the child pornography offense occurred in interstate or foreign commerce. This includes, for example, using the U.S. Mails or common carriers to transport child pornography across state or international borders. Federal jurisdiction almost always applies when the Internet is used to commit a child pornography violation. Even if the child pornography image itself did not travel across state or international borders, federal law may be implicated if the materials, such as the computer used to download the image or the CD-ROM used to store the image, originated or previously traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. In addition, Section 2251A of Title 18, United States Code, specifically prohibits any parent, legal guardian or other person in custody or control of a minor under the age of 18, to buy, sell, or transfer custody of that minor for purposes of producing child pornography. Lastly, Section 2260 of Title 18, United States Code, prohibits any persons outside of the United States to knowingly produce, receive, transport, ship, or distribute child pornography with intent to import or transmit the visual depiction into the United States. Consequences of conviction under federal law Under federal law, finding of guilt on most child pornography related offenses carry severe consequences, such as mandatory minimum sentences of several years and registration as a sex offender. A first time offender convicted of producing child pornography under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2251, face fines and a statutory minimum of 15 years to 30 years maximum in prison. Child pornography offenses for transportation (including mailing or shipping), receipt, distribution, and possession with the intent to distribute or sell child pornography offenses each carry a mandatory minimum term of 5 years of imprisonment and a maximum term of 20 years. Simple possession of child pornography is punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison, but does not carry a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. If a defendant has a prior federal or state conviction for one or more enumerated sex offenses, the penalty ranges are enhanced. Federal sentencing guidelines provide for higher sentences based on the number of images possessed or distributed, whether the victims were 12 years of age or younger, whether the material is \\"sadistic,\\" and other factors. Reporting requirements Under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 46 codified at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3771, federal law enforcement officials must notify a child pornography victim (or his or her guardian if the victim is still a minor) each time the officials charge an offender with a child pornography offense related to an image depicting the victim. Such notifications can be emotionally traumatic.http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional- testimony-and-reports/sex-offense-topics/201212-federal-child-pornography- offenses/Chapter_12.pdf Obscenity as a form of unprotected speech In the United States, pornography is considered a form of personal expression governed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Pornography is generally protected speech, unless it is obscene, as the Supreme Court of the United States held in 1973 in Miller v. California. Child pornography is also not protected by the First Amendment, but importantly, for different reasons. In 1982 the Supreme Court held in New York v. Ferber that child pornography, even if not obscene, is not protected speech. The court gave a number of justifications why child pornography should not be protected, including that the government has a compelling interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of minors. Record-keeping requirements The initial iteration of , first passed in 1988, mandated that producers of pornographic media keep records of the age and identity of performers and affix statements as to the location of the records to depictions. However, rather than penalties for noncompliance, the statute created a rebuttable presumption that the performer was a minor. Pub. L. 100-690. This version was struck down as unconstitutional under the First Amendment in American Library Association v. Thornburgh, 713 F. Supp. 469 (D.D.C. 1989), vacated as moot, 956 F.2d 1178 (D.C. Cir. 1992). After Thornburgh, Congress amended 2257 to impose direct criminal penalties for noncompliance with the record-keeping requirements. The same plaintiffs challenged the amended statute and accompanying regulations, but the new version was upheld in American Library Association v. Reno, 33 F.3d 78 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In Sundance Association, Inc. v. Reno, 139 F.3d 804 (10th Cir. 1998), the Tenth Circuit rejected the regulation's distinction between primary and secondary producers and entirely exempted from the record-keeping requirements those who merely distribute or those whose activity \\"does not involve hiring, contracting for, managing, or otherwise arranging for the participation of the performers depicted\\". 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2257(h)(3). However, after 2257 was amended in 2006 by the Adam Walsh Act, the court ruled that Sundance's restrictions no longer applied to the amended statute and generally ruled in the government's favor on its motion for summary judgment. Free Speech Coalition v. Gonzales, 483 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (D. Colo. 2006). Simulated pornography Simulated child pornography was made illegal with the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA). The CPPA was short-lived. In 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition held that the relevant portions of the CPPA were unconstitutional because they prevented lawful speech. Referring to Ferber, the court stated that \\"the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not 'intrinsically related' to the sexual abuse of children\\". 1466A - Obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children In response to the demise of the CPPA, on April 30, 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the PROTECT Act of 2003 (also known as the Amber Alert Law). The law enacted , which criminalizes material that has \\"a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture or painting\\" that \\"depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene\\" or \\"depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in ... sexual intercourse ... and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\\". By its own terms, the law does not make all simulated child pornography illegal, only that found to be obscene or lacking in serious value. In November 2005 in Richmond, Virginia, Dwight Whorley was convicted under 18 U.S.C. sec. 1466A for using a Virginia Employment Commission computer to receive \\"obscene Japanese anime cartoons that graphically depicted prepubescent female children being forced to engage in genital-genital and oral-genital intercourse with adult males\\".\\"20 Years for Loli Manga\\" He was also convicted of possessing child pornography involving real children. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. (March 10, 2006) On December 18, 2008, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.\\"Text of 4th circuit court of appeals decision on United States v. Whorley\\" The court stated that \\"it is not a required element of any offense under this section that the minor depicted actually \\". Attorneys for Mr. Whorley have said that they will appeal to the Supreme Court.\\"Court of Appeals Affirms Cartoons of Child Porn Are Illegal\\", Fox News, 19 December 2008.\\"Child-porn cartoon conviction upheld - Federal appeals panel rules porn is porn even if it's drawn\\", NBC News, 20 December 2008. The request for en banc rehearing of United States v. Whorley from the Court of Appeals was denied on June 15, 2009. A petition for writ of certiorari was filed with the Supreme Court on September 14, 2009, and denied on January 11, 2010, without comment. Section 2252A The PROTECT Act also amended , which was part of the original CPPA. The amendment added paragraph (a)(3), which criminalizes knowingly advertising or distributing \\"an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or a visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\\". The law draws a distinction between obscene depiction of any minor, and mere depiction of an actual minor. The bill addresses various aspects of child abuse, prohibiting some illustrations and computer-generated images depicting children in a pornographic manner. Provisions against virtual child pornography in the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 were ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 on the grounds that the restrictions on speech were not justified by a compelling government interest (such as protecting real children). The provisions of the PROTECT Act instead prohibit such material if it qualifies as obscene as defined by the Miller test; the Supreme Court has ruled that such material is not protected by the First Amendment. In May 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the 2003 federal law Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) of Title 18, United States Code that criminalizes the pandering and solicitation of child pornography, in a 7‚Äì2 ruling penned by Justice Antonin Scalia. The court ruling dismissed the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit's finding the law unconstitutionally vague.nytimes.com, Supreme Court Upholds Child Pornography Lawwww.supremecourt.gov, United States v. Williams, No. 06‚Äì694, Decided May 19, 2008 Attorney James R. Marsh, founder of the Children's Law Center in Washington, D.C., wrote that although the Supreme Court's decision has been criticized by some, he believes it correctly enables legal personnel to fight crime networks where child pornography is made and sold. Child pornography is illegal in the US and is not looked at in terms of the typical guidelines of the First Amendment, due to the assumption that it always harms children when it is made, sold, and/or owned. Further developments In 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled in United States v. Knox that the federal statute contains no requirement that genitals be visible or discernible. The court ruled that non-nude visual depictions can qualify as lascivious exhibitions and that this construction does not render the statute unconstitutionally overbroad. In 2014, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found that certain photos of nude children, culled from ethnographic and nudist publications, were not lascivious exhibitions and hence were not pornographic; the court ordered dropping of charges against a prisoner who had been found in possession of the photos. In at least one instance, in North Carolina, teenagers in the United States have been prosecuted as adults for possession of images of themselves. As of September 2015 twenty states had enacted \\"Romeo and Juliet laws\\" which decriminalized such consensual activity with respect to oneself and other teenagers.

The 311 model was manufactured in a number of variations, including pickup, sedan, limousine, coup√©, and as a two- seat roadster. The two-stroke engine was enlarged to 992 cc in 1962. An interim model, called the Wartburg 312 and featuring the chassis developed for the succeeding 353, was built from 1965 until 1967. Background Production of the Wartburg 311 was already underway at Eisenach by the end of 1955. The car was a development of the existing EMW 309. This was the car previously identified as the IFA F9, which, in turn, had been based on the 1940 DKW F9 scheduled for launch in 1940 until the Second World War intervened. The car The basic architecture of the pre-war design, forcibly acquired from Zwickau-based Auto Union, was retained, albeit with the chassis lengthened by 10 cm, which combined with long overhangs to create a larger car with a relatively spacious four-door sedan/saloon body. The name \\"Wartburg\\" came from the very first model (Wartburgwagen) produced in 1898 at the Automobilwerk Eisenach factory, three decades before that company was acquired by BMW, and nearly five decades before the plant's location, following the defeat of Third Reich, in the Soviet occupation zone placed it under state control. The \\"311\\" designation followed the tradition of the plant's previous owner, BMW, whose Eisenach-produced passenger cars had all been identified by a three-digit number starting with a \\"3\\". The use of a separate chassis facilitated the adaptation of the car to a range of differing body shapes. On the other hand, the use of a separate chassis with the frame rails running under the passenger compartment's floor during a period when automakers elsewhere in Europe were increasingly standardizing on self-supporting car bodies, left the Wartburg approach looking increasingly dated, and also added to the car's height, while \\"low-long-sleek\\" was becoming the order of the day in car styling. The 313-1 was a two-seat roadster, sold as the Wartburg Sport, built from 1957 until 1960. Of 469 cars that were built, about one-third were exported to the United States. A plethora of other body styles were available, including a rare four- door military utility roadster, coup√©s, and several station wagon versions. Export markets Exports of the Wartburg 311 to West Germany beginning in 1958, and by the early 1960s the car was exported to many other countries, including the United Kingdom and United States. In all, 737 right-hand-drive 311s were built from 1961 until 1964.  Argentinian production  In Argentina a small two-door sedan with small, two-stroke two- and four-cylinder engines had been built by IAME in C√≥rdoba between 1952 and 1955 as the Justicialista. After the 1955 coup d'√©tat, IAME was renamed DINFIA. From 1956 it was equipped with the 901 cc engine from the Wartburg 311, it looked mostly the same, but its name was changed to Graciela. It was built in 2280 examples until 1961. Pickup and van versions were also available. From 1962 the local bodywork was replaced with that of the four-door Wartburg 311; this was sold as the Graciela W. It retained the same engine, and 646 were built until 1964. Replacement The succeeding, boxier 353 model was to receive a modernized chassis with independently coil sprung wheels, with a significantly better ride. Before the arrival of the 353, there was an interim model, the Wartburg 312 (September 1965 ‚Äì March 1967). It had the updated chassis and also had smaller 13-inch wheels. The chassis also no longer needed regular lubrication. The 353 parts were gradually installed in the 312 as they were ready, meaning that later models were equipped with the engine, rather than the unit from the 311. Some were also equipped with disc brakes at the front. Some enthusiasts replace the body of a 353 with the body of a 311 on the same chassis, which does not require major modifications, thus making a more old-fashioned car with modern underpinnings. The smoother riding 312 is very popular in the German veteran car scene today for precisely those reasons. The 312 continued to be available with a wide variety of body styles until the late-1966 arrival of the 353, after which only the estate and the station wagon remained on sale. As with the 353 Tourist, these models were built by the VEB Karosseriewerk Halle, rather than in the Eisenach main plant.

The reported link between the use of child pornography and child abuse has been used to justify the prohibition of sexual depictions of children, whether their production involves child abuse or not. Pornographic parody images of popular cartoon characters, known as Rule 34, have also been challenged around the world. Images depicting The Simpsons characters have been of particular concern in Australia and in the United States. In Russia Yulia Tsvetkova, an LG+ activist, as of 2020 is awaiting trial on charges of producing and disseminating child pornography - offences punishable with up to six years in jail, due to a series of colourful pictures published online, some showing two men or two women, holding babies or standing with young children, sometimes surrounded by rainbow-coloured love hearts. Second Life controversy In 2007, the virtual world online computer game Second Life banned what its operator describes as \\"sexual 'ageplay', i.e., depictions of or engagement in sexualized conduct with avatars that resemble children\\". The ban prohibits the use of childlike avatars in any sexual contexts or areas, and prohibits the placement of sexualized graphics or other objects in any \\"children's areas\\" such as virtual children's playgrounds within the game environment. Those Second Life residents who are caught ageplaying are given a warning stating that their actions are considered \\"broadly offensive\\" within the Second Life community and that \\"the depiction of sexual activity involving minors may violate real-world laws in some areas.\\" (Duranske 2008). Second Life is not the only community facing virtual child pornography allegations.

Historically and strategically, Attock Khurd is considered the gateway to Central Asia since it is near Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border. History =Ancient history= Attock Khurd (the old city) has a rich history and was of special importance to the entire Indian Sub-continent. The great grammarian PƒÅ·πáini, who wrote the A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´, the oldest surviving Sanskrit grammar, is said in some historical sources to have been born near Attock in Salatura, modern Lahur, on the right bank of Indus River in the ancient Kambojan/Gandharan territory in 520 BCE.See H. Sharfe, Grammatical Literature (Wiesbaden, 1977), p. 88, note 4: \\"Panini is called ≈öƒÅlƒÅturƒ´ya 'man from ≈öalƒÅtura' in an inscription of ≈öilƒÅditya VII of Valabhƒ´, J. F. Fleet, Corpus Inscr.

Attock then finds its name in the history books dating to the rule of Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka, the Emperor of upper India, who had converted to the Buddhist faith. In the Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in Greek, it is declared that Greek populations within his realm also had converted to Buddhism: :\\"Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in Dharma.\\" ::‚ÄîRock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika). In the spring of 326 BCE Alexander III of Macedon passed into the Punjab (at Ohind, 16 m. above Attock), using a bridge over the Indus constructed by Perdiccas and Hephaestion. M. A. Foucher, Notes sur la g√©ographie ancienne du Gandhara (commentaire a un chapitre de Hiuen-tsang)\\", Bulletin de l¬¥√âcole Fran√ßaise d¬¥Extr√™me-Orient, I, No. 4 (Oct., 1901), pp. 322-369; The region became part of the Kingdom of Ederatides the Greek or Indo-Greek Kingdom, who extended his power over western Punjab. The Indo-Greek kings held the country after him (until about 80 BCE) until its invasion by the Indo-Scythians. When the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang visited the district in 630 CE and again in 643 CE, Buddhism was rapidly declining. The Brahman revival, to which India owes its present form of Hinduism, had already set in the early years of the fifth century, and must have been at its height in the days of Hiuen Tsang. From that time the light afforded by the records of the Chinese pilgrims fades. The country was under the dominion of the Hindu kings of Kashmir, and remained so till the end of the 9th century. After that, the district became part of the Kingdom of the rulers of Kabul  and the town, then known as Udhabandhapur or Waihind, their capital until 1001 when the capital was moved to Nandana in Salt Range after Battle of Peshawar (1001)  Samanta Deva and his successors (more accurately designated as the \\"Hindu Shahis of Kabul\\"), who remained in possession till the times of Mahmud Ghaznavi. With the passage of time, the Gakhars became strong in the hills to the east, but their dominion never extended beyond the Margalla pass and the Khari Moorat. The city got more fame by Sufi's & saints which were mostly consist of Bukhari-ul-Naqvi and Bukharis such as Makhdoom Jahaniyan Jahangasht (born in Uch Sharif) and Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari from Bukhara (Urdu: ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿ¨ŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿØ€åŸÜ ÿ≥ÿ±ÿÆ ŸæŸàÿ¥ ÿ®ÿÆÿßÿ±€å c. 595-690 AH, 1199‚Äì1291 CE). They were titled Dewans of Attock in last era of Lodhi period. =Imperial Rule= Akbar the Great built Attock Fort from 1581 - 1583 under the supervision of Khawaja Shamsuddin Khawafi to protect the passage of the Indus. It is ruled by Nawab of Punjab until 1754 and then captured by Durrani Empire. Attock was won by Marathas led by Raghunathrao in 1758. But this conquest was short-lived and then Nawab of Punjab again captured the Attock Khurd which was followed by Ahmad Shah Durrani's conquest under a treaty with Nawab. According to which, Attock Khurd was divided between Afghans and Nawab. It saw countless battles and skirmishes between the Sikhs and the Afghans in later years. In 1813, the Sikh Empire wrested the Attock Fort from the Kingdom of Afghanistan in the Battle of Attock and Nawab of Punjab through \\"Treaty of Misls\\". Attock fort had secured the passage of the Afghans to-and-from Kashmir. In 1833, Hari Singh Nalwa, the Commander-in-Chief of the Sikh Empire's army along its border with the Kingdom of Kabul, strengthened Akbar's fort of Attock by building the very high and massy bastions at each of its gates.Nalwa, V.

Mitsoda and b mitsoda) is an American video game designer and writer best known for his work on the 2004 game Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines. He is the founder of DoubleBear Productions. Biography =Early career and Black Isle Studios= Brian Mitsoda earned a B.A. in English at Florida State University in 1997, moving out to Los Angeles to pursue a career writing for television and film. After playing the game Fallout, he was inspired enough to look up the developer and apply for a job. This resulted in him entering the game industry as a quality assurance tester at Interplay in 1999. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to designer/writer at Black Isle Studios, and took on the role of lead writer for TORN, a PC RPG that used Monolith's Lithtech engine, and a modified version of Fallout's SPECIAL system. However, the title was cancelled in July 2001. =Troika and Obsidian= Around mid-to-late 2002, Mitsoda joined Troika Games, where he designed and wrote the story for Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines, which gained a very positive reception for the quality of its characters, writing, and voice work (of which Mitsoda himself provided multiple uncredited performances). Among the characters that Brian Mitsoda has both written and provided dialogue for in Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines are the ghoul Romero, the elderly hit man Ji Wen Ja, and multiple voices on the in-game radio (including one in the infamous \\"Frickin' Chicken\\" commercial). After the collapse of Troika, Mitsoda moved on to work at Obsidian Entertainment, where he worked on a cancelled role-playing game project codenamed New Jersey, provided feedback on several expansions for Neverwinter Nights 2, and worked as a creative lead on a version of Alpha Protocol. There exists some controversy regarding Mitsoda's role in creating Alpha Protocol: while he has been credited with the development of the game's dialogue system (known in the shorthand as \\"DSS\\"), characters (along with designer Annie VanderMeer), and an earlier complete draft of the script, he has since stated that all of his work has since been removed from the game. He has publicly stated: =DoubleBear Productions= Mitsoda is currently living and working in Seattle. In June 2009, he opened a new development studio, DoubleBear Productions. Their first project was Dead State, a turn-based RPG set during a zombie apocalypse developed with the aid of fellow indie game company Iron Tower Studio. Mitsoda has said that an aim of the game was to be a \\"[s]erious examination of a national crisis or natural disaster\\" and that the game is \\"designed around\\" the \\"stress and survival aspects\\" of \\"a world in crisis\\". Dead State was released on December 4, 2014, and followed up with numerous free updates, culminating in the Reanimated update on May 13, 2015, which acted as a kind of definitive edition. He worked as a writer on DoubleBear's second project, PANIC at Multiverse High! Other works In 2011, Mitsoda released a book of his \\"One Sentence Stories,\\" a humor book in which stories are told in only one sentence.https://www.amazon.com/One-Sentence-Stories-Tales- Attention/dp/146793724X In March 2013, it was announced that he would work with inXile Entertainment as a writer on Torment: Tides of Numenera.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/torment-tides-of- numenera/posts/433614 From 2015, Mitsoda worked with Hardsuit Labs on Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2 as narrative lead; in July 2020, he and creative director Ka'ai Cluney were terminated from their positions in a joint decision by Hardsuit Labs and the game's publisher Paradox Interactive, which Mitsoda called sudden, unexpected and disappointing.

Founding  In both the Making of Dead State book and various interviews, Brian Mitsoda stated that his primary motive for founding DoubleBear was to make the games that he wanted to create, and not have to worry about the heartbreak of a publisher changing their mind and killing the project: Regarding the studio's peculiar name, Mitsoda said:  Games  = Dead State = DoubleBear's first project was Dead State, a turn-based role-playing game set in a zombie apocalypse scenario. The studio worked with Iron Tower Studio on the project, and the game utilized The Age of Decadences game engine. Information regarding the theme and setting was divulged in a Rock, Paper, Shotgun article, including a quote from Mitsoda that reveals that one of the goals of the game is a \\"serious examination of a national crisis or natural disaster,\\" and that the game draws inspiration from Mitsoda's own experiences living in Miami, Florida, during Hurricane Andrew. Dead State launched a successful Kickstarter campaign in summer 2012, released on Steam Early Access on February 2014, and had a final release on Steam and GOG.com on December 4, 2014. The game was supported with multiple free updates afterwards, culminating in the final Reanimated update, meant to act as a definitive edition of the game. = PANIC series = For a while after the release of Dead State: Reanimated, the team made various references to a second game on their Twitch streams, and mentioned that they had \\"pretty exciting (and very fun) projects in the works\\" in their Dead State postmortem on Gamasutra. On August 16, 2016, a surprise announcement in a story from PC Gamer revealed that DoubleBear was about to release one game - PANIC at Multiverse High! - and was announcing another - PANIC in the Multiverse!  PANIC at Multiverse High!  PANIC at Multiverse High! is a parody visual novel/otome game in the vein of Hatoful Boyfriend: the main character wakes up unexpectedly with no memory of their past, nearly late for high school. Once there, they find that a cruel tentacled monster in a letterman jacket - Chad - has declared himself their rival, and they need to enhance their attributes (Cool, Nice, Tough) to make friends and defeat Chad at Prom. According to the PC Gamer article, PANIC at Multiverse High! was initially conceived as an internal joke, but became a real title when the initial project changed direction. The game was meant to act as a fundraiser for PANIC in the Multiverse!, saying that \\"We decided to take this route instead of Kickstarter so that no matter what, people would have a game to play, and get to know the characters and setting more directly.\\"  PANIC in the Multiverse!  PANIC in the Multiverse! is the follow-up title, and is described as being a Japanese role-playing game-style base-defense game, involving gathering a team of heroes to push forward to an enemy base and destroying it before the enemy could do the same to the player's. According to the website, the gameplay involves collecting heroes from all over the Multiverse in order to and bring the fight to the main enemy, \\"the self-proclaimed overlord of the Multiverse, King Sha‚Äôart.\\"  References   External links   DoubleBear Productions at Twitter Category:Companies based in Seattle Category:Video game companies established in 2009 Category:Privately held companies based in Washington (state) Category:Video game companies of the United States Category:Video game development companies Category:2009 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"DoubleBear Productions"},{"id":"23871512","text":"Aimin District () is a district of Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China.

Most of its residents are descendants of members of ancient Turkmen clans. Geographically, the village sits on the slope of a small hill, opposite a much larger hill with a spring water stream passing between the two hills. In times past the region was heavily wooded and green. Now, most of the greenery that survives, clings to the banks of the spring water stream running between the two hills. The province of Gaziantep, where Lohan Cevizli is located, is very near to the north west Syrian border. (Please find more information on the history of this region under Gaziantep). The village has two names. \\"Lohan\\" - which is thought to be a derivative of a Turkish word, \\"Uluhan\\" which means \\"Large Caravansary‚Äù, and \\"Cevizli\\" - which is also a Turkish word meaning \\"has nuts\\", named after the village's walnut and pistachio trees. The native fauna once included leopards, bears and tigers. All that remains are striped hyenas, spur-heeled tortoises, the occasional wolf, various species of skink lizards and chameleons, semi-domesticated dogs and cats, as well as geese and poultry. Along with farming animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, mules, donkeys and horses. Some other native species exist, although a new fauna census needs to be conducted in the region to determine what exactly remains.

The game was originally released in 1999 exclusively in Europe by Hasbro Interactive, who released the game under the MicroProse brand name. In 2000 the game was ported to the Dreamcast, and was published by Acclaim Entertainment under the LJN banner, five years after LJN was shut down by Acclaim. This version saw a North American release, and was released there on June 29, 2000. Spirit of Speed 1937 takes gamers back to the 1930s when motorsports were in their infancy and drivers raced for the thrill of speed, the danger, and the glamor that came with it. A port for the Game Boy Advance was in the works but was scrapped. Gameplay Spirit of Speed 1937 features 15 classic vehicles, including the first twin-supercharged single-seat racer, the Alfa Romeo P3. Also featured are the twin V8 Alfa Romeo Bimotore designed by none other than Scuderia Ferrari, the Alfa Romeo 12C, the Auto Union Type C that was designed by the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, and the Auto Union Type D, a model that conformed to the Formula 1 standard of 3.0 liter supercharged or 4.5 liter non-supercharged engines. Other cars include the Bugatti 35, Bugatti 59, Duesenberg, ERA Remus - which sported a 1500cc supercharged motor that accelerated to in a little under five seconds, Mercedes-Benz W125, Mercedes-Benz W154, Miller, and the 24-litre Napier-Railton that hits its top speed at a terrifying despite its rather hefty weight for a one-seater. Players race around nine legendary courses located in Melhalla (Libya), AVUS (Germany), Montana (U.S.), Roosevelt Raceway (U.S.), Montlh√©ry (France), Pau (France), Donington (England), Brooklands (England), and Monza (Italy). Spirit of Speed 1937's modes of play are Single Race, Championship Season, and Scenario. Single Race allows players to select a car and course to race on. Championship Season is where users take part in a series of races in an attempt to win the title. Scenario is a mode that sets up a historic racing moment for the player to experience. Each mode is broken into three separate difficulties but none of them include a two-player feature. Along with the standard controller, the game also supports arcade sticks and steering wheels.

As an author, he was known as J Kenneth Major. Early life Ken Major was born in Reading, Berkshire on 21 October 1928. His parents were Katharine May Major (n√©e Ridge) and John William Major. He was christened John Kenneth Major but owing to a number of John Majors in the family he was generally referred to as Ken. Major attended the Boy's Grammar School at Leigh, Lancashire, where his father was the headmaster, from 1939 to 1945. He then attended a school in Kendal until 1946. Major was interested in ancient buildings from an early age. He recalled cycling to Winwick church aged 8 to see the carved pig (symbolic of a legend about the church being relocated to a pre-Christian site) there. Higher education Owing to the high number of demobbed ex- servicemen, Major was unable to gain a place at Cambridge where his results would have enabled him to study mathematics. He was able to obtain a place at King's College, Durham University in Newcastle upon Tyne where he studied architecture under the Beaux-Arts regime. During his time at King's College, Major switched from design to repair. He visited Florence, Italy where he studied the repair of Renaissance buildings damaged in the war. In 1952, he applied for and obtained the Lethaby Scholarship from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). Career =Professional= On completing his Scholarship in April 1953, Major was appointed as an architect at the Planning Department of Imperial College, London. In April 1954, he married Helen Lawrence after a four-year courtship. They both had an interest in ancient building and in 1958 the purchase of a Lambretta scooter enabled them to travel further afield. In 1956, Major joined London Transport where his work involved the design of bus garages. In May 1961, Major visited the Hudson River to research the construction of a watermill at Sleepy Hollow. As the original settlers of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow had come from East Anglia, measured drawings of Woodbridge Tide Mill were prepared to assist the restoration. On his return from the United States, Major joined architect and goldsmith Louis Osman as his assistant. His main work while with Osman was the restoration of Ranston House, Iwerne Courtney, Dorset. In July 1963, Major joined Morgan and Branch, architects. He was involved in the redevelopment of Doncaster town centre including a new cinema for ABC and a new library. After this, Major then joined Hammersmith Borough Council where he was in charge of the building of the White City scheme. The scheme was cancelled and Major joined Westminster City Council where he was in charge of a scheme at Lisson Green, which was in limbo after the Ronan Point disaster. Following this, Major was in charge of the redevelopment of parts of Westbourne Grove where 101 properties formerly owned by Peter Rachman were repaired and converted to make them suitable for use by council tenants. Major later took charge of Westminster City Council's maintenance team. In 1975, Major was appointed Assistant City Architect to Westminster City Council. In 1984 his department was closed by the Council and Major commenced practice on his own account. Initial work in private practice involved finishing off various schemes from Westminster City Council. Major was involved in the restoration of the waterwheel ( diameter and wide) at Painshill Park, Cobham, Surrey. Other work included the repair of Stainsby Mill, Doe Lea, Derbyshire, Gelli Groes mill, Gwent and Sacrewell Mill, Wansford, Cambridgeshire. As well as mills, Major was involved in conservation and restoration of a number of churches. Other buildings Major was involved with include Churchgate House, Cookham, Berkshire and a 13th-century cottage at Mowsley, Leicestershire. =Molinological= In 1963, Rex Wailes invited Major to assist him in carrying out a survey of mills in Berkshire. Following this, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland and Wiltshire were covered. Major also conducted a survey of the Kennet and Avon Canal, listing all artefacts surviving and producing a map at a scale of 2 inches to the mile (1:31,680). The resulting map was long. In 1964, Major met Jo√£o Miguel dos Santos Sim√µes who was at that time trying to get the various individual mill societies together. This led to the formation of The International Molinological Society in 1973, of which Major was a founder member. Major became chairman in 1977 and remained in that position until 1993. In 1970, Major's first book, Mills of the Isle of Wight was published. The publishing in 1978 of Animal-Powered Engines marked the first in-depth study of that subject. Apart from his work for the SPAB, Major was also an advisor for other national heritage organisations, such as English Heritage, The Heritage Lottery Fund and other bodies concerned with mill preservation. He was also a founding trustee of the Mills Archive Trust. Death Major died on 25 July 2009 after a short illness. His funeral took place on 6 August 2009 at Reading Crematorium.

In the next phase of expansion, the track was extended south along the east coast of ≈åmura Bay, with ≈åmura opening as the new terminus on 20 January 1898. It became a through-station on 27 November that year when the track was further extended to , and linking up with an earlier at , achieving through-traffic to , then known as Nagasaki. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, track from Tosu through Haiki and ≈åmura to Nagasaki was designated the Nagasaki Main Line. On 1 December 1934, another route along the coast of the Ariake Sea designated as the Nagasaki Main Line. The track from Haiki through ≈åmura to Isahaya became designated as the ≈åmura Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 2,473 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 77th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

The project was the largest urban response to the drought in Australia, which severely affected water supplies in Brisbane and surrounds, particularly between 2004 and 2007. The basic component of the project was a network of potable bulk water pipelines that connect areas that have an oversupply of water to those areas lacking water. The project went online in October 2008 and by November 2008 parts of the region were receiving a diversified supply of water for the first time. Features and structure The SEQ Water Grid was initially managed by a partnership between Seqwater, LinkWater and the SEQ Water Grid Manager. The total cost of the project was 6.9 billion. On 1 January 2013, the SEQ Water Grid Manager, LinkWater, Seqwater and parts of Queensland Water Commission were amalgamated into the Queensland Bulkwater Authority trading as Seqwater. The authority is a state- owned corporation that owns and operates the SEQ Bulk Water Supply System or the Bulk Water Supply Chain. The plan for the Water Grid was originally laid out in the Queensland Water Commission's South East Queensland Water Strategy, a 50-year strategy to maintain adequate water supply. The main objectives are to respond to the drought and provide long term water security for the region, particularly to avoid the need to place severe water restrictions on residents. Other aims of the Water Grid are to move risk away from individual water storage facilities to the regional level and to efficiently coordinate the utility of water sources in South East Queensland. Components Existing facilities that have become part of the Water Grid include Wivenhoe Dam, Somerset Dam, North Pine Dam and Baroon Pocket Dam, along with eight other dams that make up the 12 connected dams. Part of the project involved the construction of the Gold Coast Desalination Plant to convert sea water to drinking water and the Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme to purify treated wastewater for supply to power stations and industrial and agricultural customers. Purified recycled water will also be added to the water supply once combined dam levels fall below 40 per cent. Two major pipelines, called the Northern and Southern Pipeline Interconnectors, link water storage facilities near Gympie in the north of the region and the Gold Coast area, south of Brisbane. Wyaralong Dam and the completed Cedar Grove Weir are part of the plans. These water reservoirs provide significant new supply and are needed to meet the region's growing demand up until 2050. In 2008 Lake Manchester Dam and Enoggera Dam were reactivated to supplement supply. The project also encompasses a raising of the Hinze Dam dam wall and the connection of the Leslie Harrison Dam and Ewen Maddock Dam to the regional network. =Current SEQ Water Grid bulk water assets= * 12 connected dams * 10 connected drinking water treatment plants * 3 advanced water treatment plants producing purified recycled water * 1 desalination plant * 28 water reservoirs * 22 bulk water pump stations * of potable bulk water mains See also * Water supply and sanitation in Australia * Water security in Australia References External links * Seqwater * LinkWater * Water Grid - \\"Australia's most secure water supply\\" Category:Water management in Queensland Category:South East Queensland Category:2008 establishments in Australia ","title":"SEQ Water Grid"},{"id":"23871703","text":"A wanted fugitive, Marshall Wolfman, turns up at the Pu√±o Airlines to claim his \\"prize\\", tennis racket in hand.\\"Free Ride to Jail\\", San Jose Mercury News, June 17, 1985 In 1985, the Fugitive Investigative Strike Team VIII, part of the United States Marshals Service, set up Pu√±o Airlines, a front organization to lure wanted criminals into the open where they could be arrested ‚Äì by sending a letter suggesting the fugitive had won a free flight, a weekend in the Bahamas, and $350 in spending money.

Life He was the son of John Aglionby, educated at Westminster School, from which he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1619, aged sixteen. He graduated B.A. in 1623, and successively proceeded M.A. in 1626, B.D. in 1633 and D.D. in 1635.Joseph Meadows Cowper, The Lives of the Deans of Canterbury, 1541 to 1900 (1900), pp. 91-2. He was hired as a tutor for her children including William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire by the widowed Countess Christian Cavendish. In this position he was the replacement for Hobbes, who was a close associate of William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire up to his death in 1628. Aglionby wrote to Hobbes on Cavendish family matters from 1629, and later made his way into the Great Tew circle.Aloysius Martinich, Hobbes (1999), p. 82, 103.Noel Malcolm, The Correspondence by Thomas Hobbes (1994). In 1632 Aglionby accepted the vicarage of Cassington, Oxfordshire. On the death of his uncle, Dr. John King, in 1638, he was promoted to a stall in Westminster Abbey. In the following year he was made a prebendary of Chichester, and in 1642 compounded for the Deanery there. For some time he was a master of Westminster School, and was tutor to the young George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. He was deprived of his stall at Westminster; at Canterbury he was never installed, given the wartime conditions, and it is probable that he never visited his cathedral. He died of disease in Oxford, in November, 1643, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral there.Thomas Hearne, Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, vol.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building and incorporates a section of the Chester Rows. History Crypt Chambers is built on the site of a medieval house whose undercroft is still present. The present building was constructed in 1858 to a design by T. M. Penson. It was built as a department store for William and Charles Brown of the Browns of Chester family of drapers. alt=Two columns with a railing between, under which is a stairway leading from the street to a lower level Architecture =Exterior= The building is in four storeys plus attics. It is constructed in red and yellow sandstone with a roof of brown tiles. The fa√ßade is asymmetrical, having a square stair turret, with three bays to the east and one wider bay to the west. At the street level five steps at the base of the tower lead down to the undercroft and in the middle east bay eight steps lead up to the Row level. Between these are shop fronts. At the Row level are cast iron railings behind which are stallboards and above them are moulded arches. On the front of the tower at this level is a blank scroll, on the east face is a recessed panel containing the initials W. B. (for William Brown), on the west face the initials are C. B. (for Charles Brown) and on the rear face is a scroll inscribed AD 1858: CRYPT CHAMBERS. On each side of the entrance to the shop are the Chester City arms. In each of the third and fourth storeys of the east bays are three pairs of arched, two-light windows with slender columns between each pair. In the west bay are four two-light arched windows in each storey. At this level on the tower is a two-storey oriel window. Above these storeys, the central eastern bay has a gable containing a traceried window in a rounded triangle, on each side of which are three-light dormer windows. The west bay also has a gable; this contains a small triangular oriel. The tower has a four-light window between shallow buttresses. The top of the tower consists of a truncated spire with a gabled dormer on each face. At its summit is a cast iron rail. =Interior= The undercroft consists of four bays with chamfered rib-vaulting; the masonry is \\"of high quality\\". The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner considered its undercroft to be \\"one of the best medieval crypts of Chester\\". Much of the structure above the undercroft has been changed or covered by modern materials. Present day Crypt Chambers still contains a department store, Debenhams, which maintains its traditional name of Browns of Chester. The undercroft is used as a restaurant.

History  = Caesar Offshore = The first predecessor of POSC Caesar Association, the Caesar Offshore program, started in 1993. The original focus was on standardizing technical data definitions for capital intensive projects at the handover from the EPC contractor to the owner/operators of onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities. The program was sponsored by The Research Council of Norway, two EPC contractors (Aker Maritime and Kv√¶rner), three owners/operators (Norsk Hydro, Saga Petroleum and Statoil) and DNV as service provider and project owner. = POSC Caesar project = During the period 1994‚Äì96, Caesar Offshore Program was defined as a project of Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC) (now Energistics), and changed its name to the POSC Caesar Project. In 1995 the project was joined by BP, Brown and Root and Elf Aquitaine and in 1997 by Intergraph, IBM, Oracle, Lloyd's, Shell, ABB and UMOE Technologies. During that time, POSC Caesar also became a member of European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE) where it collaborates with PISTEP (UK), and USPI-NL (The Netherlands) on the development of ISO 10303, also known as \\"Standard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP).\\" = POSC Caesar Association = In 1997, POSC Caesar Association was founded as an independent, global, non- profit, member organization. POSC Caesar Association serves an international membership and collaborates with other international organizations. It has its main office in Norway. Albeit the name of POSC Caesar Association still hints to its past as a project within the Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC) (now Energistics ), from 1997 onwards, the organization has been independent. Energistics and POSC Caesar Association do collaborate, and are formally member in each other's organization.  Membership  POSC Caesar Association has with its current 36 members from around the world established an international footprint (with a strong membership in Norway) that includes a wide range from academia, solution providers to engineering contractors and owners/operators.

ISO 15926 has also over the years evolved from a dictionary (a list of terms with definitions), over a taxonomy (added hierarchy) to an ontology (a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts).

These dioceses were organised into six interior provinces in Mesopotamia, in the Church's Iraqi heartland, and a dozen or more second-rank exterior provinces. Most of the exterior provinces were located in Iran, Central Asia, India and China, testifying to the Church's remarkable eastern expansion in the Middle Ages. A number of East Syriac dioceses were also established in the towns of the eastern Mediterranean, in Palestine, Syria, Cilicia and Egypt. Sources The western provinces of the Parthian empire There are few sources for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East before the Sassanian (Persian) period, and the information provided in martyr acts and local histories such as the Chronicle of Erbil may not always be genuine. The Chronicle of Erbil, for example, provides a list of East Syriac dioceses supposedly in existence by 225. References to bishops in other sources confirm the existence of many of these dioceses, but it is impossible to be sure that all of them had been founded at this early period. Diocesan history was a subject particularly susceptible to later alteration, as bishops sought to gain prestige by exaggerating the antiquity of their dioceses, and such evidence for an early diocesan structure in the Church of the East must be treated with great caution. Firmer ground is only reached with the 4th-century narratives of the martyrdoms of bishops during the persecution of Shapur II, which name several bishops and dioceses in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. The ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East in the Sassanian period, at least in the interior provinces and from the 5th century onwards, is known in some detail from the records of synods convened by the patriarchs Isaac in 410, Yahballaha I in 420, Dadisho ø in 424, Acacius in 486, Baba√Ø in 497, Aba I in 540 and 544, Joseph in 554, Ezekiel in 576, Isho øyahb I in 585 and Gregory in 605.Chabot, 274‚Äì5, 283‚Äì4, 285, 306‚Äì7 and 318‚Äì51 These documents record the names of the bishops who were either present at these gatherings, or who adhered to their acts by proxy or later signature. These synods also dealt with diocesan discipline, and throw interesting light on the problems which the leaders of the church faced in trying to maintain high standards of conduct among their widely dispersed episcopate. After the Arab conquest in the 7th century, the sources for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East are of a slightly different nature from the synodical acts and historical narratives of the Sassanian period. As far as its patriarchs are concerned, reign-dates and other dry but interesting details have often been meticulously preserved, giving the historian a far better chronological framework for the Ummayad and  øAbbasid periods than for the Mongol and post- Mongol periods. The 11th-century Chronography of Elijah of Nisibis, edited in 1910 by E. W. Brooks and translated into Latin (Eliae Metropolitae Nisibeni Opus Chronologicum), recorded the date of consecration, length of reign and date of death of all the patriarchs from Timothy I (780‚Äì823) to Yohannan V (1001‚Äì11), and also supplied important information on some of Timothy's predecessors. Valuable additional information on the careers of the East Syriac patriarchs is supplied in histories of the Church of the East since its foundation written by the 12th-century East Syriac author Mari ibn Sulaiman and the 14th-century authors  øAmr ibn Mattai and Sliba ibn Yuhanna. Mari's history, written in the second half of the 12th century, ends with the reign of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø III (1139‚Äì48). The 14th-century writer  øAmr ibn Mattai, bishop of Tirhan, abridged Mari's history but also provided a number of new details and brought it up to the reign of the patriarch Yahballaha III (1281‚Äì1317). Sliba, in turn, continued  øAmr's text into the reign of the patriarch Timothy II (1318 ‚Äì c. 1332). Unfortunately, no English translation has yet been made of these important sources. They remain available only in their original Arabic and in a Latin translation (Maris, Amri, et Salibae: De Patriarchis Nestorianorum Commentaria) made between 1896 and 1899 by Enrico Gismondi. There are also a number of valuable references to the Church of the East and its bishops in the Chronicon Ecclesiasticum of the 13th-century West Syriac writer Bar Hebraeus. Although principally a history of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Chronicon Ecclesiasticum frequently mentions developments in the East Syriac church that affected the West Syriacs. Like its East Syriac counterparts, the Chronicon Ecclesiasticum has not yet been translated into English, and remains available only in its Syriac original and in a Latin translation (Bar Hebraeus Chronicon Ecclesiasticum) made in 1877 by its editors, Jean Baptiste Abbeloos and Thomas Joseph Lamy. Rather less is known about the diocesan organisation of the Church of the East under the caliphate than during the Sassanian period. Although the acts of several synods held between the 7th and 13th centuries were recorded (the 14th-century author  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis mentions the acts of the synods of Isho ø Bar Nun and Eliya I, for example), most have not survived. The synod of the patriarch Gregory in 605 was the last ecumenical synod of the Church of the East whose acts have survived in full, though the records of local synods convened at Dairin in Beth Qatraye by the patriarch Giwargis in 676 and in Adiabene in 790 by Timothy I have also survived by chance.Chabot, 318‚Äì51, 482 and 608 The main sources for the episcopal organisation of the Church of the East during the Ummayad and  øAbbasid periods are the histories of Mari,  øAmr and Sliba, which frequently record the names and dioceses of the metropolitans and bishops present at the consecration of a patriarch or appointed by him during his reign. These records tend to be patchy before the 11th century, and the chance survival of a list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900 helps to fill one of the many gaps in our knowledge.MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147 The records of attendance at patriarchal consecrations must be used with caution, however, as they can give a misleading impression. They inevitably gave prominence to the bishops of Mesopotamia and overlooked those of the more remote dioceses who were unable to be present. These bishops were often recorded in the acts of the Sassanian synods, because they adhered to their acts by letter. Two lists in Arabic of East Syriac metropolitan provinces and their constituent dioceses during the  øAbbasid period have survived. The first, reproduced in Assemani's Bibliotheca Orientalis, was made in 893 by the historian Eliya of Damascus.Assemani, BO, ii. 485‚Äì9 The second, a summary ecclesiastical history of the Church of the East known as the Mukhtasar al-akhbar al-bi øiya, was compiled in 1007/8. This history, published by B. Haddad (Baghdad, 2000), survives in an Arabic manuscript in the possession of the Chaldean Church, and the French ecclesiastical historian J. M. Fiey made selective use of it in Pour un Oriens Christianus Novus (Beirut, 1993), a study of the dioceses of the West and East Syriac churches. A number of local histories of monasteries in northern Mesopotamia were also written at this period (in particular Thomas of Marga‚Äôs Book of Governors, the History of Rabban Bar  øIdta, the History of Rabban Hormizd the Persian, the History of Mar Sabrisho ø of Beth Qoqa and the Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya) and these histories, together with a number of hagiographical accounts of the lives of notable holy men, occasionally mention bishops of the northern Mesopotamian dioceses. Thomas of Marga is a particularly important source for the second half of the 8th century and the first half of the 9th century, a period for which little synodical information has survived and also few references to the attendance of bishops at patriarchal consecrations. As a monk of the important monastery of Beth  øAbe, and later the secretary of the patriarch Abraham II (832‚Äì50), he had access to a wide range of written sources, including the correspondence of the patriarch Timothy I, and could also draw on the traditions of his old monastery and the long memories of its monks. Thirty or forty otherwise unattested bishops of this period are mentioned in the Book of Governors, and it is the prime source for the existence of the northern Mesopotamian diocese of Salakh. A particularly important passage mentions the prophecy of the monastery‚Äôs superior Quriaqos, who flourished around the middle of the 8th century, that forty-two of the monks under his care would later become bishops, metropolitans, or even patriarchs. Thomas was able to name, and supply interesting information about, thirty-one of these bishops.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 444‚Äì9 Nevertheless, references to bishops beyond Mesopotamia are infrequent and capricious. Furthermore, many of the relevant sources are in Arabic rather than Syriac, and often use a different Arabic name for a diocese previously attested only in the familiar Syriac form of the synodical acts and other early sources. Most of the Mesopotamian dioceses can be readily identified in their new Arabic guise, but on occasion the use of Arabic presents difficulties of identification. Parthian period By the middle of the 4th century, when many of its bishops were martyred during the persecution of Shapur II, the Church of the East probably had twenty or more dioceses within the borders of the Sassanian empire, in Beth Aramaye (), Beth Huzaye (), Maishan (), Adiabene (Hdyab, ) and Beth Garma√Ø (), and possibly also in Khorasan. Some of these dioceses may have been at least a century old, and it is possible that many of them were founded before the Sassanian period. According to the Chronicle of Erbil there were several dioceses in Adiabene and elsewhere in the Parthian empire as early as the end of the 1st century, and more than twenty dioceses in 225 in Mesopotamia and northern Arabia, including the following seventeen named dioceses: Bƒì·πØ Za·∏ádai (), KarkhƒÅ d-Bƒì·πØ Sl≈çkh (), Ka≈°kar (), Bƒì·πØ Lapa·π≠ (), Hormƒ´zd Arda≈°ƒ´r (), PrƒÅ·πØ d-Mai≈°ƒÅn (), ·∏§nƒ´·πØƒÅ (), ·∏§r·∏áa·πØ GlƒÅl (), Arzun (), Beth Niqator (apparently a district in Beth Garma√Ø), Shahrgard, Beth Meskene (possibly Piroz Shabur, later an East Syriac diocese), Hulwan (), Beth Qatraye (), Hazza (probably the village of that name near Erbil, though the reading is disputed), Dailam and Shigar (Sinjar). The cities of Nisibis () and Seleucia-Ctesiphon, it was said, did not have bishops at this period because of the hostility of the pagans towards an overt Christian presence in the towns. The list is plausible, though it is perhaps surprising to find dioceses for Hulwan, Beth Qatraye, Dailam and Shigar so early, and it is not clear whether Beth Niqator was ever an East Syriac diocese. Sassanid period thumb400pxMetropolitan provinces of the Church of the East. During the 4th century the dioceses of the Church of the East began to group themselves into regional clusters, looking for leadership to the bishop of the chief city of the region. This process was formalised at the synod of Isaac in 410, which first asserted the priority of the 'grand metropolitan' of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and then grouped most of the Mesopotamian dioceses into five geographically-based provinces (by order of precedence, Beth Huzaye, Nisibis, Maishan, Adiabene and Beth Garma√Ø), each headed by a metropolitan bishop with jurisdiction over several suffragan bishops. Canon XXI of the synod foreshadowed the extension of this metropolitan principle to a number of more remote dioceses in Fars, Media, Tabaristan, Khorasan and elsewhere.Chabot, 273 In the second half of the 6th century the bishops of Rev Ardashir and Merv (and possibly Herat) also became metropolitans. The new status of the bishops of Rev Ardashir and Merv was recognised at the synod of Joseph in 554, and henceforth they took sixth and seventh place in precedence respectively after the metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø. The bishop of Hulwan became a metropolitan during the reign of Isho øyahb II (628‚Äì45). The system established at this synod survived unchanged in its essentials for nearly a millennium. Although during this period the number of metropolitan provinces increased as the church‚Äôs horizons expanded, and although some suffragan dioceses within the original six metropolitan provinces died out and others took their place, all the metropolitan provinces created or recognised in 410 were still in existence in 1318. =Interior provinces=  Province of the Patriarch  The patriarch himself sat at Seleucia-Ctesiphon or, more precisely, the Sassanian foundation of Veh-Ardashir on the west bank of the Tigris, built in the 3rd century adjacent to the old city of Seleucia, which was thereafter abandoned. The city of Ctesiphon, founded by the Parthians, was nearby on the east bank of the Tigris, and the double city was always known by its early name Seleucia-Ctesiphon to the East Syriacs. It was not normal for the head of an eastern church to administer an ecclesiastical province in addition to his many other duties, but circumstances made it necessary for Yahballaha I to assume responsibility for a number of dioceses in Beth Aramaye. The dioceses of Kashkar, Zabe, Hirta (al-Hira), Beth Daraye and Dasqarta d'Malka (the Sassanian winter capital Dastagird), doubtless because of their antiquity or their proximity to the capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were reluctant to be placed under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan, and it was felt necessary to treat them tactfully. A special relationship between the diocese of Kashkar, believed to have been an apostolic foundation, and the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was defined in Canon XXI of the synod of 410: > The first and chief seat is that of Seleucia and Ctesiphon; the bishop who > occupies it is the grand metropolitan and chief of all the bishops. The > bishop of Kashkar is placed under the jurisdiction of this metropolitan; he > is his right arm and minister, and he governs the diocese after his > death.Chabot, 272 Although the bishops of Beth Aramaye were admonished in the acts of these synods, they persisted in their intransigence, and in 420 Yahballaha I placed them under his direct supervision. This ad hoc arrangement was later formalised by the creation of a 'province of the patriarch'. As foreshadowed in the synod of Isaac in 410, Kashkar was the highest ranking diocese in this province, and the bishop of Kaskar became the 'guardian of the throne' (natar kursya) during the interregnum between one patriarch's death and the election of his successor. The diocese of Dasqarta d'Malka is not mentioned again after 424, but bishops of the other dioceses were present at most of the 5th- and 6th-century synods. Three more dioceses in Beth Aramaye are mentioned in the acts of the later synods: Piroz Shabur (first mentioned in 486); Tirhan (first mentioned in 544); and Shenna d'Beth Ramman or Qardaliabad (first mentioned in 576). All three dioceses were to have a long history. Province of Beth Huzaye (Elam) The metropolitan of Beth Huzaye ( øIlam or Elam), who resided in the town of Beth Lapat (Veh az Andiokh Shapur), enjoyed the right of consecrating a new patriarch. In 410 it was not possible to appoint a metropolitan for Beth Huzaye, as several bishops of Beth Lapat were competing for precedence and the synod declined to choose between them.Chabot, 272‚Äì3 Instead, it merely laid down that once it became possible to appoint a metropolitan, he would have jurisdiction over the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan, Hormizd Ardashir, Shushter (Shushtra, ) and Susa (Shush, ). These dioceses were all founded at least a century earlier, and their bishops were present at most of the synods of the 5th and 6th centuries. A bishop of Ispahan was present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424, and by 576 there were also dioceses for Mihraganqadaq (probably the 'Beth Mihraqaye' included in the title of the diocese of Ispahan in 497) and Ram Hormizd (Ramiz). Province of Nisibis In 363 the Roman emperor Jovian was obliged to cede Nisibis and five neighbouring districts to Persia to extricate the defeated army of his predecessor Julian from Persian territory. The Nisibis region, after nearly fifty years of rule by Constantine and his Christian successors, may well have contained more Christians than the entire Sassanian empire, and this Christian population was absorbed into the Church of the East in a single generation. The impact of the cession of Nisibis on the demography of the Church of the East was so marked that the province of Nisibis was ranked second among the five metropolitan provinces established at the synod of Isaac in 410, a precedence apparently conceded without dispute by the bishops of the three older Persian provinces relegated to a lower rank. The bishop of Nisibis was recognised in 410 as the metropolitan of Arzun (), Qardu (), Beth Zabda√Ø (), Beth Rahima√Ø () and Beth Moksaye (). These were the Syriac names for Arzanene, Corduene, Zabdicene, Rehimene and Moxoene, the five districts ceded by Rome to Persia in 363. The metropolitan diocese of Nisibis () and the suffragan dioceses of Arzun, Qardu and Beth Zabda√Ø were to enjoy a long history, but Beth Rahima√Ø is not mentioned again, while Beth Moksaye is not mentioned after 424, when its bishop Atticus (probably, from his name, a Roman) subscribed to the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø. Besides the bishop of Arzun, a bishop of 'Aoustan d‚ÄôArzun' (plausibly identified with the district of Ingilene) also attended these two synods, and his diocese was also assigned to the province of Nisibis. The diocese of Aoustan d'Arzun survived into the 6th century, but is not mentioned after 554. During the 5th and 6th centuries three new dioceses in the province of Nisibis were founded in Persian territory, in Beth  øArabaye (the hinterland of Nisibis, between Mosul and the Tigris and Khabur rivers) and in the hill country to the northeast of Arzun. By 497 a diocese had been established at Balad (the modern Eski Mosul) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century.Fiey, POCN, 57‚Äì8 By 563 there was also a diocese for Shigar (Sinjar), deep inside Beth  øArabaye, and by 585 a diocese for Kartwaye, the country to the west of Lake Van inhabited by the Kartaw Kurds.Fiey, POCN, 134 The famous School of Nisibis was an important seminary and theological academy of the Church of the East during the late Sassanian period, and in the last two centuries of Sassanian rule generated a remarkable outpouring of East Syriac theological scholarship. Province of Maishan In southern Mesopotamia, the bishop of Prath d'Maishan () became metropolitan of Maishan () in 410, responsible also for the three suffragan dioceses of Karka d'Maishan (), Rima () and Nahargur (). The bishops of these four dioceses attended most of the synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.Chabot, 272‚Äì3; Fiey, POCN, 59‚Äì60, 100, 114 and 125‚Äì6 Province of Adiabene The citadel of Erbil, chief town in the East Syriac metropolitan province of Adiabene The bishop of Erbil became metropolitan of Adiabene in 410, responsible also for the six suffragan dioceses of Beth Nuhadra (), Beth Bgash, Beth Dasen, Ramonin, Beth Mahqart and Dabarin. Bishops of the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Beth Dasen, which covered the modern  øAmadiya and Hakkari regions, were present at most of the early synods, and these three dioceses continued without interruption into the 13th century. The other three dioceses are not mentioned again, and have been tentatively identified with three dioceses better known under other names: Ramonin with Shenna d'Beth Ramman in Beth Aramaye, on the Tigris near its junction with the Great Zab; Beth Mahrqart with Beth Qardu in the Nisibis region, across the Tigris from the district of Beth Zabda√Ø; and Dabarin with Tirhan, a district of Beth Aramaye which lay between the Tigris and the Jabal ·∏§amrin, to the southwest of Beth Garma√Ø. By the middle of the 6th century there were also dioceses in the province of Adiabene for Ma øaltha () or Ma øalthaya (), a town in the Hnitha () or Zibar district to the east of  øAqra, and for Nineveh. The diocese of Ma øaltha is first mentioned in 497, and the diocese of Nineveh in 554, and bishops of both dioceses attended most of the later synods.Fiey, POCN, 106 and 115‚Äì16 Province of Beth Garma√Ø The bishop of Karka d'Beth Slokh (, modern Kirkuk) became metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø, responsible also for the five suffragan dioceses of Shahrgard, Lashom (), Mahoze d'Arewan (), Radani and Hrbath Glal (). Bishops from these five dioceses are found at most of the synods in the 5th and 6th centuries. Two other dioceses also existed in the Beth Garma√Ø district in the 5th century which do not appear to have been under the jurisdiction of its metropolitan. A diocese existed at Tahal as early as 420, which seems to have been an independent diocese until just before the end of the 6th century, and bishops of the Karme district on the west bank of the Tigris around Tagrit, in later centuries a West Syrian stronghold, were present at the synods of 486 and 554. Unlocalised dioceses Several dioceses mentioned in the acts of the early synods cannot be convincingly localised. A bishop Ardaq of 'Mashkena d'Qurdu' was present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424, a bishop Mushe of 'Hamir' at the synod of Acacius in 486, bishops of 'Barhis' at the synods of 544, 576 and 605, and a bishop of  øA√Øn Sipne at the synod of Ezekiel in 576. Given the personal attendance of their bishops at these synods, these dioceses were probably in Mesopotamia rather than the exterior provinces.Chabot, 285, 344‚Äì5, 368 and 479 =Exterior provinces= Canon XXI of the synod of 410 provided that 'the bishops of the more remote dioceses of Fars, the Islands, Beth Madaye [Media], Beth Raziqaye [Rai] and also the country of Abrashahr [Nishapur], must later accept the definition established in this council'. This reference demonstrates that the influence of the Church of the East in the 5th century had extended beyond the non-Iranian fringes of the Sassanian empire to include several districts within Iran itself, and had also spread southwards to the islands off the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, which were under Sassanian control at this period. By the middle of the 6th century the Church's reach seems to have spread well beyond the frontiers of the Sassanian empire, as a passage in the acts of the synod of Aba I in 544 refers to East Syriac communities 'in every district and every town throughout the territory of the Persian empire, in the rest of the East, and in the neighbouring countries'.Chabot, 320‚Äì1 Fars and Arabia There were at least eight dioceses in Fars and the islands of the Persian Gulf in the 5th century, and probably eleven or more by the end of the Sassanian period. In Fars the diocese of Rev Ardashir is first mentioned in 420, the dioceses of Ardashir Khurrah (Shiraf), Darabgard, Istakhr, and Kazrun (Shapur or Bih Shapur) in 424, and a diocese of Qish in 540. On the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf dioceses are first mentioned for Dairin and Mashmahig in 410 and for Beth Mazunaye (Oman) in 424. By 540 the bishop of Rev Ardashir had become a metropolitan, responsible for the dioceses of both Fars and Arabia. A fourth Arabian diocese, Hagar, is first mentioned in 576, and a fifth diocese, Hatta (previously part of the diocese of Hagar), is first mentioned in the acts of a regional synod held on the Persian Gulf island of Dairin in 676 by the patriarch Giwargis to determine the episcopal succession in Beth Qatraye, but may have been created before the Arab conquest. Khorasan and Segestan An East Syriac diocese for Abrashahr (Nishapur) evidently existed by the beginning of the 5th century, though it was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410. Three more East Syriac dioceses in Khorasan and Segestan are attested a few years later. The bishops Bar Shaba of Merv, David of Abrashahr, Yazdo√Ø of Herat and Aphrid of Segestan were present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424.Chabot, 285 The uncommon name of the bishop of Merv, Bar Shaba, means 'son of the deportation', suggesting that Merv's Christian community may have been deported from Roman territory. The diocese of Segestan, whose bishop probably sat at Zarang, was disputed during the schism of Narsa√Ø and Elisha ø in the 520s. The patriarch Aba I resolved the dispute in 544 by temporarily dividing the diocese, assigning Zarang, Farah and Qash to the bishop Yazdaphrid and Bist and Rukut to the bishop Sargis. He ordered that the diocese should be reunited as soon as one of these bishops died.Chabot, 339-45 The Christian population of the Merv region seems to have increased during the 6th century, as the bishop of Merv was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Joseph in 554 and Herat also became a metropolitan diocese shortly afterwards. The first known metropolitan of Herat was present at the synod of Isho øyahb I in 585. The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more Christian centres during the late 5th and 6th century. By the end of the 5th century the diocese of Abrashahr (Nishapur) also included the city of Tus, whose name featured in 497 in the title of the bishop Yohannis of 'Tus and Abrashahr'. Four more dioceses seem also to have been created in the 6th century. The bishops Yohannan of 'Abiward and Shahr Peroz' and Theodore of Merw-i Rud accepted the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554, the latter by letter, while the bishops Habib of Pusang and Gabriel of 'Badisi and Qadistan' adhered by proxy to the decisions of the synod of Isho øyahb I in 585, sending deacons to represent them.Chabot, 366 and 423 None of these four dioceses is mentioned again, and it is not clear when they lapsed. Media By the end of the 5th century there were at least three East Syriac dioceses in the Sassanian province of Media in western Iran. Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410 foreshadowed the extension of the metropolitan principle to the bishops of Beth Madaye and other relatively remote regions. Hamadan (ancient Ecbatana) was the chief city of Media, and the Syriac name Beth Madaye (Media) was regularly used to refer to the East Syriac diocese of Hamadan as well as to the region as a whole. Although no East Syriac bishops of Beth Madaye are attested before 457, this reference probably indicates that the diocese of Hamadan was already in existence in 410. Bishops of Beth Madaye were present at most of the synods held between 486 and 605.Chabot, 306, 316, 366 and 479 Two other dioceses in western Iran, Beth Lashpar (Hulwan) and Masabadan, seem also to have been established in the 5th century. A bishop of 'the deportation of Beth Lashpar' was present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424, and bishops of Beth Lashpar also attended the later synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.Chabot, 285, 287, 307, 315, 366, 368, 423 and 479 Bishops of the nearby locality of Masabadan were present at the synod of Joseph in 554 and the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 366 and 368 Rai and Tabaristan In Tabaristan (northern Iran), the diocese of Rai (Beth Raziqaye) is first mentioned in 410, and seems to have had a fairly uninterrupted succession of bishops for the next six and a half centuries. Bishops of Rai are first attested in 424 and last mentioned towards the end of the 11th century.Fiey, M√©die chr√©tienne, 378‚Äì82; POCN, 124 An East Syriac diocese was established in the Sassanian province of Gurgan (Hyrcania) to the southeast of the Caspian Sea in the 5th century for a community of Christians deported from Roman territory.Fiey, POCN, 85‚Äì6 The bishop Domitian 'of the deportation of Gurgan', evidently from his name a Roman, was present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424, and three other 5th- and 6th-century bishops of Gurgan attended the later synods, the last of whom, Za øura, was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 285, 315, 328 and 368 The bishops of Gurgan probably sat in the provincial capital Astarabad.Fiey, POCN, 85‚Äì6 Adarbaigan and Gilan Bishops of the diocese of 'Adarbaigan' were present at most of the synods between 486 and 605. The diocese of Adarbaigan appears to have covered the territory included within the Sassanian province of Atropatene. It was bounded on the west by the Salmas and Urmi plains to the west of Lake Urmi and to the south by the diocese of Salakh in the province of Adiabene. Its centre seems to have been the town of Ganzak. The diocese of Adarbaigan was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410, and may have remained independent throughout the Sassanian period. By the end of the 8th century, however, Adarbaigan was a suffragan diocese in the province of Adiabene.Fiey, POCN, 81‚Äì2 An East Syriac diocese for Paidangaran (modern Baylaqan) is attested during the 6th century, but only two of its bishops are known.Fiey, POCN, 119 The bishop Yohannan of Paidangaran, first mentioned in 540, adhered to the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544.Chabot, 328 and 344‚Äì5 The bishop Ya øqob of Paidangaran was present at the synod of Joseph in 544.Chabot, 366 The bishop Surin of 'Amol and Gilan' was present at the synod of Joseph in 554.Fiey, POCN, 82‚Äì3 Umayyad and Abbasid periods The mission field of the Church of the East, c. 800 A good starting point for a discussion of the diocesan organisation of the Church of the East after the Arab conquest is a list of fifteen contemporary East Syriac 'eparchies' or ecclesiastical provinces compiled in 893 by the metropolitan Eliya of Damascus. The list (in Arabic) included the province of the patriarch and fourteen metropolitan provinces: Jundishabur (Beth Huzaye), Nisibin (Nisibis), al-Basra (Maishan), al-Mawsil (Mosul), Bajarmi (Beth Garma√Ø), al-Sham (Damascus), al-Ray (Rai), Hara (Herat), Maru (Merv), Armenia, Qand (Samarqand), Fars, Barda øa and Hulwan. An important source for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East in the 12th century is a collection of canons, attributed to the patriarch Eliya III (1176‚Äì90), for the consecration of bishops, metropolitans and patriarchs. Included in the canons is what appears to be a contemporary list of twenty-five East Syriac dioceses, in the following order: (a) Nisibis; (b) Mardin; (c) Amid and Maiperqat; (d) Singara; (e) Beth Zabda√Ø; (f) Erbil; (g) Beth Waziq; (h) Athor [Mosul]; (i) Balad; (j) Marga; (k) Kfar Zamre; (l) Fars and Kirman; (m) Hindaye and Qatraye (India and northern Arabia); (n) Arzun and Beth Dlish (Bidlis); (o) Hamadan; (p) Halah; (q) Urmi; (r) Halat, Van and Wastan; (s) Najran; (t) Kashkar; (u) Shenna d'Beth Ramman; (v) Nevaketh; (w) Soqotra; (x) Pushtadar; and (y) the Islands of the Sea.MS Cambridge Add. 1988 There are some obvious omissions from this list, notably a number of dioceses in the province of Mosul, but it is probably legitimate to conclude that all the dioceses mentioned in the list were still in existence in the last quarter of the 12th century. If so, the list has some interesting surprises, such as the survival of dioceses for Fars and Kirman and for Najran at this late date. The mention of the diocese of Kfar Zamre near Balad, attested only once before, in 790, is another surprise, as is the mention of a diocese for Pushtadar in Persia. However, there is no need to doubt the authenticity of the list. Its mention of dioceses for Nevaketh and the Islands of the Sea have a convincing topicality. =Interior provinces= Province of the Patriarch Ecclesiastical provinces of the Church of the East in the 10th century According to Eliya of Damascus, there were thirteen dioceses in the province of the patriarch in 893: Kashkar, al-Tirhan, Dair Hazql (an alternative name for al-Nu ømaniya, the chief town in the diocese of Zabe), al- Hira (Hirta), al-Anbar (Piroz Shabur), al-Sin (Shenna d‚ÄôBeth Ramman),  øUkbara, al-Radhan, Nifr, al-Qasra, 'Ba Daraya and Ba Kusaya' (Beth Daraye),  øAbdasi (Nahargur), and al-Buwazikh (Konishabur or Beth Waziq). Eight of these dioceses already existed in the Sassanian period, but the diocese of Beth Waziq is first mentioned in the second half of the 7th century, and the dioceses of  øUkbara, al-Radhan, Nifr, and al-Qasra were probably founded in the 9th century. The first bishop of  øUkbara whose name has been recorded, Hakima, was consecrated by the patriarch Sargis around 870, and bishops of al- Qasra, al-Radhan and Nifr are first mentioned in the 10th century. A bishop of 'al-Qasr and Nahrawan' became patriarch in 963, and then consecrated bishops for al-Radhan and for 'Nifr and al-Nil'. Eliya's list helps to confirm the impression given by the literary sources, that the East Syriac communities in Beth Aramaye were at their most prosperous in the 10th century. A partial list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900 included several bishops from the province of the patriarch, including the bishops of Zabe and Beth Daraye and also the bishops Isho øzkha of 'the Gubeans', Hnanisho ø of Delasar, Quriaqos of Meskene and Yohannan 'of the Jews'. The last four dioceses are not mentioned elsewhere and cannot be satisfactorily localised. In the 11th century decline began to set in. The diocese of Hirta (al-Hira) came to an end, and four other dioceses were combined into two: Nifr and al-Nil with Zabe (al-Zawabi and al-Nu ømaniya), and Beth Waziq (al-Buwazikh) with Shenna d'Beth Ramman (al-Sin). Three more dioceses ceased to exist in the 12th century. The dioceses of Piroz Shabur (al-Anbar) and Qasr and Nahrawan are last mentioned in 1111, and the senior diocese of Kashkar in 1176. By the patriarchal election of 1222 the guardianship of the vacant patriarchal throne, the traditional privilege of the bishop of Kashkar, had passed to the metropolitans of  øIlam. The trend of decline continued in the 13th century. The diocese of Zabe and Nil is last mentioned during the reign of Yahballaha II (1190‚Äì1222), and the diocese of  øUkbara in 1222. Only three dioceses are known to have been still in existence at the end of the 13th century: Beth Waziq and Shenna, Beth Daron (Ba Daron), and (perhaps due to its sheltered position between the Tigris and the Jabal Hamrin) Tirhan. However, East Syriac communities may also have persisted in districts which no longer had bishops: a manuscript of 1276 was copied by a monk named Giwargis at the monastery of Mar Yonan 'on the Euphrates, near Piroz Shabur which is Anbar', nearly a century and a half after the last mention of a bishop of Anbar.MS Harvard Syr 27 Province of Elam Of the seven suffragan dioceses attested in the province of Beth Huzaye in 576, only four were still in existence at the end of the 9th century. The diocese of Ram Hormizd seems to have lapsed, and the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan and Mihrganqadaq had been combined with the dioceses of Susa and Ispahan respectively. In 893 Eliya of Damascus listed four suffragan dioceses in the 'eparchy of Jundishapur', in the following order: Karkh Ladan and al-Sus (Susa and Karha d'Ledan), al-Ahwaz (Hormizd Ardashir), Tesr (Shushter) and Mihrganqadaq (Ispahan and Mihraganqadaq). It is doubtful whether any of these dioceses survived into the 14th century. The diocese of Shushter is last mentioned in 1007/8, Hormizd Ardashir in 1012, Ispahan in 1111 and Susa in 1281. Only the metropolitan diocese of Jundishapur certainly survived into the 14th century, and with additional prestige.  øIlam had for centuries ranked first among the metropolitan provinces of the Church of the East, and its metropolitan enjoyed the privilege of consecrating a new patriarch and sitting on his right hand at synods. By 1222, in consequence of the demise of the diocese of Kashkar in the province of the patriarch, he had also acquired the privilege of guarding the vacant patriarchal throne. The East Syriac author  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis, writing around the end of the 13th century, mentions the bishop Gabriel of Shahpur Khwast (modern Hurremabad), who perhaps flourished during the 10th century. From its geographical location, Shahpur Khwast might have been a diocese in the province of  øIlam, but it is not mentioned in any other source.Fiey, POCN, 131 Province of Nisibis The metropolitan province of Nisibis had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods, including the dioceses of Arzun, Beth Rahima√Ø, Beth Qardu (later renamed Tamanon), Beth Zabda√Ø, Qube d‚ÄôArzun, Balad, Shigar (Sinjar), Armenia, Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), Maiperqat (with Amid and Mardin), Resh øa√Øna, and Qarta and Adarma. Probably during the Ummayad period, the East Syriac diocese of Armenia was attached to the province of Nisibis. The bishop Artashahr of Armenia was present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424, but the diocese was not assigned to a metropolitan province. In the late 13th century Armenia was certainly a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis, and its dependency probably went back to the 7th or 8th century. The bishops of Armenia appear to have sat at the town of Halat (Ahlat) on the northern shore of Lake Van. The Arab conquest allowed the East Syriacs to move into western Mesopotamia and establish communities in Damascus and other towns that had formerly been in Roman territory, where they lived alongside much larger Syrian Orthodox, Armenian and Melkite communities. Some of these western communities were placed under the jurisdiction of the East Syriac metropolitans of Damascus, but others were attached to the province of Nisibis. The latter included a diocese for Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), first attested in the 8th century and last mentioned towards the end of the 11th century, and a diocese at Maiperqat, first mentioned at the end of the 11th century, whose bishops were also responsible for the East Syriac communities in Amid and Mardin.Fiey, POCN, 49‚Äì50 and 88 Lists of dioceses in the province of Nisibis during the 11th and 13th centuries also mention a diocese for the Syrian town of Resh øa√Øna (Ra øs al-Ain). Resh øa√Øna is a plausible location for an East Syriac diocese at this period, but none of its bishops are known.Fiey, POCN, 124 Province of Maishan The province of Maishan seems to have come to an end in the 13th century. The metropolitan diocese of Prath d‚ÄôMaishan is last mentioned in 1222, and the suffragan dioceses of Nahargur ( øAbdasi), Karka d'Maishan (Dastumisan), and Rima (Nahr al-Dayr) probably ceased to exist rather earlier. The diocese of Nahargur is last mentioned at the end of the 9th century, in the list of Eliya of Damascus. The last-known bishop of Karka d'Maishan, Abraham, was present at the synod held by the patriarch Yohannan IV shortly after his election in 900, and an unnamed bishop of Rima attended the consecration of Eliya I in Baghdad in 1028.Fiey, AC, iii. 272‚Äì82 Provinces of Mosul and Erbil Erbil, the chief town of Adiabene, lost much of its former importance with the growth of the city of Mosul, and during the reign of the patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823) the seat of the metropolitans of Adiabene was moved to Mosul. The dioceses of Adiabene were governed by a 'metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil' for the next four and a half centuries. Around 1200, Mosul and Erbil became separate metropolitan provinces. The last known metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil was Tittos, who was appointed by Eliya III (1175‚Äì89). Thereafter separate metropolitan bishops for Mosul and for Erbil are recorded in a fairly complete series from 1210 to 1318. Five new dioceses in the province of Mosul and Erbil were established during the Ummayad and  øAbbasid periods: Marga, Salakh, Haditha, Taimana and Hebton. The dioceses of Marga and Salakh, covering the districts around  øAmadiya and  øAqra, are first mentioned in the 8th century but may have been created earlier, perhaps in response to West Syrian competition in the Mosul region in the 7th century. The diocese of Marga persisted into the 14th century, but the diocese of Salakh is last mentioned in the 9th century. By the 8th century there was also an East Syriac diocese for the town of Hdatta (Haditha) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century. The diocese of Taimana, which embraced the district south of the Tigris in the vicinity of Mosul and included the monastery of Mar Mikha'il, is attested between the 8th and 10th centuries, but does not seem to have persisted into the 13th century.Fiey, AC, ii. 336‚Äì7; and POCN, 137 A number of East Syriac bishops are attested between the 8th and 13th centuries for the diocese of Hebton, a region of northwest Adiabene to the south of the Great Zab, adjacent to the district of Marga. It is not clear when the diocese was created, but it is first mentioned under the name 'Hnitha and Hebton' in 790. Hnitha was another name for the diocese of Ma øaltha, and the patriarch Timothy I is said to have united the dioceses of Hebton and ·∏§nitha in order to punish the presumption of the bishop Rustam of Hnitha, who had opposed his election. The union was not permanent, and by the 11th century Hebton and Ma øaltha were again separate dioceses. By the middle of the 8th century the diocese of Adarbaigan, formerly independent, was a suffragan diocese of the province of Adiabene.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 315‚Äì16 Province of Beth Garma√Ø In its heyday, at the end of the 6th century, there were at least nine dioceses in the province of Beth Garma√Ø. As in Beth Aramaye, the Christian population of Beth Garma√Ø began to fall in the first centuries of Moslem rule, and the province's decline is reflected in the forced relocation of the metropolis from Karka d'Beth Slokh (Kirkuk) in the 9th century and the gradual disappearance of all of the province's suffragan dioceses between the 7th and 12th centuries. The dioceses of Hrbath Glal and Barhis are last mentioned in 605; Mahoze d‚ÄôArewan around 650; Karka d‚ÄôBeth Slokh around 830; Khanijar in 893; Lashom around 895; Tahal around 900; Shahrgard in 1019; and Shahrzur around 1134. By the beginning of the 14th century the metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø, who now sat at Daquqa, was the only remaining bishop in this once-flourishing province. =Exterior provinces=  Fars and Arabia  At the beginning of the 7th century there were several dioceses in the province of Fars and its dependencies in northern Arabia (Beth Qatraye). Fars was marked out by its Arab conquerors for a thoroughgoing process of islamicisation, and Christianity declined more rapidly in this region than in any other part of the former Sassanian empire. The last-known bishop of the metropolitan see of Rev Ardashir was  øAbdisho ø, who was present at the enthronement of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø III in 1138. In 890 Eliya of Damascus listed the suffragan sees of Fars, in order of seniority, as Shiraz, Istakhr, Shapur (probably to be identified with Bih Shapur, i.e. Kazrun), Karman, Darabgard, Shiraf (Ardashir Khurrah), Marmadit, and the island of Soqotra. Only two bishops are known from the mainland dioceses: Melek of Darabgard, who was deposed in the 560s, and Gabriel of Bih Shapur, who was present at the enthronement of  øAbdisho ø I in 963. Fars was spared by the Mongols for its timely submission in the 1220s, but by then there seem to have been few Christians left, although an East Syriac community (probably without bishops) survived at Hormuz. This community is last mentioned in the 16th century. Of the northern Arabian dioceses, Mashmahig is last mentioned around 650, and Dairin, Oman (Beth Mazunaye), Hajar and Hatta in 676. Soqotra remained an isolated outpost of Christianity in the Arabian sea, and its bishop attended the enthronement of the patriarch Yahballaha III in 1281. Marco Polo visited the island in the 1280s, and claimed that it had an East Syriac archbishop, with a suffragan bishop on the nearby 'Island of Males'. In a casual testimony to the impressive geographical extension of the Church of the East in the  øAbbasid period, Thomas of Marga mentions that Yemen and Sana øa had a bishop named Peter during the reign of the patriarch Abraham II (837‚Äì50) who had earlier served in China. This diocese is not mentioned again. Khorasan and Segestan Timothy I consecrated a metropolitan named Hnanisho ø for Sarbaz in the 790s. This diocese is not mentioned again. In 893 Eliya of Damascus recorded that the metropolitan province of Merv had suffragan sees at 'Dair Hans', 'Damadut', and 'Da øbar Sanai', three districts whose locations are entirely unknown. By the 11th century East Syriac Christianity was in decline in Khorasan and Segestan. The last-known metropolitan of Merv was  øAbdisho ø, who was consecrated by the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì1000). The last-known metropolitan of Herat was Giwargis, who flourished in the reign of Sabrisho ø III (1064‚Äì72). If any of the suffragan dioceses were still in existence at this period, they are not mentioned. The surviving urban Christian communities in Khorasan suffered a heavy blow at the start of the 13th century, when the cities of Merv, Nishapur and Herat were stormed by Genghis Khan in 1220. Their inhabitants were massacred, and although all three cities were refounded shortly afterwards, it is likely that they had only small East Syriac communities thereafter. Nevertheless, at least one diocese survived into the 13th century. In 1279 an unnamed bishop of Tus entertained the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos in the monastery of Mar Sehyon near Tus during their pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem. Media In 893 Eliya of Damascus listed Hulwan as a metropolitan province, with suffragan dioceses for Dinawar (al-Dinur), Hamadan, Nihawand and al-Kuj. 'Al-Kuj' cannot be readily localised, and has been tentatively identified with Karaj d'Abu Dulaf.Fiey, POCN, 99 Little is known about these suffragan dioceses, except for isolated references to bishops of Dinawar and Nihawand, and by the end of the 12th century Hulwan and Hamadan were probably the only surviving centres of East Syriac Christianity in Media. Around the beginning of the 13th century the metropolitan see of Hulwan was transferred to Hamadan, in consequence of the decline in Hulwan's importance. The last-known bishop of Hulwan and Hamadan, Yohannan, flourished during the reign of Eliya III (1176‚Äì90). Hamadan was sacked in 1220, and during the reign of Yahballaha III was also on more than one occasion the scene of anti-Christian riots. It is possible that its Christian population at the end of the 13th century was small indeed, and it is not known whether it was still the seat of a metropolitan bishop. Rai and Tabaristan The diocese of Rai was raised to metropolitan status in 790 by the patriarch Timothy I. According to Eliya of Damascus, Gurgan was a suffragan diocese of the province of Rai in 893. It is doubtful whether either diocese still existed at the end of the 13th century. The last-known bishop of Rai, Abd al- Masih, was present at the consecration of Abdisho II in 1075 as 'metropolitan of Hulwan and Rai', suggesting that the episcopal seat of the bishops of Rai had been transferred to Hulwan. According to the Mukhtasar of 1007/08, the diocese of 'Gurgan, Bilad al-Jibal and Dailam' had been suppressed, 'owing to the disappearance of Christianity in the region'.Fiey POCN, 86 Little Armenia The Arran or Little Armenia district in modern Azerbaijan, with its chief town Barda øa, was an East Syriac metropolitan province in the 10th and 11th centuries, and represented the northernmost extension of the Church of the East.Fiey, POCN, 58‚Äì9 A manuscript note of 1137 mentions that the diocese of Barda øa and Armenia no longer existed, and that the responsibilities of its metropolitans had been undertaken by the bishop of Halat. Dailam, Gilan and Muqan A major missionary drive was undertaken by the Church of the East in Dailam and Gilan towards the end of the 8th century on the initiative of the patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823), led by three metropolitans and several suffragan bishops from the monastery of Beth  øAbe. Thomas of Marga, who gave a detailed account of this mission in the Book of Governors, preserved the names of the East Syriac bishops sent to Dailam: > Mar Qardagh, Mar Shubhalisho ø and Mar Yahballaha were elected metropolitans > of Gilan and of Dailam; and Thomas of Hdod, Zakkai of Beth Mule, Shem Bar > Arlaye, Ephrem, Shem øon, Hnanya and David, who went with them from this > monastery, were elected and consecrated bishops of those countries.Wallis > Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 447‚Äì8 The metropolitan province of Dailam and Gilan created by Timothy I was transitory. Moslem missionaries began to convert the Dailam region to Islam in the 9th century, and by the beginning of the 11th century the East Syriac diocese of Dailam, by then united with Gurgan as a suffragan diocese of Rai, no longer existed.Fiey, POCN, 82‚Äì3 Timothy I also consecrated a bishop named Eliya for the Caspian district of Muqan, a diocese not mentioned elsewhere and probably also short-lived.Fiey, POCN, 113 Turkestan In Central Asia, the patriarch Sliba-zkha (714‚Äì28) created a metropolitan province for Samarqand, and a metropolitan of Samarqand is attested in 1018.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography (ed. Brooks), i. 35 Samarqand surrendered to Genghis Khan in 1220, and although many of its citizens were killed, the city was not destroyed. Marco Polo mentions an East Syriac community in Samarqand in the 1270s. Timothy I (780‚Äì823) consecrated a metropolitan for Beth Turkaye, 'the country of the Turks'. Beth Turkaye has been distinguished from Samarqand by the French scholar Dauvillier, who noted that Amr listed the two provinces separately, but may well have been another name for the same province. Eliya III (1176‚Äì90) created a metropolitan province for Kashgar and Nevaketh.Dauvillier, Provinces chald√©ennes, 283‚Äì91; Fiey, POCN, 128 India India, which boasted a substantion East Syriac community at least as early as the 3rd century (the Saint Thomas Christians), became a metropolitan province of the Church of the East in the 7th century. Although few references to its clergy have survived, the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1301 in the church of Mar Quriaqos in Cranganore mentions the metropolitan Yaqob of India. The metropolitan seat for India at this period was probably Cranganore, described in this manuscript as 'the royal city', and the main strength of the East Syriac church in India was along the Malabar Coast, where it was when the Portuguese arrived in India at the beginning of the 16th century. There were also East Syriac communities on the east coast, around Madras and the shrine of Saint Thomas at Meliapur. Islands of the Sea An East Syrian metropolitan province in the \\"Islands of the Sea\\" existed at some point between the 11th and 14th centuries; this may be a reference to the East Indies. The patriarch Sabrisho III (1064‚Äì72) despatched the metropolitan Hnanisho of Jerusalem on a visitation to 'the Islands of the Sea'.Mari, 125 (Arabic), 110 (Latin) These 'Islands of the Sea' may well have been the East Indies, as a list of metropolitan provinces compiled by the East Syriac writer Abdisho of Nisibis at the beginning of the 14th century includes the province 'of the Islands of the Sea between Dabag, Sin and Masin'. Sin and Masin appear to refer to northern and southern China respectively, and Dabag to Java, implying that the province covered at least some of the islands of the East Indies. The memory of this province persisted into the 16th century. In 1503 the patriarch Eliya V, in response to the request of a delegation from the East Syriac Christians of Malabar, also consecrated a number of bishops 'for India and the Islands of the Sea between Dabag, Sin and Masin'.Dauvillier, Provinces chald√©ennes, 314‚Äì16 China and Tibet The headpiece of the Nestorian Stele, erected in 781: 'The tablet of the spread of the brilliant teaching of Ta-ch'in [Syria] in China' The Church of the East is perhaps best known nowadays for its missionary work in China during the Tang Dynasty. The first recorded Christian mission to China was led by a Nestorian Christian with the Chinese name Alopen, who arrived in the Chinese capital Chang'an in 635.Moule, Christians in China before the Year 1550, 38 In 781 a tablet (commonly known as the Nestorian Stele) was erected in the grounds of a Christian monastery in the Chinese capital Chang'an by the city's Christian community, displaying a long inscription in Chinese with occasional glosses in Syriac. The inscription described the eventful progress of the Nestorian mission in China since Alopen's arrival. China became a metropolitan province of the Church of the East, under the name Beth Sinaye, in the first quarter of the 8th century. According to the 14th-century writer  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis, the province was established by the patriarch Sliba-zkha (714‚Äì28).Mai, Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio, x. 141 Arguing from its position in the list of exterior provinces, which implied an 8th-century foundation, and on grounds of general historical probability,  øAbdisho ø refuted alternative claims that the province of Beth Sinaye had been founded either by the 5th- century patriarch Ahha (410‚Äì14) or the 6th-century patriarch Shila (503‚Äì23).Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 123‚Äì4 The Nestorian Stele inscription was composed in 781 by Adam, 'priest, bishop and papash of Sinistan', probably the metropolitan of Beth Sinaye, and the inscription also mentions the archdeacons Gigoi of Khumdan [Chang'an] and Gabriel of Sarag [Lo- yang]; Yazdbuzid, 'priest and country-bishop of Khumdan'; Sargis, 'priest and country-bishop'; and the bishop Yohannan. These references confirm that the Church of the East in China had a well-developed hierarchy at the end of the 8th century, with bishops in both northern capitals, and there were probably other dioceses besides Chang'an and Lo-yang. Shortly afterwards Thomas of Marga mentions the monk David of Beth  øAbe, who was metropolitan of Beth Sinaye during the reign of Timothy I (780‚Äì823). Timothy I is said also to have consecrated a metropolitan for Tibet (Beth Tuptaye), a province not again mentioned. The province of Beth Sinaye is last mentioned in 987 by the Arab writer Abu'l Faraj, who met a Nestorian monk who had recently returned from China, who informed him that 'Christianity was just extinct in China; the native Christians had perished in one way or another; the church which they had used had been destroyed; and there was only one Christian left in the land'.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 222 Syria, Palestine, Cilicia and Egypt Although the main East Syriac missionary impetus was eastwards, the Arab conquests paved the way for the establishment of East Syriac communities to the west of the Church's northern Mesopotamian heartland, in Syria, Palestine, Cilicia and Egypt. Damascus became the seat of an East Syriac metropolitan around the end of the 8th century, and the province had five suffragan dioceses in 893: Aleppo, Jerusalem, Mambeg, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus and Malatya. According to Thomas of Marga, the diocese of Damascus was established in the 7th century as a suffragan diocese in the province of Nisibis. The earliest known bishop of Damascus, Yohannan, is attested in 630. His title was 'bishop of the scattered of Damascus', presumably a population of East Syriac refugees displaced by the Roman-Persian Wars. Damascus was raised to metropolitan status by the patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823). In 790 the bishop Shallita of Damascus was still a suffragan bishop.Chabot, 608. Some time after 790 Timothy consecrated the future patriarch Sabrisho II (831‚Äì5) as the city's first metropolitan.Mari, 76 (Arabic), 67‚Äì8 (Latin) Several metropolitans of Damascus are attested between the 9th and 11th centuries, including Eliya ibn  øUbaid, who was consecrated in 893 by the patriarch Yohannan III and bore the title 'metropolitan of Damascus, Jerusalem and the Shore (probably a reference to the East Syriac communities in Cilicia)'.Sliba, 80 (Arabic) The last known metropolitan of Damascus, Marqos, was consecrated during the reign of the patriarch Abdisho II (1074‚Äì90).Fiey, POCN, 72 It is not clear whether the diocese of Damascus survived into the 12th century. Although little is known about its episcopal succession, the East Syriac diocese of Jerusalem seems to have remained a suffragan diocese in the province of Damascus throughout the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries.Fiey, POCN, 97‚Äì8 The earliest known bishop of Jerusalem was Eliya Ibn Ubaid, who was appointed metropolitan of Damascus in 893 by the patriarch Yohannan III. Nearly two centuries later a bishop named Hnanisho was consecrated for Jerusalem by the patriarch Sabrisho III (1064‚Äì72). Little is known about the diocese of Aleppo, and even less about the dioceses of Mambeg, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus and Malatya. The literary sources have preserved the name of only one bishop from these regions, Ibn Tubah, who was consecrated for Aleppo by the patriarch Sabrisho III in 1064. A number of East Syriac bishops of Egypt are attested between the 8th and 11th centuries. The earliest known bishop, Yohannan, is attested around the beginning of the 8th century. His successors included Sulaiman, consecrated in error by the patriarch Abdisho I (983‚Äì6) and recalled when it was discovered that the diocese already had a bishop; Joseph al-Shirazi, injured during a riot in 996 in which Christian churches in Egypt were attacked; Yohannan of Haditha, consecrated by the patriarch Sabrisho III in 1064; and Marqos, present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha I in 1092. It is doubtful whether the East Syriac diocese of Egypt survived into the 13th century.Meinardus, 116‚Äì21; Fiey, POCN, 78 Mongol period At the end of the 13th century the Church of the East still extended across Asia to China. Twenty-two bishops were present at the consecration of Yahballaha III in 1281, and while most of them were from the dioceses of northern Mesopotamia, the metropolitans of Jerusalem, Ilam, and Tangut (northwest China), and the bishops of Susa and the island of Soqotra were also present. During their journey from China to Baghdad in 1279, Yahballaha and Bar Sawma were offered hospitality by an unnamed bishop of Tus in northeastern Persia, confirming that there was still a Christian community in Khorasan, however reduced. India had a metropolitan named Yaqob at the beginning of the 14th century, mentioned together with the patriarch Yahballaha 'the fifth (sic), the Turk' in a colophon of 1301. In the 1320s Yahballaha's biographer praised the progress made by the Church of the East in converting the 'Indians, Chinese and Turks', without suggesting that this achievement was under threat.Wallis Budge, The Monks of Kublai Khan, 122‚Äì3 In 1348 Amr listed twenty-seven metropolitan provinces stretching from Jerusalem to China, and although his list may be anachronistic in several respects, he was surely accurate in portraying a church whose horizons still stretched far beyond Kurdistan. The provincial structure of the church in 1318 was much the same as it had been when it was established in 410 at the synod of Isaac, and many of the 14th-century dioceses had existed, though perhaps under a different name, nine hundred years earlier. =Interior provinces= At the same time, however, significant changes had taken place which were only partially reflected in the organisational structure of the church. Between the 7th and 14th centuries Christianity gradually disappeared in southern and central Iraq (the ecclesiastical provinces of Maishan, Beth Aramaye and Beth Garma√Ø). There were twelve dioceses in the patriarchal province of Beth Aramaye at the beginning of the 11th century, only three of which (Beth Waziq, Beth Daron, and Tirhan, all well to the north of Baghdad) survived into the 14th century.Fiey, AC, iii. 151‚Äì262 There were four dioceses in Maishan (the Basra district) at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (the metropolitan diocese of Prath d‚ÄôMaishan) survived into the 13th century, to be mentioned for the last time in 1222. There were at least nine dioceses in the province of Beth Garma√Ø in the 7th century, only one of which (the metropolitan diocese of Daquqa) survived into the 14th century.Fiey, AC, iii. 54‚Äì146 The disappearance of these dioceses was a slow and apparently peaceful process (which can be traced in some detail in Beth Aramaye, where dioceses were repeatedly amalgamated over a period of two centuries), and it is probable that the consolidation of Islam in these districts was accompanied by a gradual migration of East Syriac Christians to northern Iraq, whose Christian population was larger and more deeply rooted, not only in the towns but in hundreds of long-established Christian villages. By the end of the 13th century, although isolated East Syriac outposts persisted to the southeast of the Great Zab, the districts of northern Mesopotamia included in the metropolitan provinces of Mosul and Nisibis were clearly regarded as the heartland of the Church of the East. When the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos (the future patriarch Yahballaha III) arrived in Mesopotamia from China in the late 1270s, they visited several East Syriac monasteries and churches: > They arrived in Baghdad, and from there they went to the great church of > Kokhe, and to the monastery of Mar Mari the apostle, and received a blessing > from the relics of that country. And from there they turned back and came to > the country of Beth Garma√Ø, and they received blessings from the shrine of > Mar Ezekiel, which was full of helps and healings. And from there they went > to Erbil, and from there to Mosul. And they went to Shigar, and Nisibis and > Mardin, and were blessed by the shrine containing the bones of Mar Awgin, > the second Christ. And from there they went to Gazarta d'Beth Zabda√Ø, and > they were blessed by all the shrines and monasteries, and the religious > houses, and the monks, and the fathers in their dioceses.Wallis Budge, The > Monks of Kublai Khan, 142‚Äì3 With the exception of the patriarchal church of Kokhe in Baghdad and the nearby monastery of Mar Mari, all these sites were well to the north of Baghdad, in the districts of northern Mesopotamia where historic East Syriac Christianity survived into the 20th century. A similar pattern is evident several years later. Eleven bishops were present at the consecration of the patriarch Timothy II in 1318: the metropolitans Joseph of Ilam, Abdisho of Nisibis and Shemon of Mosul, and the bishops Shemon of Beth Garma√Ø, Shemon of Tirhan, Shemon of Balad, Yohannan of Beth Waziq, Yohannan of Shigar, Abdisho of Hnitha, Isaac of Beth Daron and Ishoyahb of Tella and Barbelli (Marga). Timothy himself had been metropolitan of Erbil before his election as patriarch. Again, with the exception of Ilam (whose metropolitan, Joseph, was present in his capacity of 'guardian of the throne' (natar kursya) all the dioceses represented were in northern Mesopotamia.Assemani, BO, iii. i. 567‚Äì80 Provinces of Mosul and Erbil At the beginning of the 13th century there were at least eight suffragan dioceses in the provinces of Mosul and Erbil: Haditha, Maaltha, Hebton, Beth Bgash, Dasen, Beth Nuhadra, Marga and Urmi. The diocese of Hebton is last mentioned in 1257, when its bishop Gabriel attended the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha II.Fiey, POCN, 89‚Äì90 The diocese of Dasen definitely persisted into the 14th century, as did the diocese of Marga, though it was renamed Tella and Barbelli in the second half of the 13th century. It is possible that the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Haditha also survived into the 14th century. Haditha, indeed, is mentioned as a diocese at the beginning of the 14th century by Abdisho of Nisibis.Fiey, POCN, 86‚Äì7 Urmi too, although none of its bishops are known, may also have persisted as a diocese into the 16th century, when it again appears as the seat of an East Syriac bishop.Fiey, POCN, 141‚Äì2 The diocese of Maaltha is last mentioned in 1281, but probably persisted into the 14th century under the name Hnitha. The bishop Abdisho 'of Hnitha', attested in 1310 and 1318, was almost certainly a bishop of the diocese formerly known as Maaltha.Fiey, POCN, 91‚Äì2 and 106 Province of Nisibis The celebrated East Syriac writer Abdisho of Nisibis, himself metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia, listed thirteen suffragan dioceses in the province 'of Soba (Nisibis) and Mediterranean Syria' at the end of the 13th century, in the following order: Arzun, Qube, Beth Rahima√Ø, Balad, Shigar, Qardu, Tamanon, Beth Zabda√Ø, Halat, Harran, Amid, Resha√Øna and 'Adormiah' (Qarta and Adarma).Chabot, 619‚Äì20 It has been convincingly argued that Abdisho was giving a conspectus of dioceses in the province of Nisibis at various periods in its history rather than an authentic list of late 13th-century dioceses, and it is most unlikely that dioceses of Qube, Beth Rahima√Ø, Harran and Resha√Øna still existed at this period. A diocese was founded around the middle of the 13th century to the north of the Tur Abdin for the town of Hesna d'Kifa, perhaps in response to East Syriac immigration to the towns of the Tigris plain during the Mongol period. At the same time, a number of older dioceses may have ceased to exist. The dioceses of Qaimar and Qarta and Adarma are last mentioned towards the end of the 12th century, and the diocese of Tamanon in 1265, and it is not clear whether they persisted into the 14th century. The only dioceses in the province of Nisibis definitely in existence at the end of the 13th century were Armenia (whose bishops sat at Halat on the northern shore of Lake Van), Shigar, Balad, Arzun and Maiperqat. =Exterior provinces=  Arabia, Persia and Central Asia  East Syriac tombstone of 1312 from Issyk Kul, with Uighur inscription By the end of the 13th century Christianity was also declining in the exterior provinces. Between the 7th and 14th centuries Christianity gradually disappeared in Arabia and Persia. There were at least five dioceses in northern Arabia in the 7th century and nine in Fars at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (the isolated island of Soqotra) survived into the 14th century.Fiey, Communaut√©s syriaques, 177‚Äì219 There were perhaps twenty East Syriac dioceses in Media, Tabaristan, Khorasan and Segestan at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (Tus in Khorasan) survived into the 13th century.Fiey, Communaut√©s syriaques, 75‚Äì104 and 357‚Äì84 The East Syriac communities in Central Asia disappeared during the 14th century. Continual warfare eventually made it impossible for the Church of the East to send bishops to minister to its far-flung congregations. The blame for the destruction of the Christian communities east of Iraq has often been thrown upon the Turco-Mongol leader Timur, whose campaigns during the 1390s spread havoc throughout Persia and Central Asia. There is no reason to doubt that Timur was responsible for the destruction of certain Christian communities, but in much of central Asia Christianity had died out decades earlier. The surviving evidence, including a large number of dated graves, indicates that the crisis for the Church of the East occurred in the 1340s rather than the 1390s. Few Christian graves have been found later than the 1340s, indicating that the isolated East Syriac communities in Central Asia, weakened by warfare, plague and lack of leadership, converted to Islam around the middle of the 14th century. Adarbaigan Although the Church of the East was losing ground to Islam in Iran and Central Asia, it was making gains elsewhere. The migration of Christians from southern Mesopotamia led to a revival of Christianity in the province of Adarbaigan, where Christians could practice their religion freely under Mongol protection. An East Syriac diocese is mentioned as early as 1074 at Urmi, and three others were created before the end of the 13th century, one a new metropolitan see for the province of Adarbaigan (possibly replacing the old metropolitan province of Arran, and with its seat at Tabriz), and three others for Eshnuq, Salmas and al-Rustaq (probably to be identified with the Shemsdin district of Hakkari).Fiey, POCN, 126, 127 and 142‚Äì3 The metropolitan of Adarbaigan was present at the consecration of the patriarch Denha I in 1265, while bishops of Eshnuq, Salmas and al-Rustaq attended the consecration of Yahballaha III in 1281. The foundation of these four dioceses probably reflected a migration of East Syriac Christians to the shores of Lake Urmi after the lakeside towns became Mongol cantonments in the 1240s. According to the Armenian historian Kirakos of Gandzak, the Mongol occupation of Adarbaigan enabled churches to be built in Tabriz and Nakichevan for the first time in those cities‚Äô history. Substantial Christian communities are attested in both towns at the end of the 13th century, and also in Maragha, Hamadan and Sultaniyyeh. China Hulagu and his Christian queen Doquz Khatun There were also temporary Christian gains further afield. The Mongol conquest of China in the second half of the 13th century allowed the East Syriac church to return to China, and by the end of the century two new metropolitan provinces had been created for China, Tangut and 'Katai and Ong'.Fiey, POCN, 48‚Äì9, 103‚Äì4 and 137‚Äì8 The province of Tangut covered northwestern China, and its metropolitan seems to have sat at Almaliq. The province evidently had several dioceses, even though they cannot now be localised, as the metropolitan Shemon Bar Qaligh of Tangut was arrested by the patriarch Denha I shortly before his death in 1281 'together with a number of his bishops'.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle, ii. 450 The province of Katai [Cathay] and Ong, which seems to have replaced the old T'ang dynasty province of Beth Sinaye, covered northern China and the country of the Christian Ongut tribe around the great bend of the Yellow River. The metropolitans of Katai and Ong probably sat at the Mongol capital Khanbaliq. The patriarch Yahballaha III grew up in a monastery in northern China in the 1270s, and the metropolitans Giwargis and Nestoris are mentioned in his biography.Wallis Budge, The Monks of Kublai Khan, 127 and 132 Yahballaha himself was consecrated metropolitan of Katai and Ong by the patriarch Denha I shortly before his death in 1281.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle, ii. 452 During the first half of the 14th century there were East Syriac Christian communities in many cities in China, and the province of Katai and Ong probably had several suffragan dioceses. In 1253 William of Rubruck mentioned a Nestorian bishop in the town of 'Segin' (Xijing, modern Datong in Shanxi province). The tomb of a Nestorian bishop named Shlemun, who died in 1313, has recently been discovered at Quanzhou in Fujian province. Shlemun's epitaph described him as 'administrator of the Christians and Manicheans of Manzi (south China)'. Marco Polo had earlier reported the existence of a Manichean community in Fujian, at first thought to be Christian, and it is not surprising to find this small religious minority represented officially by a Christian bishop.Lieu, S., Manichaeism in Central Asia and China, 180 The 14th-century Nestorian communities in China existed under Mongol protection, and were dispersed when the Mongol Yuan dynasty was overthrown in 1368. Palestine and Cyprus There were East Syriac communities at Antioch, Tripolis and Acre in the 1240s. The metropolitan Abraham 'of Jerusalem and Tripolis' was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yaballaha III in 1281.Sliba, 124 (Arabic) Abraham probably sat in the coastal city of Tripolis (still in Crusader hands until 1289) rather than Jerusalem, which had fallen definitively to the Mameluks in 1241. The Crusader stronghold of Acre, the last city in the Holy Land under Christian control, fell to the Mameluks in 1291. Most of the city's Christians, unwilling to live under Moslem rule, abandoned their homes and resettled in Christian Cyprus. Cyprus had an East Syriac bishop in 1445, Timothy, who made a Catholic profession of faith at the Council of Florence, and was probably already the seat of an East Syriac bishop or metropolitan by the end of the 13th century.

Status In 1932 William Harry Evans reported that the species was common. Description The barrow-banded satyr is 55 to 68 mm in wingspan. The barrow-banded satyrs are large powerfully built Himalayan butterflies which are black or very dark brown above. They are characterised by a white discal band across both wings. The hindwing band is narrow and even in width. The white discal spots in 1 to 4 along the inner edge of the forewing are in line. The wings are rounded with convex termens and have chequered fringes. A dark apical spot or ocellus is present on the forewing. The under hindwing is dark below, with beautiful white variegations not as prominent as the dark background. The tegumen is gradually sloped to the tip. Earlier Aulocera brahminoides was considered a subspecies of A. brahminus. In A. brahminus, the under-forewing apical ocellus is well-defined and prominently pupilled while in A. brahminoides it is less well defined, much smaller and darker. The upper-hindwing discal band to dorsum, which is a characteristic feature in A. brahminus is much curved in the case of A. brahminoides.

From 2009 until 2018, he was a Member of the European Parliament. He is specialized in the field of civil rights, data protection and democracy. Early life and education Albrecht was born in Braunschweig. He studied law in Bremen, Brussels and Berlin and worked for the Walter Hallstein Institute for European Constitutional Law in Berlin. He graduated in information and communications technology law from Leibniz University Hannover and from the University of Oslo. Political career Albrecht was spokesman of the Green Youth in Germany from 2006 to 2008. He joined the German Green Party in 1999 and held various posts at local, regional and federal level. He led working groups and pressed political campaigns especially in the fields of civil liberties, legal affairs and constitutional issues. Albrecht became an anti-nuclear activist very early in his career, prompted by the problems with a nuclear waste storage facility in his home town, and has taken part in demonstrations against the transport of nuclear waste in his region. He later explained that these experiences provoked his commitment to civil liberties and democracy, in particular with regards to new technologies. His commitment to data protection and other issues of civil rights in the digital age have become a defining point in his political career. =Member of the European Parliament, 2009‚Äì2018= In the 2009 elections, Albrecht was elected for the Greens to the European Parliament. He became a member of the LIBE committee and substitute member of the JURI committee (2009‚Äì14) and later on of the IMCO committee (since 2014) in the European Parliament.

In January 2013, Albrecht introduced a bill proposing to create a new agency to enforce a series of measures giving Internet users greater control of their online information. If approved, the proposal would have replaced the Article 29 Working Party, an advisory panel to the European Commission, with a regulator with the power to make decisions for the EU member states and levy fines of up to 2 percent of a company‚Äôs revenue.Kevin J.

It was released in November 2008. An 'epic' western film, it is loosely based on the 1921 novel To the Last Man: A Story of the Pleasant Valley War by Zane Grey. The film revolves around the struggle between two ranches - one with water and one without - in the American West. The film was filmed on location at two ranches - one in Northern California and the other in a remote part of Arizona that is the actual site of the bloodiest feud in American history. The film's production budget was about US$200,000, making To the Last Man the most expensive gay porn produced in 2008. An unusual porn film, in which all but one of the characters are killed, it has earned more awards than any film in the studio's history.

It took over the patrimony of experience gathered by the Italian Royal Airforce on the location since the end of World War I. In the 1920s the centre facilities already included a wind tunnel. Around the DSSE soon a new town developed, Guidonia. In the last years before the outbreak of World War Ii, DSSE grew into a world-known aeronautics testing ground. At the Directorate for Studies and Experiments there were many advanced facilities, such as one of the first wind tunnels, an ultrasonic tunnel, the weightlessness simulator called ‚Äòpneumatic tank for high altitude‚Äô and a centrifugal apparatus to study loss of orientation in space. Many of these tools were used by the Center for Studies and Research in Aeronautical Medicine research and anticipated more advanced technological equipment to be employed later In that field and Space activities at large. in Space Medicine. The more outstanding examples are the flight simulator provided with a cycle-ergonometer, the centrifugal device, the pressurized suit and the airtight cabin: these last two pieces of equipment were used by Mario Pezzi to attain his altitude records in the 1940s. DSSE was meant to become the only State Agency devoted to aeronautics research coordinating private firms too, such as Savoia-Marchetti, Caproni, Fiat, CANT and others, in order to avoid overlapping and attain maximum efficiency. DSSE collected as well foreign data on aeronautic matters and overlooked military and university research. The aim was to become a unique collector of experiences and information such as to promote the Italian Royal Airforce as world leader. That aim was only partly attained especially in airplane engine studies where DSSE myopia hampered the development of high performance power plants.

Raigad District is a district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is located in the Konkan region. The district was renamed after Raigad, the fort which was the former capital of the Maharashtra leader Shivaji, and is located in the interior regions of the district, in dense forests of the district, on a west-facing spur of the Western Ghats of Sahyadri range. The name was changed in the regime of Chief Minister Antule on 1st Jan 1981.‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ó‡§° ‡§ú‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§π‡§æ Early history Kolaba Ports of Ceul, Mahad Chodeganv and Rajpuri in Janjira were probably centres of trade from the earliest historical times (B. C. 225). The trade-in those times must have been through the openings of the Sahyadris by the Bor, Devasthali, Kumbha and Sevtya passes. It is probable that at that time the entire Kolaba coast was ruled by a power which had its sway over both the Konkan and the Deccan and trade in the ports mentioned above shrank from foreign commerce to local traffic when Kolaba became part of Gujarat ruled by a local Chief.For early trade details see Thana Statistical Account XIII, 404 note 3-Also see Stanley's Barbosa p. 69. From the days of the 1st century after Christ, Buddhist caves have been located in Ceul, Pal and Kol near Mahad as well as Kuda near Rajpuri. Along with these historical places, Ghodeganv may also be mentioned as a centre of trade. Ptolemy's Simulla or Timula (A. D. 150) and possibly Pliny's Perimula (A. D. 77) are identical with Cemulla or Ceul. The earliest Hindu reference to this Cemulla (i.e, Ceul) is found in two Kanheri cave inscriptions of the beginning of the 2nd century after Christ.Bombay Gazetteer, XIV, 172, 189. =Local Rulers= Among the twenty- eight inscriptions found at the Kuda Caves so far, five record gifts by connections of Khandapalita, the Mahabhoja,Burgess' Archaeological Survey of Western India, Separate Pamphlet, X.3‚Äì21 the Chief of Mandava, who probably belonged to a local dynasty with its capital at Mandad about a mile north of Kuda. Similarly, an inscription in the Pale Caves contains a reference to a Prince of a Kamboja dynasty as ruling somewhere in Kolaba at about the same time.9, 14, 15, 17. Dr. Burgess' Archaeological Survey, X 2. It is not certain whether these local dynasties were independent or subordinate to the Satavahanas, who at this time had their capital at Paithan near Ahmadnagar and at Kolhapur. =Kshatrapas= The Kusana emperor Kaniska I extended his power over Central and Western India at about the end of the 1st century A. D. Ksaharata Bhumaka is the earlier known Ksatrapa who was put in charge of the south-western part of the empire of the Kusanas of Kaniska's house. This Ksatrapa Bhumaka was succeeded by Nahapana who flourished about the period 60 CE. Jain Works are unanimous in that Nahapana ruled Ujjain for 40 years while the inscriptions made by Ushavadata evince that Nahapana ruled for 46 years. Thus, Nahapana must have captured Ujjain in his 6th regnal year. Periplus of 60 CE evince that Nahapana was ruling Ujjain, thus fixing his regnal period from around 54 CE to 100 CE. In the earlier records Nahapana is called Ksatrapa although his precise relation with Bhuumaka is not known. On the coins. Nahapana is invariably called Rajan, a title which probably indicates that he assumed independence. During his reign, Rsabhadatta, his son-in-law, extended his sway over the northern part of Konkan. In about AD 125 the Satavahana King Gautamiputra Satakarni defeated Nahapana and annexed the southern provinces of the Ksaharata dominion. In the inscriptions found in caves at Naneghat (near Junnar), this king is described as 'Khakharatvamsaniravsesakala', i.e, the person who uprooted the entire family of Ksatrapas and 'Sakayavanapallavanisudana.', i.e, the destroyer of Sakas, Yavanas and Pallavas. =Kardamakas= After the overthrow of Nahapana, the Scythian family of the Kardamakas established its authority in Western India under Castana, the son of Yasamotika. Inscriptions discovered at Andhan in Kaccha evince that in the Saka year 52 (A. D. 130-31) Raja Castana was ruling jointly with his grandson Rudradaman. Castana was the Mahaksatrapa and Rudradaman, the Ksatrapa.Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan-The Age of Imperial Unity p. 183. There is evidence to show that the Sakas under Rudradaman succeeded in defeating the Satavahana king and thereby, recovering most of the northern districts of the dominions of Satakarni originally conquered from Nahapana. Junagad inscription of Rudradaman speaks of him as the lord of many countries including Akora, Avanti, Anupa, Aparanta, Saurastra and Anarta (i.e, Dvaraka in Kathiavad). Most of these were conquered from Gautamiputra when Rudradaman was probably a Ksatrapa under his grandfather. Rudradaman came to the throne sometime after AD 130. We know much about the reign of this powerful ruler with the help of the important historical document in Junagad inscription dated in the Saka year 72 (A. D. 150-51). The subject for the prasasti here is the reconstruction of the dam of the Sudarsana lake which during his time was wiped away by a terrible cyclone. Rudradaman's rule appears to have extended over the whole of the Ksaharata dominions with the only exception of Nasik and Poona districts. Besides being a great conqueror and administrator, he was a great patron of Sanskrit literature. In his reign and due to his influence Kardamakas entered into matrimonial alliances with the families of Satavahanas of Daksinapatha, of the Iksvakus of Andhrapatha and also of the Licchhavis of Vaisali. Successors of Rudradaman were, however, unable to retain their hold on the province of Aparanta probably on account of the pressure of Satavahanas at the end of the 2nd century AD. =Satavahanas= Satavahanas came to power in trans-Vindhyan India during the 1st century B. C. Kings of this illustrious family were styled as Lords of Daksinapatha. According to Indian literary tradition, the Satavahanas had their capital at Pratisthana now identified with modern Paithan on the Godavari in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra. Ptolemy's Geography also confirms this view. Puranas use the expression Andhrabhrtya in case of the members of this family. This has given rise to a controversy.For the controversy, see the Age of Imperial Unity, Pages 192‚Äì193 (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan).] among scholars. In this connection, it can be pointed out that Satavahana might be the name of kula or family; while Andhra can be considered to be the name of a jati or a tribe. Simuka and his successors The chronology of the Satavahanas has also been a matter of dispute. According to Pauranic passages, Simuka, the founder of this dynasty, distinguished himself by overthrowing Susarman, the last of the Kanva kings who ruled for 45 years, after extirpating the last Shunga king Devabhuti. On this basis, Simuka can be assigned to the 1st century B. C. which is also confirmed by the palaeography of the Naneghat, Nasik, Sanci and Hathigumpha inscriptions referring to Simuka as well as his immediate successors, namely, Krsna and Satakarni. Both of these are known through inscriptions. The Hathigurhpha inscription shows that Satakarni I must have exercised his sway over a large empire. It probably included Northern Konkan and also Kathiavad. The Naneghat inscription speaks of Nayanika, the wife of this king claiming to have celebrated numerous Vedic sacrifices. Here a mention has been made of her. sons Vedisri and Saktisri also. Elder Saraganus noted in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (written between A. D. 70 and 80) probably refers to this Satakarni I. Periplus suggests that the Northern Konkan passed from Satakarni to Sandares some time about the middle of the 1st century CE. This Satakarni, appears to have been a descendant of Satakarni I. The period of about a century that intervened between Satakarni I (end of the 1st century) and that of Gautamiputra Satarkarni (beginning of the 2nd century CE) seems to have witnessed a temporary eclipse of the Satavahana power owing to the encroachment of the Sakas. 106‚Äì130 CE Gautamiputra Satakarni is styled as 'Saka-yavana-pallava- nisudana' and 'Satavahana-kula-yasa- pratisthapanakara'. Extirpation of the Ksaharata dynasty was his outstanding achievement. A Nasik inscription of the eighteenth year of his reign (roughly coinciding with AD 124-25) is seen recording a grant of some land that belonged to Rsabhadatta, Nahapana's son-in-law. This grant was issued from a \\"Victorious camp of the army that was gaining success\\",For the interpretation of the relevant passage, see Select Inscriptions bearing on Indian History and Civilisation, Part I, P. 191, by D. C. Sircar, Calcutta, 1942. Also see Journal of the Numismatic Society of India, Bombay III, pp. 79‚Äì81. and the king at that time was stationed at a place called Benakataka in the Govardhana (Nasik) district. On the strength of this inscription, it is possible to say that the direct rule of this king extended over the whole land from the Krsna in the south to Malva and Kathiavad in the north and from Berar in the east to the Konkan in the west. Last epigraphic record of this king which belongs to the twenty-fourth year of his reign was issued jointly by him along with his mother Gautami Balasri who is styled as one, \\"whose son is living\\". Soon after this charter being issued, the king seems to have died and was succeeded by his son Vasisthaputra Pulumavi (the name is written as Pulumayi). Hence the reign of this king can be roughly assigned to the period A. D. 106‚Äì130. Before his death, this king had lost some of the districts that he had conquered from Nahapana to another Scythian dynasty of the Kardamakas, already referred to above. Among the successors of this illustrious king, Yajnasri Satakarni or better Yajna Satakarni (A. D. 174‚Äì203) deserves mention. This king is known from inscriptions at Nasik (seventh year of his reign), Kanheri (16th year of the rule) and Cinna-Ganjan in the Krsna district (27th year of his reign). Silver coins of this king found at Sopara (Ancient Surparaka, the capital of Aparanta) have the head of the king on the obverse; while the reverse type is a combination of the Ujjain and hill symbols with the rayed Sun, a constant feature of the coins of the Sakas of Western India. Yajna, by far, was the last great king of the family, who succeeded in ousting Sakas; but soon after his death, the decline of the Satavahanas started and the empire appears to have been split up into a number of separate units under different princes of the royal blood. =Ptolemy, 150 CE= From the days of the geographer Ptolemy (135‚Äì150 CE) Konkan, the part of the west coast, is known to the Greeks. Information about Western India was supplied to this geographer by Greeks, who had known Symulla, probably Ceul, as one of the trading centres.Ptolemy I XVII, Bertius's Edition 17. Ptolemy's account of India suffers from the confusion due to his mistaken idea of the Indian coast stretching (according to him) east and west instead of north and south. In his division of Ariake, i.e, the Maratha country, he refers to Sadan's Ariake (a word of doubtful meaning) or the north Konkan and Pirate Ariake or the south Konkan. He mentions three places in Kolaba; the cape and mart of Symulla (i.e, Ceul), Hippokura, south of Symulla and Balepatna not far from Hippokura. These three can be identified respectively with the south point of Bombay Harbour and the mart of modern Ceul, Goreganv or Ghodeganv six miles south of Manganv and modern Mahad respectively. Details about the trade of the Greeks attracted towards the emporium of Symulla or Ceul are, however, not available from Ptolemy. =Periplus= The author of Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (70 and 80 AD) mentions Sopara (Ouppara), Kalyan (Kalliena), Ceul (Semulla) and Palpattan or Pal near Mahad (Palaiptama).The date is fixed in Reinaud's Paper translated in Indian Antiquary, December, 1879. Direct commerce with Egypt in articles of food, sesame, oil, etc, at this time, appears to have declined from the Konkan ports; yet considerable trade was carried on. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries places from Kolaba like Ceul were thus famous centres of trade. Satakarni's rule over Konkan only confirms this. =Vakatakas of Vatsagulma, 300‚Äì500= Vakatakas held sway over many parts of the Deccan after the fall of Satavahanas and before the rise of Chalukyas in the middle of the 6th century. Vindhyasakti, the founder of this dynasty, is mentioned in the Ajintha inscription of the time of Harisena. Unfortunately not much is known about the precise extent of Vindhyasakati's dominion. His own Maharaja Haritiputra Pravarasena I, described as samrat in some records, distinguished himself by performing various sacrifices like Agnistoma, Atiratra, Vajapeya, etc. The earliest epigraphic record of these Vakatakas of Vatsagulma occurs in the Basim grant of Dharma-Maharaja Vindhyasakti II, the great-grandson of Vindyasakti I, grandson of Pravarsena I and the son of Dharma-Maharaja Sarvasena. According to the Ajintha inscription he secured a victory over the king of Kuntala about the middle of the 4th century. The son of this king, Devasena is referred to in glowing terms in the inscription mentioned above. Devasena's son Harisena was one Of the most powerful rulers of his time. He, as is read in Ajintha record, spread his influence in many countries like Kuntala, Kosala including Trikuta, i.e, Traikutaka territories, about the Northern Konkan. The Ajintha inscription was caused to be incised by Varahadeva, a saciva of this king. Vakatakas were lovers of learning and great patrons of art and literature. =Mauryas and Nalas,500‚Äì600= During the 6th century, Raigad district along with the Northern Konkan coast was probably ruled by Mauryas and Nala Chiefs as Kirtivarman (550‚Äì567), the first of the Chalukyas who conquered Konkan is described as the night of death to the Nalas and Mauryas.Indian Antiquary VIII. 24. From an inscribed stone of the 5th and the 6th century (brought from Vada in Thana), it appears that a Maurya King Suketuvarman was then ruling in Konkan. More is a name quite common among Marathas, Kunbis and Rolls of Kolaba. Probably here can be traced the name Maurya. Two small landing places of the name of More in Elephanta and in Karanja can be taken as relics of the Maurya power formerly existing in Konkan. The Rithapur copper plate inscription Epigraphica Indica XIX p. 100. records the grant of a village called Kadambagiri by Maharaja Bhavattavarman while he had gone on a pilgrimage to Prayag. This copper plate, according to experts, is assigned to the first half of the 6th century. The name Bhavattavarman is probably a Prakrtised form of Bhavadattavaraman who is called Nala-nrpa-vamsa-prasuta. The expression Mahesvarmanhasenatisra-rajya- vibhava used in the case of this king indicates that he had obtained royal fortune through the grace of Mahesvara (Siva) and Mahasena (Skanda-Kartikeya). The king's banner bore the tri-pataka. Although the charter is dated in the king's eleventh regnal year, the grant, however, is said to have been made for the spiritual benefit of his own parents by Maharaja Arthapati-bhattaraka, now taken to be the grandson of Bhavadattavarman. A Nala inscription recently discovered Journal of the Bihar Research Society, Patna, XXXIV, 33. in the Umarkot thana, old Jaypore State, Orissa records a grant made by Maharaja Arthapati-bhattaraka. The father of this Arthapati was probably one Skandavarman (the name is doubtful due to the reading which is not clear) described as the son of Bhavadatta of the Nala family (identical with Bhavattavarman referred to above). This is known from Nala inscription Epigraphica Indica XXI, p. 155. in verse found at Podagadh in the old Jaypore State not far from the borders of the old Bastar State. Another trace of these Nalas occurs in the local story of Nala Raja who married his daughter to the Malahg or Arab devotee, who gave his name to Malahggad hill.Bombay Gazetteer, XIII, 420 and XIV under Vada and Malanggad. Epigraphic and numismatic materials indicate that originally the territories of Nalas were in Bastar- Jaypore region. In the first half of the 6th century, they extended their power at the expense of the Vakatakas. Thus these Maurya and Nala kings retained Konkan under their control even after the Chalukya king Kirtivarman; until finally Konkan was conquered by Pulakeshin II (610‚Äì640), the grandson of Kirtivarman who describes his general Candadanda as a great wave which drove before it the watery stores of the pools, which are the Mauryas.Arch. Sur. Ref. III-26. After having made his position secure at home, Pulakeshin II launched on a career of conquest for the subjugation of his neighbours. A graphic account of his victories is given in the Aihole prasasti, composed by the Jain poet Ravikirti, who claimed equality of fame with Bharavi and Kalidasa, at the completion of a shrine of Jinendra in A. D. 634-35. In the south Pulakeshin II besieged and reduced Vanavasi, the capital of the Kadambas who had been formerly subdued by his father. Then the Gangas of South Mysore and the Alupas, who are supposed to have ruled at Humca in Shimoga district of Mysore, were compelled to submit, probably because they were allies of the Kadambas. After the struggle, the Ganga king Durvinita Konganivrddha son of Avinitakongani, appears to have given one of his daughters in marriage to the Chalukya conqueror.But of, pp. 242, 269. The Mauryas of the Konkan, previously subdued by his father, were overwhelmed and the city of Puri (either Gharapuri, i.e, the island of Elephanta near Bombay, or Rajpuri near Janjira), which was located in the Arabian Sea and was probably the Maurya capital, was invaded by Pulakeshin's battleships and was captured. Further to the north the Latas, Malavas and Gurjaras were subdued. Pulakeshin's success in the Gujarat region is indicated by the establishment of a Chalukya viceroy. The Kaira grant issued from Vijayapura in A. D. 643 by the Chalukya Raja Vijayaraja or Vijayavarmaraja, son of Raja Buddhavarmaraja surnamed Vallabharanavikranta, and grandson of Jayasimha, records the grant of the village of Pariyaya (Pariya in Surat district) to the priests and religious students of Jambusaras (Jambusar in the Varuch district). The Bagumra (old Baroda State) grant of the Sendraka Chief Prthivi-vallabha Nikumbhallasakti (son of Adityasakti and grandson of Bhanusakti), dated AD 655 and recording a gift of land in the Treyannahara visaya (district round Ten near Bardoli), shows that the Chalukyas were succeeded in the viceroyalty of the Gujarat region by the Sendrakas related to Pulakeshin's mother. The non-mention of the overlord in both the records is probably due to the temporary eclipse of the Badami house after Pulakeshin's death in 642. =Traikutakas= A reference to Traikutakas is also opportune in the history of Kolaba. These kings derived their family name from the Trikuta hill in Aparanta, i.e, Northern Konkan. One of the Traikutaka kings is actually described as ruling over Aparanta. Coins of these kings have been found in Southern Gujarat, Konkan as well as Maratha countries on the other side of Ghats. These kings used the era of A. D. 248-49, which probably speaks of their relation with Abhiras or Ahirs. The Candravalli inscription Mysore Archaeological Report 1929 No 1 p. 50. refers to the separate conflict of Abhiras as well as Traikutakas with the Kadamba king Mayurasarman who ruled about the middle of the 4th century. Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa written in the 4th or 5th century contains a veiled reference to the Traikutaka kingdom of Aparanta. Indradatta, his son Daharasena (at times Daharangana) and the latter's son Vyaghrasena (at times Vyaghragana) are three Traikutaka Maharajas who ruled in 5th century A. D. as is evinced by epigraphic as well as numismatic evidence. Among the Maharaja Daharasena's copper plate grant is issued from the victory camp at Amraka and is dated in the year 207 (455 A. D.). This was found at Pardi about 50 miles from Surat. This king appears to have performed Asvamedha sacrifice. Surat grant of his son, Vyaghrasena was issued from Aniruddhapura in the year 241, i.e, 489 A. D. He, like his father, was a Vaisnava and is described as the Lord of Aparanta. The Traikutakas were always at war with Mauryas; and both of them had to accept the supremacy of Kalachuris in the second half of the 6th century. The Kalachuris, however, were subdued by the Chalukyas of Badami of the 6th century. Thus the Chalukya king Mangalesha (597-98 to 610‚Äì11) claims to have put to flight Buddharaja, the son of Kalachuri Sankaragana. Kirtivarman I died in 597-98, probably leaving several minor children, and the throne, therefore, passed to his younger brother or step-brother Mangalesha (A. D. 597-98 to 610‚Äì11), also known as Mahgalisa (sic), Mahgalaraja, and Mahgalisvara. The new king enjoyed the virudas Rana-vikranta and Uru-rana-vikranta, besides Prthivivallabha or Sri-prthivivallabha. Mangalesha has been described as a Paramabhagavata, i.e, devout worshipper of the Bhagavat (Visnu). The victory over the Katachhuris (Kalachuris) and the conquest of Revatidvipa, referred to in the Aihole inscription and echoed in the Kauthem grant, were his greatest e achievements. According to the Nerur grant and Mahakuta pillar inscription, the Kalachuri king Buddha, son of Sankaragana, was defeated before the 12th of April, A. D. 602, and his entire possessions were appropriated, when the Chalukya king was desirous of conquering the northern region. Buddharaja was in possession of Nasik district as late as AD 608. The struggle between the Chalukyas and Kalachuris, therefore, appears to have continued for some years, after which the former came into complete possession of the central and northern Maratha country. The Nerur grant of Mangalesha also refers to the killing of the Chalukya Chief Svamiraja who was apparently ruling in the Konkan and was said to have been famous for his victories in eighteen battles. Most probably this Svamiraja was placed in the Konkan by Kirtivarman I as his viceroy; and he sided with Pulakeshin II in his struggle against Mangalesha. It is also not unlikely that Svamiraja had his headquarters at Revatldvipa in the waters of the Western or Arabian Sea (i.e, the fortified promontory of Redi to the south of Vengurla in the Ratnagiri district), which is said to have been conquered by Mangalesha, and that the conqueror appointed Indravarman of the Bappura (i.e, Batpura) lineage, apparently related to his own mother, as the new Governor of the region. According to a Goa grant, Satyashraya-Dhruvaraja-Indravarman was ruling four visayas or mandalas with his headquarters at Revatldvipa in January 610 or 611 A. D, which was the twentieth year of his government, and granted a village in the Khetahara desa (Khed taluka in the Ratnagiri district) with the permission of the Chalukya emperor of Badami. It is usually believed that Indravarman was placed as a viceroy in the Konkan by Kirtivarman I about A. D. 590, the first year of the former's rule according to the Goa grant. But possibly he was ruling as a subordinate ruler elsewhere and was stationed at Revatldvipa only after the conquest of that place by Mangalesha sometime after A. D. 597-98. It was as a result of the difficult days through which the Chalukya emperor was passing about this time that he appears to have become bold enough to issue the charter, dated in his own regnal year. About the end of Mangalesha's reign there was a civil war between him and his nephew Pulakeshin II, son of Kirtivarman. The cause of the quarrel, according to the Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II, was Mangalesha's attempt to secure the succession for his own son. As a result of this war Mangalesha lost his life and the throne of Badami passed to Pulakeshin II. The son of Mangalesha, not mentioned by name in the Aihole epigraph, is usually identified with Satyashraya-Dhruvaraja-Indravarman of the Goa grant. But even though his title \\"an ornament of the original great Bappura (Batpura) lineage\\" may be explained by the suggestion that his mother was a Bappura princess, the fact that Indravarman acknowledged in January AD 610 or 611 the supremacy of Maharaja Sri-prthivi-vallabha, identified with Pulakeshin II, renders the theory unlikely; because Pulakeshin II could have hardly allowed his inveterate enemy and rival to the throne to be kept in the important position of the viceroy of the Konkan districts. As, however, Pulakeshin's first regnal year corresponds to Saka 532 (expired) while the date of the Goa grant is Saka 532 (current or expired) the identification of Maharaja Sriprthivi-vallabha, overlord of Satyashraya-Dhruvaraja-Indravarman, with Mangalesha is not beyond the bounds of possibility. The victory of Chalukyas was completed in the clays of the celebrated Pulakeshin II who came to power after Mangalesha. =Shilaharas, 765‚Äì1260= History of Raigad district during the 7th century is still wrapped up in obscurity. We only know that Hiuen-Tsang (640 AD) mentions Cimolo which is the same as Ceul. During the latter half of the 8th century Silaharas rose to power in Konkan and the rule of the branches of this family continued up to the 13th century with only temporary interruptions. Now history informs us that three Silahara houses For a detailed information of the Shilaharas, see ' Shilaharas of Western India'-Dr. A. S. Altekar (Indian Culture Vol. II, No. 3). ruled in Western India. The oldest, out of these, ruled over Southern Konkan from 765 to 920. Silaharas of Northern Konkan popularly known as Silaharas of Thana rose to eminence at about 800 AD. and ruled for a period of four centuries. The third branch was mostly ruling the territories now included in Satara and Belganv districts as well as those in the former Kolhapur State. This house, which rose in prominence at the end of the 10th century, did not extend the sphere of its influence over Kohkan or Kolaba. All along, Silaharas were feudatories in status. They owed their allegiance first to the Rastrakutas, then to Chalukyas as well as Kadambas and finally to the Yadavas of Devgiri. Rulers of these houses claim to have descended from Jimutavahana. Jimuta vahana, according to the traditional story, offered himself as ahara or food for Garuda on the Sila fixed for the purpose, for saving the life of the serpent Sankhacuda.The story is dramatised by Shri Harsha in his Sanskrit Drama Nagananda. Hence the descendants came to be known as Silaharas. This explanation is curious and unable to convince historians. Probably the original name was a Prakrt one like Selara and the change was made with a view to giving antiquity to it and connect it with the Pauranic hero, i.e, Jimutavahana. Silaharas of Thana and Kolhapur style themselves as tagarapuravaradhisvara and have the common garudalanchana. The identity of tagarapura still remains a matter of conjecture. Fleet's view that ancient tagara is the same as Ter about 95 miles south-east of Paithan Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, p. 337. appeared to be the near-most approach to truth. The fact that tagara is the home of Silaharas is proved on the strength of the Karakandacariu of Kanakamaramum published by Prof. Hiralal Jain.Prof. Hiralal Jain's Article in Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, XVI, pp. 1‚Äì11. The relation of the three branches of Silaharas remains a moot question. Shilaharas of South Konkan, 765‚Äì1015 History of this house is known through one record, namely, the Kharepatan plates of Rattaraja [Epigraphica Indica, III, p. 292.] issued in 1008 AD. Rattaraja was the last ruler of this dynasty. The document is extremely important as it not only gives the genealogy of the ten ancestors of Rattaraja, but mentions their specific exploits also. The date of the founder can be inferred from the fact that he was feudatory of the Rastrakuta emperor Krsna I (758 to 773 AD). By 765 AD Krsna I had established his power over Konkan and it was probably handed over to Sanaphulla, the founder of this dynasty. Allowing 25 years for each reign, as is the custom, the Chronology The Chronology is given by Dr. A. S. Altekar in ' Shilaharas of Western India'. would be as follows:- Sanaphulla (765 to 795) Dhammayira (795 to 820) Aiyaparaja (820 to 845) Avasara I (845 to 870) Adityavarman (870 to 895) Avasara II (895 to 920) Indraraja (920 to 945) Bhima (945 to 970) Avasara III (970 to 995) Rattaraja (995 to 1020) Soon after the issue of the plates (referred to above) in 1008 A. D, the rule of Konkan passed over to the later Chalukyas. The Kharepatan plates declare that the founder, namely, Sanaphulla obtained lordship over the territory between Sahya mountain and the sea through the favour of Krsnaraja.Kharepatan plates of Rattaraja-see Krishnarajaprasadavan-Samudratira sahyantadeshasamsadanobhavat. Sana-phulla's son Dhammayira is known to have built a fort at Vallipattana on the Western Coast.Epigraphica Indica, III, p. 294, n. 8. Aiyaparaja secured victory at Candrapuri, i.e, Candor near Goa.Kharepatan plates-see \\" Tasmadaiyaparajo bhutvijigishugunanvitah Snatas- chandrapurasannanalikeramibunasa yeh \\". The reign of Avasara I proved to be uneventful. His son Adityavarman, described to be as brilliant as the Sun in valour, became known on account of the help offered to the kings of Candrapuri (modern Goa) and Cemulya (modern Ceul), 30 miles to the south of Bombay. This shows that the rule of Silaharas had spread over the whole of Konkan. At this time, Laghu Kapardi the ruler of the Thana branch, was just a boy and hence the help given to the feudatory ruler of Ceul must have been at his expense. Avasara II only continued the policy of his father. Indraraja's son Bhima is styled as 'rahuvadgrasta candramandala' because he overthrew the petty ruler of Candor. At this time the Kadamba ruler Sasthadeva and his son Caturbhuja were trying to overthrow the Rastrakuta rule. This explains Bhima's opposition to Candrapuri or Candor. Avasara III, no doubt, ruled in troubled times, but had no contribution of his to make. Finally, Rattaraja, loyal to the Rastrakutas, was compelled to transfer his allegiance to Taila II.Miraj plate of Jagadekamalla, Balvantam cholam nirghatya saptakon-kanadhishvaranam sarvasvam grihitva uttaradigvijayartham Kolhapurasami- samavasitavijayaskhandhavare-Indian Antiquary, VIII, p. 18. Northern Konkan 800‚Äì1240 Regarding this branch, sufficient historical evidence is available. In addition to five copper plates and six stone inscriptions already published, there are a dozen inscriptions that refer to rulers of this branch. Thana was the capital of these feudatories. Hence they are known as Silaharas of Thana. Founder of this house was Kapardi,For the Chronology of these Shilaharas, see ' Shilaharas of Western India' by Dr. A. S. Altekar. one of the most valiant lieutenants of the Rastrakuta emperor Govinda III (794 to 813 A. D.) in many a battle. Govinda, therefore, rewarded him with rulership over Northern Konkan. Kharepatan plate of Anantadev Indian Antiquary, IX, p. 63. (1095 A. D.) described him as \\"a daring hero like Sahasanka\\". Kanheri inscription, dated 843 A. D. speaks of Pulasakti, his son, having obtained lordship over Konkan through Rastrakuta Amoghavarsa's favour; but it appears to be more customary than real. Originally the grant was made to Kapardi who ruled from 800 to 825 A. D. Description of Pulasakti's exploits in Kanheri plates Indian Antiquary, IX, p. 33. is conventional. Kapardi II (850 to 880 AD) is more known as Laghu-Kapardi. Thana plate of Arikesarin Asiatic Researches, Vol. I p. 358. speaks of the fact that the enemies of Laghu- Kapardi were afraid of him in childhood also. This is more conventional than real. Two records of this king only tell us that he was a feudatory of Amoghavarsa I. It is in the reign of this king that Silaharas of the south spread their influence over Goa. It may be mentioned here that Kapardi II submitted to the Kalachuri ruler Kokalla.Age of Imperial Unity, p. 97. His son Vappuvanna was not an able ruler. But Vappuvanna's eldest son Jhanja (910 to 930) is known to be the ruler of Samur or Ceul from the statement of the Arab historian Al Masudi in 916Prairies d'or II 85. Kharepatan plates inform that this king built 12 Siva temples. Sangamner plates of this king were, however, issued in 1000. His younger brother Goggi (930 to 945) is compared with Drona and Bhishma in the Kharepatan plates; but no exploit of his is mentioned. His son Vajjada I (945 to 975) remained loyal to the Rastrakutas even though the empire was overthrown in 973. Bhadan copper plate grant of Aparajita Mrganka (975 to 1010) issued in 997 speaks of his rule over the whole of Konkan which comprised Thana and Kolaba districts. In these plates, this king expresses sorrow for the overthrow of the Rastrakuta empire, but does not accept the supremacy of the Chalukyas. Samantadhipati is his title. A verse in the Kharepatan plates of Anantadeva (in 1095) refers to the help that this Aparajita gave to a ruler named Gomma as well as to the fact that he enabled Aiyapadeva to retain his kingdom. This verse also refers to the fact that this Aparajita granted protection to king Bhillama II, a scion of the Yadava family. The statement in Navasahasankacaritam that Paramara received help from a king of Vidyadharas confirms this. As Paramaras were avowed enemies of Chalukyas and as these Silaharas bad only unwillingly accepted the supremacy of Chalukyas, this is probable. We know of Salyasraya, the successor of Taila to have launched an attack on Aparajita soon after the retirement of Colas. It is, here, pertinent to remember, that the Canarese Ranna claims that Satyashraya routed the lord of Konkan. He speaks of Aparajita, i.e, king of Konkan as 'Hemmed in by ocean on one side and Satyashraya routed the lord of Konkan. He speaks of Aparajita, poetic exaggeration; nevertheless, it is safe to assume that Aparajita was defeated by Satyashraya. Soon after this, Aparajita died. The assumption that there was a war of succession between the two sons of Aparajita, viz, Vajjada II and Arikesarin, is based on the ambiguous words Cf. tasmadabhudvajjadadevanama tato graja Kesari Keshirajascha. used in Bhandup plates. Other documents, however, do not support it. The eulogy of Vajjada II (1010 to 1015 A. D.) and the statement that Arikesarin was his younger brother, made in Thana plates of Arikesarin go against this, it is sometimes argued that Sindhuraja's intervention in Konkan was intended to establish the legitimate heir, viz, Arikesarin to the throne, but the argument does not hold much water. The fact that Vajjada's son succeeded Arikesarin also belies any war of succession. It is true that Vajjada's reign was very short. A queen of the Kadamba King Chattadeva by name Kundaladcvi is known to be the daughter of King Vacchaya of Thani (i.e, Thana Hangal Inscription-Epigraphica Indica XV p. 333.) Now as Chattadeva's rule is assigned to the period from 980 to 1031 A. D, it is possible to identify Vacchaya with this Vajjada II. It is probable that Arikesarin (1015 to 1025 A. D.) might have been a regent of Cittaraja, i.e, Vajjada's son who was just a child at the time.Bhandup plates say about Chittaraja-Shilaharavamsho sishunapi yena paramunnatimunnatena. Arikesarin had to work against heavy odds. The acceptance of the Chalukya supremacy on the part of his father had estranged Paramara King Bhoja who consequently attacked northern Konkan as Bhoja is described as the Lord of Konkan (Konkanadhipati) in Bansvara plates Epigraphica Indica, XI, p. 182. issued on 3 January 1020 A. D. as well as in Betma plates Cf. Konkanagrahanavijayaparvani, Epigraphica Indica XVIII p. 320. issued in September 1020 A. D. In 1024 A. D. (Miraj plates) Chalukya King Jayasimha II is reported to be ready to march against Northern Konkan, but whether he succeeded in subduing Arikesarin or Cittaraja is uncertain.However, The Struggle for Empire, page 166, states that he recovered Northern Konkan before 1024 and not in 1024. \\" Sometime before A.D. 1024 Jayasimha II and his 'general Chavanarasa reconquered Konkan, apparently after defeating the Paramara Bhoja\\". In the reign of Cittaraja (1025 to 1040 A. D.), clouds began to gather over Silahara supremacy due to the Kadaihbas of Goa. Kadamba King Sasthadeva II claims to have conquered both southern and northern Konkan.Narendra Inscription A-Epigraphica Indica XIII,; p.1.316. It appears that Cittaraja succeeded in retaining Northern Konkan because he accepted Kadamba supremacy. The attack of Kadambas was facilitated by King Gorika's (Silahara house of Kolhapur) invasion of Thana at this time. 'Dayadavyasana' helping the conquest of Konkan referred to in Kharepatan plates of Anantadeva, probably alludes to this war between these two Silahara houses. Cittaraja built the beautiful Siva temple at Ambarnath near Kalyan. In the days of his son Mammuni (1040 to 1070 A. D.), Kadambas were becoming extremely powerful and he was prudent enough to offer his daughter to him.Narendra Inscription- Epigraphies Indica XIII p. 310. It may also be mentioned that Someshvara I, the Chalukya ruler, defeated Mammuni and placed his own nominee on the throne of Northern Konkan. \\"How long Someshvara kept Konkan under his control cannot be determined.\\" (The Struggle for Empire, p. 171). During his reign Ambarnath temple appears to have been repaired.Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, XII, p. 329. Anantadeva (1070 to 1110 A. D.), the son of the elder brother of Mammuni, happened to be an ambitious ruler. His Kharepatan plates indicate that he routed the enemies of his house. This enemy possibly is Guhalla II of the Kadambas who was expelled by Anantadeva and who took the title of 'pascimasamudradhipati', i.e, 'the lord of the western ocean' and the ruler of entire Konkan with 1,400 villages.Indian Antiquary, IX, p. 35. It is, however, stated in the Struggle for Empire, page 171, that the adversaries of Anantadeva were the Chalukyas. It is true that Silaharas had become weak due to the attack and victory of Gonka (1020 to 1050 A. D.) described as the 'Lord of Konkan' in his grandson's record Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, IV, p. 281. so as to become an easy target for Kadambas; but it seems that Anantadeva succeeded in indicting defeat on the Kadamba ruler Guhalladeva III (1180 A. D.) as the Kharepatan plate describes him as \\"Casting into the ocean of the edge of his sword those fierce heaps of sin who, at a time of misfortune due to hostility of relatives, obtained power, devastated the land of the Konkan, harassing Gods and Brahmanas. Apararka I (1110 to 1140 A. D.) son of Anantadeva is found issuing land grants without any reference to the Kadambas in 1118‚Äì19 and 1127‚Äì28 A. D.Annals of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute V p. 169. as well as in 1129‚Äì30 A. D.Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society XXI p. 506-16. and 1138‚Äì39 A. D.Festageate der Dr. Jacobi, pp. 189‚Äì93. Hence the assumption that the Kadamba ruler Vijayaditya who styled himself as the 'torch for the jewels of the land of Konkan' had annexed the Silahara kingdom appears to have no basis.Vijayaditya seems to have revolted against the Chalukya; but was defeated and made to submit. The Struggle for Empire, pp. 175‚Äì176 Anantadeva's Vadavalli plates issued in 1127‚Äì28 graphically describe the demon Cittuka invading the country, Apararka with a single horse and sword plunging into the battlefield and harassing the enemy to such an extent that he could neither fight nor flee and took refuge with the Mlecchas.Journal of the Bombay Branch of Royal Asiatic Society, XX, p. 508. This probably refers to the Kadamba ruler Jayakesin II (1125‚Äì1147 A. D.) who styled himself as the Lord of Southern as well as Northern Konkan.Narendra Inscription (1125 A.D.)-Epigraphica Indica, XIII, p. 316. It may also be mentioned that Jayakesin strengthened his position by marrying the daughter of Vikramaditya VI, the Chalukya ruler. He ruled jointly with his queen as a subordinate of the Chalukyas.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) The Struggle for Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, p. 176 Jayakesin's success must have been a very short-lived one as another inscription of his issued only five months later fails to mention Kaverikadvipa or Northern Konkan among his dominions.Referred to by Fleet Bombay Gazetteers, I-ii, p. 568 No. 6. Hence Vadavalli plates can be assumed as describing a fact which resulted in Apararka throwing off the Kadamba yoke. He later on is seen sending an embassy to Kasmir as is confirmed by Srikanthcarita written by Mankha in the lifetime of the Kasmir King Jayasimha who died in 1150 A. D. Colophon of Apararkatika on Yajnavalkyasmrti states that it was composed by Aparaditya, a Silahara king born in the family of Jimutavahana belonging to the Vidyadhara stock.Cf. \\" Iti shrividyadhara-vamsaprabhava srishilahara-narendrajimutavaha-nanvaya- shrimadaparaditya-virachite yajnavalkyadharmashastranibandhe prayscittadhyah trtiyah. Internal evidence shows that the author flourished between Vijnanesvara (1110 A. D.) and Devana-bhatta (1225 A. D.). Hence Aparaditya has to be identified with Aparaditya I (1110‚Äì1140 A. D.) or Aparaditya II (1170‚Äì1195 A. D.). It is more probable that he is this Aparaditya or Apararka who was introduced by Tejahkantha in Kasmir assembly through this book. Of course, whether he himself has written it or his protege has fathered his work upon him, cannot be determined at present, since Vadavalli plates are silent on this point. The relation of Harapaladeva (1140‚Äì1155) with Apararka is not known. Bombay Gazetteer refers to three inscriptions of this King, dated 1149, 1150 and 1153 A. D.Journal of Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, XII, p. 333 One of these from Agasi is dated Saka year 1078 Mdrgasirsa Suddha Pratipada which corresponds to 22 November 1150 A. D. Mallikarjuna (1155‚Äì1170 A. D.) is known through his Prince of Wales Museum inscription hailing from Ciplun (Saka year, 1079 Pausa Vadya Caturdasi, i.e, 2 December 1157), where his rule over Ratnagiri is spoken of. In his reign, his northern neighbour Chalukya Kumarapala of Gujarat invaded the Silahara kingdom as is known from the description of war in Kumarapalacaritam Canto VI, 47‚Äì72. Although in the first battle at Navasari in Surat district the General of Kumarapala was defeated, yet Mallikarjuna was slain in the second battle. Hence Kumarapalacaritam includes Konkan among the provinces ruled by the King Kumarapala. But Parel inscription of Mallikarjuna's successor, Aparaditya II (1170‚Äì1195 A. D.) dated 1180 A. D. describes him as 'maharajadhirajakonkan- cakra-varti'. This indicates that the Silaharas soon overthrew the Chalukya yoke. Kesiraja, the next Silahara ruler, is referred to in two unpublished inscriptions, one dated 1203 and the other dated 1238 A. D.Bombay Gazetteers, Vol. I, ii, p. 20, n. 3. From the latter, it is known that Kesiraja was the son of Aparaditya II. Although this king ruled for 40 years, it is clear that Yadavas of Devgiri by this time, extended their power over the Deccan and Kesiraja was forced to accept Yadava suzerainty. Last Silahara ruler was Someshvara (1240‚Äì1265 A. D.) two of whose stone inscriptions Bombay Gazetteers, Vol. I, ii, p. 21,. n. 1. are dated 1259 A. D. and 1260 A. D. Hemadri states that the Yadava ruler Mahadeva (Saka, 1182‚Äì1193, i.e, 1260‚Äì1271 A. D.) defeated and killed the King of Konkan named Soma.Cf. Rajaprashasti I from Hemadri's Vratakhanda (Chaturvarga Chintamani Sardham Jananya sahe jivitena someshsvarayapi rajyam, V. 49. Last known date of Someshvara is 1260 A. D. Hemadri's statement shows that Someshvara was first defeated on land, then took to ships and there appears to have met his death by being drowned. It is said that \\"even the sea did not protect him\\" and that \\"he betook himself to the submarine fire thinking the fire of Mahadeva's prowess to be more unbearable.\\"Cf. Hemadri etataipratapo bahiramburaseraurvantarepyasti kutah prayami. Chiran bimrshyeti yadiyavairi someshvaro vadavameva yatah. Thus in 1273 A. D. Thana plates published by Mr. Wathen Journal of the Royal Asratic Society (Old Series), Vol. V, pp. 177‚Äì78. speak of a Yadava Governor ruling over the Kingdom of Silaharas. So it is clear that Konkan was annexed to the territories of the Yadavas. Among the Silaharas of Kolhapur who ruled over Satara and Belganv districts from 1000 to 1215 A. D., Gonka deserves mention here, as he is described as the Lord of Karhad (Karad), Mairifvja (Miraj) and Konkan [Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. IV, p. 281, Sanskrit Transcript.]. Dayadavyasana referred to in the record of Anantadeva possibly refers to Gonka's conquest of at least of portions of Northern Konkan and a part of Kolaba district. Gandaraditya of this house claims to be the undisputed King of Konkan. During his reign Apararka I of the Thana branch appears to have been temporarily ousted by Jayakesin II of Goa. A record of Vijayaditya, son of Gandaraditya states that he had restored the Lord of Sthanaka or Thana to his kingdom.Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay, III p. 393. It appears, therefore, that Gandaraditya had asked his son to help Apararka II, who defeated Jayakesin II in 1127 A. D. Vijayaditya (1140 to 1175 A. D.) had also helped Chalukya Paramadideva in his war with Kalachuris. In fact, he played the role of a kingmaker. His son Bhoja II (1175 to 1215 A. D.) assumed all imperial titles, but received a crushing blow from the ambitious Yadava ruler Sihghana (1210 A. D.) who is described as the \\"Garuda putting to flight the serpent in the form of the King Bhoja\\".Cf. 'parnala-nilaya-prabdlai-bhajarbhupala-vyala-vidravana-vihangarajah '. Quoted in Bombay Gazetteers, Vol. I, ii, p. 254, n. 1. Yadavas of Devgiri Viceroys of the Yadavas of Devgiri, ruled Indian Antiquary, IX, 44. over the Deccan including Konkan as well as Kolaba from the days of Sihghana (1200 to 1247) down to Ramacandra or Ramadeva (1271‚Äì1310) and his son Sankara (1311‚Äì1313). Ramacandra as is well known, was taken prisoner by Malik Kafur, the General of Ala-ud-din, in the battle at Devagiri in 1307 AD. In Saka, 1235, i.e, 1313 A. D, Malik Kafur sent again to the Deccan for subduing Tailahgana put Ramacandra's son Sahkara also to death and fixed his residence at Devagiri. The revolt of Harapala, the son-in-law of Ramcandra was suppressed finally by Mubarak, the third son of Ala-ud-din Khilji in 1317, who seized and inhumanly burnt him alive.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) The Struggle for Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, p. 196. From this time the Delhi sultanate have held ports in Kolaba. Ceul was one of such ports.Briggs' Ferishta, II, 295. It must be said in fairness to Vijayanagar or Anegundi kings that they maintained control over many parts of Kolaba up to 1377. In fact, before Musalman domination, the south Konkan including present Raigad district was under the control of a Lingayat dynasty called the Kanara gings, whose headquarters were at Anegundi. By the end of the 14th century, however, the whole of Konkan including Kolaba, came under the thumb of the Delhi sultanate. Formation of Kolaba district Kolaba district was split from Thane district in 1869. According to the 1872 census Kolaba district had a population of just over 3,50,000 people, with 94% of the population being Hindus, and most of the remaining population being Muslims. In 1881 the population was about 382,000 with 95% of the population being Hindus. However, at this point, the northernmost parts of modern Raigad district were retained in Thane district. Panvel, just across the bay from Mumbai was not put in Kolaba district until 1883, and Karjat, an area in the north-east corner of modern Raigad district was not placed in Kolaba until 1891.

Aulocera brahminoides is 50 to 60 mm in wingspan and its smaller than A. brahminus. The narrow-banded satyrs are large, powerfully built Himalayan butterflies which are black or very dark brown above. They are characterised by a white discal band across both wings. The hindwing band is narrow and even in width. The white discal spots in 1 to 4 along the inner edge of the forewing are in line. The wings are rounded with convex termens and have chequered fringes. A dark apical spot or ocellus is present on the forewing. The under hindwing is dark below, with beautiful white variegations not as prominent as the dark background. The tegumen is gradually sloped to the tip. In A. brahminus, the under-forewing apical ocellus is well-defined and prominently pupilled while in A. brahminoides it is less well defined, much smaller and darker. The upper-hindwing discal band to dorsum, which is a characteristic feature in A. brahminus is much curved in the case of A. brahminoides.

The Air Ministry ordered the production variant off the drawing board as the Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow bomber. Development When Air Ministry specification C.16/28 for a multi-engined bomber transport failed to produce a satisfactory replacement for the Vickers Victoria, the Ministry turned to monoplane designs. Specification C.26/31 called for a twin-engined monoplane capable of carrying 24 soldiers and their gear over a range of 920 ml (1,480 km) at a speed of more than 95 mph (153 km/h). Handley Page, having had useful experience of constructing single-spar monoplane wings for their unsuccessful H.P.47 general-purpose bomber, realised that they could marry the fuselage of their failed contender for C.16/28, the H.P.43, to a monoplane wing. The result was designated the H.P.51. It was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with the wing meeting the fuselage at the same position as the lower wing of the H.P.43 but without the inboard anhedral. The wing had a similar tapered planform to that of the H.P.47, though much bigger with a span of 90 ft rather than 58 ft. The H.P.47's wing construction used a single central spar forming the rear of a stressed skin torsion box forward to the leading edge and the confirmation of its design assumptions by stress tests at the RAE allowed a similar approach for the new aircraft. The H.P.51 wings were of thick RAF 34 section, and like the H.P.47 were fabric-covered behind the spar. There were leading edge slats on the outer half of the wing with fabric-covered ailerons and inboard slotted flaps on the trailing edge. The undercarriage legs of the H.P.51 were longer than those of the H.P.43 because there was no anhedral wing section: the main legs went vertically to the spar just behind the engine mounting and were each braced to the fuselage with a pair of struts from top and bottom of the leg. The resulting landing gear had a wide track, with legs in streamlined fairings and the wheels in spats. The fabric-covered, tube framed fuselage was that of the H.P.43, though extended by 31 inches (787 mm) to provide the larger tail moment required by the monoplane's broader chord wings. The original tail was also used, though the area of all the flying surfaces was increased by extending both leading and trailing edges, the monoplane carrying noticeably more fin below the tailplane than its predecessor. The H.P.51 was powered by two 750 hp (560 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IV 14-cylinder double-row radial engines mounted on the chord line and in broad-chord Townend cowlings. The aircraft was completed at Cricklewood, dismantled and taken to the newer Handley Page site at Radlett for its first flight on 8 May 1935, piloted by Major J.L.B.H. Cordes. The results were so encouraging that Handley Page decided to press ahead with a production-ready variant designated the H.P.54 (later known as the Harrow) and submit this to C.16/31 rather than the H.P.51. In the end, Handley Page did not enter the C.28/31 competition at all and the Harrow was ordered on an ad hoc specification (B.29/35, issued June 1935) to go to production from the drawing board. In January 1935 the final report on wind tunnel tests on a 1/32 model confirmed what had been suspected from preliminary data, that with flaps down the elevator was partly blanketed, requiring the design of a revised tail for the Harrow. To test the redesign, the H.P.51's empennage was modified to the new profile, increasing the area by 70% and requiring external bracing. The new fins were taller and more rounded and the elevator had a much smoother contour. Apart from the bracing and the detail of the fin below the tailplane, the tail was now that of the Harrow. Although tests of the new surfaces were supposed to be urgent, it was decided to fit the H.P.51 with 690 hp (515 kW) Bristol Pegasus III engines similar to the Mk Xs intended for the Harrow. These alterations delayed the flight of the revised aircraft until early September 1936 and it did not fly with the new tail until later. It may even have first flown with the new tail after the first flight of the Harrow on 10 October 1936. Operational history The sole H.P.51 flew in its revised form for a short while with Handley Page. In January 1937 it went on to RAF Martlesham Heath for performance testing, then joined the RAE which it served until early 1940. During that period it was involved with air-to-air refuelling, blind flying instrumentation and intercom and radio developments. Some cockpit components of the aircraft survive, the rudder pedals, the base of the throttle quadrant and other parts. They are part of the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum.

The edition used is contained in the 16 DVD set of Pilger's documentaries; the book was originally published by Bloomsbury. which Denton directed for Granada's World in Action series. ATV, Central and Zenith At ATV he became successively deputy, then Head of Documentaries and later controller of programming. Not long after joining ATV he began the Pilger series which ran for five series between 1974 and 1977. John Pilger recalled: \\"Pilger was Charles' idea ... It was he who encouraged me to stand in front of the camera and say 'I'.\\" Denton came under extreme political and diplomatic pressure from both the British and Saudi governments both before and after ATV part-financed and produced the drama-documentary Death of a Princess shown on 9 April 1980. The British ambassador to Saudi Arabia was requested to leave the country, and remained away from his post for several months.David Brockman \\"Death of a Princess\\" , Transdiffusion, 5 February 2008 In 1981, he sacked Noele Gordon star of the soap opera Crossroads, a decision which antagonised viewers: \\"'I got excrement through the post'\\", he once said.Sue Summers \\"Hired to make drama out of a crisis\\", The Independent, 21 July 1993 As an act of revenge Gordon sang a 'love song' to him at the ATV End of Year Party. In the 1982 franchise round, the ITV Midlands broadcaster ATV turned into Central Independent Television, with Denton remaining in his post. He is an admirer of his former ATV boss, Lew Grade: \\"'Those times of meeting Lew in his office at 6.30am and watching him eat his grapefruit were among the happiest working days of my life ... ATV lost its franchise because it was too populist, but Lew would be sensationally right for ITV now.'\\" Towards the end of the 1970s, Denton had begun working in the film industry, becoming the managing director of Black Lion Films, also a Grade company. The most notable film he worked on during this time was The Long Good Friday (1980), starring Bob Hoskins, but the film was unappreciated by Denton's superiors, and was sold to HandMade Films becoming their second successful film.Michael Brooke \\"HandMade Films\\", BFI Screenonline In 1984 Denton left Central to become chief executive of Zenith Productions, which was initially financed by Central as one of its programme-making subsidiaries, and partly intended to become involved in the revival of the British film industry which had resulted from Channel Four's investment in films intended for a brief circuit release before a first television screening as part of its regular Film on 4 seasons. Zenith produced a number of successful feature film including Personal Services and Wish You Were Here. It was sold to Carlton Television in 1989 with Denton remaining in his post. Later career In 1993, Carlton sold Zenith and Denton left to re- join the BBC in the role as Head of Drama; by then dramas shot on videotape using the multi-camera technique were largely restricted to soap operas. Denton's time at BBC Drama coincided with some flops, such as the expensive Rhodes (1996) receiving a negative press, but some critical and popular successes such as the adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (1995) with Colin Firth as Mr Darcy.Paul Field \\"Shock waves set to hit quality of radio\\", The Independent, 8 June 1996 He left the Head of Drama post in 1996, reportedly in protest at the changes carried through by the Corporation's Director General at the time, John Birt,Georgina Born Uncertain Vision, London: Vintage, 2005, p.321 (pbk) with Denton complaining of Birt's \\"'Orwellian'\\" regime at the BBC.

Illumination The location of the dep√¥t can be seen from across the sweep of Douglas Bay and is marked by a large illuminated sign with the words \\"Electric Railway\\" in the cliffs above the sheds. This was reinstated in 1993 as part of the Year Of Railways celebrations marking the line's centenary, previous incarnations having been removed several years previously. The site of today's sign once held a similar illuminated sign which read \\"M.E.R. For Scenery\\", and a similar sign denoting the presence of Derby Castle was located on the hillside approximately behind the Strathallan Hotel (now the Terminus Tavern near the station). A Further sign in the same style was erected at the southern end of the White City amusement complex but this was removed in 1985. Site The depot in 1962 Where the dep√¥t lies is a reclaimed site, having once been Port-E-Vada Creek it was filled to make way for the railway in 1892 necessitating major works. Originally the site was home to the power station that created the electricity that powered the line. A pathway runs parallel and then behind the dep√¥t to the headland above, running behind the illuminated signage, offering an impressive birds-eye view of the site. Sheds The shed to the right of the yard was completed in 1998 replacing an original building that had stood since the earliest days of the railway; whilst in a similar style to the original, the current incarnation is a steel clad affair, whereas the original had wooden doors and sides. At the bottom of the yard lie original buildings comprising the workshops and paint shops; to the far left the stone structure is part of the original power station, the tall chimney having long since disappeared. Changes 1988 There was significant alteration to the site in 1988, including the removal of the \\"bonner siding\\" that was used initially in connection with the road-rail wagons of the same name, one road connected to the car shed and joiners' shop was lifted, and a new oil and paint store, and new works office were constructed between the two sets of car sheds. The ex- Aachen tramcar that also was stored at this point was destroyed to make way for these modifications. The site office at the mouth of the yard was however retained and is still used for this purpose today, being a characteristic of the site. Rebuild 1999 As part of the management's continued commitment to refurbish and improve facilities on the railway, the upper car sheds which had been built between 1894 and 1924 were completely demolished and new versions constructed on the same site. This was not without its controversy as local group the Manx Electric Railway Society were vocal in their support for alternative accommodation, ultimately being ignored. The new shed was not without problems initially, the two lower (left hand) roads being on such a lower level than the others that they could not be rail-connected. The overhead wiring also caused difficulties but ultimately the new fully functioning carshed is a vast improvement on the original which had decayed beyond economic repair. Outbuildings At the mouth of the yard lies a green corrugated hut, which is the signing-in area for staff, it too dates from the early days of the line. Between the two main sheds is an ablutions block with toilets and shower facilities for the staff. In the past there have been various other edifices, including an ex-Aachen tramcar used as a store in the 1970s among others. Being on an unusually shaped site, the buildings and associated sheds are all at different levels to accommodate rail access at various levels. Tommy Milner High atop the lower sheds is a figure that takes the form of a tightrope walker; this character is known at Tommy Milner and legend has it that if the figure were to be removed from its position, disaster would befall the railway. True to form, it was removed for repairs in 1992 and a disastrous fire ripped through the bottom shed, all but destroying winter saloon No. 22 (but this was subsequently rebuilt). The figure was returned and has not been removed since.

Visual and written representations Prohibition covers the visual representations of child sexual abuse and other sexual activity by persons (real or imaginary) under the age of 18 years or the depiction of their sexual organ/anal region for a sexual purpose, unless an artistic, educational, scientific, or medical justification can be provided and the court accepts that. It also includes the written depictions of persons or characters (fictional or non-fictional) under the age of 18 engaging in sexual activity.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 163.1, as enacted by SC 1993, c 46, s 2. Courts in Canada can also issue orders for the deletion of material from the internet from any computer system within the court's jurisdiction. The current law criminalizes possession of purely fictional material and has been applied in the absence of any images of real children, including to possession of fictional stories with no pictures at all, or vice versa, cartoon pictures without any stories.R. v. Beattie (8 April 2005). Retrieved March 12, 2007. Some current law is unenforceable to the extent of exemptions carved out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Sharpe. The Internet In 2002, laws passed addressing child pornography on the Internet, regulating the nature of live-time chatting and email communications that may relate to grooming children for pornographic (e.g., web cam) or other sexual purposes. The laws also criminalize the intentional access of child pornography. Criminal Code provisions Canadian laws addressing child pornography are set out in Part V of Criminal Code dealing with Sexual Offences, Public Morals and Disorderly Conduct: Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals. Section 163.1 of the Code defines child pornography to include \\"a visual representation, whether or not it was made by electronic or mechanical means\\", that \\"shows a person who is or is depicted as being under the age of eighteen years and is engaged in or is depicted as engaged in explicit sexual activity\\", or \\"the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen years.\\" The current minimum penalty for possession of, or \\"accessing,\\" child pornography is six months of imprisonment. Cases =Eli Langer art show trial= One early application of this law was the Eli Langer case. In 1993, this Toronto artist had an exhibition at the Mercer Gallery. His drawings included images of children in sexual positions. Police raided the gallery and confiscated the works. Langer was eventually acquitted after a trial because his work was considered artistic enough to be justified as protected speech. =R v Sharpe= The whole law against simple possession of child pornography was declared void for two years in British Columbia following a 1998 ruling (R v Sharpe) by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, but this decision was subsequently overturned by the Canadian Supreme Court. Moreover, the definitive 2001 Supreme Court ruling on the case interprets the child pornography statute to include purely fictional material even when no real children were involved in its production.

Guidonia Montecelio, the small town and comune where he died while testing a new parachute, was named after him in 1937. Life Guidoni was born in Turin, Italy, on 15 July 1880. He obtained his degree in engineering at the Turin Polytechnic in 1903 and in 1905, while serving in the Navy Engineering Corps, took his second degree in naval engineering. In 1909 he developed a keen interest in the newborn Corpo Aeronautico Militare (\\"Military Aviation Corps\\") of the Regio Esercito (Italian Royal Army), joining many aviation pioneers. Guidoni served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-1912 as a pilot trainee, soon achieving a full certification and flying \\"hydroplanes\\" (seaplanes). He then started studying weaponry and developed a new gyroscope-guided bomb to be delivered by planes against distant targets. In 1912, as a captain, he experimented with the air- launching of torpedoes by dropping weights from a Farman biplane.Chant, p. 13. He also drew the plans of the seaplane carrier Europa, which entered service with the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) in 1915.hazegray.org World Aircraft Carriers List: Italy In 1920, Guidoni joined the Italian Embassy in London as military attach√© with the rank of colonel. When the Corpo Aeronautico Militare separated from the army in 1923 to become an independent service, the Regia Aeronautica, he became a member of the new service, and achieved the rank of general. On the morning of 27 April 1928, being dissatisfied with its design, Guidoni tested personally a new model of parachute at the Regia Aeronautica airfield at Montecelio, Italy, and was fatally injured when it failed. Commemoration and legacy Monument to Guidoni at the Guidoni Military Airfield, north of Rome Guidoni posthumously received the Medaglia d‚ÄôOro al Valore aeronautico (\\"Gold Medal for Aeronautic Valor\\"). The third Dornier Do X flying boat built, the X3, registered as I-ABBN, was named Alessandro Guidoni in Guidonis honor, and entered service in May, 1932. A private airline, Societ√† Anonima di Navigazione Aerea (SANA) flew it initially; the Regia Aeronautica later operated it. In the 1930s a town was built around the airfield at Montecelio to house military personnel. Benito Mussolini, the Italian Duce, laid the towns founding stone on 27 April 1935, the seventh anniversary of Guidonis death. In 1937, Montecelio and the surrounding comune were renamed Guidonia Montecelio in Guidonis honor. Only a military airfield exists at Guidonia Montecelio today, but a memorial to Guidonia stands on the exact spot where he died in front of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church. Guidoni's passion for flight was celebrated publicly by General Ermanno Aloia of the Aeronautica Militare Italiana (Italian Air Force) celebrated Guidonis passion for flight 26 April 2006 with these words: ‚ÄúA perfect fusion of military engineer and scientist, General Guidoni (ITAF) represents more than anyone else in our country the passion of man to conquer space, reach other planets, and investigate stars.‚Äù  Decorations  Gold Medal for Aeronautic Valor Notes  Bibliography  * Alessandro Guidoni, Aviazione, idroaviazione : origine, storia, sviluppi, dagli albori alle traversate aeree dell'Atlantico : note, documenti, disegni, progetti, studi, esperienze ideate ed effettuate dall'eroico generale Alessandro Guidoni raccolte ordinate da Guido Mattioli, Roma, Pinciana, a.

It is easily reached via the Khosrov State Reserve (which it is situated within), located across the Garni Gorge. The Havuts Tar Trail leads directly from the east side (left) of the reserve entrance to the monastic complex. An alternate route/shortcut to the monastery can be found at the end of the main road along the Azat River and just past the fish hatchery ponds. It takes approximately thirty minutes to reach the ruins of the monastery via the Havuts Tar Trail. A couple of khachkars can be found midway along the trail as it forks left upon a very low mound. Also, a short distance from the monastery (clearly visible oh a hill in the background) in a small field to the left, is a large khachkar and a small ruined monument. Following the trail a little further leads to the fortified walls and ruins of the monastic complex. Just before entering the monastery, a small path leads up a hill to the east and through a semi-wooded area. At the end of the path are the ruins of a small chapel with two large khachkars to the left, and a third to the right.  History  The majority of the Havuts Tar monastic complex was constructed between the 12th and 14th centuries. After having been badly damaged by a large earthquake in 1679, the monastery was effectively abandoned in the years that followed. Portions of the complex were rebuilt in the early 18th century by the Catholicos Astvatsatur Hamadantsi, and some restoration efforts took place in the early 20th century. The monastery is known to have had a brief visit during October 1734 by Abraham Kretatsi during the time while he was serving the Catholicos Abraham II. He brought a monk as a guide and spent two days there while on his pilgrimage to a number of churches and monasteries across Armenia. His visit to Havuts Tar is mentioned the following brief passage:  Monastic complex  The eastern outcrop at Havuts Tar is surrounded by a fortified wall, constructed of roughly hewn stones that are cemented into place. There are some khachkars and other decorative stones that were used as accents and at times as rubble infill for the walls. Access to the monastery is through an arched entryway at the southeast corner that connects to the main trail. Within its confines are two churches positioned in the center (the main church with its surrounding walls intact and the ruins of another adjacent to it), the ruins of a gavit to the main church, monastic buildings situated along a section of the northern and southern interior walls, vaulted guest chambers, and a large underground chamber that likely served as a manuscript library at the south wall. The main church is notable for the decorative relief that is found on its exterior and interior walls. There is a single entry to the church from the west through a highly decorated fa√ßade that utilizes burnt orange and dark gray tuff to highlight its unique architectural details. A similar technique is used on the interior as well. Carvings of birds adorn the tympanum above the western portal, the southern exterior wall, and one of the niches in the interior. Construction of a new church (adjacent to the north) began in 1772, but the work was never completed. Even though much of the site is in ruins, there are still numerous inscriptions and interesting carvings to be found all over the complex. Just beyond the monastery's walls along the path that leads to S. Amenaprkich Church and the western outcrop, are the remnants of stone foundations and depressions in the earth of other structures.  Amenaprkich Church  On the western outcrop upon a hill overlooking the valley below is a structure that is often referred to as Amenaprkich Church (which can be seen from across the gorge all the way to Garni Temple) with a small number of graves nearby. The historical accounts of Mkhitar Airivanatsy mention that Gevorg Marzpetuni had originally built the church in the 10th century. According to inscriptions at the site, it was later rebuilt in 1013 by Grigor Magistros Pahlavuni, son of Vasak Pahlavuni. Pahlavuni was also the founder of Kecharis Monastery in Tsakhkadzor. However, some sources indicate that Amenaprkich is the main church in the eastern outcrop. Amenaprkich Church is cross-dome in plan, where the cylindrical drum and dome are collapsed. A single entry leads into the church from the west with prayer rooms at either side to the north and the south. There are additional prayer rooms adjacent to both sides of the raised altar at the eastern wall. A single window in each of these rooms allowed light to enter the space. The apse has two small decorative niches and a window. Windows are also at each of the other wings. Vaulting and a pendentive above the northern wing that had once helped to support the drum and dome are still intact. Pendentives each contained decorative relief depicting knot patterns in their bottom corners. Exterior walls are constructed in an alternating checkerboard pattern of burnt orange and dark gray tuff. The structure was constructed with two vertical niches at the eastern wall to provide overall strength and stability, as well as increase its resistance to collapse during earthquakes. A number of inscriptions can be seen at the southern and western exterior walls. The ruin of a small vaulted church constructed at a later date of grey basalt is attached adjacent to Amenaprkich's southern exterior wall.

It passes through the Dane River valley. It is the main road that gives access to the Jodrell Bank Observatory and the Quinta Arboretum, planted by Sir Bernard Lovell in 1948. History Location area of the A535 in the United Kingdom (marked red) A535 approaching Chorley Hall heading south. The approaching left road is Chorley Lane. In medieval times part of the existing A535 route provided access to Chorley Old Hall and moat near Alderley Edge, a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument. This part of the road is known as \\"Ryley's Lane\\". The original part of the house was built around 1330 by Robert de Chorley. The Stanley family carried out alterations around 1640 and built a bridge across the moat. Just past the hall, a lane leads off to the east which is named after the hall, Chorley Lane. In historical times, this lane leading off what is now the A535 road was the main road leading to Macclesfield from Alderley Hall, and was the continuation of the Macclesfield Road. This stretch is now the B5087 road. From the 16th to the 18th century, the Booth family were the major landowners in the southern part of the road in the Twemlow area. They built a grand mansion at Twemlow Hall in the area which can be viewed along the A535 road from Holmes Chapel to Goostrey on a hill top. In 1831, Corbishley Bridge was erected along the road to the northeast of Chelford, to the west of the hamlet of Corbishley to facilitate the railway line. In 1898, the Cheshire County Council erected a signpost near Withington Hall along the road. From September 1952, the road became the main road of transport of shifting building materials for the building of the Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first major constructional work was completed in the summer of 1957, and eventually 5 telescopes were installed at the centre under the guidance of Sir Bernard Lovell. Lovell acknowledged that delivering the telescope parts over the level crossing along the A535 may have been problematic but he didn't anticipate any major difficulties. Jodrell Bank Observatory has since become the main tourist attraction of the area. During the summer of 2010, the construction of the A34 Alderley Bypass affected the road network in the area and meant that as one road was closed off, traffic had to frequently be diverted. The road used to connect to the A34 at a junction in Alderley Edge, but with the opening of the A34 Alderley Bypass in November 2010, the A535 now terminates at the roundabout on the A537 in Chelford. The part of the A535 from the Chelford roundabout to Alderley Edge was joined with the section of the old A34 from Alderley Edge to the Whitehall Bridge roundabout and renamed B5359. Route Location (A535 marked roughly in white) Starting at a double mini-roundabout in the centre of Holmes Chapel at , the road heads eastwards where it is initially known as Macclesfield Road, before heading northeastwards and crossing the Crewe to Manchester branch of the West Coast Main Line. It passes the village of Twemlow Green, running alongside the Twemlow Viaduct. After the gentle climb out of Twemlow, the Lovell Telescope of Jodrell Bank is in view, with access to the site being from a sharp left turn into Bomish Lane. At Jodrell Bank is a road leading off to the east which is initially called Farm Lane, leading to Lower Withington. This is part of the B5392 road which eventually joins the A537 at Broken Cross in the western suburbs of Macclesfield. After passing through the village of Withington Green, a lane passes off the east called Catch Penny lane which leads to Deans Rough Farm and a Catch Penny lake. Further north is Farm Wood Quarry on its left, an area which the road passes which has had several notable geological examinations conducted into it. Approaching Corbishley Bridge The road continues to past Astle Hall, site of the annual 1000 Engine Rally in June, and also the Astle Park Steam Rally (at Astle Park) in August, to Chelford, where it terminates at the A537 roundabout. Originally the A535 continued from the roundabout on the A537 towards Alderley Edge, but this section of the A535 was downgraded and renamed B5359 following the opening of the new A34 bypass in 2010. Shortly after leaving Chelford the B5359 passes under the Crewe to Manchester line at Corbishley Bridge, and continues through the village of Alderley Edge and finally ends at the Whitehall Bridge roundabout on the new A34.

As well as riding, Dunton promoted Peterborough Panthers and co-promoted Oxford Cheetahs, then Oxford Rebels and finally White City Rebels. Career summary Dunton was born in Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire. He first took his bike in 1949 to Harringay Racers, and immediately found himself as a team member in his first meeting, a rare if not unique feat. As well as Harringay Racers, Belle Vue Aces, Ipswich Witches, Oxford Cheetahs, and Long Eaton Archers are listed as tracks where he rode as a contracted or loaned rider. In 1950, in only his second season, he qualified for the World Championship Final and finished 12th ‚Äì the top three riders were Jack Young, Graham Warren and Cyril Brine. In 1953, following a crash at New Cross, he used a wheelchair and could not walk for 4 months. Danny Dunton retired from racing at Long Eaton at the end of 1963, having scored 127 and a half points from just 17 matches. In 1964, he was the Team Manager at Oxford, taking over the promotion the following year. He was joined in 1972 by Bob Dugard, becoming co- promoter.Bamford, R & Shailes, G (2007). ‚ÄúThe Story of Oxford Speedway‚Äù. He already had opened up Peterborough Speedway at the Showground in 1970, and was joined as co-promoter by his son, Lee, in 1979, who was also the Team Manager. 1974 saw the Rebels at the bottom of the League Table but, with new signing Dag Lovaas the team improved, winning the Midland Cup. Lawson,K (2018) ‚ÄúRebels 1975 ‚Äì The Last Season‚Äù. After a threatened closure of the stadium at Oxford, Danny and Bob Dugard secured White City as a venue, only to find out too late, the stadium was saved.Lawson, K (2018) ‚ÄúThe Cheetahs ‚Äì The Resurrection‚Äù. At White City, the Rebels won the Gulf British League in 1977 but, the venue not proving viable, raced their last season in 1978 and the licence was moved to Eastbourne. Following the decision of the British League promoters in November 1967 to run a second division, five promoters from the British League, Danny Dunton, Maury Littlechild, Len Silver, Ron Wilson and Reg Fearman formed Allied Presentations Limited. This company opened three tracks in 1968, Reading, Middlesbrough and Rayleigh, and constructed Crewe in 1969, followed in 1970 by Peterborough. Each track was promoted by one of the APL members and Danny Dunton‚Äôs track was Peterborough. After he retired from riding, he served during the 1970s on the committee of the British League and then the National League as its chairman in 1981‚Äì85 and 1987, and was honoured by being made president in 1988. Danny was active in the World Speedway Riders Association and was the honoured and respected president for the year 2005/06. After retirement, he was a keen golfer and restorer of vintage speedway bikes, which he used to race in specialist matches. That had to stop after a motoring accident (car ran into him) in 2004 and he had to have a leg amputated. He lived for many years with his wife in Ley Hill, Buckinghamshire.

It was through his literary interventions that the miserable and subhuman life of the downtrodden people of Kerala was exposed before the world of letters in an aesthetic manner. The celebrated author has been considered as one of the pioneers of Dalit Literary Movement in India. Personal life Paul Chirakkarode was born on 4 September 1938 in Maramon, a small village situated on the banks of Pamba river, near Thiruvalla in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. He belonged to a Dalit Christian Family. His father Rev LT Daniel was well known among the natives of his village as a teacher, social worker and as a Christian Missionary. His mother was Elikutty.

Reasons include that the pornography normalizes and/or legitimizes the sexual interest in children, as well as that pornography might eventually cease to satisfy the user. * Viewing child pornography decreases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse. Reasons are that the pornography acts as a substitute for actual offenses. Simulated child pornography is suggested as an alternative so that real children are not harmed. * There is no correlation between viewing child pornography and acts of child sexual abuse, or that available evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions at all. Views on increasing criminal sexual intent =General= One perspective is that exposure to child pornography promotes criminal sexual intent that otherwise would not exist. The promotion may take place via material that legitimizes sexual interest in minors. Anonymity (or belief that anonymity exists) may further loosen the internal restraints, facilitated by still or moving images, which makes actual criminal sexual behavior with children more probable if the person was already sexually motivated toward children, or, by creating new sexual interests in children. A review article states that these are plausible hypotheses, but that there is a lack of clarity as to the general applicability of these mechanisms. The authors also note that, \\"among some groups of predisposed individuals, easy access to a wide variety of engrossing and high-quality child pornography could serve as a substitute for involvement with actual victims\\". According to the National District Attorneys Association of America, \\"In light of the documented link between individuals who view child pornography and individuals who actually molest children, each child pornography case should be viewed as a red flag to the possibility of actual child molestation.\\" John Carr, founding member of the United Kingdom Home Secretary's Internet Task Force on Child Protection, in a report published by the NCH stated, \\"Many pedophiles acknowledge that exposure to child abuse images fuels their sexual fantasies and plays an important part in leading them to commit hands-on sexual offenses against children.\\" =Research= A 1987 report by the U.S.A. National Institute of Justice described \\"a disturbing correlation\\" between traders of child pornography and acts of child molestation. A 2008 longitudinal study of 341 convicted child molesters in America found that pornography's use correlated significantly with their rate of sexually re-offending. Frequency of pornography use was primarily a further risk factor for higher-risk offenders, when compared with lower-risk offenders, and use of highly deviant pornography correlated with increased recidivism risk for all groups. The majority of men who have been charged with or convicted of child pornography offenses show pedophilic profiles on phallometric testing.Seto, M. C., Cantor, J. M., & Blanchard, R. (2006). Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 115, U.S.A. 610‚Äì615. A study with a sample of 201 adult male child pornography offenders using police databases examined charges or convictions after the index child pornography offense(s). 56% of the sample had a prior criminal record, 24% had prior contact sexual offenses, and 15% had prior child pornography offenses. One-third were concurrently charged with other crimes at the time they were charged for child pornography offenses. 17% of the sample offended again in some way during this time, and 4% committed a new contact sexual offense. Child pornography offenders with prior criminal records were significantly more likely to offend again in any way during the follow-up period. Child pornography offenders who had committed a prior or concurrent contact sexual offense were the most likely to offend again, either generally or sexually.Seto, M. C., & Eke, A. W. (2005). The criminal histories and later offending of child pornography offenders. Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17, 201‚Äì210. According to the Mayo Clinic of the US, studies and case reports indicate that 30% to 80% of individuals who viewed child pornography and 76% of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child; however, they state that it is difficult to know how many people progress from computerized child pornography to physical acts against children and how many would have progressed to physical acts without the computer being involved. A study conducted by psychologists at the American Federal Bureau of Prisons has concluded that \\"many Internet child pornography offenders may be undetected child molesters\\", finding a slightly higher percentage of molesters among child pornography offenders than the Mayo Clinic study, though they also \\"cautioned that offenders who volunteer for treatment may differ in their behavior from those who do not seek treatment.\\" The study was withdrawn by Bureau officials from a peer-reviewed journal which had accepted it for publication, due to concerns that the results might be misinterpreted. Some researchers argued that the findings \\"do not necessarily apply to the large and diverse group of adults who have at some point downloaded child pornography, and whose behavior is far too variable to be captured by a single survey\\". Child protection advocates and psychologists like Fred Berlin, who heads the National Institute for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma, expressed disapproval over the failure to publish the report. One study suggests that child pornography is used by non contact sex offenders as a cathartic release, that the use would serve as an alternative outlet in contrast to physically offending. It was found that sex offenders with an anchored preference higher in levels of graphic child pornography with less amounts of collected images were more likely to be contact offenders while the lower level child pornographic preferences with high amounts of collected images proved to be of non contact offenders. According to another study, contact offenders were found to have higher rates of trading and producing child pornography with individuals with similar interests. Some subjects in one study demonstrated cognitive disassociation between the images and reality, where they believed that the people involved in the pornography were not people at all, but simply part of a whole picture. =Criticism= Dennis Howitt (1995) disagrees with such research, arguing the weakness of correlational studies. He argues that \\"one cannot simply take evidence that offenders use and buy pornography as sufficient to implicate pornography causally in their offending. The most reasonable assessment based on the available research literature is that the relationship between pornography, fantasy and offending is unclear.\\"Howitt, Dennis (1995). \\"Paedophiles and Sexual Offences against Children,\\" chapter 6. Loughborough University, UK; John Wiley & Sons. A Swiss study reviewing the criminal record of 231 men who were charged with viewing child pornography found that those without a prior sexual conviction are unlikely to sexually assault a child. The study found that in the six years before the 2002 police operation, 1% were known to have committed a hands-on sexual offense and 1% committed a hands-on sex offense in the six years afterwards. The study reinforces previous research that consumers are well-educated and view other types of illegal pornography like acts involving animals and violence as well. Author Frank Urbaniok said it should not automatically be assumed that they were a risk for sexually assaulting a child and said: \\"Our results support the assumption that these consumers, in fact, form a distinct group of sex offenders. Probably, the motivation for consuming child pornography differs from the motivation to physically assault minors. Furthermore, the recidivism rates of 1% for hands-on and 4% for hands-off sex offences were quite low.\\" A 2005 paper by Canadian researchers Michael Seto and Angela Eke found that of 201 men charged with child pornography offenses, 24% had committed prior offenses of sexual contact and 4% went on to commit subsequent sexual offenses after being charged or prosecuted. Views on reducing criminal sexual intent Milton Diamond, from the University of Hawaii, presented evidence that \\"[l]egalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse\\". Results from the Czech Republic indicated, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes \\"decreased or essentially remained stable\\" following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. His research also indicated that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen considerably since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible ‚Äì a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan. The findings support the theory that potential sexual offenders use child pornography as a substitute for sex crimes against children. While the authors do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography, they say that artificially produced materials might serve a purpose. Diamond suggests to provide artificially created child pornography that does not involve any real children. His article relayed, \\"If availability of pornography can reduce sex crimes, it is because the use of certain forms of pornography to certain potential offenders is functionally equivalent to the commission of certain types of sex offences: both satisfy the need for psychosexual stimulants leading to sexual enjoyment and orgasm through masturbation. If these potential offenders have the option, they prefer to use pornography because it is more convenient, unharmful and undangerous.

It was intended to be the alternative to the Ares I and Ares V rockets which were under development for the US Project Constellation. Major benefits were projected from re-using as much hardware and facilities from the Space Shuttle program as possible, including cost savings, experience with existing hardware, and preserving the workforce. DIRECT proposal Some envisioned Jupiter configurations, including crew and cargo variants Jupiter was designed to be a high-commonality family of rockets, adapted closely from existing Shuttle systems. Each Jupiter launch vehicle would use a \\"common core stage\\" consisting of a tank structure based closely on the existing Space Shuttle External Tank with a pair of standard four-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) mounted at the sides as on the Space Shuttle. Up to four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) from the Space Shuttle Orbiter would be attached to the bottom of the tank and would be expended along with the tank. For heavier payloads a proposed Jupiter Upper Stage (JUS) would be added atop the tank structure. For extra-planetary expeditions, the JUS would serve in a role similar to the Earth Departure Stage planned for Ares V. DIRECT purposefully specified existing components for the launch vehicles, but contended that improvements such as the more powerful five-segment SRB or the J-2X upper stage engine could have been incorporated. Crews would be carried atop the launch vehicle in NASA's planned Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. Cargo, whether carried under Orion or alone on a cargo-only launch, would be enclosed by a payload fairing. Variants Many configurations of Jupiter were projected, with the May 2009 DIRECT version 3.0 proposal recommending two: the Jupiter-130 and Jupiter-246, with claimed lift capacities exceeding 60 and 90 tonnes (t), respectively, to low Earth orbit.. = Jupiter-130 = Expanded diagram of the DIRECT v3.0 Jupiter-130 configuration DIRECT proposed that the Jupiter-130 be the first configuration developed, with the goal of becoming operational within four years of the start of the development program. The Jupiter-130 would have consisted of the Jupiter common core stage with one SSME removed, no upper stage, and a payload fairing on top. \\"130\\" stands for one cryogenic core stage, three main engines, and zero upper-stage engines. Initial launches would rotate crews and bring cargo to the International Space Station, a function currently carried out by Soyuz rockets. DIRECT calculations indicated that the Jupiter-130 would have been able to deliver between over 60 t and over 70 t of cargo or cargo and crew to a variety of circular and elliptical inclined low Earth orbits. When the mass of the proposed Orion spacecraft and crew is subtracted (18 - 22 t depending on the mission ), the remainder compared favorably with the approximately 25 t cargo capacity of the Space Shuttle, and the lack of capacity of Ares I besides the Orion spacecraft. = Jupiter-246 = The Jupiter-246 would have used four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) in the common core stage with an upper stage, informally called the Jupiter Upper Stage (JUS). The Jupiter-246 would use six RL10B-2 engines on the upper stage. \\"246\\" stands for two cryogenic stages, four main engines, and six upper stage engines. The primary role for the Jupiter-246 would be to launch heavier cargo as well as crew and cargo for lunar missions.  Jupiter Upper Stage  Because the Jupiter-246 would have used four SSMEs on propellant tanks originally sized for three engines, the core stage propellant would be depleted before achieving low Earth orbit, and a large capacity upper stage would deliver payload into orbit. Launched with a partial upper stage propellant load of 75 t, a Jupiter-246 could deliver over 84 t of crew and cargo to a circular 241 km (130 nmi), 29¬∞ inclined orbit. Launched with no crew or payload, the same 75 t of propellant could deliver an additional 100 t of propellant to the same orbit. The total JUS capacity was to be approximately 175 t. For lunar missions where the JUS is to serve as the Earth departure stage, a full load of 175 t of propellant would be launched and 75 t would be consumed in achieving low Earth orbit, leaving 100 t available for the Earth departure burn. In line with the DIRECT v3.0 theme of using as much existing hardware as possible, DIRECT proposes the veteran RL10 engine family to power the JUS. However, DIRECT anticipated similar performance for its upper stage from the J-2X engine, previously under development for the Ares I and Ares V upper stages.  Design Considerations  = Existing Engine Use = One of the primary goals of the DIRECT proposal is to develop a new heavy lift rocket in a shorter time frame. When the DIRECT project began in 2006, Shuttle was expected to be operational for another four years or so. DIRECT was planned to use the four-segment Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) unchanged from the Shuttle and to make use of work already underway for the Constellation Project on the RS-68 main engine and J-2X upper stage engine. By 2009, however, there were concerns that the ablatively-cooled RS-68 engine could not survive the intense heat from the nearby SRBs. With this worry and with Shuttle retirement imminent, the DIRECT v3.0 proposal called for using the more expensive regeneratively-cooled, reusable Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) in a disposable role. Three or four SSMEs attached to the bottom of the core tank structure would be discarded in Earth's atmosphere along with the tank. For missions beyond lower Earth orbit, the Jupiter Upper Stage would use six Pratt and Whitney RL10B-2s. Before it can be launched, NASA's proposed Ares I rocket would require both a new, modified five-segment version of the Space Shuttle SRB and the J-2X upper stage engine, a modification of the J-2 engine used on the Saturn V. The proposed Jupiter family could have launched with currently available engines, with the ability to upgrade to a more powerful SRB and J-2X upper stage engine should they become available. = Crew Safety= DIRECT envisioned continued development and operation of NASA's Orion crewed spacecraft, including its Launch Abort System (LAS). In the event of an emergency, the LAS would pull the crew capsule to safety as it would on NASA's Ares I. The DIRECT Team asserted, however, that the Jupiter-130's greater lift capacity - 64 tonnes, versus 25 tonnes for Ares I - would enable the Orion to be designed with more crew safety capability than was planned. For crewed flights to the International Space Station (ISS), DIRECT said the added lift capacity of the Jupiter would allow significant cargo to be carried in a separate module mounted below the Orion spacecraft. Once orbit was reached, the Orion would dock with this module and ferry it to the ISS. By comparison, Ares I would be capable of bringing only the Orion spacecraft to the ISS. DIRECT asserted that flying Orion and a separate payload module on a Jupiter would satisfy the safety concerns raised about flying crew separately from cargo following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, since the Orion capsule would still be able to separate from the launch vehicle and any cargo in the event of a launch abort.  Jupiter vs. Ares I  The DIRECT Team cited a number of particular features that were claimed to make a Jupiter-130 safer than the Ares I: The Jupiter design would re-use the proven method of Space Shuttle of attaching the SRBs to the tankage though an internal structural member. DIRECT says this would avoid the inducing of potentially severe vibration in the vehicle, resulting from a \\"thrust oscillation\\" effect endemic in large solid rockets. This effect became a concern for the Ares I. As with the Space Shuttle, the liquid main engines of a Jupiter-130 would be ignited on the ground and undergo a rapid checkout before SRB ignition and launch. Start- sequence problems could be detected before committing to the launch, and the only vehicle staging event would be the burnout and separation of the SRBs. By comparison, the Ares I launch consists of the immediate ignition of its single SRB first stage, then requires a staging event and ignition at altitude of its cryogenic second stage. While staging is common launch vehicle practice, it introduces safety, risk and reliability concerns, particularly on crewed flights. (The larger Jupiter-246, with its upper stage, would typically include this risk.) The DIRECT Team asserted that the Jupiter-130 and -246, with their multiple main engines, would be capable of reaching orbit even in the event of an engine shutdown. In the Jupiter concept, the crewed Orion spacecraft would be supported by a large aerodynamic fairing. This arrangement would place the Orion at least further away from propellant-filled stages than it would be on an Ares I. DIRECT asserted this would provide a valuable additional \\"buffer space\\" between an exploding vehicle and the crew. The envisioned lift capacity of the Jupiter-130 could allow protective hardware to be mounted inside the payload fairing, below the Orion spacecraft. DIRECT postulated mounting a lightweight shield made from Boron carbide and Kevlar between the spacecraft and the stages below to help protect the crew from shrapnel and other debris from a vehicle explosion.  Jupiter vs. Ares V  The then-current baseline configuration of the Ares V heavy-lift cargo rocket employed six RS-68B main engines and two \\"stretched\\" 5.5segment SRBs. According to NASA, this vehicle design had a Loss of Mission (LOM) risk factor below 1 in 90 and a Loss of Crew (LOC) risk factor below 1 in 850. The ESAS Report specified that an LOC of 1 in 1,000 (a figure estimated to be at least five times higher than the Space Shuttle at program end accounting for the latest safety upgrades) would be the minimum required to be acceptable for human use for any new systems. The DIRECT Team asserted that, because Ares V will not meet NASA's targets regarding human safety, all Ares-based missions would be forced to utilize an Ares I, incurring all of its associated costs for every mission type. However, even the largest Jupiter variant, the DIRECT v2.0 Jupiter-232, was expected to comfortably exceed these targets with an LOC of 1 in 1,162. DIRECT's advocates said that if the DIRECT v3.0 vehicles have similar safety margins, the DIRECT system could offer considerable mission flexibility. Lunar missions could be flown with a pair of powerful two-stage Jupiters instead of one single-stage crew vehicle and one two-stage cargo vehicle.

It took place on 19 June 1987 at the Hipercor shopping centre on Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona, Spain. The bombing killed 21 people and injured 45, the deadliest attack in ETA's history. Controversy surrounded the timing of telephone warnings made before the attack and the authorities' response to them. Background In the two years before the attack, ETA detonated six car bombs in Barcelona that killed three people. Up to this point, Spain's deadliest terrorist attack had been the El Descanso bombing in Madrid by suspected Islamic militants which had killed 18 Spaniards and injured 82 others, including 11 American servicemen, who were believed to have been the target of the attack. The ETA attack which had caused the most fatalities had occurred on 14 July 1986 when a car bomb on Rep√∫blica Dominicana Square in Madrid had killed 12 civil guards and injured 50 people. On 10 June 1987, 10 days before the bombing, ETA's political wing Herri Batasuna had received its highest vote share in the European Parliament elections, becoming the most voted for party in the three Basque provinces. Attack =Preparations= Acting on orders received from the ETA leader Santiago Arrospide Sarasola, \\"Santi Potros\\", three members of ETA's 'Barcelona Commando' Josefa Ernaga, Domingo Troiti√±o and Rafael Caride Sim√≥n, decided to place an incendiary bomb inside a Hipercor store. The three visited various commercial centres and selected one where a car could be parked. They then met in a flat in Calle Casteldefels, Barcelona and assembled a bomb containing 30 kilos of ammonal and 100 litres of gasoline together with a timer device and an indeterminate quantity of glue and flakes of soap to create a bomb weighing up to 200 kilograms. This was then placed in a stolen Ford Sierra. =Bombing= The attack occurred on a Friday afternoon. The car bomb, hidden in the boot of the vehicle, had been placed on the first floor of the three-storey subterranean car park below the commercial centre. At approximately 16:12, a timer activated the bomb which exploded destroying 20 vehicles parked nearby and causing a hole of around 5 metres in diameter in the ground floor of the shopping centre through which a huge ball of flame penetrated. Several of those unaffected by the flames were asphyxiated by the toxic gases produced causing several fatalities. The damage at the scene was so extensive that several of the corpses could not be located until two hours later and some had been burned so severely that identification was impossible. Initially 15 people were killed, of whom ten were women (one of whom was pregnant), three men and two children. However, the death toll then rose to 21, as six victims succumbed to their injuries. Telephone warnings In a subsequent communique ETA said they had given advance warning of the bomb but the police had failed to evacuate the area. The police said that the warning had come only a few minutes before the bomb exploded. The Spanish news agency said a man claiming to speak for ETA had told the Barcelona newspaper Avui 30 minutes before the blast at 16:15 that a bomb would go off in the store. A spokesman at the store said police officers and private security guards began searching the store minutes before the blast. However the store management decided not to evacuate the store as it was not the first time that a bomb threat had been received. Ferran Cardenal, the Barcelona Civil Governor, said at a news conference that the police had searched the building before the bombing but found nothing. Three telephone warnings had been received from a man who claimed to be an ETA spokesman with the first of the calls coming 57 minutes before the explosion. Some relatives said they would sue the police and the Hipercor store for failing to clear the crowded building after receiving the warnings. A store spokesman said it was up to the police to clear a building. But the Government spokesman said the decision was up to management. \\"The building is private property. It's difficult to go against the will of the owners. The police's action was appropriate at all times.\\" Reactions Prime Minister Felipe Gonz√°lez, cut short a visit to Brazil to return to Spain. He told reporters in Salvador, Brazil: \\"This attack is of a different style than what we have seen to date. It is an attempt to force the Government to change tack. But we will not give in to indiscriminate violence. We shall continue fighting terrorism with all the means we have.\\" There was almost universal condemnation of the attack. Some leaders of Batasuna also felt compelled to condemn the attack, although they pointed out that they did so in a personal capacity and not as party spokesmen. An estimated 750,000 people marched through Barcelona with banners declaring, \\"Catalonia Rejects Terrorism\\". Around 700,000 workers paused for five minutes of silence to condemn the attack. While an ETA spokesman apologised for the attack, this apology was criticised, with the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia asking: \\"Does anyone who does not want to kill many people plant a bomb in a supermarket, at a peak hour on a Friday?\\" Following the arrest in 1993 of the bomber Sim√≥n, The Independent noted that \\"The attack was seen by many as a turning-point in the organisation's fortunes, its cold-blooded murder of women and children sickening many Basques who until then had sympathised with the group's aims.\\" Subsequent arrests and trial On 9 September 1987, Domingo Troiti√±o and Josefa Ernaga were detained and on 23 October 1989 both were given sentences of 794 years in prison and fined more than 1,000 million pesetas. The Spanish Central Criminal Court ruled that they had acted in a premeditated manner and had spent a considerable time before the attack weighing up all the possible consequences. Both were ordered to pay 320 million pesetas to the stores and to 114 people who had been injured in the attack. Additionally they were ordered to pay 525 million pesetas by way of civil responsibility to the families of those who had been killed and 200,650,000 pesetas to another 45 people who had been injured in the bombing. At the trial Troiti√±o and Ernaga attempted to justify their actions, stating that they had only intended to incinerate the stores, not cause deaths, although they were aware there were inhabited buildings at the back of Hipercor. In 1993, Rafael Caride Sim√≥n was arrested in France. Spanish police alleged that Caride Sim√≥n had been the former head of ETA's so- called \\"Barcelona Commando\\" and had planned the Hipercor attack. On 23 July 2003 he was sentenced to 790 years in prison for carrying out the attack, while at the same trial, Santi Potros received the same sentence for ordering the attack.

Directly across from the station is the steep Old Lonan Church Road which eventually accesses the pack horse lane that leads to the Groudle Glen Railway and it is this road that the locomotives and larger equipment are delivered to the diminutive line on. Namesake The house from which the stopping place takes its name is itself dominated by topiary in the shape of a peacock and was once the dwelling of Richard Maltby Broadbent, the entrepreneur who developed the nearby glen and railway. The house is of unusual style, including mock-Tudor gables and red brick construction, with modern garages to its side. Marketing The stopping place was never officially marked until 1999 when a bus-type totem sign was erected on one of the traction poles to denote its presence. It is little used and not mentioned in the railway's timetable literature, although the 13/13A service of Bus Vannin serves the route on the parallel road.

Rohl is also a musician and sound engineer, and a member of the band Mandalaband. He lives in the Marina Alta, Spain.  Biography  Rohl traces his fascination with ancient Egypt to a visit to that country at the age of nine, which featured a journey on the Nile on King Farouk's paddle-steamer. He first worked as a rock musician, forming a band in 1968, (Sign of Life, later Ankh), which was signed by Vertigo, but split up after Vertigo rejected the finished product. In 1969/70 Rohl completed an Institute of Incorporated Photographers degree at the University of Manchester,David Rohl, CV, Davidrohl.com, accessed 6 August 2009 before forming a new group, Mandalaband, which released two albums, Mandalaband (1975 - \\"an ambitious concept inspired by the Chinese occupation of Tibet\\"Barclay James Harvest, David Rohl accessed 6 August 2009) and The Eye of Wendor (1978). About 1974, Rohl started work as a sound engineer, ultimately becoming chief engineer at Strawberry Studios, the Stockport home of the group 10cc. Royalties from four solo artist and composing recording contracts enabled him to retire from music and focus on Egyptology, in particular to develop the New Chronology which he had been working on for five years during his music career.Sussex Egyptology Society, accessed 6 August 2009 In 1985 Rohl became the first Director of the Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences (ISIS), and editor of its Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum from 1986. In 1988 he was accepted by University College London and awarded the prestigious W. F. Masom History Research Scholarship by the University of London as well as being awarded a BA in Ancient History and Egyptology in 1990. He is a past President of the Sussex Egyptology Society (SES) and edited The Followers of Horus: Eastern Desert Survey Report.Toby Wilkinson, The Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2001, Treasures in an antique land The publication of his book, A Test of Time led to his role in a three-part television documentary, \\"Pharaohs and Kings: A Biblical Quest\\", which appeared late summer 1995 on Channel 4 in the UK, and spring 1996 on The Learning Channel/Discovery in the USA. Following a thirty- year break from music composition and production, Rohl reformed a new incarnation of Mandalaband to release the first album of a two-part progressive rock concept work, BC - Ancestors, in 2009, and followed by its partner album, AD - Sangreal, in 2011. BC - Ancestors follows the Old Testament story of humanity from the Garden of Eden through to the birth of the Roman Empire. According to the 2015 documentary Patterns of Evidence: Exodus, in which Rohl discusses his research about the New Chronology of the ancient Near East, David Rohl is agnostic. New Chronology The New Chronology is an alternative chronology of the ancient Near East created by Rohl. It involves a major revision of the conventional chronology of ancient Egypt, in particular by redating Egyptian kings of the 19th through 25th Dynasties. Rohl asserts that the New Chronology allows scholars to identify some of the main characters in the Old Testament with people whose names appear in archaeological finds. The New Chronology has not gained acceptance among most Egyptologists. Garden of Eden Eden and adjacent areas after Rohl In addition to his theories on Egypt, Rohl has put forth other theories related to the Old Testament. In his published work, Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation, he posits a location for the legendary Garden of Eden in Iranian Azerbaijan, in the vicinity of Tabriz upon which the Genesis tradition was based. According to Rohl, the Garden of Eden was then located in a long valley to the north of Sahand volcano, near Tabriz. He cites several geographical similarities and toponyms which he believes match the biblical description. These similarities include: the nearby headwaters of the four rivers of Eden, the Tigris (Heb. Hiddekel, Akk. Idiqlat), Euphrates (Heb. Perath, Akk. Purattu), Gaihun-Aras (Heb., Gihon), and Uizun (Heb. Pishon); the mountain range of Kusheh Dagh (the land of Cush); and Upper and Lower Noqdi (the Land of Nod). In the same work, he develops a local flood theory for the Genesis Flood, positing that the biblical reference to the covering of \\"all the high mountains\\" is merely a description of the flooding of cities in the plains of Mesopotamia on the basis that the Hebrew word 'har' does not just mean 'mountain' but also 'hill' and 'city mound'. In his book From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible, Eric H. Cline, writing about Rohl's suggestion for the location of Eden, says \\"his suggestions have not caught on with the scholarly establishment. His argument is not helped by the fact that it depends upon speculations regarding the transmission of place-names for both the various rivers and nearby related areas from antiquity to the present. In the end, while Rohl‚Äôs suggestion is not out of the question, it seems no more probable than any other hypothesis, and less likely than those suggested by Speiser, Zarins, and Sauer.\\" Works =Books= *Published in the US as  Published in paperback as  =Videos= * Three-part documentary shown 1995 on Channel 4 in the UK and in the spring of 1996 on The Discovery Channel in the US.

The name was adopted in June 2009 to replace Isle of Man Transport. The company was founded on 1 October 1976,Isle of Man National Transport 1977 - 2009 The Classic Manx Buses as National Transport, which was an amalgamation of two other operating companies. History Lord Street bus station in 1961 Northern Counties bodied AEC Regent III in April 1961 Guy Otter in September 1961 Mercedes-Benz Citaro at Port Erin in September 2014 The first omnibus services on the island were provided by the Manxland Bus Co Limited, in addition to several smaller operators which operated independently. The primary means of longer-distance travel were the Isle of Man Railway to the west, south and north (via the west side of the island) and the Manx Electric Railway on the east coast. When bus competition became a threat to the Isle of Man Railway, it bought out the bus company and operated it as Isle of Man Road Services in conjunction with the railway. In addition to the island-wide services, Douglas Corporation also operated a fleet of buses around the capital, distinctive by their yellow livery. As the railway company began to falter, it relied more heavily on the bus operation, and when the railway lines closed for the first time in 1965 the bus services were intensified to replace the rail services. The vehicles of Road Services carried an all-over red livery with two off-white bands, and the Railway Company crest was modified to include a facsimile of a bus instead of a railway locomotive. The buses of Douglas Corporation, which only operated within the borough, carried an all-over yellow livery with two red bands and corporation crest. Both operators used the bus station on Lord Street in Douglas as their base. Today, this site has been given over to a car park, whilst buses use roadside lay-bys on Lord Street itself. The two companies operated services independently from this site until the operations began to falter in the early 1970s at which time government intervention was required to ensure continued operation. =Nationalisation= When the service was bought by the Isle of Man government in 1976 the buses carried National Transport logos and a new livery, predominantly of red with white trim, having previously carried a variation of this colour scheme under the Road Services banner. The publicly-owned service used many second-hand vehicles from England, a practice which continued until relatively recently, from a variety of sources including Liverpool Corporation, Preston Borough Transport and Ribble Motor Services. Such vehicle types included Leyland Atlanteans from Merseyside PTE, Portsmouth Transit, SELNEC and Tyne & Wear PTE, Leyland Olympians from Devon General, Dublin Bus and Stagecoach, and Leyland Lynxs from Halton Transport. By 1987, when a new management scheme was under way, a revised livery of cream and red was introduced, and Isle of Man Transport adopted as the title, using a similar design motif to all the island's government departments including a triskelion motif. During this period the buses carried a variety of advertisements along their side panels, with several distinctive buses carrying all-over advertising for local businesses including the Gaiety Theatre, Lombard Bank, Curraghs Wildlife Park and the National Coal Board. A further change of leadership in 1999 saw the introduction of brand-new buses and gradual phasing out of older stock, latterly used only on school services, and the advertising policy changed resulting in no advertisements appearing at all. By 2009 a further change of policy resulted in the reintroduction of advertisements which has proved popular, with local radio stations, estate agents, travel agents and cinemas taking advantage of the new schemes. Branding The government-owned bus service on the island came into being in 1976 as National Transport, taking over from both the Road Services (a subsidiary of the Isle of Man Railway Company) and Douglas Corporation Transport, operated by the municipal authority. The vehicles were liveried in an all-over red colour scheme, later changed to include wide white banding; although with the fleet consisting of a wide selection of different second hand vehicles the uniform appearance was not successful. By 1987 the white banding had become cream in colour, and the full Isle of Man Transport name was added to all vehicles. During the period up to 1997 advertising panels were carried on the sides of some vehicles, and, in certain cases, all-over advertising was used (see above). In April 2009, eleven new Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvo B9TLs were added to the fleet, carrying a maroon and cream livery with the Bus Vannin branding which is now used in all literature and timetabling information. Not all of the fleet carries this new livery, however the Wright StreetLites that entered service in 2010 were delivered in the new livery although the overall colour scheme is largely cream with some maroon detailing, the opposite of the 2009 deliveries. In 2010 Hullad Oie (Night Owl) late night services were introduced into the timetable; they operate at weekends into the early hours, serving the satellite towns from Douglas departing at about midnight. Totems at bus stops are in the process of being updated to the new maroon scheme. Text also appears in Manx Gaelic on these, and digital destination displays on the vehicles also have an option to show the place names in the language as well. Between 2011 and 2013, thirty Mercedes-Benz Citaro LE single deckers were delivered; these are presented in a silver-grey livery with Bus Vannin decals - this being the new standard livery for all buses in the Bus Vannin fleet. The bus service continues to be operated by the government but is now more clearly segregated from the railways, which are now called Isle of Man Heritage Railways though they remain managed by the same group. Operations =Bus stations= Ramsey Bus Station in September 2014 There are three bus depots on the island which provide passenger facilities and storage areas for off-duty buses. At Port Erin and at Ramsey, these are combined at one location, while in Douglas the Banks Circus site has a workshop and bus yard, with no passenger facilities. The passenger facilities provided at all the bus stations are limited, and some facilities are only open at certain times of the day. *Douglas (Lord Street): shelters only *Port Erin (Station Road): toilets, waiting area *Ramsey (Princes Road): toilets, waiting room =Depots= Port Erin depot in July 2009 In the past there was a depot in Laxey, the site later being occupied by Princes Motors and vehicle storage yards are also located next to the depots at Port Erin and Ramsey. A depot in Peel closed in 2010. The garage and facilities in Ramsey were taken over from the original Manxland Omnibus Company, and have remained in bus company ownership ever since. The yard at Port Erin is on the site of former railway platforms whilst the original garage now houses the Port Erin Railway Museum which opened in 1975; the current garage was built as a replacement the following year and remains open today. *Douglas (Banks Circus) *Port Erin (Station Road) *Ramsey (Princes Road) Routes A wide range of routes are operated by Bus Vannin. Many of them are operated on a regular daily timetable, such as routes from Douglas to the other towns on the island and also local services around Douglas and Onchan. There are some routes however which are operated less frequently on certain days of the week to smaller villages around the island. From September 2009 night bus services were introduced to Port Erin and Port St Mary (N1), Ramsey (N3) and Peel (N5). These services are operated on Fridays and Saturdays only. The most recent timetable change came into effect in April 2019. Ticketing and fares Rail tickets purchased for the Isle of Man Railway between Douglas and Port Erin and also those for the Manx Electric Railway between Douglas and Ramsey are valid on buses. Bus tickets, however, are not valid on the heritage railways. The latest timetable update was released in April 2019. Current (April 2019) ticket options are: 1\\\\.

Career  He was born at Fort Ellice in present-day Manitoba, the son of William McKay and Mary Cook, and was educated there, in Westbourne and at St. John's College at the University of Manitoba. While at St. John's, he won, in 1877, the Dufferin Bronze Medal for Ancient and Modern History. McKay articled in law and was called to the Manitoba bar in 1886.

It is based on the principle of rotational grinding and serves to grind rails at up to .  Background  Since roughly the beginning of the 1990s, rail network operators have experienced increasing problems with rail surface defects. Head checks, squats, corrugation and slip waves all contribute to higher maintenance costs, intensified noise pollution, traffic obstructions, and ultimately a shortened rail lifespan. These increasingly common flaws are exacerbated by the growing density and speed of both freight and passenger traffic. The direct consequence of these problems is a growing need for rail maintenance. The primary challenge for modern rail maintenance is that less time is available to perform it due to higher traffic densities. Conventional rail maintenance machines (e.g. rail milling, planing or grinding) working at speeds from can work only during possession time (track closure) which is in most cases available only at night. HSG allows for working speeds of up to and is deployable within regular traffic. It comes under non-traditional machining operations.  Principle  Principle of high-speed grinding HSG is based on the principle of circumferential grinding. Cylindrical grinding stones are pulled over the rail at an angle, inducing rotation as well as an axial grinding motion. The grinding stones are mounted on grinding units hauled by a carrier vehicle. Two things are achieved with this motion: First, the required material removal rate is obtained through the relative motion between grinding stone and rail. Second, by rotating the stones, overheating, glazing and uneven wear of the stones is prevented. The usual grinding speed on Deutsche Bahn's rail network is .  Implementation  Today two machines using HSG technology exist. Both are operated by Stahlberg Roensch. The larger machine, RC01, has four grinding units, each with 24 grinding stones. A smaller machine using one grinding unit with 16 grinding stones is also in use. RC01 is used on main line and high speed tracks of DB Netz AG, while the smaller version is deployed mostly on commuter and metro rail networks.

The current parish boundary encloses a mixed residential, industrial and rural area south of the River Can, east of the River Wid and mostly to the west of the Great Eastern Main Line. Toponymy Widford is first recorded in 1216 (as Witford); the later 13th century forms Wydiford and Wydeford show that derivation from \\"withig\\" (by the willows) is probable. The name of the River Wid is a later back formation. History In early times the area was inhabited by the Iceni and later by the East Saxons. In 1329, the manor of Widford was held by Edward of Woodstock, Earl of Kent; and it afterwards passed to the Mortimer, Bacon, Altham, and other families. =Account of Widford in 1848= White‚Äôs Directory of Essex, published in 1848, describes Widford as ‚Äòa small parish on the London road‚Äô (the old Roman road which has become the A414, Widford Road & Moulsham Street). It contained of land, and about 190 inhabitants. When the census was taken in July 1841, its population had been swelled by railway labourers to 362. Widford village had about 300 occupants, but appeared to have been split so that some of it was in Chelmsford parish. John Attwood MP owned most of the land and lord of the manor. The description from 1848 goes on to say that he ‚Äòhas a handsome seat here, called Hylands on the western acclivity of the valley, commanding extensive views. Though the house was large and handsome, he is now erecting a more elegant and spacious mansion. The park and pleasure grounds are extensive and beautiful. The old house was erected by Chief Justice John Comyns, Kt, in about 1730, and was much improved by the late P. C. Labouchere, Esq. Mr. Attwood is one of the parliamentary representatives of Harwich.‚Äô The description of the village goes on ‚Äòthe Church (St. Mary) is a small neat structure of mixed architecture, but evidently of Saxon origin. The wooden turret, at the west end, has two bells, and is crowned by a small spire. There is a chapel belonging to the lord of the manor, and near it is a monument in memory of Viscountess Falkland. The rectory, valued in K.B. at ¬£8, and in 1831, at ¬£225, is in the patronage of J Attwood and incumbency of the Rev William Buswell BA, who has a good residence, which he has lately much improved. The tithes were commuted in 1838, for ¬£257 per annum. Mr. Attwood built a Schoolhouse in the church yard in 1843. In 1776, Lady Falkland left ¬£200 to this parish, to provide for a weekly contribution of bread among the pool attending the church. To increase this charity, the Rev John Saunders left ¬£100 in 1814. These bequests now form a fund of ¬£379.4s.9d. three per cent Consols, and the dividends are applied in a weekly distribution of 17 threepenny loaves. In 1738, Benjamin Sarjant left ¬£100 three per cent. Reduced Annuities, in trust, to apply the dividends yearly in clothing, for two poor widows, and two poor widowers.‚Äô =Notable buildings= The 1881 map of the area appears to show five buildings of significance: Hylands House, Widford Hall, Widford Lodge, St Mary‚Äôs church and the workhouse. *Hylands Park and House is now in the ownership of Chelmsford City Council and its history is well documented.

It has been converted to offices and is surrounded by Widford Industrial Estate. *Widford Lodge remains too. On its sale in 1933 it was described as ‚Äòa freehold estate comprising residence which includes billiard room, 6 principal bedrooms, 3 garages, outbuildings including stables, kennels, greenhouses, two tennis courts, gardens and park lands, gardener's or chauffeur's cottages, in total 18 acres with extensive frontages to the main Chelmsford to London road, and to Wood Street‚Äô.

He was also an officer in the Royal Air Force Special Reserve, and the Auxiliary Air Force. Although he qualified as a mining engineer the lure of flying proved too strong, and he did not enter the family mining company. During the war he became an important test pilot for aircraft manufacturer Hawker Siddeley. Having tested some of the early jet aircraft, he retired from test flying in 1948, becoming a sales executive for Hawker. He is the grandfather of British television presenter Kate Humble. Early life Humble was born on 14 April 1911, the son of William Humble senior, a mining engineer and mine owner in the South Yorkshire coalfield, and also associated with the Staveley Coal and Iron Company. Humble was educated at Repton School and the University of Cambridge, following his father in qualifying as a mining engineer in 1930. He learnt to fly in the Auxiliary Air Force in 1929 (while still at university), and on 27 July 1930 he was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation in the Special Reserve of the Royal Air Force, his rank was confirmed on 25 October 1931, and he was promoted flying officer on 27 January 1932. He was a founder member of No. 504 (City of Nottingham) Squadron, and during this period received flying instruction from Arthur Marshall. He transferred to the Reserve of Air Force Officers, Class A on 16 May 1932. In 1935 he entered the King's Cup Air Race, flying a Miles Hawk, he would enter again on several subsequent occasions. On 24 April 1936 he transferred to the Auxiliary Air Force, becoming a founder pilot of No. 609 (West Riding) (Bomber) Squadron, he returned to the Reserve of Officers on 31 August 1937. He married for the first time in 1936, but divorced just a few years later. Test pilot Hawker Tempest I prototype HM599 Following the outbreak of the Second World War Humble was invited to join Hawker Siddeley's team of test pilots, taking up the role on 10 October 1940. The testing team was led by George Bulman and Philip Lucas. Humble was initially involved in testing Hurricanes as they came off the production line at the rate of seven a day. Having proven his ability, he was soon assigned to help test and develop new aircraft types, initially the Hawker Typhoon, and then later types derived from it, the Hawker Tempest, Hawker Fury and Sea Fury. The Typhoon became particularly important as a \\"tank-buster\\" during the Normandy Campaign, and the Tempest in the fight against the V-1 flying bomb. Development of the Fury was a particularly difficult experience. The aircraft could approach the sound barrier in a dive, causing unexpected handling problems; the Bristol Centaurus engine was also still relatively new and experienced many problems, on more than one occasion it was only Humble's skill as a pilot which prevented a crash. Bulman had retired towards the end of the war, Lucas then became Hawker's chief test pilot. In mid-1945, Lucas was promoted to the board of the company, and in early January 1946, Humble was appointed the new chief test pilot. Hawker now moved into the jet age, with Humble making the first test flight of the Hawker P.1040 from Boscombe Down on 2 September 1947. This ultimately entered service as the Hawker Sea Hawk. Later life and legacy Humble retired from testing in 1948, remaining with Hawker as a sales executive. He continued to give demonstration flights, and his skill as a display pilot is credited with helping to win Hawker sales. His main sales territory was the Middle East, and he spent much time in Egypt, Lebanon and Cyprus. According to his obituary in The Times he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1949. He returned to the United Kingdom permanently in the late 1980s when his health began to deteriorate. He died on 1 March 1992, survived by his second wife, Georgina, his son (by his first wife) and his daughter. In an episode of the BBC television programme, Who Do You Think You Are?, first broadcast on 29 July 2009, TV presenter Kate Humble investigated her family history, starting by finding out more about her grandfather, Bill Humble. During a visit to the RAF Museum at Hendon, she was shown film footage of her grandfather flying, and spoke to one of his former colleagues, Captain Eric 'Winkle' Brown.

His follow-up, Eko Ree, won first prize at the 2004 contest. As a journalist, he has written columns for several Nigerian newspapers. Olorunfemi works professionally as a television producer. He has been credited on several popular local shows, and was nominated as TV producer of the year in 1991. Background Simbo Olorunfemi received his general education at Federal Government College, Idoani and a political science degree from Ondo State University. He then studied to become a journalist at the Nigerian Institute of Journalism, and later earned a master's degree in international Law and diplomacy from the University of Lagos. At the age of 15, Olorunfemi wrote his first novel, The Cardinal Mafia. Career =Poet= Olorunfemi first published work, Rhythm of the Coins, was described by Nigerian journalist May Ellen Ezekiel Mofe- Damijo as \\"an endearing work\\" with \\"clear, simple, and easy to understand\\" language. Reprinted in Rhythm of the Coins preface. The Punch described the book as \\"a simple, lucid, and reflective work of art,\\" while the Daily Champion called it \\"a promise that the Nigerian literary scene is not entirely off-course.\\" Rhythm of the Coins was shortlisted for the 1993 Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) Poetry Prize, earning an honourable mention. Rhythm of the Coins was followed by the highly anticipated poetry collection Eko Ree (This is Lagos) in 2004. Those expected in attendance at the book's launch included the Executive Governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Dr. Bode Olajumoke, and Chief Segun Olusola, among others. The collection uses simple language to portray Lagos State as a place where inhabitants eke out livings in highly unusual ways. In his introduction to the book, cultural affairs officer Ambrocio Lopez writes \\"I believe Simbo has magnificently captured the pulse of life of the city... [he presents] urban conversations that challenge us to examine our very being.\\" Eko Ree: The Many Faces of Lagos took first place in the 2004 ANA/Cadbury Poetry Prize competition. The accompanying $1000 prize was the largest awarded by the competition. The judging panel described it as \\"a candid but graphic reflection on the many faces of Lagos\\" adding \\"Eko Ree is distinctly impressive... The collection is engaging, the title is apt and captures the metaphor of Lagos life.\\" Writing for Vanguard, Uzor Uzoatu strongly disagreed with the judges, writing \\"no so- called poem in the collection is anywhere near successful... Eko Ree contains the lightest verses you ever read anywhere since kindergarten, words that are neither sublime nor solid.\\" Uzoatu's criticism drew a response from Ayodeji Fashikun of This Day. Olorunfemi himself poked fun at the critique during his official acceptance speech. In 2007, Olorunfemi released his third book, Singing in the Rain, through Raider Publishing International. His work was selected for inclusion in the 2009 anthology of Nigerian Poetry Lagos of the Poets. Olorunfemi's works have been translated to Hindi and German. =Journalist= Olorunfemi has written columns for newspapers and magazines including TheNEWS, The PM News, and The Independent on Sunday. =Television= Olorunfemi works professionally as a television producer. As a producer, he has numerous credits including the TV talk show MEE & YOU and the news program The Globe This Week, which ran for three years on Nigerian TV station Lagos Television (LTV 8), Ikeja. In 1991, he was nominated as TV producer of the year at the Nigerian Media Merit Awards (NMMAs).

The Independent has noted Blues & Soul as being the equal of magazines such as NME and Q. Billboard magazine has called Blues & Soul \\"a respected publication.\\" History John Abbey, a devotee of American R&B; music, established a magazine entitled Home of the Blues in 1966. This came about while Abbey was working for a travel agency in London. The magazine went on to publish its own musical charts, cover events and clubs and feature reviews, interviews and other musical articles. Blues & Soul's R&B; charts were compiled via a poll record sales throughout Britain. The publication soon gained further popularity in the UK and Europe covering genres of music such as soul, R&B;, dance, jazz, hip hop, reggae and world music. With issue number 12 the magazine's title was changed to Blues & Soul. In addition to Abbey's contributions, material was provided by writers such as former Motown press officer Sharon Davis and British soul fan Dave Godin. Within a June 1970 column of Blues & Soul, Godin went on to coin the term \\"Northern soul\\". The business gradually expanded and Abbey set up an associated record label called Contempo Records, which released the UK's first 12-inch singles. Abbey moved to Atlanta, Georgia in the mid-1970s and established Ichiban Records, while the editorship of the magazine was taken over by Bob Killbourn in 1979. Another important contributor, David Nathan, began writing for Blues & Soul in the early 1970s, first in London, then from 1975 as the magazine's principal New York correspondent.\\"David Nathan\\", Rock's Backpages (Retrieved 11 June 2015). Blues & Souls charts, from the start of such, became increasingly popular within the UK. During 1979, DJ Pete Tong started being a journalist at Blues & Soul. Within the following year, he became the features editor of the magazine. Fellow UK publication Black Music was also absorbed in April 1984 by Blues & Soul. Blues & Soul has also, from its inception, bestowed awards to artistes based upon an annual readers poll. By 2006, the magazine had published 1000 issues. The magazine returned in printed form in August 2010 with a special vintage edition. In July 2011, Blues & Soul was relaunched permanently in print as a two-monthly magazine alongside its ongoing presence online, helmed by editor Lee Tyler plus assistant editor (and long-time contributor) Pete Lewis.

Biography Eliahu Gulkowitz (later Gat) at was born in 1919 in the small town of Dokshitz in what is now Belarus, to a Lithuanian Jewish Zionist family. In 1926, the family resettled in Poland, where Gat attended a Polish gymnasium. In 1937, he immigrated to Mandate Palestine and studied architecture at the Technion in Haifa. From 1939 to 1942, he joined Kibbutz Nir Haim and Maoz Haim. During this period, he also worked as a dockhand and seaman in Haifa port. In 1942, he joined the British Army, serving in Palestine and North Africa until 1946. In 1945, while still a soldier, he studied for a year at Aharon Avni‚Äôs painting studio. When he was transferred to Cairo, he enrolled in the Cairo Academy of Art, taking courses sponsored by the British Army. Following his discharge, he painted at the Stematsky ‚Äì Streichman studio. In 1948-1949, he served in the Israel Defense Forces. Artistic career  Gat was among the founders of the Group of Ten, which held its first exhibition in February 1951 at Beit HaOmanim in Tel Aviv, home of the Israeli Artists Association. The group consisted of Gat, Elhanan Halperin, Shoshanah Levisohn, Ephraim Lifshits, Moshe Propes, Shimon Zabar, Dan Kedar, Claire Yaniv, Nissan Rilov and Zvi Tadmor ‚Äì all graduates of the Stematsky-Streichman studio. The two participating sculptors were Shoshanah Heiman and David Polombo. The philosophy of the group was to paint the local Israeli scene realistically, as opposed to the abstract art and universalism of the New Horizons group.Information Center for Israeli Art: Eliahu Gat Influences In 1952, Gat traveled to France on a Government grant. He studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts under Souverbie together with Michael Gross and Ori Reisman. Gat‚Äôs letters from his sojourn in Paris testify to his artistic confusion and to his spiritual and physical tribulations: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I taught I would paint a little in the evenings and bought a blue lamp, but so far I haven‚Äôt succeeded. You can understand the difficulties, after a day‚Äôs work, and especially in a room with no atmosphere, in addition to the confusion I feel about painting in general.‚Äù The artists he mentions in his letters, tough notably disparate in style and approach, represent the divergences that were to mark Gat‚Äôs own work in the future. He admired Bernard Buffet, a young artist who was then enjoying a social and artistic success in Paris. ‚Äú‚Ä¶By the way, Buffet is head and shoulders above everyone else. His exhibition was very impressive and he already has a following.‚Äù Another artist mentioned by Gat was Chaim Soutine. ‚ÄúSoutine, in terms of stature, is fit to stand side by side with the great classicists‚Ä¶Mourjansky has promised me to Katia Granoff so that I can view fifteen Soutines. He is one of the artists I understand the least, but who impresses me the most. By the way, Israeli art suffers from Soutinism, but not of the healthy kind.‚Äù A trip to Spain and a visit to the Prado yielded the following impressions: ‚ÄúYou walk round and round and each painting is better than the last. I could stay here for months and study. What a lightness of touch there is in the colour handling of Titian and Tintoretto; it is practically a sketch, and yet it is so deep. Some works could even be called Titian Impressionism ‚Äì brushwork and light translucent layers of paint.‚Äù Gat‚Äôs interest in Soutine and in the free impressionist approach of the venetian artists also serves as an indication of his future artistic direction.  ‚ÄúThe Group of Ten‚Äù exhibitions / realism  In April 1953, Gat, together with others of the \\"Group of Ten‚Äù participated in an exhibition of drawings by young artists at the Tel Aviv Museum, and in the summer of 1953 the members of the group held an exhibition at the artists House in Tel Aviv. They were then called ‚ÄúThe Group of Nine.‚Äù The group‚Äôs image was now defined by its penchant for realism and by its self-presentation as an antithesis to ‚Äòall for modernism,‚Äô ‚Äòabstractionism‚Äô and ‚Äòuniversalim in art‚Äô. ‚ÄúOne of the ‚ÄúNine‚Äù published an open letter in the press to the effect that ‚Äúwe are all committed to the idea that the way to achievement is through the adherence to reality, i.e., to our daily life in Eretz Israel‚Ä¶ We have floated in the heavens of so- called modernism (which is no longer modern anyway) and we are reurning to the palpable earth.‚Äù The writer attacks the abstract: ‚ÄúAn unhealthy atmosphere has pervaded many of our art circles, and escape from the real into the abstract and the cosmopolitan by obliterating any identifying feature of time or place‚Ä¶ to adhere to that trend here in this country and in these times of acute social crisis is merely to copy obsolete things from an alien reality‚Ä¶‚Äù On formalism he says: ‚ÄúOur problems are not of creating forms, but of giving shape to a particular content‚Ä¶ We belong to this land, and we love it for better or worse. Why should we distort the image of the people we see and live with‚Ä¶ Why should we make mathematical calculations or formal trickery out of our landscape, cities, villages or maabarot, when they are of profound significance in their realistic forms?‚Äù The article was written from a distinctly class-conscious viewpoint: ‚ÄúThe time has come to pay our debt to society, to transform art from a luxury, snob-value item for the elite, to a product for the masses. It is time for labourers, farmers and people of all social strata to come to a painting exhibition and like what they see and feel that it belongs to them.‚Äù The writer concludes by opposing ‚ÄúNew Horizons‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGroup of Nine‚Äù: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Should you parachute a person into a ‚ÄòNew Horizons‚Äô exhibition, he would not know which country he had fallen into, nor the period of its art. Undefined and cosmopolitan, the works float beyond time and place, beyond life‚Äôs problems.‚Äù Artistic style Gat was enamoured of colours containing ‚ÄúOriental‚Äù characteristics such as is prominent in Islamic decorative art. In the years following, though he continued to show his work in the exhibitions of the Group of Ten, his paintings became dark and monochromatic, composed of controlled light and dark contrasts. The forms were now delineated by heavy contour lines and the composition was based on a plastic rhyming of lines and a repetition of vectors. Lines used in two planes, unifying near and far, emphasized the flatness of the depicted space. The artist tended towards a treatment of architectonic themes such as the facades or roofs of houses and, as strange as this may seem in light of the ideology of the group, his paintings became increasingly stylized and abstract. One influence in evidence here is Gat's architectural background. Another is that of the French painter Souverbie under whom he studied. The transformation apparent in Gat's work during these years is better understood against the background of the shift in the attitude to abstractionism and modernism in the mid-1950s. The leftist ideology, which at the beginning of decade had preached an art engage, adherence to realism and a non-elitist and non-individualistic approach, lost much of its vitality (among other things due to the change in relationship of the \\"Progressive Culture\\" circle to the Soviet Union and the 1954 split in Mapam). A greater number of Israelis, including artists, traveled to Europe where they witnessed the popularity of abstract art. Art criticism and polemics, which now began to filter in from the West with greater frequency via journals and visiting art critics, reinforced this notion, The charisma of \\"New Horizons was such that from an oppositional fighting force in the early fifties it had evolved into an influential group not unpopular with the art establishment. With this in mind, the course os artists who began as realists but who, by the end of the 1950s, went over to the abstract, is more intelligible. The last exhibition of the \\"Group of Ten\\" took place in 1960 at the Tel Aviv Museum. Abstract Art / \\"Tazpit\\" Gat's abstract painting from 1961/2 constitutes a sharp, unequivocal stylistic turnabout, an open departure from his work of the immediate past. He began experimenting with aquarelles on paper, based on random dabbing, a liquid effect and the spraying of paint. The compositions lack definite direction and have no reference to up, down, right or left. The only figurative notation is the existence of a central area, more intensive in relation to the periphery in terms of colour. The degree of abstraction in these paintings is greater than that achieved by many veteran Israeli abstractionists. The last works of this phase contain geometric forms reminiscent of rows of houses. In the same period Gat joined various organizations of abstract painters, the most important of which was that resulting in the \\"Tazpit\\" exhibition (Israeli painting and sculpture) at the Tel Aviv Museum in 1964. The \\"Tazpit\\" exhibition was born of a feeling that abstract artists lacked a central exhibition space in which to show their works. Among its initiators were artists who had recently returned to the country (Yigael Tumarkin), members of \\"New Horizons,\\" members of the \\"Group of Ten\\" who had gone over to abstract art and others. The exhibition manifest challenged \\"the use of external impressions and an external depiction of objects and figures.\\" It declared that \\"the obscuring of values, the 'return' to folkloristic localism, and the so-called hankering after 'Israeliness' would create a counter group of artists who, in contrast to nostalgic, touristic exotica and commercializing of Jewish consciousness, would search for pure plastic values appropriate to our times.\\" The paintings Gat showed in \\"Tazpit\\" were a first stage in his return to the figurative. Already in 1963, he exhibited what were called \\"abstract landscapes\\" at the Dugit Gallery in Tel Aviv. In them, the line of the horizon was very high or even absent (landscape without sky). Most of the paintings were inspired by Ein Kerem and Safed, arid landscapes penetrated here and there by paths which dictate the pictorial rhythm. Their texture is rich despite their predominantly monochromatic colour. The landscape becomes part of an encompassing form which, rather than relate to a particular subject, reconstructs nature. Its details become colour happenings, sprouting organically out of the paint. The different patches of the painting carry equal weight and project a uniform energy, a pictorial translation of the mountain's burning haze. The brushwork, applied in a wide smooth sweep or in short rhythmic dabs' provides the direction, kneads the material texture and creates the forms, all at the same time. At some points paint has been sprayed in a fashion similar to that in the abstract aquarelles, and spontaneous colour patches are added to the hasty weave of the brush, to create a vibrating, glowing and sensual texture of paint and earth. The technical and formal lessons of abstract painting, the result of many years of drawing in nature, to create a unity of feeling, painting and landscape painting. The critics (Yoav Bar El, Ha'aretz), evaluating these works' found in them distinctive local values, and an \\"explicit Israeli identity, the peace and dusty quiet of the country's landscape, \\" in the nature depictions. This phase in Gat's work, which continued until the late 1960s, gave expression to his deep need to combine the spontaneous, based on an \\"erotic\\" identification with the subject, with a controlled composition created from an accumulation of technical information, from a vocabulary comprising brushwork and colour combinations. Whereas Zaritsky, Streichman and Stematsky use the landscape as a formal core from which lyrical abstract shapes grow, in Gat's abstract-like paintings the lyricism itself (the liquidity, the quivering of the brush) is born of the inspiration of the landscape. Unlike Zaritsky and Streichman, he remains umbilically tied to the landscape to the end of the painting process. In the 1970s and 1980s, Gat would try to separate between the different components of the painting ‚Äì between the details of the landscape, between the figures and the landscape, between image and background ‚Äì to try to remove them from the context of abstraction, from a system whose danger lies in its tendency to impose itself arbitrarily on reality. Rather than anchor his work in a method, he chose to utilize the experience of reality, i.e., to return to a kind of realism. Gat's view of the process of painting as an adventure may explain his frequent reversals and shifts in direction. The exhaustion of a particular stage in his artistic development immediately spurs him to a change of approach. The realism of the 1970s and 1980s/ Landscapes Gat's landscapes of the 1970s and 1980s represent the artist's familiar haunts: Safed, Zikhron Yaakov, the Jerusalem Hills, Sinai. The angle of vision is high so that the landscape extends flat and panoramic on the canvas with a very narrow strip of sky. This type of composition which is also found, as noted, in his work from the late 1950s, had crystallized in his \\"abstract landscapes\\" of the mid-1960s. Though rendered in an impressionist technique, Gat's landscapes are not picturesque. His mode of landscape depiction is that of the sublime. It expresses his intoxication with nature and infinity, with the emotional response to nature. The sense of freedom gained by the open landscape, the affinity with it, the yielding of the landscape to the artist, the mutual relationship between nature and the experiencing agent ‚Äì these form the basis of Gat's artistic experience. The sun in Gat's paintings burns from within the earth, lending it its light. (\\"the light is in the earth, the sky is leaden, that's why I didn‚Äôt leave room for sky,\\" he said). Color / Composition Gat applies the impressionist principle that contrasting or complementary colors placed one beside the other in equal intensity radiate a strong, vibrating, multifaceted light. Gat is a \\"practical theorist\\" of color and is connected to the impressionist tradition which does not recognize black as color and translates the value contrast of light and shade into color differences. Such as red and blue or orange- red and ochre. His paintings demonstrate that colour is only a part of a color structure in which each component derives its meaning from the whole. Thus, for example he shows that blue and green can become warm colors in a given color environment. Gat employs his concept of color to convey the blazing Mediterranean sun, the earth, from the sands and the flesh of the mountains. Heat is the Israel land factor in his works. The green surfaces of his canvases resemble oases' saturated shadows in a desert of fire. \\"I'm a painter of Israel's heat, not necessarily of its light'\\" he says. Gat adopts the harmonious synthetic color approach. By intentionally admixing strong colors to create a synthesis of contrasts (\\"in this country both the light and the shade are hot\\"), he joins an Israeli impressionist landscape tradition which developed in the thirties under the influence of French painting (\\"painting the landscape, we have no choice but to be impressionists\\" Menahem Shemi said at the time). The color contrasts in Gat's paintings also have an emotional quality. The express the painter's dynamic impression of the subject. The multiple rapid strokes,while conveying the dancing light, are also lines of rhythm, conveying not so much the rhythm of the landscape as the psychological rhythm of being moved by it. The line, rather than forming a structural foundation, constitutes a driving force, the embodiment of energy and movement in the painting process. It does not serve to separate areas; on the contrary, it unifies them with its vibration.the contour lines of the objects blend like arabesques in the general weave of the brushstrokes. Gat in both a colorist and a draftsman. The translucent air of Israel renders colors in a distance as strong as those near by, hence the colors are spread over the canvas in equal intensity. Thus Gat creates a uniform surface reminiscent of abstract painting which, in addition to its identification as a landscape having a spatial depth and linear perspective, constitutes yet another level of interpretation. Like in the abstract mode, Gat institutes a complex reworking of the canvas surface: opaque alongside transparent, dry with glowing, translucent and turbid, rough and smooth ‚Äì all these qualities are distributed evenly over the canvas without a particular faithfulness to the depicted landscape. At the same time, Gat is not an advocate of the intellectual structuring of a composition. Everything flows in this paintings and, like in a free sketch, he preserves the heat of the pictorial process. There is a close correlation between Gat and Monet's later painting in the garden of his home in Giverny, despite the fact that Gat's brushstrokes are \\"wilder\\" than those of Monet and he does not play with the translucence of objects or divide reality into units of color. Gat's work is also related to that of the Jewish artist Chaim Soutine in whose works the objects and depicted landscape are in a state of turbulence and dramatized to the point of distortion. Gat's admitted affinity with the Jewish Ecole de Paris of the first decades of the century may provide the link between the two sources of Gat's identity: Jewishness and Israeli particularism. Gat was born in Eastern Europe where he spent his youth. After World War II he discovered that his family had perished in the Holocaust. Yet he also underwent the \\"Israeli experience\\" and saw himself as a member of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War generation. Interior-Exterior / Nudes-Still Lifes-Landscapes The landscape, the common denominator of all the Gat's works, also provides the background for his nudes and still lifes. The principle informing Gat's nudes and still lifes is pantheismthe unification of all natural elementsflora, mountains, hills, people,into a single vibrating whole. His vase with flowers, for example, painted in the 1960s, disappears into the ground as though woven into it. In the same period he painted a green nude in which one type of brushwork was used over the entire surface so that the body's contours dissolved into their surroundings. The same principle was applied to figurative paintings. Gat's nudes are characterized by a foreshortened reclining position which creates a perspective illusion of depth. The foreshortening precludes the classical aesthetic spread of the feminine curves. The figure is always recumbent, never engaged in any daily activity, and generally devoid of eroticism. The conquest of the woman is achieved, as with the landscape, through the act of painting. The flesh of the figure is treated similarly to the features of landscape which always, as noted, constitutes a background to the picture, and the same color principles are applied to both. There are instances where the nude is depicted as a continuation of the landscape, for example when a path seen through a window seems to travel into the room up to the body of reclining woman. Topographical features of the landscape echo in the lines of the female groin, a parallelism which reinforces the idea of the identity of woman and landscape. On the other hand, the geometric shape of the window frame emphasizes the rounded contours of the recumbent female figure. In some instances the window is represented as a mirror facing the figure and reflecting it. The landscape in Gat's painting becomes the true portrait of the woman. The nude and still life represent the artist's inner world, his \\"interior.\\" They are staged as artistic subjects rather than as part to a daily authentic environment. This \\"interior\\" is very like an exterior. Gat's paintings do not contain actual exteriors. The indoor scenes are always represented close to the window-sill, tending to slide outwards, or even to form an integral part of the outside. Therein lies the message: the artist's inner world and nature are one and the same. His workshop, his life, his art and his desires, are all woven into nature. The landscape is not simply a visual subject but an essential component of his existence. In Gat's case, nudity constitutes a complement and interpretation of the landscape, its sensuality and its repose, and of the artist's erotic relationship to it. \\"Aclim\\" (Climate) Gat was a founding member of \\"Aclim\\", which was organized in 1974. The group was established in the wake of the Yom Kippur War \\"to point to the necessity of raising the public's consciousness of its Israeli identity in all cultural spheres.\\" Participants in the group's exhibitions until 1983 were: Gat, Rahel Shavit, Ori Reisman, Avram Rafael, Michael Gross, Hannah Levy, Tova Berlinski, Yechezkel Streichman, Avraham Mendel, Zvi Aldouby, Avraham Ofek, Ran Shehori, Hannah Megged, Shimon Avni, Hannah Evyatar, David Ben Shaul, Reuven Cohen, Zvi Tolkovsky, and Shimshon Holzman. Some participated in only one or two shows, others in most of the group's exhibitions. Eliahu Gat and Rachel Shavit were the guiding spirits of the group. The works were eclectic in style, the only feature common to all was the influence of the landscape or a component of the landscape on them. The group's rejection of a literary and mythological \\"Israeliness\\" and archaism on the one hand, and a universalistic and avant- grade approach on the other, recalls the ideology of the \\"Group of Ten\\".

Member of the State Duma since 2011. Biography Vladimir Bortko was born May 7, 1946 in Moscow. He grew up in the family of the Ukrainian Soviet playwright Aleksandr Korneychuk. After his studies in the Geological College in Kiev and his military service in 1965-1966, he worked three years as an electrical engineer in Kiev. In 1969 he went to the Karpenko-Kary State University of Theatre, Film and Television in Kiev. After graduating in 1974 he worked as an assistant director at the Dovzhenko Film Studios. In 1975 he was directing his first film, entitled Channel. In 1980, Vladimir Bortko became production leader in the Kinostudiya Lenfilm in Leningrad, the largest film production company of the Soviet Union after Mosfilm in Moscow. He received relative fame in the Soviet Union, but his big breakthrough he realized with the film adaptation of the novel Heart of a Dog written by the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov. He was awarded it a Grand Prix at the Film Festival in Perugia. In 1991 he made Afghan Breakdown, a Soviet-Italian film about the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan with Michele Placido in the lead, critical of the Soviet military activity. During the troubled shooting that started in Tajikistan in 1990 one of the team members, Nikita Matrosov, was killed by Tajik ultra-nationalists following the 1990 Dushanbe riots. According to Bortko, most of their equipment was destroyed as well, the team was evacuated, and the shooting was finished in Crimea and Syria.Artem Zayatc. Gastarbeiters. 10 National Films with Foreign Stars article, Film.ru online magazine, September 15, 2014 (in Russian) After the turn of the century Vladimir Bortko accepted the challenge to realize two of the biggest projects ever in the history of Russian cinema for the television channel Telekanal Rossiya. The first was an adaptation of the novel The Idiot written by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky into a television series of 10 episodes in 2002. The series clinched all the major television prizes in Russia, and actor Yevgeny Mironov received the award for Best Actor at the Monte Carlo Television Festival. Three years later followed an adaptation of the novel The Master and Margarita written by Mikhail Bulgakov, also into a TV series of 10 episodes. The first broadcast of December 19, 2005 was preceded by months of controversy in the media. Opponents feared that by the filming, the layered narrative of the novel and the complexity of the socio-political and metaphysical themes would be sacrificed to the popular demands of the medium television. Bortko had been following carefully the dialogues of the novel though, and the series became the most successful ever on Russian television. On December 25, 2005 40 million Russians were watching the seventh episode. In 2009, Bortko caused another big controversy, followed by a huge public success, with his film adaptation of the historical novel Taras Bulba written by the Russian author Nikolai Gogol. This time the criticism came from Ukraine, because while Bortko allowed the Polish actors in the film to speak Polish, the Ukrainian Cossacks had to express themselves in poor Russian. Yet this film was also a big success, with nearly 4 million paying visitors in Russian cinemas. Bortko is a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), and has claimed that Russia now can only \\"export oil, gas and prostitutes.\\" In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russian accession of Crimea.

It was an attempt to answer the requirements for the Navy's programme Hydravion √©claireur de combat (\\"Combat reconnaissance seaplane\\") for a large floatplane capable of acting as a torpedo bomber or reconnaissance aircraft. Development and design Design of the Loire-Nieuport 10 started in 1937, with the resultant aircraft being a twin-engined monoplane of all-metal stressed-skin construction with inverted gull (or W-shaped) wings.

The deep fuselage accommodated a crew of six, with pilot and co-pilot seated in tandem, while a glazed nose was provided for the bomb-aimer/navigator. Defensive armament was a machine gun in the nose, with another firing through a ventral hatch, and a 20 mm cannon in a dorsal turret, while it could carry two torpedoes or 1,200 kg (2,700 lb) of bombs in an internal bomb-bay.Green 1963, p.47.

It was destroyed at Bordeaux in June 1940 to prevent capture by German troops. The fuselage of the Loire-Nieuport 10 was used for the SNCAO 700 four-engined bomber prototype, of which a prototype was built but failed to fly due to the Armistice.Green 1967, pp. 148-149.

Horton, who purchased it in 1911 with financial help from his investment banker brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Warren and Demia Gorrell. The Gorrells and their children spent summers in Wyoming, while the Hortons stayed year-round. The ranch includes a number of guest cabins built by the Hortons, Gorrells and their friends, who used the property as a guest ranch and a working ranch. Cabins are arranged along the banks of Rock Creek with a main house for the Hortons and a club house. Ranch structures are scattered through the site as well, with dormitories for wranglers. Most of the cabins are of log or rustic frame design. The most significant building is the club house (1924), of log construction with a prominent front porch. Its hipped roof is supported by pine trunks and it features stone fireplaces. An office cabin built between 1911 and 1920 is also the Saddlestring post office.

The sole example flew in 1926 but was lost in 1928 during testing after modification to improve performance. Design and development Richard-Penho√´t 2 photo from L'A√©rophile October,1926 Richard-Penho√´t 2 photo from Aero Digest January 1927 The Richard-Penho√´t was a monoplane with a three part cantilever wing, each part with the same span and with 5.4¬∞ of dihedral. The central panel was rectangular in plan and had a constant thickness/chord ratio of 20%, while the outer panels had symmetrical trapezoidal plans and tapered in thickness outwards to 8%. Wing construction was mixed, largely wooden with wire bracing and with four spruce and ash box spars and spruce and ply ribs. Apart from the leading edge of the central wing, which was covered with corrugated aluminium sheet, the wing was fabric covered. The whole of the trailing edge was filled with ply-covered ailerons. The hull was also of mixed construction. There were four longerons, the lower ones wooden and the upper ones steel, braced together with bulkheads. Its planing bottom, with a step below mid-wing and a double-curvature section, was constructed from two spruce, mahogany and teak layers, the space between them divided into eight watertight compartments. The sides were birch ply, reinforced nearer the water with teak. Upper and rear parts were fabric covered. Stability on the water was provided by a pair of unstepped floats under the wing, held a little beyond the central section on mountings within completely enclosing fairings. The vertical tail was metal- framed and fabric covered, with an in-flight adjustable, triangular fin and rectangular balanced rudder. The horizontal tail was built like the wing, with an in-flight adjustable, straight-tapered tailplane and narrow chord elevators, mounted on the fin just above the hull. The pilots sat in an open, side-by-side cockpit on top of the hull, well forward above the wing and fitted with dual control; behind them there was a separate, similar cockpit for flight engineers or navigator. Internally the hull was divided into two decks linked by steps and entered by doors aft of the wing, one to each side of the upper deck. This was reserved for the crew, with sleeping quarters forward under the cockpits and access to most control systems. The windowed passenger cabin was below, with four rows of four seats separated by a central aisle, another two at the front and provision for two more. Behind the passenger cabin there were small cabins for the radio-operator and for the captain, plus toilets and a baggage store. The large flying boat was power by five Gnome-Rh√¥ne Jupiter uncowled nine-cylinder radial engines. Four were mounted close to the wing leading edges and the fifth, at the same height, over the bow. Fuel was held in the central wing section, with four tanks on each side. The wing engines could be reached in flight by a walkway with headroom, The Richard-Penho√´t 2's first flight was in August 1926 and about ten flights were made between 21 August and 9 September, with Duhanel at the controls. Behaviour on take-off and in the air was good but the performance was lower than expected. The trials showed propeller efficiencies were only about 55%, a result ascribed to the closeness () of their discs to the wing leading edge, given a wing thickness of . The engines were also ungeared, leading to high tip speeds and their associated inefficiencies. It was therefore decided to move the engines forward by , provide engine gearing and increase propeller diameters to as much as . The modifications kept the flying boat grounded for a year before restarting flight testing in 1928 but on 26 April, piloted by Victor Lucas, assisted by engineers Denis Provost and Marcel Lecoq and with designer Lewis Quinc√© observing, it crashed from low altitude into the Loire estuary. Pilot and engineers were rescued but Quinc√© died. Early reports suggested the fin broke away, taking with it the tailplane and elevators.

In 1999 he moved to Singapore where he started DJing at private parties and soon he got his first residency @ Suede (Mohammed Sultan road) during Sunday nights. Shortly after he participated in the creation of the reefonline brand of parties and events along with some friends and started playing for other events and clubs around the city like Eden, dbl 0, Solace @ Venom, and Nox among others. He also started getting bookings overseas and played in Station 3 in Melaka, Malaysia earning himself a reputation and a contract with Kinemat Productions. He then started taking part in Kinemat's techno night, Techkroniq @ Bugis' legendary club Insomnia and took part in Sentosa NYE 2001 warming up for John Digweed and a new years appearance in Pacha (Baqueira).

Months later he became a sure bet for the Techkroniq series of parties sharing Phuture's (Zouk) booth with D.Knox and made the eventual appearance in Milieu. To add to his residencies in clubs like Nox and Pinkk borhead also became a common DJ in the Singapore gay scene with regular gigs at the Box. In 2003, the reef parties came out of the underground to a more mainstream crowd at venues such as tunnel without sacrificing the non mainstream qualities of the music played. Kinemat took the risk of being the first crew to support a minimal techno/microhouse event in Zouk to celebrate their 5th birthday with Analog Girl, Voila (borhead & Don), Sutekh and Haris Custovic. At this point Borhead had graced the decks of clubs across the world and could not stop getting booked for clubs such as trilogy (Dubai), Fun factory (madrid), returning to Pegasus (Shanghai)... As an opportunity to celebrate his brother bruno's birthday in 2004, the \\"let's frloik!\\" series of parties was created. In 2006, Borhead continued dishing out his best tunes in the Singaporean clubbing circuit along names like Interlace and with a residency at Liberte before moving back to his hometown, Madrid where he brought his reef brand to the local rave circuit and joined his brother Bruno a.k.a. Bruns to form the duo Side B where they made their d√©but at reef's \\"Made in Madrid\\" @ Taboo. It didn't take Borhead long before he moved back to Asia. He landed in the Philippines where he took a residencie in M Caf√© along local crew Sounds Good with DJs Miss BadKiss and Adrian Cuenca featured in Spanish TV show \\"madrile√±os por el mundo\\".

The incident was caused by a blocked fuel line leading to the gas generator of the third-stage RD-0110 engine of the spacecraft's Soyuz-U booster. After the loss of Progress M-12M, all Russian crewed spaceflights were temporarily suspended, due to the similarities between the failed engine and the third-stage engine in use on the crewed Soyuz-FG booster. A Russian commission blamed the Progress M-12M failure on a single human error, and put additional procedures in place to prevent the problem from recurring. On 30 October 2011, Russia successfully launched the uncrewed Progress M-13M cargo spacecraft atop a Soyuz-U booster, clearing the way for the Soyuz TMA-22 launch. =Launch= Soyuz TMA-22 lifts off from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on 14 November 2011.

Biography June Bevan (Christened Norma) was born in Parkes on 9 June 1931 to Norman and Lillian Single. They moved to Newcastle in 1935 where June went on to attend Dudley Primary School and then Hunter Girls High School. June's main sporting interests were netball and hockey, playing at 'A' grade level. Subsequently she decided to switch to badminton when a friend was talking to her on the bus, her friend wanted to get some boys together to play badminton. June said, \\"That's right boys get to play and girls miss out\\". June was then invited along to play. Enjoying the game so much because it was fast and strenuous, June took up badminton at the age of 17 at a time when the sport was re- organising after the war. June continued to play hockey and netball as they became a means of maintaining her fitness and speed for badminton. Badminton possessed everything that June wanted in a sport and it was accessible 12 months a year rain, hail or shine. 1950 was the beginning of a brilliant sporting career as she was selected in the New South Wales team. On 5 September 1953, June married Keith Bevan (who also played badminton). As a young married couple they could not afford to travel interstate to play badminton in the Australian Carnival plus having a honeymoon. So they combined the two together and went to Tasmania playing badminton in the State team together. In 1953, June was selected to play for Australia against New Zealand for the first time and continued to represent her country until 1961. June's badminton career representing New South Wales spanned three decades from 1951 to 1984 with the exception of 1958, 1966 and 1969. June's first daughter Margaret was born in September 1958. In May 1963, June's second daughter Janine was born and after a great deal of hard training June was able to represent New South Wales in Queensland in August/September that same year. In December 1966 her third daughter Christine was born and in July 1969 June's fourth daughter Kim was born. June has won so many New South Wales State Titles that she has lost count of them, June has also won 12 Australian Titles including the Triple Crown on two occasions. June represented the State for over 30 years from 1951 to 1982 a record which no other badminton player has been able to achieve. Since injuring her left knee in 1992, she has not been able to play competitive badminton, something that June is not too pleased about. Badminton has been a family affair with her four daughters following in their mother's footsteps as they have all won many State Junior Titles and have all represented the State. In addition to her sporting achievements June is a Life Member of the NSW and Newcastle Badminton Associations, and will be returning to the coaching aspects of badminton with Junior players. June's husband Keith was an avid supporter of Badminton and very proud that June had been given deserved recognition of her achievements and dedication to the sport, by having a tournament named after her. Sadly, Keith, June's greatest fan, died on 10 November 2009. Since then at least one daughter has attended the June Bevan Trophy with June.

TMA-03M was the 112th flight of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, since the first in 1967, and the third flight of the modernised Soyuz-TMA-M version. The docking with the International Space Station took place at 19:19 Moscow Time on 23 December, three minutes ahead of schedule.–°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–ª—Å—è –∑–∞–ø—É—Å–∫ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ–º–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª—è ¬´–°–æ—é–∑ –¢–ú–ê-03–ú¬ª Roscosmos The crew were Oleg Kononenko (Russia, commander), Andr√© Kuipers (the Netherlands) and Donald Pettit (United States).

The capsule used in the mission can be seen at the Space Expo visitors center at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Crew The Soyuz TMA-03M crew members conduct their ceremonial tour of Red Square on 1 December 2011. = Backup crew =  Mission insignia  The Soyuz TMA-03M mission insignia (or 'patch') was designed by Luc van den Abeelen, partially based on artwork by 11-year-old Alena Gerasimova from Petrozavodsk, Russia. Former Roscosmos head Anatoly Perminov officially approved the patch on 9 March 2011. The Soyuz TMA-03M patch was the final patch based on the children's competition initiated for the Soyuz TMA-14 flight. The children's project had been organized by Roscosmos Public Relations and in mid-2011 the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center took over responsibility for the operational aspects of the Soyuz patches. Mission details The mission launched on 21 December 2011, at 17:16:15 Moscow time (13:16:15 GMT) using the Soyuz-FG rocket system. After a 528-second flight, Soyuz –¢–ú–ê-03–ú successfully disconnected from the third stage on a satellite orbit. Soyuz Commander Kononenko was launched from the Soyuz's center seat with flight engineer Donald Pettit strapped in to his right and ESA astronaut Andre Kuipers on his left. The launch occurred a little more than an hour after sunset at Baikonur in bitterly cold weather with temperatures near -18 degrees Celsius (0 F). Live television footage from inside the spacecraft's showed the crew members looking relaxed as they monitored the automated ascent. Shortly after the Soyuz slipped into a preliminary orbit, the Russian Mission Control said \\"Congratulations, guys, on a good insertion, (there are) no issues with telemetry or anything at all at this time, We wish you best of luck. You are experienced people, I'm sure everything is going to go very well\\". During the next two days after the launch, three major rendezvous burns were performed to put the spacecraft on a refined path to the ISS. File:Soyuz TMA-03M rollout 2.jpgRolling out to launch pad.

File:Soyuz TMA-03M rocket launches 2 cropped.jpgSoyuz TMA-03M lifts off from Baikonur on 21 December 2011. =Docking= Following the two-day rendezvous, the Soyuz spacecraft successfully docked to the Mini Research Module-1 (MRM-1) ‚ÄúRassvet‚Äù Nadir docking port at 15:19 GMT on 23 December 2011. The port was vacated just over one month earlier by the Soyuz TMA-02M. The entire process of approaching and docking with the ISS went nominally as planned. After arriving in the vicinity of the ISS, the spacecraft made a short flyaround maneuver to achieve a perfect alignment with the Docking Port on the Rassvet Module. The station keeping started at a distance of 200 meters to the docking target. This gave teams inside the Russian Mission Control adequate time to evaluate systems and alignment. The final GO for approach came after just a few minutes and Soyuz Commander Kononenko sent the command for the final phase of the docking operation. The docking occurred three minutes ahead of previously announced time of 19:22:41 Moscow Time when the Soyuz TMA-03M gently came into contact with the ISS at a relative velocity of less than 0.3 m/s. At the time of docking, the two spacecraft were sailing 240 miles over southern Russia. Soft Docking was confirmed shortly thereafter and hooks and latches were closed 10 minutes after docking to form a hard-mate between space station and the Soyuz TMA-03M spacecraft. Extensive leak checks and vehicle reconfigurations were made from both sides of the docking system before Mission Control gave a GO to open the hatches between the Soyuz TMA-03M spacecraft and the ISS. Following the hatch opening, the crew members floated aboard the ISS to greet the already-aboard Dan Burbank, Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoli Ivanishin. Together, the two crews formed the full group of Expedition 30 until March 2012. File:Soyuz TMA-03M docking.jpgSoyuz TMA-03M approaches the Rassvet module for docking.

This non-coding RNA was initially identified from Tn5 transposon mutant libraries of Vibrio cholerae and its location within the bacterial genome was mapped to the intergenic region between genes VC1741 and VC1743 by RACE analysis. Outer membrane vesicles are secreted from the surface of gram-negative bacteria, where they are thought to aid in virulence. Little is known about how these vesicles aid virulence but it has been speculated that they may contribute by secreting toxins and help in the evasion of the immune system. Recent studies showed that VrrA expression is activated by the alternative stress sigma factor, sigma E; unlike other strains of bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella, it does not require the Hfq protein to regulate the sigma factor. It was also shown that VrrA transcription increases on exposure to UV light and that over expression of VrrA resulted in an increase in outer membrane vesicles secreted. From these studies it has been suggested that VrrA acts to relieve outer membrane stress by limiting the synthesis of OmpA protein and that outer membrane vesicles provide the bacteria physical protect against UV light.

It is unknown of the extent of which Ray played with the Panhandles. While he did appear in photos advertising the Panhandles, he did not play in many games with the club. However why he played in so few games remains a mystery. According to family accounts, Ray sprained his ankle in a game one day, and they put liniment on it and put his sock and shoe back on. He went out and played with it, and when they took the sock and shoe off, the skin just came right off of his foot. While the rest of the Nessers became boilermakers for the Pennsylvania Railroad, Ray decided not to follow his brothers footsteps. Instead he became a policeman for the city of Columbus, Ohio. According to The Columbus Citizen-Journal newspaper on June 6, 1927, Ray, a corporal with the Columbus Police Department, chased and shot an Angelo Furne who fled from the scene of an accident. During the chase, Furne held a hand out in front of body. Nesser fearing that he may have had gun, fired along with his partner an \\"Officer Knight\\" and shot Furne killing him. Both officers' actions were cleared by a review panel. Raymond died on September 2, 1969 at the age of 71.

The band consisted of Simon Eugene, also known as Comfort (vocals, guitar, bass, piano, keyboards), Sean Elliot (guitar), Kenny Rumbles (drums) and George Muranyi (keyboards). Their single \\"Mister Jones\\" entered the UK Singles Chart peaking at number 73. History The early version of the band was formed in 1991 by Eugene. Early membership included Barny C. Rockford (who later became a member of The Auteurs) on drums. The band performed several gigs in the UK and Amsterdam, but did not release any records. In late 1993 Eugene, feeling that \\"the chemistry of the band didn't seem right\\", decided to reform it. Elliot remained on guitar, Rockford was replaced by Kenny Rumbles, Eugene replaced Jake on bass and John George joined the band as another guitarist. In June 1994 their first single was released, featuring two songs: \\"In the Groove Again\\" and \\"River of Gold\\". In late 1995 the band released their only full album, Drop The Roof. The album was first released in Japan, where it gained a relatively significant success. A UK release followed in early 1996, but it failed to become popular. During those years, Out of my Hair toured extensively supporting artists including David Bowie, Crash Test Dummies and Barenaked Ladies. In spite of some positive criticism, and a success of the \\"In the Groove Again\\" single, the band remained unknown to the wide public and quietly disappeared around 1997 when Simon went solo using his performing name Comfort. Some further supports followed, notably with Radiohead in Paris and a new album God is in the Detail was ready for release when Comfort's label folded. After appearing at the South by Southwest Festival in early 1999 Comfort all but retired from performing until the mid 2000s when he formed the International Love Corporation.

It is situated in the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, connecting mainly markets of Central and Southeast Europe with the Mediterranean Sea and Far East. Differently from other European ports, which are managed by port authorities, the activities of Port of Koper comprise the management of the free zone area, the management of the port area and the role of terminal operator.  Business  = Terminals of the port = The Port of Koper has 12 specialized terminals: * Container and Ro-Ro Terminal * Car Terminal * General cargo Terminal * Fruit Terminal * Timber Terminal * Terminal for minerals * Terminal for cereals and fodder * Alumina Terminal * European Energy Terminal * Liquid Cargoes Terminal * Livestock Terminal * Passenger Terminal The core business covers cargo handling and warehousing services for all types of goods, complemented by a range of additional services for cargo with the aim of providing a comprehensive logistics support for customers. The company manages the commercial zone and provides for the development and maintenance of port infrastructure.  History  = Before World War II = From its establishment during the era of the Roman Republic, maritime trade has played an important role in the history and development of Koper. The town received a charter from Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II in the early 11th century, while in the 13th century the Patriarchs of Aquileia granted Koper domain over its northern Istrian hinterland. In 1279, Koper was absorbed by the Venetian Republic, and developed into the pre-eminent commercial and administrative centre of Istria. Following the fall of Venice in 1797, the entire region was absorbed into the Habsburg Monarchy, and, for a short while, Koper was known as the Imperial Austrian Port. When Trieste and Rijeka were proclaimed as free ports in 1719, Koper's status, trade, and influence began to ebb. The collapse of the Venetian Republic and the transfer of local administrative and political power to Trieste that followed further hastened this decline. Koper's maritime and commercial stagnation continued, first under Habsburg rule, and then after 1919 under the Italian rule. Despite liberation in 1945, insecurity as to its future continued into the post-war era, during the period of the Free Territory of Trieste. Koper's status and long-term future were finally resolved in 1954 through the signing of the London Memorandum of Understanding, by way of which Zone B of the territory‚Äîincluding Koper and Istria‚Äîwas ceded to Yugoslavia. The partition of the Trieste Free Territory led to mass emigration by ethnic Italians living in Istrian coastal towns. Neglected for more than two centuries, their commercial potential was poor and their industries obsolete, whilst maritime traffic and trade was strictly limited to local needs. = Afterwar period = In investigating new possibilities for the development of Slovenian Istria, a group of enthusiasts began considering the potentials for construction of an international seaport. In 1957, they prepared an investment programme for the development of 135 metres of Koper's northern shore, while 23 May that year saw the foundation of the first handling and warehousing company Pristani≈°ƒçe Koper. Thus the new venture was established, employing local workers whose experience was crucial in the organisation of this new and intrepid undertaking. By August 1957, the Peter Klepec, a floating dredger had deepened the seabed along the northern shore of town, and concreting the area around the first berth began in December. At the same time, work began on a dyke across the Stanjon inlet, and thus the operative areas of the new port began to take shape by a continuous process of dredging and accumulation. The Port of Koper was eventually permitted to join the Association of Yugoslav Ports (), and in October 1958 received the state consent for its investment programme. At last due recognition was at hand. = The founding of Luka Koper = Despite developing in an era in which imports were rising, it was difficult to attract business away from the established ports in the region, such as nearby Port of Trieste (Italy) and Port of Rijeka (Croatia). But development gradually enhanced the port's competitive edge, as did its openness to prospective users, and this led to increasingly widespread commercial co-operation as well as the establishment of what were to become long-term partnerships between the port and its customers. It was mainly companies trading in foodstuffs and timber - including, amongst others, the national Silo and Warehouses Administration, Emona, Slovenijales and Centroprom - that decided to co-finance or invest in the construction of the necessary infrastructure. Based on the resolution of the company's Workers\` Council in October 1961, Pristani≈°ƒçe Koper changed its name to Luka Koper, and operated as a socially owned and managed enterprise. The company's objectives were clear, and by the end of 1962 its integrated operations were functioning efficiently. Development continued with the acquisition of the Dekani cold storage facility and the purchase of disinfection and fruit ripening units. By 1962, annual throughput amounted to 270,000 tonnes. Freight passing through the port was for the most part hauled by road, with a minor portion travelling by rail to Kozina, and from there transported by truck to Koper, and vice versa. Imports were destined for the Slovenian and Serbian markets; unlike neighbouring Croatia, Serbia did not have its own access to the sea. During the early 1960s, outgoing maritime cargo, exports from the European continent, amounted to a mere 20 percent of total traffic, while the proportion of transit goods was similarly low. With nearly the same capacities and improved organisation, 1963 witnessed a throughput of 628,456 tonnes of cargo. This rapid growth was the result of increased imports of wheat, rice, fertiliser and fodder. As a consequence of its solid performance, in conjunction with its geographic and other advantages, Luka Koper gained the trust of its foreign partners, and recorded record growth. The excellent results achieved in 1963 were also a consequence of the establishment of the first free zone, Luka Koper was able to provide a range of services for companies using the port. This new orientation required the reorganisation of the company into six units: Handling, Warehousing, Timber, Maintenance, Joint Services and Lu≈°ki dom. = Era of railway = Accelerated development and operational growth revealed the inadequacy of communications with the hinterland. Various problems pertaining to the co- ordination of rail and road transport between Koper and Kozina increased the demurrage costs of vessels, wagons and trucks. Nevertheless, the freight handled by Luka Koper continued to rise, and in 1966 amounted to 788,616 tonnes. Both the Yugoslav as well as the Slovenian authorities did not look favourably to the construction of a rail link for Koper, thus Luka Koper itself financed the initial study and project documentation. In 1964, following exhaustive negotiations, the company commissioned the scheme, and work on the new railway got underway. Despite financial difficulties and the troublesome terrain, construction work gradually proceeded, and an auspicious and lavish inaugural ceremony on 2 December 1967 marked the commencement of operations on the 31-kilometre line between Koper and Pre≈°nica. Soon afterwards, provisions adopted by Yugoslavia's Federal Executive Council gave fresh impetus to Luka Koper's development. Namely, foreign companies were allowed to invest in local enterprises active within the port's free zone. The construction of the Bulk Liquids Terminal was one such tangible consequence of these provisions. Foodstuffs still accounted for the majority of cargo passing through Koper. In 1967, the total throughput of tropical fruit amounted to 113,000 tonnes, which placed it top of the list of Yugoslav ports handling such perishables. There was also an increase in transit cargo, in particular for Czechoslovakia (140,572 tonnes), Hungary (49,645 tonnes), West Germany (47,592 tonnes), Austria (15,039 tonnes), Italy (11,369 tonnes), Switzerland (1,680 tonnes), as well as Bulgaria, Romania and the USSR (with an aggregate total of 12,479 tonnes). Between 1968 and 1977 the development of the Port of Koper was exclusively dependent on indigenous resources, namely the company's own profits and raised loans. A high degree of indebtedness in conjunction with rapid development led to a number of economic and operational difficulties. = A leap in growth in the late 1960s = The most important investment in 1968 was the construction of the liquid fuels terminal, which began operations in November of that year. Indeed, petroleum derivatives saw the greatest rates of annual growth over the ensuring years. The railway was now proving itself to be an excellent investment, and even more ardent opponents to the project were finally forced to admit its worth. As a result of favourable public opinion and excellent performance, the Koper line was officially incorporated into the national rail network. At the same time the state committed itself to an interest-rate subsidy on loans raised for the development of port infrastructure, an action which greatly relieved the company's debt burden, particularly as regards the financing of the railway and port infrastructure. Accelerated development, and the large liabilities accrued through such ceaseless investment, affected cash flow and solvency. Employment conditions deteriorated, which led to a large turnover in personnel: 703 new workers were employed in 1969, while 490 also left the company. Due to the shortage of domestic labour, workers were brought in from other Yugoslav Republics. All of these conditions concerted negatively on Luka Koper's operations, and the countermeasures adopted ameliorated the situation only slightly. = Cargo throughput growth prior to 1970 = Annual maritime cargo throughput surpassed the one-million-tonnes threshold for the first time in 1968; just two years later the quantity was nearly two million tonnes. In addition to petroleum derivatives, general cargo throughput also increased, which can mainly be attributed to the revival of Slovenian trade and commerce. The Port of Koper began operations by handling a variety of cargo, in particular fruit, timber, wheat and fodder, general cargos and oil. Initially, imports accounted for more than half of throughput, and a mere ten percent were Slovenian exports. The balance was accounted for by transit goods destined to the countries of Eastern Europe. = Cargo throughput growth 1970 - 1980 = The 1970s witnessed a slow-down in rises in cargo throughput; the growth rate averaged 2.6 percent per annum, which resulted in an increase of less than thirty percent over the decade. This deceleration was a consequence of the high degree of corporate indebtedness, labour cost rises and organisational instability. From this period on, Luka Koper began to increasingly specialise and concentrate on certain types of cargo. The volume of timber throughput rose, whilst mineral and ore cargo shipments became ever more frequent. In addition to petroleum, other liquid cargos, such as chemicals, wine and vegetable oil were also handled. Containers and RO-RO were crucial innovations of the 1970s for which a specialised terminal came on stream in 1979. In this era, half of cargo handled, not including petroleum derivatives, pertained to the domestic market of which imports accounted for 35 percent, and exports 15 percent of total. The other half was transit cargo pertaining to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria. = Cargo throughput growth 1980 - 1990 = The 1980s were an extremely significant period in the development of Luka Koper; total throughput more than doubled, while the range of capacities were extended to those which the port has to this day. Alumina imports commenced in 1990, while dry bulk cargos increased eightfold over the decade. In addition, the 1980s witnessed the first major shipment of cars, a trade which - over the years - was to develop into one of the most important areas of business. The second half of the decade was characterised by considerable down-turns in raw timber and fruit throughput, which was due mainly to the more widespread introduction of containerisation. The proportion of transit freight rose throughout the 1980s, and bulk cargos for Austria particularly so. By 1990, Koper's total business, with Hungary and Czechoslovakia each still holding some 10 percent. = Cargo throughput growth 1990 - 2000 = The final few years of the 20th century were marked by dynamic growth, underpinned by an up-turn in the Slovenian economy. The late 1990s marked a particularly successful period of development for Luka Koper, while between 1990 and 2000 cargo throughput increased by over 70 percent, i.e. some 8 percent per annum. By 2000, Luka Koper was again handling 300,000 tonnes of timber per annum. And while petroleum derivates volume reached three-fold the level they had been in the early 1990s, the company actively capped the commensurate growth that was occurring in iron ore and coal traffic. Vehicle throughput increased seventeenfold in a mere decade. The late 1990s also saw the upgrade of livestock operations. Although growth in container freight continued, it only increased by twenty percent over the decade, which for the most part was a consequence of the unstable political and economic situation experienced in many of the hinterland states during the early 1990s. The 1990s also saw the creation of a cargo market structure that persists to this day. Some one-third of all traffic was attributable to Slovenian domestic market, while the countries of the European hinterland of Koper accounted for the remainder. By 2000, Austria was placed first with over two million tonnes of goods per annum, while Italy accounted for a significant ten percent of total. = Cargo throughput growth 2000‚Äì2006 = From 2000 to 2006, the throughput in container traffic, vehicles, timber, liquid cargoes (excluding petroleum), and cereals, have all doubled, while general cargo has increased by over 50 percent. The most intensive growth was recorded in trade with Hungary, which surpassed a million tonnes in 2006. Nevertheless, Austrian clients‚Äîwith 3.5 million tonnes, or a quarter of total throughput‚Äîstill top the transit freight list, whilst trade with Italy, which now accounts for 15 percent of business, also grew rapidly. The domestic market generated some 30 percent of turnover. The throughput has increased in average for 7 percent annually. During 2006, cargo throughput almost reached saturation level due to the limitations posed by the single-line rail link with the national network. Over recent years the growth in container freight and vehicles has been of particular importance to the prosperity of Luka Koper, and shall remain among the company's key strategic development orientations over the coming decade.

This form of vegetation occurs only in the Southwest Botanical Province of Western Australia. Tuart being predominantly a coastal tree, tuart forest occurs only in a narrow belt along the coast. Logging history and conservation Coastal land in the southwest of Western Australia has been in high demand ever since British settlement of the Swan River Colony, initially for grazing, and more recently for housing. Tuart was also a prized timber. It is light in colour, similar to honey oak, and unusually hard. It was particularly useful where a very hard wood was needed, and most old-style butchers had a tuart \\"round\\" as a durable chopping block. As a result of its value as a timber and as grazing land, most of the tuart forest has now been cleared. The only remaining tall tuart forest is the Ludlow Tuart Forest now protected by the Tuart Forest National Park. Other tuart forest occurs in the Maiden Tuart Forest near Bunbury, and further north near Mandurah, although these are smaller trees. The forests and other surviving remnants are now the target of active conservation efforts such as the National Trust of Australia's Tuart Forest Appeal. The world's only tall tuarts grow in an area of less than around Ludlow near Busselton, south of Perth, making it one of the rarest forests in the world. Now that it has been preserved from further logging, the next challenge is to revive the ageing forest, which suffers from degradation due to almost two centuries of cattle grazing, to weed infestation (particularly arum lilies), and an absence of new young trees due to overpopulation of western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), for whom infant tuart saplings are a favoured dietary item. In addition, many areas of tuart forest have suffered from tree death and decline due to a newly described dieback organism, (Phytophthora multivora), which acts in a similar way to the well-publicised (Phytophthora cinnamomi). Fauna Besides the western grey kangaroos, other inhabitants are the western brushtail and the endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus occidentalis), whose principal diet is the leaves of the peppermint (Agonis flexuosa) tree. These animals rest by day in hollows in the tuart trees and move to the peppermints to feed at night. Also inhabiting the forest are the carnivorous wambenger (Phascogale tapoatafa) and the quenda (Isoodon obesulus) or southern brown bandicoot, and the tiny freetail bat (Tadarida australis). Abundant birdlife can be seen in the forest and the nearby Vasse- Wonnerup Estuary. A number of spectacular birds of prey will frequently be seen, such as ospreys (Pandion haliaetus cristatus) and whistling kites (Haliastur sphenurus), but of particular interest is the Australian shelduck (Tadorna tadornoides) which nests high in tuart tree hollows. The female incubates five to fourteen cream-coloured eggs for 30 to 33 days while her mate defends the surrounding territory. The newly hatched young leap from the nest cavity to the ground and are led by their parents on a perilous overland journey to their brooding territory in the nearby estuary. They remain together in a family group for the first six weeks of the ducklings' lives. Once the young birds fledge they are completely independent.

Since 2004 the YCSU has been a member of the Youth of the European People's Party, an umbrella organization of European political youth organisations that is the official youth wing of the European People's Party. The YEPP brings together over 54 centre-right youth political organisations from over 35 countries across Europe and is considered to be the largest political youth organisation in Europe. The YCSU Young Democrats was admitted as an observer member of the European Christian Political Youth Network in 2004.  History  The Youth Christian Social Union was founded in 1997 and officially registered by the Ministry of Justice of Belarus from 1998 until 2003. On the eve of the 2004 parliamentary elections, it lost its legal status when the Supreme Court made a decision on the liquidation of the YCSU Young Democrats based on the suit of the Ministry of Justice. The main reason was that members began campaigning for opposition candidates and undertaking street actions. In 2002 the Youth Christian Social Union merged with the Youth of the United Civil Party of Belarus and a new brand YCSU Young Democrats was created. From 2002 to 2008 the YCSU Young Democrats was cooperating with the United Civil Party of Belarus, but at the last congress the decision was taken to become independent. Some members who did not support the decision left the group and stayed in the UCP Youth. At a congress in 2009 the group supported Alaksandar Milinkieviƒç as a candidate for the forthcoming elections, YSCU Young Democrats made one more attempt to gain legal status, but the Ministry of Justice declined, supported by the Supreme Court.http://www.en.civicbelarus.eu/content/download/531/3566/file/MONITORING%20Assembly%20_March- June%202009.pdf  Political activities  Independent observation over the 2000 parliamentary elections under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The YCSU supported the decision of majority of democratic organizations to take an active part in campaign of boycott of the unfree and undemocratic \\"parliamentary elections\\". At the time of the 2001 presidential elections in Belarus, the YCSU formed a \\"Peramenaw!\\" (For Changes) coalition with other youth organisations, including Young Front, the Association of Belarusian Students, the Association of Young Entrepreneurs, Young Hramada, the UCP Youth, the Belarusian Association of Young Politicians. YSCU activists took part in work in headquarters, independent observation and mobilization campaigns. YSCU supported Alaksandar Jaro≈°uk and U≈Çadzimier Hanƒçaryk. The took active participation in the 2003 local elections (as candidates, volunteers and managers). Members of the organization served as deputies of local councils in cities including Mogilev and Rogachev. During the 2006 presidential elections the YCSU Young Democrats supported Alaksandar Milinkieviƒç as an opposition candidate. After the election results were broadcast, the YCSU Young Democrats took an active part in the Jeans Revolution. Ten members of the YCSU Young Democrats were arrested when police attacked the tent camp erected on October Square in Minsk.

Polk and his wife Sarah Childress Polk, originally on Vine Street in Nashville, Tennessee before it was demolished in 1901.  History and description  Original Shown as Grundy Place The home originally called \\"Grundy Place\\" was constructed for Attorney General Felix Grundy between 1815 and 1820 in the Palladian style of architecture, Grundy lived in the home till his death in 1840. President Polk purchased the home while living in the White House in 1847 renaming it \\"Polk Place\\". Polk contracted Nashville architect J. M. Hughes to renovate the home for when he and Sarah returned to Tennessee after the end of his presidency. In the processes of modifying and renovating the home the back portion was destroyed by an accidental gunpowder explosion in 1847. With repairs underway the President wanted a more modern style, and requested Hughes to redesign the home in the Greek Revival style of architecture. Sarah went to inspect the construction and repairs of the home in early 1848 for their return. Upon returning to Tennessee in 1849, Polk Place was not yet completed, so he and Sarah returned to Columbia to his mother's home before returning to Nashville two weeks later when it was finished. It was the President's final residence where he died of cholera in 1849 at the age of 53. He had lived in the home for a little over thirty days. After his death his wife continued to reside there for 42 years until her death in 1891. The home was demolished in 1901, a decade after her death.  After President Polk's death  200x200pxAfter the president's death first lady Sarah Polk lived in the home, she became a recluse for some time, barely leaving the mansion. She wouldn't find solace until fostering a great niece, Sarah Polk Jetton in the early 1850s. Soon she opened her home back up for invitations and hosting guests along with the occasional event. She hosted distinguished and popular guests throughout her widowhood, such as Adelicia Acklen a close friend, along with Abram Hewitt, Edward Cooper, John C. Calhoun II, John Catron, George Bancroft, Cyrus Field, William Vanderbilt, Sam Houston among numerous others, including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Rutherford B. Hayes and Grover Cleveland. During the Civil War, Polk Place was considered neutral ground by both the Confederate and Union armies, despite the fact that she had nephews fighting on the Confederate side. Union Generals Ulysses S. Grant, Don Carlos Buell, frequently paid their respects to the former first lady, as had Confederate generals briefly before the Union occupation. (At the end of the war, Sarah's great niece Sarah Polk Jetton was married in the main parlor of Polk Place to a wealthy Nashville merchant, George Fall.)  Legal dispute  Hallway of Polk PlaceAfter a short illness, Mrs. Polk died at Polk Place in 1891, just short of her 88th birthday. (Originally Sarah's will was followed giving sole ownership of the home and its estate to her great niece Mrs. Fall, allowing her to live in the mansion for a few years after her death.) What followed was a long legal dispute centered on both wills by other Polk relatives, claiming Sarah's will was invalid and President Polk's will perpetuity had gone into effect that he could not foresee that far into the future. The president's nephew Tasker Polk, son of his brother William Hawkins Polk was the one that led the legal battle against Mrs. Fall. A judge ruled in favor of Tasker and the Polk family giving control of the home to them. President Polk's tomb was originally located on the front lawn until 1893, when it was moved to the Tennessee State Capitol. The Polk Family could not agree on what to do with the home and did not want to follow the president's will, in which he expressed desire that a worthy and noble Polk relative run the home like the Hermitage. The state of Tennessee nearly acquired Polk Place and made it the governor's mansion. (At the time, the governor of Tennessee stayed in a hotel room.) Finally, the state Supreme Court ordered the Polk family to sell the home and evenly split the money from the sale in 1900. Tasker would sell the home to Jacob M. Dickinson who then sold it to a developer and the mansion was demolished in 1901 to build a small apartment building.alt=  Today  The site has changed hands many times over the years. The YWCA bought the property in 1909 and built a new state-of-the-art facility. They sold the building in 1978 and moved to Woodmont Avenue. The Capitol Hotel (formerly Best Western) now occupies the former site of Polk Place in downtown Nashville.

Unifab began working for the international protection of intellectual property and for the fight against counterfeiting. It took part in drawing up the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) and the Madrid Arrangement concerning international trademark registration (1891). Encouraged by these successes, it helped to draw up a large number of bilateral treaties to increase the protection of industrial property between France and Austria, Portugal, the United States, Greece, Peru, Russia, etc. In France, it was recognised as a public interest organisation as early as 1877 and came under the system created by the Associations Act in 1901. It took part in the creation of the National Trade Mark and Patent Office in 1901 and recommended the creation of the first register of trademarks, which was later used as the basis for the Institut National de la Propri√©t√© Industrielle (INPI, the French Industrial Property Office). Today, Union des Fabricants includes 300 companies and professional federations based in France from all sectors of the economy. It is a unique observatory of the protection of intellectual property rights, a source of information and a discussion forum. Activities  Supporting the business community  Unifab organises special committees to develop practice and legislation in protecting industrial property and combating counterfeiting. These commissions initiate the signing of charters, the writing of \\"green papers\\" and codes of conduct, the production of dossiers, studies, etc. It also organise, in Paris, the annual seminar providing a broad discussion forum and meeting point for all intellectual property professionals, the European Intellectual Property Forum tackles the year's major intellectual property issues. And many symposium held in partnership with various organisations deal with a range of subjects. Its publications provide all the main news in the field of intellectual property: a quarterly newsletter, which presents the activities of Union des Fabricants, the Revue Internationale de la Propri√©t√© Industrielle et Artistique (RIPIA) which informs of the jurisprudence, the Manuel of the Union des Fabricants, practical guides, etc. Union des Fabricants can provide its members with the contact details of all those concerned by the defence of intellectual property: industrial property consultants, lawyers specialising in intellectual property, official agencies and authorities (Customs Department, Competition Consumer Affairs and Anti- Fraud Directorate General (DGCCRF), criminal investigation departments, police forces, justice systems, foreign trade missions), various national associations for the prevention of counterfeiting, etc. Unifab takes part in professional exhibitions by setting up stands providing information on protecting and defending companies against counterfeiting. Its activities also include meetings with professional federations and creating and monitoring anti-counterfeiting charters. Unifab opened offices in Tokyo (1980) and in Beijing (1998). The main activities of these Offices are: *Lobbying officials in order to improve legal provisions and enforcement *Market monitoring *Providing practical data on products and information on counterfeiting *Supporting authorities requests for seizures, prosecutions and trials = Providing authentication services = Unifab represents certain Rights Holders, in order to identify presumed counterfeit products in association with the Customs department or any public authorities during the suspension for release or seizure procedures. = Training = Unifab trains public agencies (customs department, police forces, foreign trade missions, competition consumer affairs and anti-fraud directorate, justice system, etc.) to make them more aware of counterfeits and to help them recognise these products and to support public enforcement, publishing the Manual for criminals investigations = Lobbying and collaboration with public agencies = It is a member of the National Anti-Counterfeiting Committee (CNAC), collaborates with the European Commission, the INPI, the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), the European Patent Office (EPO), the World Industrial Property Organisation (WIPO), the World Customs Organisation (WCO), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), the European Brand Association (AIM) and professional organisations . Unifab is also a founder member of the Global Anti-Counterfeiting Group (GACG), which brings together all the national anti- counterfeiting associations on an international level. Its aims are to be an international forum for national information and to issue joint communications to heighten the awareness of the general public across the world. = Increasing customer awareness = Unifab heightens the awareness of the consumer, the final link in the chain, it is a priority to curb the marketing of counterfeiters. *Being in permanent contacts in connection with media *Informing the general public of the dangers, extent and development of counterfeiting at the Museum of Counterfeiting where a large number of sectors are represented. *Organising the French part of the World Anti-Counterfeiting Day *Participating to miscellaneous contribution to communication campaigns The \\"Mus√©e de la Contrefa√ßon\\" (Museum of Counterfeiting) was created in 1959 and is based in the Unifab's headquarters, 16 rue de la Faisanderie, in Paris.

CISS's primary mission is to deliver academic programming to prepare outstanding students for careers in intelligence analysis in both the public and private sectors. In addition, CISS personnel engage in applied research and consortium building with government, private and academic partners.  Recognition as a Center of Academic Excellence  In late 2012 The Director of National Intelligence designated the Center for Intelligence and Security Studies at the University of Mississippi as an Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence (\\"CAE\\"). CISS is one of only 29 college programs in the United States with this distinction. CAE schools receive funding from the federal government to develop academic courses, fund student travel, and run conferences and workshops.Office of the Director of National Intelligence  Days of Intrigue Intelligence Exercise  The CISS hosts an annual practical intelligence exercise, developed by Melissa Graves and Walter Flaschka. The latest exercise was held on April, 2013, and dealt with a fictional pandemic flu outbreak. ISS student analysts were joined by student scholars visiting from other Center of Academic Excellence schools and organized into one of five agencies, CIA, DIA, FBI, NSA, and State Department. The exercise leads students through a realistic national security or all- hazards disaster scenario similar to what they might face one day as intelligence analysts.Intelligence Center Students Focus on Global Pandemic  Academic Offering  The Center offers a minor in Intelligence and Security Studies (ISS) that is designed to complement a major course of study in areas of highly desirable core competencies such as foreign languages, engineering, and international studies. Unlike other minors at the University of Mississippi, students must apply for and be accepted into the minor once they have become students at the university.University of Mississippi's Center for Intelligence and Security Studies Criteria for acceptance include an excellent GPA, strong communication skills and exceptional motivation for a career in analytics. The minor consists of the following six mandatory courses; students generally complete upper level courses in their junior and senior years:University of Mississippi's Center for Intelligence and Security Studies * ISS 125 Introduction to Intelligence Studies * ISS 350 Fundamentals of Analysis * ISS 375 Intelligence Communications * ISS 480 National Security Issues of the 21st Century * ISS 490 Internship * ISS 499 Capstone Project  Students  CISS selects its cohorts of students through a vigorous application process that includes personal statements, essays, letters of reference and an interview. CISS selected its third cohort of 16 students in March 2011. The 2012 cohort students represented 9 majors and 6 languages spoken with different degrees of fluency. The average GPA was 3.78. Represented majors: Accountancy, Arabic, Biology, Business, Chemical Engineering, Chinese, Civil Engineering, Classics, Criminal Justice, Economics, English, French, Geology, History, International Studies, Marketing Communications, Political Science, Psychology, Public Policy, Religious Studies, Spanish.

Retrieved on 1 September 2009. is a British playwright and screenwriter. He is best known for the television serials Blackpool (2004), a musical drama about a shady casino owner; Occupation (2009), which follows three military servicemen adjusting to civilian life after a tour of duty in Iraq; and Desperate Romantics (2009), a biographical drama about the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 2007, he adapted Blackpool for CBS as Viva Laughlin. His most current work is the BBC World War II drama series World on Fire (2019). Biography Born and raised in Hazel Grove, Stockport, Bowker was educated at Marple Hall School and read philosophy and English at the University of Leeds. He taught for twelve years in a Leeds hospital unit for the intellectually disabled, and went on to study for an M.A. in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, where his tutors were novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Rose Tremain. He switched to the screenwriting course after realising he preferred writing dialogue. Bowker began his career writing for the long-running BBC medical drama Casualty in 1992. He wrote seven episodes of the series, including the 1993 episode \\"Boiling Point\\", in which the emergency department is burnt down by rioters. \\"Boiling Point\\" attracted 17 million viewers and hundreds of complaints, and led to Bowker writing for Medics and Peak Practice. Bowker later began to write his own works for television, and in 2002 contributed the play Flesh and Blood to the BBC Two season on sex and disability. It was hailed as a breakthrough in the representation of learning disability. He has also contributed updated versions of \\"The Miller's Tale\\" and A Midsummer Night's Dream for the BBC's The Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare ReTold series (2003 and 2005, respectively). In 2009, Bowker rose back to prominence with a series of high profile and sometimes critically well-received serial dramas. Occupation, based upon the backdrop of the Iraq War and starring James Nesbitt and Stephen Graham, ran for three consecutive nights on BBC One. It averaged approximately 4 million viewers across the three nights and was described by The Independent as a \\"masterly production\\", as well as gaining praise across the wider media. Bowker followed this with another BBC drama, Desperate Romantics, which received mixed reviews, and an adaptation of Emily Bront√´'s classic novel Wuthering Heights for ITV.

The surfboards are made primarily from northern white cedar, with some western red cedar added for color accent. Grain manufactures custom boards, as well as selling kits and offering classes where surfers can build their own boards. History Founded in 2005 in York, Maine, Grain has boat building and cabinetry influences. The first of Grain's boards were constructed in co-founder Mike LaVecchia's basement. A New England magazine, N'East, featured a story about the startup, which was followed up by a report by the Associated Press in December 2005. Around the same time, Clark Foam, a major manufacturer of blank foam surfboards, shut down after disagreements with California's Environmental Protection Agency. This led surfers to rethink the environmental impact of their boards, and business at Grain picked up. Brad Anderson joined the company as co-owner, and Grain moved into a workshop at Side Hill Farm in York. Grain has made a wooden version of Channel Islands Surfboards 'Biscuit' since 2009. The original Biscuit won the 2008 Surf Industry Manufacturers Association Award. The Wood Biscuit is heavier than a fiberglass board, but the extra weight gives better momentum over choppy water. Grain launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2013 to raise funds for a bus and trailer to use as a mobile workshop for board building classes. The campaign was successful, raising over $40,000 dollars in one month. In keeping with the company's green ethos, the bus is powered by alternative fuel. In 2017 Grain had to leave the workshop they had rented for over a decade. They crowdfunded a deposit for the purchase of a new workshop, but ultimately were unable to raise sufficient funds to buy the property. Later in 2017, Grain was one of the founder members of the nonprofit trade group Maine Outdoor Brands. In 2018, Grain partnered with the Glenmorangie distillery create a limited edition of boards made from whisky barrels. The board was made from Glenmorangie's whisky barrels, along with reclaimed western red cedar and Maine-grown northern white cedar. Each board contained twelve barrel staves, which is half of a whisky barrel. Production New designs are drawn using 3D cad software. Each board has an internal wooden frame onto which planks are glued before being sanded into shape. The frame forms the backbone of the hollow board and is intricately designed like an airplane wing. It takes up to 60 hours to construct a board, with many tiny pieces of wood used. The final step is to finish the board with fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin, which is necessary to prevent the wood from soaking up water. The wood used to craft the boards is white cedar, grown locally in Maine, and sustainably harvested. Left-over wood is not wasted; shavings are collected for use as animal bedding, and off-cuts are used to make sea-sleds or skateboards. Customer engagement , Grain had over 50,000 followers on Instagram, 12,000 on Facebook, and more than 7,000 newsletter subscribers. Grain's website and social media presence have been praised as an example of using open communication on the internet to spread ideas and create customers. As people attend classes with Grain and build their own boards, they share images of this on social media, which fuels further interest in Grain's surfboards.

She is best known for her work treating cognitive deficits in people with psychiatric disorders. This subspecialty is known as cognitive remediation.  Education and career  Medalia received her BS from Tufts University (1976) and PhD in Clinical Psychology and Neuropsychology from City University of New York (1982). From 1983-2006 she served on the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, rising from Instructor to Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology. During this time, she also served as Director of Neuropsychology at Montefiore Medical Center. In 2007 she moved to Columbia University‚Äôs College of Physicians and Surgeons, where she is a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry. At Columbia, she established the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic, a comprehensive psychiatric rehabilitation program for individuals with persistent mental illness. The Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic was featured on the award-winning PBS television series, Healthy Minds. Medalia has been instrumental in raising awareness about the need to address cognition as a central aspect of health related to functional outcome. In 1996 she started the largest annual conference on the topic of treating cognition in psychological disorders. This conference, Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry, takes place in June in New York City. Alice Medalia is the recipient of the Connie Lieber Research Award the Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Awardhttp://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/privatefoundationgrants/beckman_ceremony_program_2012.pdf for inspirational teaching, and the 2012 Brain Behavior Research Foundation Productive Lives Award.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r-tlpqcERo&feature=youtu.be Contributions Medalia has primary research interests in treating cognition, motivation, and facilitating recovery among people with mental illness. Her key contribution to psychiatry relates to her application of motivation theories to the treatment of cognitive disorders. Medalia identified the need for the treatment of cognition to move beyond theories of neuroplasticity, to embrace an understanding of how people learn. Drawing on theories of motivation as they related to learning, Medalia showed that intrinsic motivation, which is the motivation to engage in an activity for its inherent value and interest, is significantly linked to the amount of learning that takes place in rehabilitation programs. She also demonstrated that intrinsic motivation is malleable and responsive to environmental cues and instructional techniques. Medalia developed the widely used NEAR (Neuropsychological & Educational Approach to Remediation) model of cognitive remediation, which has been disseminated world wide. The NEAR model creates a therapeutic structure designed to enhance intrinsic motivation to learn. It teaches clinicians how to evaluate cognitive training programs, from the vantage of neuropsychology, neuroplasticity theory and motivational theory. This is important because computerized cognitive training activities started to proliferate in the 21st century, and consumers and clinicians needed tools to evaluate the products. The NEAR model has been used with people diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and mild cognitive impairment and implemented in psychiatric, educational, forensic and supportive housing settings. In addition to working with psychiatric populations, Medalia has used cognitive remediation to help formerly homeless individuals in supportive housing improve the cognitive skills needed to work and maintain housing. By focusing on cognitive health in addition to physical and mental health, cognitive remediation seeks to improve such skills as memory, attention, and problem solving, so people are more effective in their daily lives.

The stadium was never completed, and the partially constructed building was demolished in 2005.  History  The idea for the stadium was originally devised by Paoli, Pennsylvania, businessman Thomas X. Flaherty. Plans were for the new stadium to host the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, as well as the Lehigh Valley Steam A-League soccer club. The stadium's total cost would have been $15 million. The land the stadium was to be built on was owned by a Pennsylvania non-profit organization, Northwestern Human Services (NHS), on whose board of trustees Flaherty sat. The non-profit qualified for a $5 million grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; NHS hoped that its involvement in the stadium would raise its profile in the community and create awareness for its programs. The Black Diamonds were intended to open their inaugural 1998 season in the new park. However, construction was delayed and did not commence until December 1998. Plans were changed for play at the stadium to start in the 2000 season. In the meantime, the construction delay caused the Steam to fold, after playing its sole season in 1999 on various high school fields in the area. In 1998, the Black Diamonds played their home games at aging Delano- Hitch Stadium in Newburgh, New York as the Newburgh Black Diamonds. After league commissioner Bud Harrelson announced that the league would return to Newburgh in 1999 only if the city built a new stadium; they did not, forcing the club played its entire second season as a traveling team. In July 1999, with the stadium only about 60% completed, construction was halted when funds were exhausted and permanent financing could not be located. Further, the $5 million grant that was promised by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania upon completion of the facility was officially terminated. While attempting to find investors to complete construction of the stadium (and the fact there was a new Atlantic League rule stating that all teams had to have a home field), the Black Diamonds moved into cozy Memorial Park Stadium in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, which had a capacity of about 900, all on wooden benches. Since the new team arrived at the last minute, Memorial Park gave the Quakertown Blazers of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, as well as the local American Legion teams, schedule priority over the Black Diamonds. Therefore, home games were often played on weekday afternoons and typically drew less than 100 fans; one game had a paid attendance of exactly two people. The club filed for bankruptcy in 2000, and their place in the league was taken by another traveling team, the Pennsylvania Road Warriors. Finally, the Sport Complex was torn down in 2005, without a single game ever being played at its grounds. =Legacy= Several lawsuits followed in the wake of the Sports Complex failure, including one brought by Northwestern Human Services itself, against Flaherty and its former President and CEO, Robert C. Panaccio. The suit claimed that Flaherty and Panaccio used their positions on the Board of Trustees to influence NHS into gifting the land for the construction of the Sports Complex; it was also alleged that the two hid the fact that Flaherty had no independent ability to pay for the stadium, and that they had secretly been using NHS funds to pay for the construction of the stadium even though they made representations to the other board members that no funds were being used. As proof of its claims, NHS produced documentation that Flaherty and Panaccio entered into an agreement for the company to purchase a building owned by Flaherty at an inflated price of nearly $900,000 more than he paid for it four years earlier. The proceeds from the sale were to be used in the construction of the Sports Complex. The idea of professional baseball in the Lehigh Valley seemed to be seriously damaged by the failure of the Sport Complex and the Black Diamonds. However, in 2006 ground was broken on Coca- Cola Park, a $50.25 million facility with a capacity of 10,000 people, located in Allentown. The stadium is used by the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who are the Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, who have been a success.

Von Frey filaments rely on the principle that an elastic column, in compression, will buckle elastically at a specific force, dependent on the length, diameter and modulus of the material. Once buckled, the force imparted by the column is fairly constant, irrespective of the degree of buckling. The filaments may therefore be used to provide a range of forces to the skin of a test subject, in order to find the force at which the subject reacts because the sensation is painful. This type of test is called a mechanical nociceptive threshold test. The buckling force is inversely proportional to the length of the column (so the shorter the column, the higher the force required to buckle it) and proportional to the cube of the diameter, so that increasing the diameter of a filament by a small amount increases the buckling force considerably. Sets of filamentshttp://www.bioseb.com/bioseb/anglais/default/item_id=577_cat_id=19_Von%20Frey%20Filaments.php are normally made of nylon hairs, all the same length, but of various diameters so as to provide a range of forces, typically from 0.008 grams force up to 300 grams force. Von Frey filaments are a diagnostic, research, and screening tool, used both in human and animal medicine. They are readily used to study skin areas with normal responsiveness, as well as hyper- or hyposensitive areas. The determination of a mechanical threshold using von Frey filaments requires a number of discrete tests using filaments with different bucking forces. There are two commonly used algorithms, the up-down method and the percent response method. The up-down method is most commonly used, usually requiring a minimum of four tests after the first response is detected. The first measurement should be made with a filament with a buckling force close to the expected mean of the population. Errors may result if testing is commenced a long way above or below the mean. These errors have been evaluated by a combination of experimentation and mathematical simulation http://www.mousemet.co.uk/files/2014/07/Up-down-method-errors.pdf References Category:Medical equipment ","title":"Von Frey hair"},{"id":"23874509","text":"\\"Don't Take It Personal\\" is a 1989 single by Jermaine Jackson.

By measuring the radial velocities of the group's members through astronomical spectroscopy, the velocity dispersion of that group can be estimated and used to derive the group's mass from the virial theorem.Collins Dictionary of Astronomy, 2nd Ed.; Harper Collins Publishers; 2000; pp.444,449 Radial velocity is found by measuring the Doppler width of spectral lines of a collection of objects; the more radial velocities one measures, the more accurately one knows their dispersion. A central velocity dispersion refers to the œÉ of the interior regions of an extended object, such as a galaxy or cluster. The relationship between velocity dispersion and matter (or the observed electromagnetic radiation emitted by this matter) takes several forms in astronomy based on the object(s) being observed. For instance, the M‚ÄìœÉ relation was found for material circling black holes, the Faber‚ÄìJackson relation for elliptical galaxies, and the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation for spiral galaxies. For example, the œÉ found for objects about the Milky Way's supermassive black hole (SMBH) is about 75 km/s. The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) hosts a SMBH about 10 times larger than our own, and has a œÉ ‚âà 160 km/s. Groups and clusters of galaxies have a wider range of velocity dispersions than smaller objects. For example, our own poor group, the Local Group, has a œÉ = 61¬±8 km/s. But rich clusters of galaxies, such as the Coma Cluster, have a œÉ ‚âà 1,000 km/s. The dwarf elliptical galaxies within Coma have their own internal velocity dispersion for their stars, which is a œÉ ‚â≤ 80 km/s, typically. Normal elliptical galaxies, by comparison, have an average œÉ ‚âà 200 km/s. For spiral galaxies, the increase in velocity dispersion in population I stars is a gradual process which likely results from the random momentum exchanges, known as dynamical friction, between individual stars and large interstellar media (gas and dust clouds) with masses greater than .

Music Finn took up the bouzouki in the 1970s. In contrast to most Irish players, he played a round-backed Greek bouzouki, one of the older-style trichordo three course (six string) instruments tuned DAD. The Greek tuning gave him a versatile modal rhythmic background on which to create counterpoint to the melody. In the late 1970s and early 80s, he accompanied several prominent Irish instrumentalists including Frankie Gavin, Mary Bergin and Noel Hill. He performed with De Dannan up to its dissolution in 2003. After the dissolution of the group, Finn copyrighted the name De Danann (note the slightly different spelling). Ironically, a dispute arose in July 2009 with his former colleague Frankie Gavin for using the name De Dannan for the Frankie Gavin Quartet, a group which had been in existence parallel to De Dannan since 1991. Finn, along with fellow original De Danann member Johnny \\"Ringo\\" McDonagh, had recently reformed De Danann with banjoist/keyboardist Brian McGrath, accordionist Derek Hickey, fiddler Mick Conneely, and singer Eleanor Shanley. Family and name Alec Finn was the older brother of the author Gervase Phinn. He changed the spelling of his surname from Phinn to Finn upon moving to Ireland from his childhood home in Rotherham, West Riding.

It is currently a department within the Government of Gibraltar. History Main Street The Gibraltar Post Office has been running for over 150 years, as in 1857 the Overland Post Office (based in the colonial authorities' premises at Secretary's Lane) merged with the Packet Agency (which had office's in Turnbull's Lane). The first stamps went on sale in September and a year later a new building was completed and opened at 104 Main Street. This remains the main post office in Gibraltar today. George V pillar box in Gibraltar In 1886 the local colonial authorities took over control of the Gibraltar Post Office and were able to issue their own stamps. Initially they overprinted Bermuda stamps but by December they had their own design. However, they still sold Spanish stamps if required and between 1889 and 1898 the post office sold Gibraltar stamps valued in pesetas as this was the currency in circulation. For the first fifty years, the Gibraltar Post Office had responsibility for the post office not only in Gibraltar but also for the British postal service in Morocco. This ended in 1907. In 2005 the Gibraltar Post Office was granted the title of \\"Royal\\" by Her Majesty the Queen. Gibraltar is the only Commonwealth or British Overseas Territory post office outside the United Kingdom that bears this title.RGPO  About Us Gibraltar has traditional red pillar boxes and the tops are also frequently painted black. The Post Office continues to provide some traditional services and was still using benefit books after they were abandoned in the United Kingdom, while there is also a special philatelic counter to sell the commemorative stamps.

Tom Field (1914‚Äì1919), MHR (Member of the House of Representatives) for Nelson, was a relative. Field was a significant figure in the tramping history of the Tararua Range of which he helped to promote the development of its most popular tramping route, known as the Southern Crossing. Within the Tararuas, both Field Peak and Field Hut, the oldest remaining purpose-built tramping hut in New Zealand, are named after him. He was a founding member of the Tararua Tramping Club, one of the first of many tramping clubs in New Zealand. Centennial Highway opened 1940 He was closely associated with improvement to the railway services to his electorate, one train was known as \\"Field's Express\\", and the construction of the Tawa Flat tunnel. He also led the campaign for the electrification of the Johnsonville service extended to Paekakariki in 1940 and, 70 years later, to his electorate at Waikanae in February 2011. With Charles Gray of Pukerua Bay he was largely responsible for the Centennial Highway on the narrow coastline south of Paekakariki.Obituary, Charles Gray.

William Field stood as a Liberal in 1900 and was regarded as a 'country liberal' or 'freehold liberal' and therefore it is not surprising that he moved politically to support the Reform Party over time. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal and in 1937, he was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal. Death Field died in Wellington on 13 December 1944.

Located at UNESCO HQ's in Paris, France, was founded in UNESCO's 10th session of General Conference in 1958. History Under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Rivet, in 1955, UNESCO organized a series of consultations to further the work of the International Institute of Educational Cinema, which was previously affiliated to the League of Nations. On the occasion of the General Conference of UNESCO, held in New Delhi in 1958, the project of establishing an International Institute of Cinema and Television was presented by Professor Mario Verdone, Head of the Italian Delegation, and approved. The study was entrusted to Jean Benoit-Levy, filmmaker, honorary director of the United Nations Cinema, assisted by a group of twelve international experts. The Constitutional Charter of ICFT was signed on 23 October 1958. The most important federations and associations working in the field of audiovisuals and media became the founding members of the ICFT. In 1980, with the emergence of new technologies, Professor Enrico Fulchignoni, Director of Artistic and Literary Creation at UNESCO and President of the ICFT, decided to add audiovisual communication to the missions of the counsel.

Routledge & Kegan Paul (London), 2013. Accessed 12 November 2013. is a figure in traditional Chinese folklore and religion. He is known for endlessly cutting down a self-healing osmanthus tree on the Moon, a divine punishment which has led to his description as the Chinese Sisyphus.Brendon, Juliet & al. The Moon Year: A Record of Chinese Customs and Festivals, p. 410. Kelly & Walsh, 1927. Reprinted Routledge (Abingdon), 2011. Accessed 13 November 2013. In modern Chinese, the chengyu \\"Wu Gang chopping the tree\\" () is used to describe any endless toil. The specific reason for his situation has varied in the sources, but Wu Gang's story dates back to at least the Tang dynasty. Legend =Origins= An etiological myth for the moon's phases was that a great forest or great tree grew there, swiftly growing and losing leaves and blossoms over the course of each month. After the expansion of the Chinese cultural area south of the Yangtze River during the Qin and Han dynasties, the lunar trees became associated with the fragrant and white-blossoming osmanthus. This tree flowers during the autumn and promoted the connection of the Chinese harvest celebration with the Moon, a connection still observed during the modern Mid-Autumn Festival. Confections and wine flavored with its blossoms are also still associated with the holiday.Qiu Yaohong. Origins of Chinese Tea and Wine, p. 121. Asiapac Books (Singapore), 2004. Accessed 7 November 2013.Liu Junru. Chinese Food, p. 136. Cambridge Univ. Press (Cambridge), 2011. Accessed 7 November 2013. By the time of the Han, the Book of the Master of Huainan associated the waxing of the moon with trees growing from the feet of a Chinese immortal. In his Compendium of Materia Medica, Li Shizhen explains that Wu Gang was added to the stories about the holiday from novellas published during the Sui and Tang dynasties.The Writings of Mao Zedong, 1949‚Äì1976, Vol. II. January 1956 ‚Äì December 1957, p. 540. M.E. Sharpe (London), 1992. Accessed 12 November 2013. =First version= The 9th-century Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang mentions a lunar tree over five hundred feet high and says that Wu Gang of Xihe stood under it. It relates that other immortals were sent there to chop the tree when they made a mistake. =Second version= Wu witnessed a liaison between his wife and Yandi's grandson, after the two had already carried on an affair so long it begat three sons. In a rage, Wu murdered his wife's lover but Yandi ordered Wu banished to the Moon, where he would cut down a tree. After each blow, the tree healed itself and Wu was therefore forced to cut at it forever. =Third version= Another version features a cherry bay. In this version, Wu Gang began the attempt to become a Taoist immortal but gave up lazily midway through the process. The Jade Emperor was furious and decided to punish him. The Emperor created a cherry bay on the Moon and Wu Gang was invited to chop it down in order to become an immortal. Wu Gang tried, but again the tree healed itself and the task was impossible. The shadows on the Moon are said to be created by the growing cherry bay. =Fourth version= In yet another version, Wu found a teacher in the mountains in his quest for immortality. When his teacher taught him to heal, he gave up after three days. When he was taught to play Chinese chess, he gave up after two days. When he was taught the method of eternal life, he gave up after a day. His teacher then sent him to the Moon to chop down the tree.

It is said that his rigid ways prompted him to follow and document the Hung Ga Kuen teachings of Wong Fei Hung to the letter, thus he was referred to as Old Square Mind for his stubbornness to tradition. This statement cannot be confirmed, but it can be confirmed that he was known as the Tiger of Sai Gwan. Life Dang Fong was born in Saam Sui, of Guangdung Province in China. His father Dang Biu was a famous practitioner of Tit Da and Chinese Kung Fu, and had a deep knowledge of Maau Saan, Chinese Witchcraft. Dang Biu had killed people in combat during his younger years and thus refused to teach his son martial arts. As Dang Fong was stubborn in his request he did manage to learn the basics of self-defense from his father. In his youth he learned Chinese Tit Da (Chinese Orthopedics) from his father. When he grew up Dang Fong went to Guong Jau City to learn martial arts under Master Wong Yau, who had a school located in Cheung Sau Lane's Dak Sing Lane. He stayed under Wong's strict tutelage for more than 2 years before leaving to seek out a better teacher. Later, Dang Fong became a student of monk Sin Ling of the Wah Lum Temple. Dang believed Sin Ling to have a better method of teaching and devoted himself to learning with him. It was Sin Ling who taught Dang Fong the Left-handed Plum Flower Spear (Joh Sau Mui Fa Cheung), a weapon that he became very famous by. Dang Fong originally began learning Hung Ga Kuen from Lam Sai Wing, the disciple of Wong Fei Hung. At that time Lam Sai Wing was teaching in Guangzhou's Chan Tong District. Dang Fong was popular and had many friends, two of which were Sui Lo Yuk and Sui Lo Yin, both students of Wong Fei Hung. They taught a lot of their kung fu to Dang and later introduced him to Wong Fei Hung to become an indoor disciple learning martial arts and Tit Da. He reported that Wong's teaching style was to teach students according to their abilities. For example, he taught Ling Wan Gai mainly the skills of the staff and Lam Sai Wing the skills of the fist and hand forms. When Wong Fei Hung saw Dang Fong perform the Left-handed Plum Flower Spear he saw a lot of potential, but for his own reasons focused Dang's training on Tit Da and herbal skills. As Dang Fong was determined to learn Kung Fu he would ask other students of Wong Fei Hung to teach him. He learned Fifth Brother Eight Trigram Staff (Ng Long Pah Kua Guang) from Ling Wan Gai, the Generals Broadsword (Ji Fai Do) from Lam Sai Wing, the Green Dragon Knife (Ching Lung Yan Yuet Do) from Chan Din Biu, etc. Then one day when Wong Fei Hung saw Dang Fong practicing the Green Dragon Knife, which he had never taught him, he realized his passion for learning and changed his focus to teaching Dang Fong his Hung Ga Kuen. Afterward with Wong's permission, Dang Fong opened a school in Yi Yung Tong, in Tai Ho Road of Sai Kwan District in Guangzhou. He invited Wong's wife Mok Gwai Lan to be the martial art and lion dancing trainer for female students, and the school became famous for male and female lion dancing. One day Dang Fong had a fight with a master named Yuen Hoi and defeated him. The fight gained him the name \\"Tiger of Sai Kwan\\". During the Lok Sin Theater incident, Dang Fong was one of the participants and injured many people and had to leave Guangzhou going to Southeast Asia. Dang Fong returned to China after the Ching Dynasty and after the Sino-Japanese war he moved to Hong Kong. In 1948, the Kowloon Jewelry Association and Hong Kong Fisher Market of the Eastern District invited Dang Fong to be their martial arts and lion dance teacher.

Charles Cavendish (1620‚Äì1643) Life He was second son of William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire and his wife Christiana, born on 30 May 1620, and named after Prince Charles, his godfather. In 1638 he was sent abroad to travel with a governor, visiting Cairo and Turkey. He returned to England in May 1641, and then served in a campaign under the Prince of Orange. On the outbreak of the First English Civil War he entered the king's troop of guards as a volunteer under the command of Lord Bernard Stuart. At the battle of Edgehill he distinguished himself and was given the command of the Duke of York's troop left vacant by the death of George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny. After a disagreement with an inferior officer, he sought an independent command, and obtained from the king a commission to raise a regiment of horse in the north. He then established himself at Newark; active against the parliamentarians, he was requested by the king's commissioners for Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire as commander-in-chief, and took on the forces of those two counties, with the rank of colonel-general. On 23 March 1643 he captured Grantham with the aid of a large force drawn from Newark under the command of Colonel Sir John Henderson, and on 11 April defeated the younger Hotham at Ancaster, threatening to break-out into the eastern association area. He received the queen Henrietta Maria at Newark, and escorted her part of her way to Oxford, taking Burton-on-Trent by assault during the march, 2 July 1643. But attempting to prevent the raising of the siege of Gainsborough, he was defeated by Oliver Cromwell, and fell by the hand of James Berry, Cromwell's captain-lieutenant (28 July 1643). He was buried at Newark; thirty years later his body was moved to Derby, to be interred with his mother.

The theorem states that every strict partial order is contained in a total order. Intuitively, the theorem states that a comparison between elements that leaves some pairs incomparable can be extended in such a way every element is either less than or greater than another.  Definitions and statement  A binary relation R on a set X is formally defined as a set of ordered pairs (x,y) of elements of X, and we often abbreviate (x,y) ‚àà R as xRy. A relation is irreflexive if xRx holds for no element x ‚àà X; it is transitive if xRy and yRz imply xRz for all x, y, z ‚àà X; and it is a connex relation if either xRy or yRx holds for all x, y ‚àà X. A strict partial order is an irreflexive and transitive relation, and a total order is a strict partial order that is also a connex relation. A relation R is contained in another relation S when all ordered pairs in R also appear in S, i.e. xRy implies xSy for all x, y ‚àà X. The extension theorem states that every relation R that is irreflexive and transitive (i.e. a strict partial order) is contained in another relation S which is irreflexive and transitive but also connex so that it is a total order.  Proof  The theorem is proved in two steps. First, if a strict partial order does not compare x and y, it can be extended by first adding the pair (x,y) and then performing the transitive closure, and second, since this operation generates an ordering that strictly contains the original one and can be applied to all pairs of incomparable elements, there exists a relation in which all pairs of elements have been made comparable. The first step is proved as a preliminary lemma, in which a strict partial order where a pair of elements x and y are incomparable is changed to make them comparable. This is done by first adding the pair xRy to the relation, which may result in a non-transitive relation, and then restoring transitivity by adding all pairs qRy such that qRx, all pairs xRp such that yRp, and all pairs qRp such that qRx and yRp. This is done on a single pair of incomparable elements x and y, but produces a relation that is still irreflexive and transitive and that strictly contains the original one. Other pairs of elements may still be incomparable, in which case we can repeat this process. The extension theorem is then proved by showing that the poset of strict partial orders containing R, ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element. The existence of such a maximal element is proved by applying Zorn's lemma to this poset. A chain in this poset is a set of relations containing R such that given any two of these relations, one is contained in the other. To apply Zorn's lemma we need to show that every chain has an upper bound in the poset. Let \\\\mathcal{C} be such a chain, and we show that the union of its elements, \\\\bigcup \\\\mathcal{C}, is an upper bound for \\\\mathcal{C} which is in the poset: \\\\mathcal{C} contains the original relation R since every element of \\\\mathcal{C} is a strict partial order containing R. Next we show that \\\\bigcup \\\\mathcal{C} is a transitive relation. Suppose that (x,y) and (y,z) are in \\\\bigcup \\\\mathcal{C}, so that there exist S, T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} such that (x, y) \\\\in S and (y, z) \\\\in T. Since \\\\mathcal{C} is a chain we have either S‚äÜT or T‚äÜS. Suppose S‚äÜT; the argument for when T‚äÜS is similar. Then we also have (x, y) \\\\in T. Since all relations produced by our process are transitive, (x,z) is in T, and therefore in \\\\bigcup \\\\mathcal{C}. Therefore by Zorn's lemma the set of strict partial orders containing R has a maximal element Q, and it remains only to show that Q is total. Indeed if Q had a pair of incomparable elements then we could apply our process to it, leading to another strict partial order that contains R and strictly contains Q, contradicting that Q is maximal. Q is therefore a total order containing R, completing the proof.

Life Menesius came from an old wealthy Scottish family of Catholic and traditional background from Aberdeen, who were forced by religious persecution to emigrate to France in 1639. Menesius studied at the Douai College. After Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658 the family returned to Scotland when Charles II returned the family's land. However, their wealth was lost and Paul, the youngest son, had to seek his own living. He joined the Polish army. In 1660 he defected to Russia. There, he received a master's rank and later married a Russian woman. Menzies' friendship with Kirill Naryshkin, who since 1671 was the Tsar's father-in-law, and Patrick Gordon and others placed him close to Tsar Alexei. When in 1671 - 1672 during a return to Scotland, his fortunes took a further turn. The Russian state was looking for allies among the European states to fight Turkey. Menesius with his linguistic skills and Catholic faith was enlisted as an ambassador and sent in 1672, to Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, Venice and Rome. Although he was welcomed, he did not receive any direct response to the appeal for alliance. However, despite Austrian suspicion; in Vienna when he announced that the Turks had conquered the Kamenets and Russian arsenals, the Austrian Emperor led an army to the borders to defeat the infidel invader. Meeting with the pope On the embassy to Rome in 1673, the legate was warmly welcomed. Menesius delivered a letter from Tsar Alexei to Pope Clement X requesting his help against their common enemy the Turk and asking him to intercede and write to the Kings of England and France that they might aid him against the enemies of Christians. He was also to solicit the Pope on behalf of Alexis for formal recognition of the title of Tsar. Rome recognized Alexis only as the Grand duke of Muscovy who had conferred the title of Tsar upon himself. The Pope was not convinced that Alexis professed the faith in such a manner as to give any assurance of his Catholic intentions. However an audience was refused when Menzies would not agree to kiss the Pope's foot. Despite an attempt to arrange a secret audience, the negotiations ended unsuccessfully. Later life On his return to Russia in 1674 he was promoted to the rank of major general and was made a tutor for the Tsarevich Peter (the future Peter I) in military matters; consisting mainly of rowdy outdoor games with live ammunition. Come 1682, the regent Sophia Alekseyevna sent him off to war against the Crimean Tatars. In 1684, along with Patrick Gordon and Alexander Livingston, fellow Scottish soldiers in the Tsar's service, Menesius signed a petition for the opening of a first Roman Catholic congregation in Russia. The permission was granted. This was the first time that a Roman Catholic church was built in Moscow. By the summer of 1689, Peter took power from his half-sister Sophia, whose position had been weakened by two unsuccessful Crimean campaigns. Menesius, till his death in 1694, enthusiastically defended the interests of Russia, but still remained a staunch Catholic and Scottish patriot.

Ukrainian Language Dictionary (Academic Etymology Dictionary). which serves as an arterial road. The term \\"prospekt\\" as a road- type concept originated in the Russian Empire. As an urban area sprawls along transportation routes, the roads outside of city limits called chaussee (French for road surface) often also become converted into prospekts. History In the first years of construction of St Petersburg (in the early 18th century), the city's broad ways were called \\"perspectiva\\" (, literally, visual or graphical perspective). One of the world-known prospekts of Petersburg is Nevsky Prospekt. The name \\"prospekt\\" was widely used in the USSR where it was traditionally used for the main avenues in the newly constructed cities and cities‚Äô blocks. Later on, the term came into the national languages of the Soviet Republics which became independent states in 1991. Etymology Russian lexicographer Vladimir Dal in his \\"Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language\\" marked prospekt as a loanword from French. Prospekt is cognate with the English term prospect, both derive from Latin prospectus \\"view, outlook\\". In the 18th century Russia, prospekt was used specifically for very long straight streets, especially in St. Petersburg, because they afforded a spectacular view from one end to the other when looking down them.

They are members of a basal group within the cockroaches. This somewhat roundish and contrastingly marked cockroach is mainly found on the ground in scrub forest habitats where they may burrow under leaf litter or loose soil during the heat of the day. Description tegmina The seventh spot is seen below its third spot, on the left bottom. The black and white pattern of adults is believed to have evolved to mimic the pattern of the aggressive ground beetle Anthia sexguttata that has strong defenses, including the ability to spray chemical irritants. The upperside of the abdomen is orange-yellow, but is hidden by the tegmina. The spots on the asymmetrical tegmina are placed so that when closed, the spots appear symmetrical. The right tegmen lobe is bright orange-yellow. The species has been said to be one of the few cockroaches with \\"grace and beauty\\". The head is bent back underneath the pronotal shield (hypognathous) and the ocelli (simple eyes) face forward, helping sense light and thereby time foraging activity during early morning and late evening. Reproduction Once a female has copulated with a male, she does not allow other males to approach, kicking them away with her hind legs. The eggs are laid in leaf litter. Up to 13 oothecae are produced by a female over 3 to 40 days (blocking the ocelli of the females has been found to inhibit the laying of eggs). The oothecae are produced as in other cockroaches by the secretions from the asymmetrical colleterial glands of the females. Once the ootheca is extruded it is deposited in suitably moist leaf litter. Nymphs lead a life hidden below the ground and may go as deep as 30 cm during the dry season. Taxonomy This is the type species for the genus Therea. The species epithet is after James Petiver (1663‚Äì1718), who obtained specimens from Madras and its vicinity (probably from the surgeon at Fort St. George, either Samuel Browne or Edward Bulkley). Carl Linnaeus placed the species under Cassida and described C. petiveriana and another that he called C. septemguttata, now considered a synonym. Communication Like other cockroaches, T. petiveriana uses chemical pheromones to communicate with each other. When disturbed, they are said to raise their wings and evert lateral glands on the second and third abdominal segments. Their glandular secretions were found to contain volatile compounds N-3-methylbutylacetamide (MBA) and N-3-methylbutylpropanamide (MBP), making up nearly 60% of the volatile fraction. These chemicals appeared to induce alarm behaviour. Digestion Like termites, these cockroaches have symbiotic flagellates and bacteria in their gut that aid in digestion. As pets This species is popular as a pet in many parts of the world and is easy to keep.

It is the first in a series which features the husband-and-wife team of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. Plot introduction The Cater Street Hangman introduces Inspector Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison, who both become regular characters in crime novels by Anne Perry. Set in 1881, the story follows an investigation into the murders of several young women in the streets near the wealthy Ellison family home.Rye, Marilyn. \\"Anne Perry.\\" British Mystery and Thriller Writers Since 1960. Ed. Gina MacDonald. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 276. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Literature Resource Center. Gale. Hennepin County Library. 5 August 2009 =Explanation of the novel's title= Throughout the Thomas Pitt series, Perry uses the names of real neighbourhoods in London as titles of the novels. Plot summary In an upper-class salon on Cater Street, several women discuss, in oblique terms, the death of a local girl. Even though Susannah has recently been out of town and is unaware of the murder, it is bad form for proper women to talk about such matters and so they are careful not to say anything too direct about the way the daughter of a friend was garroted and cut open. Finally, tiring of the game, Charlotte comes out and tells her aunt what she has heard about the murder. Although the victim was of the upper class she quickly gains a reputation as having been a bad seed. A second death occurs, this time a servant. Again the idea that these women did something to deserve this end is easier to accept than the knowledge that it could happen to anyone else. Only when the third murder happens to a member of the Ellison household do they believe that these crimes might not be a simple case of robbery or jealousy. A young police inspector, Thomas Pitt, has been investigating these crimes and soon arrives to question the Ellison household. Pitt is the educated son of a gamekeeper and cook. His education and manners let him wander in upper-class circles, while his dress and impolite tactics keep them from becoming entirely comfortable with him. Although Pitt aspires to higher social standing, he requests that he be treated as a middle class working man. None of this endears the inspector to Caroline Ellison, the lady of the house and mother of Sarah, Emily and Charlotte Ellison. Pitt uses pointed questions and little tact to find the information he needs. He often knows the answers to questions before he speaks and so puts everyone off-guard as they attempt to keep their secrets hidden. Before long, every female suspects every male of being the hangman, much to the detriment of long- standing marriages and relationships. As the investigation into who is killing the young women progresses, Thomas falls in love with the unconventional Charlotte. Outwardly, Charlotte is a model of Victorian society, but she does not wish to become one of the mindless women she sees every day. Instead, she reads newspapers that are smuggled out of her father's sight and speaks her mind on all manner of subjects. She finds out more about the world beyond her door when she meets Thomas and finds that he will engage her in useful and interesting discussions. Anne Perry wrote The Cater Street Hangman as a single, stand alone, novel. She had not intended for it to become a series and so there are elements in this book which do not blend smoothly into the series.Perry, Anne and Diana Cooper Clark. \\"Interview with Anne Perry.\\" Clues. 3.2 52‚Äì65.

Wives think about husbands, sisters watch one another. Readers witness the various thoughts that crowd into the characters head as each suspects the others and tries to reconcile their treacherous thoughts about those they thought they know and love. =Victorian society as a facade= The Love Triangle ‚Äì Charlotte has been in love with her sister's husband since the day they met. As the book comes to a close this unrequited love divides the Ellison house. Classism/Oppression of the Poor ‚Äì As each murder victim is laid to rest their reputation is soiled as they are labelled as having been among bad seeds. This reference to the lower classes makes the upper class feel secure. Also, Thomas and Charlotte have many discussions about the plight of the poor. Charlotte wonders why anyone would choose to live in squalor and Thomas explains what it means to be poor. Madness ‚Äì The crimes are blamed upon a mythical madman that no one is able to define. The murderer does turn out to be quite mad, but not in a way that anyone was expecting when they threw the term around earlier in the novel. Literary significance and reception Anne Perry's first published novel was well received in the United States for its historically accurate setting, focus on social issues and its intricate character relationships.VALENZUELA. (11 August 2002). Perry balances crime fiction, short stories :[HOME Edition]. Daily Breeze, p. B2. Retrieved 6 August 2009, from ProQuest Newsstand. (Document ID: 152293291). Enthusiastic reviews helped spread her readership, but it wasn't until many years later that she gained fame in her home country of England. \\"An ingenious mystery and an excellent example of manners and caste systems of the Victorian era.\\" The Chattanooga Times =References to other works= * When her mother catches Charlotte reading a newspaper she suggests that the new work by Charles Dickens or Coningsby by Benjamin Disraeli would be more acceptable reading material. =References within other works= * In John Sandford's Invisible Prey there is a reference to the wife of the main character reading the 'latest' Anne Perry book. =References to actual history, geography and current science= * The book opens upon Charlotte reading a purloined newspaper. She learns that Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield has recently died. Her first thought is to the reaction of his rival, William Ewart Gladstone. * Unacceptable topics of conversation for proper women include the Zulu War, violent crimes, and sex in any context. * Charlotte and Thomas discuss many criminal elements that Thomas has dealt with, including gangs of child thieves and the sale of corpses to medical schools by grave robbers. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 1998 Ardent Productions produced a made-for- television film version of the book in association with Yorkshire Television. It was broadcast on ITV in Britain, and on A&E; in the United States. The film departed slightly from the novel, dwelling less on seamy motives, and having a slightly different ending.

She sent news of the christening of Princess Elizabeth, and a copy of A Letter sent from France by Walter Montague to his father by Walter Montagu to William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, hoping he would not be converted by it to Catholicism. She wrote more letters to the Earl of Newcastle, relating her son William's grand tour in France, and the arrival of the Prince Palatine at court. Christmas 1636 was spent at Byfleet.HMC Duke of Portland, vol. 2 (London, 1893), pp. 124-7, 130. In 1637 Dorothy Sidney, Countess of Leicester, tried to arrange a marriage between her daughter Dorothy and the Earl of Devonshire; however, she found Christian's letters \\"full of civility, craft, and coldness\\", perhaps because Devonshire wanted her son's bride to bring a greater dowry.Michael G. Brennan, Noel J. Kinnamon, Margaret P. Hannay,The Correspondence (c. 1626‚Äì1659) of Dorothy Percy Sidney, Countess of Leicester (Ashgate: Farnham, 2010), pp. 37, 119: HMC Report on the manuscripts of Lord De L'Isle and Dudley, vol. 6 (London, 1925) p. 101: Victor Slater, ODNB, (2004). At the outbreak of the English Civil War she was one of the most enthusiastic royalists; her second son, Charles was killed at the battle of Gainsborough on 28 July 1643.Thomas Pomfret, The Life of the Right Honourable and Religious Lady Christian, Late Countess Dowager of Devonshire (London, 1685), p. 53. In 1647 she moved to Ampthill and lived with her brother Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin, and kept up a correspondence in cipher code with royalists in England and Scotland.Thomas Pomfret, The Life of the Right Honourable and Religious Lady Christian, Late Countess Dowager of Devonshire (London, 1685), pp. 72-3. In 1650 she bought a house at Roehampton.Thomas Pomfret, The Life of the Right Honourable and Religious Lady Christian, Late Countess Dowager of Devonshire (London, 1685), p. 66: Noel Malcolm, The Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1997), p. 809: Victor Slater, ODNB, (2004). She took charge of the king's effects after the Battle of Worcester, and during the Protectorate entertained royalists at Roehampton. She also kept up a correspondence with the principal royalists on the Continent, and General Monck sent to her privately to make her aware of his intention to restore the king. She was in fact well connected also with Oliver Cromwell, whose daughter Frances had married one of her Rich grandchildren, and she was seen at his court.Roy Edward Sherwood, Oliver Cromwell (1997), p. 112 and p. 118. In 1657 she attended the wedding of Frances Cromwell.Nadine Akkerman, Invisible Agents (Oxford, 2018), p. 133. After the Restoration Charles II frequently came to Roehampton, and his mother, Henrietta Maria of France, was on terms of intimacy with her. In old age she was said to be of formidable stature, and at Roehampton she reposed on couch with a suspended canopy and curtains.W. E. Knowles Middleton, Lorenzo Magallotti at the Court of Charles II (Waterloo, Ontario, 1980), p. 117. She died on 16 January 1675, and was buried in Derby on 18 February. Letters She entertained wits and men of letters, one of her favourite friends being Edmund Waller, another royalist. Waller dedicated to her his Epistles, which conclude with an Epistle to the Duchess, and he also wrote an epitaph for her son. William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke wrote a volume of poems in praise of her and Lady Rich, which was published with a dedication to her by John Donne. Her biographer, Thomas Pomfret, also mentions her friendship with Viscount Falkand and Sidney Godolphin.Thomas Pomfret, The Life of the Right Honourable and Religious Lady Christian, Late Countess Dowager of Devonshire (London, 1685), p. 57. Several of Lady Devonshire's letters survive. She wrote to the Earl of Haddington (d. 1640), alluding to the Bishops' Wars, \\"If the calamity be only to terrify not to punish our foul faults, for which I fear we must bleed e'er we can expiate them, I hope there is left a possibility for your Lordship again to see this part of the world.\\" In another letter she advised him against taking sides in the conflict, \\"You had better be suspected of both sides than a party to either ... If you exclude yourself in reason and religion there's enough to plead for you, even to satisfy the nicest opinions.\\"'Letters from Christian Countess of Devonshire to the Earl of Haddington and Earl of Morton', in, Miscellany of the Maitland Club, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1843), pp. 346-62, modernised spelling here. Some of these letters are dated at \\"Les\\", meaning Leicester Abbey a home she used more after her son's marriage in March 1639, until it was destroyed in 1645 following the capture of the town by Prince Rupert.Thomas Pomfret, The Life of the Right Honourable and Religious Lady Christian, Late Countess Dowager of Devonshire (London, 1685), p. 41: Noel Malcolm, The Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1997), p. 809. To William Douglas, Earl of Morton, she wrote news of Charles I and Parliament, and the death of her daughter Anne, Countess of Warwick, in 1638.Miscellany of the Maitland Club, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1843), pp. 363-5, the original letters are in the National Library of Scotland, Morton Papers. Her biographer Thomas Pomfret described her correspondence with royalists in \\"characters\\" or cipher code during the years she lived at Ampthill from 1647 to 1650. The work of receiving and opening and making these cipher letters was shared only with her nephew Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury and her chaplain Mr Robert Gale.Thomas Pomfret, The Life of the Right Honourable and Religious Lady Christian, Late Countess Dowager of Devonshire (London, 1685), pp. 72-3.

She is best known for her 2009 album Taller Children, produced by Mike Mogis and Dan Molad and released on Verve Forecast. History Ziman, who grew up in Greenwich Village, trained from youth as a classical pianist, writing her first songs on an upright piano at age 6. She attended the Berklee College of Music on a scholarship to study classical composition, and was awarded the 2001 ASCAP Leiber and Stoller scholarship for her song \\"Like Water is to Sand.\\" Her original plans to pursue film scoring were changed in 2002 when Patti Austin came to Berklee to recruit background vocalists for an Ella Fitzgerald tribute tour. Ziman toured with Austin for 18 months, causing her subsequent compositional style to draw heavily from jazz vocalists such as Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan. She met Esperanza Spalding through the Patti Austin band and Spalding eventually played bass in Ziman's first band while still attending Berklee. Ziman met Lucius drummer and fellow student Dan Molad and Esperanza Spalding at a party during their final semester at Berklee, and they began performing together shortly afterward. Esperanza Spalding left the band soon after and Guitarist Pete Lalish (Lucius), another Berklee student, later joined the band after Ziman saw him performing at a Boston bar and invited him to collaborate. After Ziman and Molad completed their studies, the band moved to Brooklyn in early 2005. Using Molad's home studio, the band financed, recorded and produced an EP, Elizabeth & The Catapult in 2006. The band was the featured Billboard Underground Artist for October 2006, and signed with Verve Records in 2008. Taller Children Having been popular on New York's Lower East Side, the band achieved a measure of national notoriety in the spring of 2009 with their first album under Verve, Taller Children. The band chose to travel to Omaha, Nebraska to record the album in the studio of Mike Mogis. Elizabeth wrote all the songs on the album with the exception of the Leonard Cohen cover \\"Everybody Knows,\\" and several of the tracks were derived from demos recorded previously in Molad's home studio. The album was recorded quickly, and the band returned to New York shortly thereafter and released the album in June 2009. The Other Side of Zero In 2009, Ziman was commissioned by John Schaefer of NPR's Soundcheck to write a song cycle for a Lincoln Center show. Having gone through a band breakup, Ziman turned to Leonard Cohen's poetry collection Book of Longing. Ziman and Molad, now working as a duo, recorded demos for much of the new album, The Other Side of Zero, at Molad's father's home in Austin, Texas, before following their record label's suggestion of working with a producer. Molad suggested Tony Berg, and the band moved into the studio to complete the album. With the departure of Pete Lalish, guitar parts on the new album were covered by Berg and by Blake Mills. The title track features Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, who had visited the studio during recording and chose to participate after Ziman encouraged them to listen to the track. The album was released in October 2010. Like It Never Happened In 2014 she performed at Madison Square Garden opening for Sara Bareilles and wrote music with Ben Folds. In 2014, Like it Never Happened was released by 30 Tigers and produced by Dan Molad, Peter Lalish and Paul Loren with string arrangements by Rob Moose. In 2015, Like it Never Happened was nominated for best album, best song, and best video by The 14th Annual Independent Music Awards and \\"Someday Soon\\" won the award in the \\"Folk/Singer- Songwriter Song\\" category. Keepsake Keepsake, the fourth album from Elizabeth & the Catapult and the first on Compass Records, was released on October 20, 2017. It was produced by Dan Molad, Richard Swift and Elizabeth Ziman.

History =Early Organizing= 32B's first logo. Between 1902 and 1920, attempts were made to form janitor‚Äôs unions, but disadvantages were overwhelming. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) chartered a few early janitor locals but remained chiefly concerned with more skilled trades. In 1921, seven small local unions led by William F. Quesse of the Chicago Flat Janitors received an AFL charter as the Building Service Employees International Union. By 1928 BSEIU membership had grown to 7,000 members across 50 small locals, with most of the strength still centered in Chicago. The Great Depression caused many BSEIU locals to fall by the wayside, and the situation in New York City was especially hard. Local 32, Superintendents and Janitors, suffered a wage cut. Locals 58 and 51 were dwindling in members, and Local 14, Harlem Superintendents, had folded. New York janitors and others were working under conditions the Chicago Flat Janitors had won 20 years earlier. BSEIU Local 58 disintegrated in the face of a 1933 membership revolt led by elevator operators David Sullivan, Thomas Shortman, Arthur Harckham, and Thomas Young. The 500 dissenting members applied to BSEIU, now led by Jerry Horan, but were turned down. Joined by Local 32, they formed an independent union in February 1934. In March 1934, Thomas Young and James Bambrick led the union‚Äôs first successful strike against a Seventh Avenue building, and by mid-April Bambrick succeeded in obtaining a BSEIU charter for the new local, and Local 32B was born. Following a successful strike in the garment district during November 1934, 32B began rapidly growing in membership, gaining an estimated 4,000 new members in less than three days during the strike, and membership stood at somewhere around 6,000 by the spring of 1935. After another successful strike in 1936 which paralyzed residential and commercial buildings citywide, 32B was established as one of the most powerful trade unions in New York City. By 1937, less than three years old, Local 32B counted some 10,000 members and shifted the balance of BSEIU power away from Chicago. =Crisis and Change= The union‚Äînow a budding power in New York politics‚Äîbegan to test its legislative strength. Measures unfriendly to Local 32B members were publicly criticized in radio and print, and efforts were made to prevent their passage. By the summer of 1938 Local 32B's employment bureau had placed over 19,000 workers in the midst of the Great Depression, and became so busy that it was forced to set up its own office at 421 Ninth Avenue. However, the New York police and the US Labor Department began investigating BSEIU locals in New York City for connections to mobster Jerry Horan and union leader George Scalise, the latter of whom was later convicted of embezzlement and forgery in 1940 and sentenced to 10-20 years in prison. In 1941, James Bambrick, 32B president since its founding, was forced to resign his union post and later served a sentence for embezzlement. Secretary-Treasurer David Sullivan, who had battled for financial integrity and safeguards, was elected to replace Bambrick.\\"Bambrick Admits Stealing Union Funds,\\" New York Times, April 26, 1941; \\"David Sullivan Wins Post in Building Service Local,\\" New York Times, June 20, 1941; \\"Bambrick Aide Elected,\\" New York Times, September 19, 1941. Historians generally consider Bambrick's accusations to be accurate. See: Witwer, \\"The Scandal of George Scalise: A Case Study in the Rise of Labor Racketeering in the 1930s,\\" Journal of Social History, Summer 2003; Fitch, Solidarity For Sale, 2006; Jacobs, Mobsters, Unions, and Feds: The Mafia and the American Labor Movement, 2007. The outbreak of World War II in 1941 offered several opportunities to polish the union's tarnished image. Local 32B, now led by David Sullivan as president, kept in the forefront of New York's defense effort. Through member contributions, an ambulance was donated to the Red Cross, and a bomber plane, \\"The Spirit of 32B,\\" to the Air Corps. War bond contributions totaled over $325,000, and Local 32B alone gave $75,000 to the $4-million AFL-CIO \\"labor war chest.\\"Local 32B-32J: Sixty Years of Progress, 1994 =Coming of Age= Parade on 6th Avenue On September 4, 1945, Local 32B struck against New York's Realty Advisory Board (RAB), requiring Governor Thomas E. Dewey to intercede. The result was a milestone ten-year \\"peace pact,\\" with regular re-openers each year and wage boosts totaling some $7 million. An outstanding provision of the contract was an antidiscrimination clause requiring employers to hire and promote without regard to race or color. 1949 marked the establishment of 32B's college scholarship program for members and their children, one of the first union scholarships in the nation. The first grants, each worth $1,200 per year for four years, were given for use at either Columbia University or Barnard College. The program would later be broadened to additional schools and supplemented by additional grants. In 1951, the union's Welfare Trust Fund began providing comprehensive coverage of members and their families for hospital and surgical benefits and life insurance, jointly administered by the union and employers. By 1954 Local 32B membership had risen to 36,000 workers employed in 5,000 commercial and residential buildings and 22 department stores. To mark its 20th anniversary, the union commissioned a television documentary depicting the lives and work of building service workers, entitled The 32B Story. It would later be used by the AFL-CIO, the United States Information Agency, and a number of international unions in the United States and abroad. In 1958 the union concluded a merger with Superintendents and Resident Managers Local 219, adding 900 members to the local's ranks. In 1991, members of 32BJ went on a labor strike, and nearly came to strike in 2006 and 2010.Deal Reached That Averts a Walkout by Doormen PATRICK McGEEHAN https://nytimes.com April 21, 2010 Merged unions The union was previously known as Local 32B-32J following the 1977 merger of SEIU locals 32B and 32J. Both locals were based in New York and had joined what was then called BSEIU in the 1930s. Local 32B (for buildings) was composed mostly of men and Local 32J (for janitors) was composed mostly of women. In the 21st century, SEIU locals underwent a series of aggressive mergers.

Several individuals called themselves \\"Diamond Lil\\" or \\"Diamond Tooth\\", creating an amalgamated legacy clouded by myth. These individuals include a vaudeville entertainer in the Yukon during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, a madam in the American West during the early 1900s, and the titular character of Mae West's Diamond Lil, who embodied these traits and popularized the name in the 1920s.  Overview  Multiple women of the American West have used the name \\"Diamond Tooth\\" and \\"Diamond Lil\\". In the case of the two most prominent, historians have often confused the lives of Honora Ornstein and Evelyn Hildegard, who both went by the name Diamond Lil around the turn of the 20th century, both emigrants from Austria, with similar ages, careers in entertainment, and diamond-inset teeth. They did differ, however, in where they lived: Ornstein in the Klondike and Seattle, and Hildegard in California and Nevada. Lil became known as enigmatic figure, and has been variously attributed as a \\"dance hall girl, gambler, prostitute, or madam who smoked cigars and carried a gun\\"‚Äîa legacy clouded with myth. By the 1920s, Diamond Tooth Lil was a household name.  Klondike Lil  The first Diamond Tooth Lil was a woman named Honora Ornstein, born in 1882. Details about her early years are unclear and sometimes contradictory. The Master File of the Social Security Death Index gives her birthplace as Austria (then Austria-Hungary). The 1920 United States Census gives her birthplace as France. Information about her family's emigration to the United States is also unclear. A 1936 Washington Post article stated she was the daughter of a Jewish family and had formerly been known as Lillian Orinstein. Newspapers in the 1960s reported that she was the daughter of wealthy cattle ranchers from Montana. Ornstein arrived in the Yukon town of Dawson in 1898 or 1899. She became famous during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon before the turn of the century on the Pantages vaudeville circuit, where she was a star entertainer for the region's spendthrift \\"sourdough\\" gold seekers. A nearby gambling house owner said that Lil spent three or four years there. Her stage name, Diamond Tooth Lil, is based on her several diamond-inset dental fillings, including ones in her front and canine teeth. She also collected and wore other diamond-studded jewelry, including a white gold snake bracelet studded with 125 real diamonds that scaled the length of her arm. Around 1908, she had moved to Seattle and was remembered for ostentatiously spending money during a Klondikers' parade. She married Robert Ernst Snelgrove in 1918. It is unclear if they divorced or he died, or when this occurred; she is reported as having married George Miller \\"later\\". Shortly before she divorced her last husband around 1928, she lived in an apartment she had purchased in Seattle and inherited $150,000 from her mother, equivalent to $ in . Lil made newspaper headlines in 1936 when she was committed to Western State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Washington, and reported as near-death. By this time, she had sold the diamonds from her teeth but was thought to still have considerable wealth‚Äîonly she was unable to speak and her relatives were not in contact. Her reputation limited the market for her jewelry collection, which she struggled to sell in the 1950s. Lil's lawyer reported that her assets had been exhausted by 1961. After spending the remainder of her life in state institutions, Lil died in a Yakima, Washington, nursing home on June 18, 1975. She was buried in a simple grave and had no known relatives. The New York Times remembered Lil as a \\"dance hall queen\\" and \\"the toast of the North\\".  Sierra Nevada Lil  1943 photo of Evelyn Fialla, the second Diamond Tooth Lil, with an undated photograph of her from her performing days on the right. Evelyn Fialla was also born in Austria-Hungary, in approximately 1877. Her family emigrated to the United States and settled in Youngstown, Ohio. She met Percy Hildegard when she was fourteen and eloped with him to Chicago, where she became a saloon singer. She divorced him on an unspecified date, and went on to marry several more times over the course of her life. Sources such as Ripley's Believe It Or Not! reported thirteen marriages. Hildegard herself put the number at eight. As a traveling dancer, she worked her way from Ohio across the West to San Francisco, California. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake left the city in ruins, Hildegard moved to Goldfield, Nevada, a boomtown of the California Gold Rush. Hildegard was paid handsomely for her exceptionally popular act at the town's Northern Saloon. Though she ultimately spent less than a year in Goldfield, she quickly opened her own dance hall and had a relationship with prospector Diamondfield Jack. Hildegard was said to have won her title of Diamond Tooth Lil in a successful bet with a Reno dentist, who set a diamond in her front tooth. Lil was said to have entertained and managed multiple profitable brothels across the West, including Death Valley, California, Denver, Colorado, and Boise, Idaho, where her \\"Star Rooms\\" in Boise had amenities including steam heating and both hot and cold water. She had reached Boise by the early 1940s. In 1944, she announced that her famous front tooth diamond would be willed to the Idaho Children's Home orphanage upon her death. By 1966, she had sold her jewelry and was penniless in California. She died at the Claremont Sanitarium of Pomona in 1967.  Mae West  Diamond Lil, the successful Broadway play written and acted by Mae West in 1928, is assumed but not confirmed to be based on the Lils' lives. The show was later adapted into the 1933 film She Done Him Wrong. West said that her inspiration for the name likely came from her father's nickname for her mother, \\"Til\\", short for \\"Matilda\\", and sometimes with her drink of choice, \\"Champagne Til\\". West based the character on herself and viewed Lil as an alter ego. \\"The femme fatale of the Bowery\\", declared The New York Times of West's Lil in the play's 1949 revival, \\"bowling her leading men over one by one with her classical impersonation of a storybook strumpet\\", dressed in \\"some of the gaudiest finery of the century\\" with a \\"snaky walk, torso wriggle, stealthy eyes, frozen smile, flat, condescending voice, [and] queenly gestures\\"‚Äîin all, \\"a triumph of nostalgic vulgarity\\". West won a lawsuit in 1966 against a Los Angeles performer for infringement of the name \\"Diamond Lil\\".

The chain became defunct following the closure of its last location in Brea, California, in 2019. History Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour was started at NW 21st Avenue in Portland, Oregon,Parkrose High School - Equus Ferox Yearbook (Portland, OR), Class of 1966, Page 290 by Bob Farrell and Ken McCarthy in 1963. Farrell's became known for their offer of a free ice cream sundae to children on their birthday. The parlors had an early 1900s theme, with employees wearing period dress and straw boater hats, and each location featured a player piano. In 1972, the Farrell's chain was purchased by the Marriott Corporation. By 1975, there were 120 Farrell's nationwide. Thereafter, sales dropped and most of the parlors were sold off in the 1980s. In 1982, Marriott sold the chain to a group of private investors. By 1990, almost all Farrell's locations had closed. One of the last original Farrell's locations in Portland, located near the Lloyd Center mall, closed in 2001. At the time of its closing, it was privately owned and known as The Original Portland Ice Cream Parlor. The final original location closed in 2006 in Eugene, Oregon. At the time, it was operating under the name of Pearl Street Ice Cream Parlour. In 2009, there was a discussion of an eventual return to Portland, but nothing came of it. In 2008, after a years-long legal battle over rights to the brand, Parlour Enterprises of Lake Forest, California, was confirmed as the owner and operator of Farrell's properties on the U.S. mainland. The company established a franchise model with original founder Bob Farrell as an advisor. They promptly opened seven Farrell's locations in California, including the Mountasia Family Fun Center in Santa Clarita; Rancho Cucamonga; downtown Brea; Riverside; Sacramento; and Buena Park. By 2014, there was a total of 8 restaurants with one each in Hawaii and Sacramento and the remainder in Southern California. There were eight Farrell's locations in Hawaii. The last Farrell's in the state was operated by E Noa Corporation at Pearlridge shopping center in Aiea, Hawaii. After 10 years in service, it closed at the end of their lease in October 2016. By 2016, Farrell's had accumulated $2 million in debt and was forced to start closing under-performing locations. The Mission Viejo location closed in January 2016. In April 2016, the Farrell's inside Mountasia Family Fun Center was re-branded and named Lickity Split by Farrell's, featuring over-the- counter dining and a streamlined menu. In August 2016, Farrell's was featured on CNBC's series The Profit, where Marcus Lemonis made a deal with the current owners and stakeholders of the Farrell's brand; three locations stayed open with a last push to bring back the iconic restaurant and ice cream parlour. Also in August 2016, the Sacramento and Rancho Cucamonga locations closed. The Santa Clarita location quietly closed sometime after the closure of the Rancho Cucamonga but before the closure of the Riverside location in late July 2017. After purchasing the company, Lemonis immediately closed the Buena Park for renovations and reopened the restaurant in August 2017. Besides the Buena Park location, only the Brea location remained open. The Buena Park location closed on December 30, 2018 leaving Brea as the last remaining location. The Brea location closed on June 8, 2019, leaving no remaining locations. While Lemonis owns 51% of the brand, he had no ownership in the Brea location. Menu The menu was printed as a tabloid-style newspaper. It featured appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, and dozens of different sundaes, as well as malts, shakes, sodas, and floats. Unusual offerings included a glass of soda water for 2 cents, and the traditional free sundae for customers celebrating a birthday. Some of the sundaes were huge and intended for a group to share. The largest, the \\"Zoo\\" sundae, was delivered with great fanfare by multiple employees carrying it wildly around the restaurant on a stretcher accompanied by the sound of ambulance sirens.\\"Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour, the Zoo Returns\\". Orange County (California) Register, November 3, 2009. One of the more amusing highlights of their original menu was a \\"Low-Calorie Diet\\" recipe sheet you could theoretically \\"adopt\\" to if you ate too much ice cream. A bowl of \\"Bees Knees and Mosquito Knuckles\\" were among the \\"impossible-to-eat\\" dishes that were featured in the joke-menu. Sacramento location tragedy On September 24, 1972, a privately owned Canadair Sabre jet (a variant of the F-86 Sabre) piloted by Richard Bingham failed to take off while leaving the Golden West Sport Aviation Air Show at Sacramento, California's Executive Airport. It went off the end of the runway and crashed into the ice cream parlour; 22 people were killed and 28 injured. In the news On April 9, 1982, a small private plane crashed into the road and burst into flames in front of the Farrell's location in Torrance, California. The pilot and his two passengers were killed but no one on the ground was harmed. In 1983, the Selective Service purchased Farrell's \\"Birthday Club\\" data and mailed warnings to young men telling them to register for the draft before their 18th birthday. Farrell's blamed the situation on an unauthorized sale by a list broker, and the government announced they would stop using the list. In April 2014, an out-of-control automobile ran into a line of patrons waiting outside the Buena Park, California, location of Farrell's. One person was killed and six others were injured. On August 23, 2016, the television show The Profit featured Farrell's Ice Cream Parlours, and frankly discussed the financial health of the company and their locations, as part of a reality television show. An investment was proposed as part of a turn-around for the company and as a result, Marcus Lemonis became the majority shareholder of the Farrell's franchise. He later took over ownership of the Buena Park location, but the restaurant closed in late 2018.

Six-year incumbent mayor Nathan Phillips was challenged by former mayor Allan Lamport and Controller Jean Newman. Phillips was returned to office. The City of Toronto also held a referendum on whether to remove the Blue Law banning films and concerts on Sunday evenings. The measure passed 94,000 votes to 58,003. Toronto mayor Phillips had first been elected to city council in 1926 and was elected mayor in 1954 and was reelected in 1956 and 1958. He faced two prominent challengers in the 1960 race. Former mayor and Board of Control member Allan Lamport and Controller Jean Newman. Each of the three candidates had the endorsement of one of the city's newspapers. The right-wing Toronto Telegram backed Phillips, the centre-right The Globe and Mail backed Newman, and the centre-left Toronto Daily Star backed Lamport. One of the central issues was over the expansion of the Toronto subway system by building the Bloor-Danforth Line. All candidates supported it, but there was debate over how it should be paid for. ;Results :Nathan Phillips - 81,699 :Allan Lamport - 58,254 :Jean Newman - 31,999 :Ross Dowson - 1,643 :Harry Bradley - 1,511 Plebiscite A plebiscite was held on loosening Toronto's blue law to allow cinemas to open on Sundays. ;Sunday movies :For - 81,821 :Against - 45,399 Source: \\"Results of Voting in City and Suburban Elections\\", The Globe and Mail (1936-2016); Toronto, Ont.

Buccal fat pad extraction or buccal fat removal is a plastic surgery procedure for reducing prominent cheeks, by the proportional removal of buccal fat-pad tissue.  History  The buccal fat pad was firstly described by Heister as a glandular tissue in 1732. However, in 1802 Xavier Bichat popularized and defined the structure as fat tissue. It is widely suspected that celebrities like Bella Hadid and other models have had the procedure to obtain the high, contoured and chiseled cheekbones they have. The procedure is also known as cheek fat reduction, buccal fat removal, or bichetomia in Spanish. The American Society of Plastic Surgery does not keep statistics on the procedure.  Surgical procedure  = Cost = Buccal fat removal is considered a cosmetic procedure and is rarely covered by insurance. It is typically performed by plastic surgeons. According to RealSelf, the average cost is $2,400. = Associated Procedures = Buccal fat removal is often performed as a solo procedure but can be done alongside a facelift. It is often also done in combination with chin liposuction and fat grafting. According to Beverly Hills facial plastic surgeon, Sagar Patel MD, the buccal fat processed and reinjected into the face. Dr. Patel performs \\"Sagar Sculpting\\" on patients to use the buccal fat to build the cheek bones. = Technique = The reduction of buccal fat pad is usually performed under local anesthesia with the patient completely awake. The typical approach for removing the buccal fat pad is through an incision in the mouth, towards the back of the oral cavity, near the second upper molar. The buccinator muscle is then encountered and without making an incision, the fibers are separate until the buccal fat is seen. Once the buccal fat is visualized, a thin casing over the fat is opened and the fat in gently teased out while gentle pressure is applied externally. The fat is then cauterized at the base and removed. The remainder of the buccal fat pad then is replaced to its anatomic site and the oral mucosa is sutured close, and the two incisions are sutured. Typically the procedure takes about 30 minutes to complete. = Recovery = Patients typically have swelling for a few days, but often this swelling is not visible externally. Typically, self absorbing sutures that dissolve on their own are used. The final results can take up to 3 months to manifest. = Risks = Injury to the buccal branch of the facial nerve is a risk; the buccal branch nerves that might be affected control facial functions, therefore, such damage might result in partial facial paralysis, regional facial numbness, loss of taste, et cetera. Likewise, damage to the parotid duct also might occur in men and women whose parotid ducts run deep to the buccal fat pad, which can lead to a salivary fistula or buildup of saliva.

Career Charge began his career at Waltham Forest, and was a product of the club's youth system. He made his debut for the club against Boreham Wood in their 6‚Äì1 defeat in January 2006, his only appearance for the club. He progressed through the Dagenham & Redbridge reserve team and earned a two-year contract with the club. In November 2008, Charge joined Hitchin Town on loan. He made his debut for Hitchin Town in the club's 1‚Äì0 home loss to Halesowen Town. Three days later, Charge scored twice in Hitchin's 4‚Äì0 victory against Arlesey Town.

Shortly after his release from Dagenham, Charge signed for Conference National club Grays Athletic. He scored his first professional goal for Grays Athletic in the club's 3‚Äì1 home defeat to Kidderminster Harriers a week after signing for the club.

His trial was unsuccessful, and he returned to Billericay in October 2010, scoring the winner on his return in a 2‚Äì1 win against Horsham. Charge went on to have a spell at Boreham Wood before returning to Isthmian League Division One North club Grays Athletic in January 2011. In February 2012, Charge signed for Isthmian Division One North club AFC Sudbury having been out injured with an ankle injury.

He studied at the Hamburg Art Academy (HfBK) in the 1970s. In 1975, he founded ROSA, one of Germany‚Äôs first gay-themed magazines. During the 1980s, he was a volunteer with the German branch of the children‚Äôs rights organization Terre des Hommes, serving for a time as its chairman. Since 1991, he has been living and making art in the Berlin neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg.  Public Works  Cerro Rico Aktion, Hamburg 1982 In 1982, Nicolaus Schmidt created the Cerro Rico Aktion with 100,000 tin cans. In this work, the artist created an outdoor installation inspired by his interest in Third World affairs. Via public media, people were asked to collect tin cans so that the artist and his team could build a shining silver mountain (‚ÄúCerro Rico‚Äù) to symbolize the Bolivian mountain of the same name.kunstaspekte.de (German) This project called attention to the historical exploitation of South America‚Äôs wealth by European conquerors, and the use of child labor in the region. The Cerro Rico Aktion served as a prototype for many campaigns protesting conditions in the developing world. In 2008, Schmidt and Christoph Radke presented RECONSTRUCCION! (Reconstruction) at the 10th Portes Obertes in El Cabanyal/Valencia, Spain.El Pa√≠s, El Cabanyal se abre al arte, 2008-10-28 With this performance/installation, the artists protested against the demolition of the architecturally and historically significant quarter. Despite their efforts, the area was partly destroyed shortly thereafter so that a new avenue can be built in the future. The conflict is still going on (2012).  Photography and painting projects  Nicolaus Schmidt WELTEN, poster Richard Haizmann Museum - Museum of Modern Art Nieb√ºll Since the end of the 1980s, Schmidt has been working on his ‚ÄúMorphograms,‚Äù anthropomorphic designs derived from the lines of the human body. The works start as drawings and are transformed into paintings and sculptures. Another long-term project is the Kosmographie Gayhane, which Schmidt started in 2004. Gayhane is a successful Berlin nightlife event at the legendary SO36, offering Turkish gays and lesbians a place to meet. Schmidt‚Äôs Kosmographie is both documentary and fiction.

He is known for both his work with Flower Travellin' Band and as a solo musician; singing at a vocal range of three octaves. As an actor, he appeared in many television shows and movies, such as Takashi Miike's Deadly Outlaw: Rekka and the 1989 version of Zatoichi. He is also recognized for 20 years of charity and volunteer work with the Japan International Cooperation Agency and flew around the world helping those in poor or war-torn conditions; visiting more than 30 countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bosnia, numerous sovereign states in Africa, China, Ukraine (including Chernobyl), North Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Brazil. While doing aid work in Jamaica, he met local musicians and later became involved in reggae music. His aid work was a personal inspiration to help those who were growing up in similar conditions that he had experienced as a child. Biography Akira Yamanaka was born in Yokohama, Japan, on September 2, 1946. He grew up in a family of seven children, though the only one of mixed descent as his father was a US Army soldier of Caribbean descent. In his autobiography, he mentions that he never met his biological father and that he came from a poor family in ruined Yokohama; being born in a brothel as his mother was a prostitute for the Recreation and Amusement Association. The only knowledge of his father was that he was a US soldier from either Cuba or Jamaica. Joe grew up in an orphanage after his mother and stepfather died. During an interview with Mainichi Shimbun, Akira stated that he was born with tuberculosis and that he never really thought about his biological father, believing those who raise you are your real parents. He left the orphanage at the age of 16 and became a boxer (inspired by his childhood idol Hiroyuki Ebihara) to earn money, he then met his lifelong friend Rikiya Yasuoka, who was a kickboxer of Japanese-Sicilian heritage. Yamanaka mentions that he adopted the English name Joe because it is the English pronunciation of his favorite painter, Keito Joh; with Joh meaning castle in Japanese. As a teenage boxer, he used the ring name . Joe and Rikiya decided to become actors and starred in the 1964 Japanese film Bicycle Thieves. Yamanaka's career changed once again, though he would continue to act until his death, when he met another lifelong friend, Johnny Yoshinaga, who persuaded him to become a musician. In 1966, he became a member of the group sounds band 4.9.1. Four years later, while in the blues band Mystic Morning with Hideki Ishima, the two of them were scouted by Yuya Uchida for Flower Travellin' Band. They went on to become successful, particularly in Canada where they lived for a while, and are now considered a pioneering and influential Japanese band. In his acting career he was known as one of the three \\"real tough guys\\" in Japanese cinema, along with Tsunehiko Watase and Jerry Fujio. The trio were known for being good-natured, but with a rebellious past and noted fighting prowess. In his autobiography, Akira recounts the times during his youth when he was involved in violent fights. After a large brawl with members of the Zenkyoto in Hibiya Park in which he almost killed a man, the resulting police raid led him to an epiphany that \\"violence leads to nothing.\\" Yamanaka starred as himself in the Hollywood action movie Ulterior Motives featuring Thomas Ian Griffith and Ellen Crawford. Three of Joe's songs were used in the film. After Flower Travellin' Band disbanded in 1973, Joe started a solo career the following year. His most well-known song is , which sold more than half a million copies, and is a household name throughout Asia. It is the theme song and namesake of the 1977 film Proof of the Man, which is based on a novel by Seiichi Morimura about war babies. Joe also has a small acting role in the film as a half Japanese, half African-American who is murdered, which the film is based around. In Chinese speaking countries the song is called \\"Old Straw Hat\\", taken from lyrics in the song. That same year, he was arrested on suspicion of violating the Cannabis Control Law. He was close friends with numerous celebrities including Mickey Curtis and Yoko Ono. Joe recorded the entrance theme for Shinji Takehara titled \\"Hot Vibration\\" and composed the song with his friend Am√°lia Rodrigues. He later became the lead singer of The Wailers for around five years after his friend Bob Marley died. In 2007, Flower Travellin' Band reunited and released an album the following year. They performed several concerts, including internationally in the US and Canada. Death In March 2010, it was announced that Joe was diagnosed with lung cancer, which he learned in February. On September 6, his house was burned down after a lit cigarette was left unattended .

Patrons pay a cover fee, generally hourly, and thus cat caf√©s can be seen as a form of supervised indoor pet rental. \\"Cat caf√©\\" has been officially recognized in the online edition of the Oxford Dictionary of English since August 2015. History The world's first cat caf√©, \\"Cat Flower Garden\\" (Ë≤ìËä±ÂúíNikkei BP : Article on 2 May 2008 ), opened its doors in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998. The Taiwanese cat caf√© eventually became a tourist destination, attracting tourists from Japan as well as all over the globe. Although the origin of cat caf√© is in Taiwan, the concept blossomed in Japan, where the first one named \\"Neko no Jikan\\" (lit. \\"Cat's Time\\") was opened in Osaka in 2004. Due to Japan's land size and population, many residents live in small apartments or condominiums which do not allow pets, making a cat caf√© a very popular destination for young workers looking for the companionship and comfort offered. Tokyo's first cat caf√©, named \\"Neko no mise\\" (Shop of Cats), opened in 2005. After this, the popularity of cat caf√©s boomed in Japan. From 2005 to 2010, seventy-nine cat caf√©s opened across the country.  Asia  =Japan= Nekokaigi, a small cat caf√© in Kyoto. Somali in cat Caf√© in Tokyo Cat caf√©s are quite popular in Japan, with Tokyo being home to 58 cat caf√©s . The first was , by Norimasa Hanada, which opened in 2005. The popularity of cat caf√©s in Japan is attributed to many apartments forbidding pets, and to cats providing relaxing companionship in what may otherwise be a stressful and lonesome urban life. Other forms of pet rental, such as rabbit caf√©s, are also common in Japan.\\"Tokyo's rabbit cafes hopping with customers.\\" The Japan Times. 16 February 2012. Retrieved on 13 July 2013. There are various types of cat caf√©s in Japan. Some feature specific categories of cat such as black cats, fat cats, rare breed cats or ex-stray cats. Every cat caf√© in Japan is required to obtain a license and comply with the strict requirements and regulations of the nation's Animal Treatment and Protection Law.Iwata, Mamiko, All About : Article on 7 March 2010 Japanese cat caf√©s feature strict rules to ensure cleanliness and animal welfare, in particular seeking to ensure that the cats are not disturbed by excessive and unwanted attention, such as by young children or when sleeping. Many cat caf√©s also seek to raise awareness of cat welfare issues, such as abandoned and stray cats and many often have cats from local animal shelters to help them lose any fear of humans and advertise them for possible adoption. From 2012 the cats could be displayed until 8 pm, but in 2016 the guidelines of the environment ministry state that they may visit and play with customers until 10 pm.Cats at Japan's ‚Äòcat cafes‚Äô now allowed to stay up till 10pm 28 April 2016 News.com.au Retrieved 3 May 2016 One caf√© in Tokyo added goats as a way of having a unique element.\\"Tokyo cafe employs goats to add 'wow factor' - video.\\" Reuters at The Guardian. 11 July 2013.

The cat caf√© is known to have ceased operation shortly after the beginning of the First World War, although the much repeated story that the closure was due to its patriotic owner's donating all the cats to a factory making fur-lined boots for the war effort may be apocryphal.

In some cases, this even extends to areas that cats pass through only briefly (e.g. an adopted cat must leave through a separate door without passing an area that prepares food). Gaining regulatory approval can be difficult, as with KitTea of San Francisco. Starting the process in November 2013, KitTea's design was finally approved in August 2014 after extensive negotiation with San Francisco's Health Department. Oakland's Cat Town was the first cat cafe to open its doors to customers, signing a lease in July 2014 and opening just months later in October. These timelines highlight not only the regulatory hurdles for cat cafes that prepare food on premises, but also differences between local governments that are mere miles from one another. In contrast to Japanese cat caf√©s, US cafes typically focus on adoptions. Within seven months of being open, Cat Town reported that \\"the euthanasia rate at its partner shelter has declined from 41 to 21 percent, and 184 cats have made the transition from the cafe's Cat Zone to permanent homes\\". Similarly, The Cat Cafe in San Diego has facilitated adoptions for more than 250 cats (January 2015 - October 2017) and KitTea of San Francisco has adopted 203 (June 2015 - February 2018).

They house 30 adoptable cats and visitors can enjoy coffee, tea and even beer while spending time with the cats. Controversy In the United Kingdom animal charities disagree on whether cat caf√©s are a suitable environment for cats, with the RSPCA, Cats Protection and the Celia Hammond Animal Trust criticizing them for keeping large numbers of cats in a confined space with a revolving population of people. International Cat Care takes a more positive view, saying, \\"It is a difficult environment to get right but it's not impossible by any means\\". However, all the charities agree that cat caf√©s need to be properly regulated.

A guitarist and sitar player for nearly forty years, he now exclusively plays the sitarla, an instrument he invented in 2000 that combines aspects of a sitar with an electric guitar. Guitarists Akira Takasaki, Rolly and Mikael √Ökerfeldt have cited him as an influence. Career Ishima started playing guitar at 19, at the behest of a friend who wanted to be in a band. His first group was in his native Sapporo shortly after graduating high school. He moved to Tokyo and formed the group sounds band The Beavers in 1966, who had released four albums and one single but had not had major success. Ishima began playing sitar at 24, after researching G√°bor Szab√≥ at the suggestion of a woman and learning that the jazz guitarist also played this instrument he had never heard of. He taught himself from Ravi Shankar's 1968 book My Music, My Life, looking up the Japanese translations for the English words. In 1969, while in the blues band Mystic Morning with Joe Yamanaka, the two of them were scouted by Yuya Uchida for Flower Travellin' Band. When they went on hiatus in 1973, Ishima recorded the solo album One Day and joined a group called Trans Am. After a few years off, he followed this with the Donjuan R&R; Band with Kenichi Hagiwara. During the 1980s he was in Co-Colo alongside Kenji Sawada and Nobuhiko Shinohara, before being fired. Ishima quit guitar in 1990, citing money problems. After a 40-minute sitar lesson from Manilal Nag during a trip to Japan in 1998, Ishima became a student of Nag's Japanese apprentice. He made a comeback in 2000 exclusively playing the sitarla. That year, he recorded the album More-ish with the multinational group Pythagoras Party.http://6rbtata.com/view/uGVVdlhn9mE/Pythagoras_Party„ÄúH.Ishima__N.Shinohara__K._Harada.html The improvisational instrumental group View was formed in 2007.

He is regarded as one of the Italian pioneers of climbing as a sport. He died during training in the Valle d'Aosta, Arnad, in the local alpini training place called \\"la gruviera\\" (the holey cheese), he fell apparently being struck by lightning. Ironically, he is also remembered for techniques on the Machaby pillar, in Arnaud, in May 1979. The pillar today is named Lomasti pillar.Arrampicare ad Arnad - Le origini Lomasti PillarLomasti pillar Early life Ernesto Lomasti was born in Udine but spent his early life in Pontebba and Tarvisio, where he attended the local school. During childhood, he contracted pertussis and his parents and uncle used to bring him up on high hills. On 29 June 1973, he left middle school and passed the exam, earning his father a climb on the J√¥f di Montasio, Montasio along with a local mountain guide. Following an accident at age three, he severely damaged his hearing in his right ear. This disability would severely impair his climbing career because of having difficulties hearing climbing instructions. The problem was solved on 29 August 1977 when he decided to undergo surgery. He served under the Alpini corps attending the SMALP (alpini military school) until his sudden death.

He has also played in MLB for the Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks. Avila is the son of Tigers general manager Al Avila. Avila was the Tigers' starting catcher for the team's four straight American League Central Division titles, which included catching Cy Young Award seasons for starting pitchers Justin Verlander in 2011 and Max Scherzer in 2013. Nicknamed \\"The Titanium Catcher\\" for the perception among many baseball fans that he was unusually likely to be hit by foul tips, Avila has a history of concussions and concussion-like symptoms. He spent time on the disabled list for a concussion in 2013 and missed games on at least two occasions in 2014 for concussion-like symptoms after taking blows to the head. His most recent reported concussion occurred in the clinching Game 3 of the 2014 American League Division Series when a tipped foul ball hit him in the mask, knocking him out of the game and ending his season three innings early. Early baseball career Avila played prep baseball at Archbishop McCarthy High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 34th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, but chose to attend the University of Alabama where he was an All-SEC selection. In 2007, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Following his junior year in which he hit .343 with 17 home runs and 62 runs batted in (RBIs), he was then drafted by the Tigers in the fifth round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. Career =Detroit Tigers= 2009 On August 6, 2009, Avila made his major league debut for the Tigers against the Baltimore Orioles where he had two hits, scoring a run and also batting one in. He started the following night, August 7, and in his first at bat of the game hit his first career home run off Anthony Swarzak. He finished the 2009 season playing in just 29 games, with a .279 batting average, 5 home runs, and 14 runs batted in. 2010 Avila in 2010 Avila made the Tigers 2010 Opening Day roster and shared playing time with starting catcher Gerald Laird. Baseball America ranked Avila as the sixth best prospect in the Detroit Tigers organization entering the 2010 season. Avila was the catcher for Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2, 2010. In part-time duty, he finished the season with a .228 average and 7 home runs in 294 at-bats, while throwing out 32% of potential base-stealers. 2011 Avila was named the Tigers starting catcher for the 2011 season, and showed considerable improvement. On July 3, 2011, he was voted to the All- Star team as the starting catcher for the American League, beating out New York Yankees catcher Russell Martin who had led through the majority of the voting. Alex also caught Justin Verlander's no hitter on May 7, 2011 against the Toronto Blue Jays. His season stats included a .295 batting average with 19 home runs and 82 runs batted in. Avila won the 2011 Silver Slugger Award for the American League at catcher, making him the 10th Detroit Tigers catcher to win the award and first since Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez in 2004.Avila claims first Silver Slugger Award MLB.com November 2, 2011 2012 Avila followed his career best 2011 season with one marked by inconsistency, particularly at the plate. Nagging injuries undercut his offensive performance while catching the fourth most games in the American League. His offensive numbers dropped across the board, as he finished with a .243 batting average, 9 home runs and 48 RBI. Avila was first in the American League in runners caught stealing, but also led the AL in passed balls. 2013 Avila had a horrible first half at the plate in 2013 and spent some time on the disabled list in June. Through the end of June, Avila was batting just .172. He fared much better in the second half, hitting .281 over the season's final three months, including batting .343 in September (23-for-67). Avila hit the first grand slam of his career on July 30, 2013, against Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg. In an August 5 game against the Cleveland Indians, a team the Tigers battled for first place in the AL Central all year, Alex clubbed a game-winning three-run homer in the top of the ninth inning off Indians closer Chris Perez.GIF: Alex Avila's game-winning three run home run off Chris Perez Rogacki, Rob at blessyouboys.com on August 5, 2013.

His hitting struggles continued into the 2014 season, as he batted a career-low .218 while matching his 2013 totals of 11 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also struck out a career-high 151 times. Defensively, the season was a success, as Alex was a finalist for the 2014 Gold Glove Award at catcher. Avila allowed only 3 passed balls in 122 games at catcher, versus 9 and 10 the previous two seasons, and he threw out potential base stealers at a 34% rate, the highest of his career. On November 17, 2014, the Tigers exercised the $5.4 million contract option on Avila for the 2015 season. 2015 The 2015 season was not kind to Avila, as he struggled mightily at the bat (.191, 4 home runs, 13 RBI) and lost his starting catcher position to James McCann. He suffered a knee injury that robbed him of some time as well. At the conclusion of the 2015 season Avila became a free agent, having reached 6 years of service time.

(Biblioth√®que Nationale de Paris) Polyphemus Surprising Acis and Galatea, by sculptor Auguste Ottin, was added to the fountain in 1866. The Fontaine de L√©da, (1806-1809), originally at rue Vaugirard and rue du Regard, since 1858 hidden behind the Medici Fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg. Louis-Simon Bralle, architect, Achille Valois, sculptor. The Medici Fountain () is a monumental fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement in Paris. It was built in about 1630 by Marie de' Medici, the widow of King Henry IV of France and regent of King Louis XIII of France. It was moved to its present location and extensively rebuilt in 1864-66. Italian influence in Paris in the 17th century  The period between the regency of Catherine de' Medici in France (1559‚Äì1589) and that of Marie de' Medici (1610‚Äì1642) saw a great flourishing of the Italian mannerist style in France, A community of artists from Florence, including the sculptor Francesco Bordoni, who helped design the statue of King Henry IV of France built on the Pont Neuf, and fountain technician Thomas Francini, who had worked on fountains in the new gardens of the Medici villas in Florence and Rome, found eager royal patrons in France. Soon features of the Italian Renaissance garden, such as elaborate fountains and the grotto, a simulated cave decorated with sculpture, appeared in the first Gardens of the French Renaissance at Fontainebleau and other royal residences.Luigi Gallo, La pr√©sence italianne au 17e si√®cle, in Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance √† nos jours, Collection Paris et son patrimoine, Delegation a l'action artistique de la Ville de Paris.  Construction  Marie de' Medici, as widow of Henry IV and mother and regent of King Louis XIII of France, began construction of her own palace, which she called the Palais des Medicis, between 1623 and 1630, on the left bank of Paris. The new palace was modeled after the Palazzo Pitti in her native Florence, and the gardens around the palace were modeled after those of the Boboli Gardens in Florence. The Palace was the work of architect Salomon de Brosse, but the fountain and grotto was most probably the work of Tommaso Francini, the Intendant General of Waters and Fountains of the King.See Yves Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, L'art des jardins en Europe, and Luigi Gallo in Paris et ses Fontaines, both of which attribute the fountain to Francini. De Brosse is sometimes credited with designing the fountain, but he died in the same year the fountain was built, and before his death he was involved in a lawsuit with Marie de' Medici over non-payment of his fee; court documents detailed all the work he had done for the Queen, and there was no mention of the fountain. See Luigi Gallo, pg. 56. Francini, who emigrated to France at the invitation of Henry IV in 1598 and was naturalized in 1600, had built grottos and fountains in the Italian style for the marquis de Gondi and for the royal chateau of Henry IV at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The first difficulty of construction was the lack of water in the Left Bank of Paris. Unlike the Right Bank, where the water table was near the surface, and there were many wells and two aqueducts which served the city, the water table on the Left Bank was deep underground and all water had to be carried from the Seine. As a result, the city had expanded far from the Right Bank of the Seine, but had hardly grown at all on the Left Bank. This problem was finally solved by the construction of the aqueduct of Arcueil, between 1613-1623.For a description of the water shortage on the Left Bank, see Philippe Cebron de Lisle, Paris en qu√™te d'eau, in Paris et ses Fontaines  19th Century modifications  After the death of Marie de' Medici, the Palace and fountain went through a series of owners. By the middle of the 18th century, when the fountains of Versailles and the Garden √† la fran√ßaise were in fashion, the Medici Fountain fell into disrepair. The two original statues at the top of the fountain, by the sculptor Pierre Biard, two nymphs pouring water from pitchers, had disappeared, and the wall of the Orangerie, against which the fountain was placed, was crumbling. In 1811, at the instructions of Napoleon Bonaparte, the grotto was restored by the neoclassical architect Jean Chalgrin, the architect of the Arc de Triomphe, who replaced the simple water fountain in the niche of the grotto with two streams of water, and added a white marble statue representing Venus in her bath.A. Duval, Fontaine Medicis, Les fontaines de Paris, 1813. In 1864, during the Second French Empire, Baron Haussmann planned to build the rue de Medicis through the space occupied by the fountain. The lateral arcades of the fountain and the crumbling old orangerie behind it had already been torn down in 1855. From 1858 to 1864, The new architect, Alphonse de Gisors, moved the fountain thirty meters to make room for the street, and radically changed its setting and appearance. Since the fountain no longer stood against a wall, the Fontaine de L√©da, displaced from another neighborhood, was placed directly behind it. (See the Fountain of Leda, below.) He replaced the two original statues of nymphs at the top of the statue with two new statues, representing the Rivers Rhone and Seine. He restored the coat of arms of the Medici family over the fountain, which had been defaced during the Revolution. He inserted two statues into the niches, one representing a faun and the other a huntress, above which are two masks, one representing comedy and the other tragedy. He removed the simple basin and water spout which had been in the niche and replaced them with a long tree- shaded basin. Finally, he removed the statue of Venus and replaced her with a group of statues by Auguste Ottin, representing the giant Polyphemus, in bronze, discovering the lovers Acis and Galatea, in white marble. That is the fountain as it appears today.Luigi Gallo, pg. 57  The Hidden Fountain - the Fountain of L√©da  The fountain which Gisors placed behind the Medici Fountain had a history of its own. The Fontaine de L√©da had been constructed in 1806-1809, during the First Empire, at the corner of rue Vaugirard and rue du Regard. It was the work of architect Fran√ßois-Jean Bralle and sculptor Achille Valois. The bas-relief of the fountain depicts the story of Leda and the Swan; Leda holds the swan on her knees, and the figure of Amor is shooting an arrow at her from the corner of the sculpture. Water flowed from the beak of the swan down to a hemispherical basin at the foot of the fountain. In 1856, when Baron Haussmann wanted to extend the rue de Rennes, the chief of the service of Promenades and Plantations of Paris, Gabriel Davioud, who designed most of the city's fountains, benches, gates and other urban architectural decorations during the Second Empire, and who was himself a sculptor, wanted to preserve the fountain, and in 1858 he had it moved to the Jardin du Luxembourg. Since it was a wall fountain, it had to be attached to something, so he placed it on the back of the Medici Fountain, where it still remains, unnoticed by passers-by.See Katia Frey, L'enterprise napol√©onienne, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 115.

He and his wife, Mary, requested membership in the nearby Pelham Quaker meeting in November 1803 and were accepted in March 1804. However, the War of 1812 prompted them to return to the United States. Obadiah and family, including sons Robert and James, left Canada during the height of the War of 1812 and sought to settle near his brother, Jonathan Griffin, in the present-day town of Orchard Park. Obadiah and Mary‚Äôs Quaker membership was transferred to the local meeting by a certificate dated January 18, 1813.\\"The Griffins of Orchard Park and Griffins Mills\\", Sue Kulp, Orchard Park Historian, 6/16/2012 Saw mill and grist mill as viewed from Mill Road Upon their return to New York, Obadiah and his sons purchased the mill, ultimately giving their surname to the location: Griffins Mills. They successfully operated a saw mill, grist mill, carding mill, distillery and four asheries which produced potash and lye for soap making. Multiple flumes carried the water to various operations. Obadiah's wife died sometime prior to 1822, and in 1829 the mills were sold to Henry N. Hill. By 1831, the Griffins divested themselves of their properties and moved west to Niles, Michigan. The mills then passed from Henry Hill to Joseph Jones & Israel Smith (1833), Henry P. Darrow (1841), William H. Wing (1853), Ridley Cole (1854), William Deuel (1860), Jabez Snashell (1868), and were then acquired by Ferdinand Wanneke (1884), who came from Germany. He operated the business until 1903 when he sold to his nephews, Theodore and Frank Yaw.Title Search Abstract No. 338993A, dated September 6, 2006 Yaw Bros. Flour, Feed & Grain Mill The Yaw Brothers, known throughout western New York, operated the business for 56 years and were known for their accurate measurements in lumber sawing. Buckwheat flour was a specialty ground by the brothers. It was the only mill over a large area doing this type of grinding. The flour, eagerly bought for its excellent quality, was packaged in 5-, 10-, and 25-pound sacks labeled with the Yaw Brothers trademark.East Aurora Advertiser, July 13, 1961 Both grist and sawmills were water powered until in 1919 when a \\"freak flood\\" washed away the dam and motors were installed to replace the large waterwheel. The remodeled, original gristmill, then 137 years old, was destroyed by fire May 9, 1947. The sawmill was remodeled and utilized as a feed mill and the business continued until April 1, 1959, when it was permanently closed. Theodore C. Yaw died March 20, 1959 and Frank H. Yaw, December 6, 1960. The mill structure in 1961 was donated to St. Paul's Lutheran Church on West Falls Road and subsequently moved there for use as a Sunday school building.East Aurora Advertiser, January 25, 1962 =Churches= Griffins Mills Presbyterian Church in 1908 with horse stalls and schoolhouse in back On August 18, 1810, the West Aurora Congregational Church was formed with nine members under the influence of \\"Father\\" John Spencer, a wandering evangelist. Reverend Elias Harmon was the first pastor and the nine charter members were Benjamin Enos, Laurinda Enos, Seth McKay, Clement King, Mary King, Samuel Henshaw, Betsy Henshaw, Joshua Henshaw, and Elizabeth Henshaw. It became incorporated January 26, 1831 and the current Federalist style church building was dedicated on August 17, 1832. A large solid cast bronze bell for the steeple was purchased for \\"no more than $250\\" in 1844. In January 1848, land was purchased adjacent to the church to build a Session Room and horse shed. Ties to the Presbyterian Church began as early as 1830, when Deacon Conklin was appointed as a delegate to the Buffalo Presbytery. On May 5, 1907, the church was re-incorporated as Griffins Mills Presbyterian Church and is still very active today.150 Years in Aurora, 1818-1968, Aurora Historical Society, published 1968 St. Paul's Lutheran Church was founded in 1874, with services held in private homes. Pastor Plenz served in conjunction with his work at Martin Luther Seminary in Buffalo until 1910. The church was incorporated January 27, 1892 and is still very active. Other records of past churches include a Methodist Episcopal church that was formed in 1850. About 1868 a Baptist church was organized, but it disbanded. From 1893 to 1944, a Mennonite Meeting house was located across from the Presbyterian Church. This congregation had a close connection with the Mennonite Reformed congregation of Williamsville, which bought the building and liquidated the operation in 1944.\\"Griffins Mills: Architectural Repository\\", Wilber H. Glover, Vol. 17 Issue 2 Summer 1979, Niagara Frontier, published by Buffalo & Erie County Historical Society =Other businesses= In 1813, Robert Griffin (one of the sons of Obadiah) opened a tavern in what is referred to as the Luther House (Conklin-Dyer 1825 Mill Road). The Griffin's distillery converted grains into spirited drinks and by 1820, the use of liquor was universal. A drink of milk punch or a whiskey sling was greatly appreciated in the heavily forested area where malarial fever was the common disease. At about this time, Adam Paul opened a store (Preston's ‚Äì 1848 Mill Rd) and was in business for nearly 30 years. Robert Griffin opened a brick tavern before 1822, which for a time was the scene for joyful socializing in the isolated frontier community. The mail route was established through Griffins Mills in 1814 and stopovers were made at Griffin's Tavern. The tavern was torn down in 1848 to put up the Session Meeting Room for the West Aurora Congregational Church. There were at least two tanneries in Griffins Mills. They were located near water where hemlock bark was placed in large vats to make tannic acid. Skins of animals were placed in the acid so that hair would be removed and the skin be made more pliable for leather. A pungent odor prevailed around the area where a tannery was located. The first tannery was located on the south side of Mill Road, between Grover and West Falls Road in the center of a field. It was operated by Ledyard Phelps in 1828, the son of Judge Isaac Phelps. The driveway at 1644 Mill Road was the original tannery road, leading to the tannery mill in the field. This road connected to Olden Road and ran west to Tannery Road where Ledyard Phelp's uncle, Aaron Rumsey and sons, Dexter and Bronson, established a tannery in 1843. This tannery continued until the Civil War years when most hemlock bark was depleted. Benjamin Enos operated a tannery and bark mill on Luther Road on the west branch of Cazenovia Creek, between Snyder and Grover Roads after 1822. The settlers were farmers, engaged in growing large amounts of cattle and swine in order to pay off their debts to the Holland Land Company. The tanneries were numerous throughout the township, since leather was used to make shoes and boots, harness, and hinges for doors. Much leather was also shipped to Montreal and other eastern markets. The Rumsey's manufactured over 300,000 hides each year in their vats. =Schoolhouse= Schoolhouse behind Griffins Mills ChurchSide view of Schoolhouse There was a schoolhouse, School #5, behind the West Aurora Congregational Church which would have been on the original road that crossed the creek. The schoolhouse was built in the 1820s and was in operation until 1964 when students were transferred to the newly dedicated West Falls Elementary School which consolidated a few schoolhouses in the area as part of the East Aurora School District. The West Falls Elementary School on West Falls Road is now the Aurora Waldorf School. The original schoolhouse was sold to the Church for $500 on April 6, 1965 and subsequently demolished in June 1966.Recollections of resident Terry Sprague =Griffins Mills Cemetery= Griffins Mills Cemetery In March 1834, the West Aurora Cemetery Society was organized with Henry L. Baker as clerk. The land was presented as a gift by Colonel Orange Train Brown. The site was an old peach orchard located on West Falls Road just south of Mill Road, now adjacent to St. Paul's Lutheran Church. Prior to this cemetery, many bodies were buried in the West Aurora Graveyard Cemetery which was established before April 5, 1829 and located in a low point near where the road forded the creek. They were subsequently moved to this new plot. Among them were five soldiers of the Revolutionary War: Thomas Treat (1758-1832), Henry Little (1758-1840), Ebenezer Patterson (1760-1844), Jebediah Darbee (1757-1828), and Clement King (1756-1828). In addition to the veterans of the Revolutionary War, there are also many veterans of the War of 1812 and the Civil War buried in Griffins Mills Cemetery. The names of most of those buried there have been registered with the Aurora Historical Society by Craig Eckert. =Underground Railroad= There was strong anti-slavery sentiment in the Griffins Mills area. Besides the influence of the Quakers in Orchard Park, the West Aurora Congregational Church issued Anti-Slavery Resolutions at the monthly meeting on November 13, 1846. On December 15, 1848, the Church directed an Overture be sent to the district Presbytery to adopt the Resolutions. There is no written record of the numbers that passed through the village to freedom, but Cazenovia Creek provided a discreet passage into Buffalo and local knowledge describes at least one tunnel from a house to the creek near the mill that was filled in during road construction in the early 1970s. In addition there is evidence of a \\"secret room\\" at a local residence. =The bridge across Cazenovia Creek= Building of wooden bridge over Cazenovia Creek Mill Road covered bridge Prior to 1867, Mill Road coming west from East Aurora traveled down into Griffins Mills and turned right between the Luther House and the West Aurora Congregational Church and headed to a point at Cazenovia Creek where one could ford to the other side. Once across, it is a steep, but gradual climb up to the top where the trail intersected with Luther Road and continued to Davis Road (Route 240) on what is now Short Road. This arduous crossing of the creek was eliminated with the construction of a covered wooden bridge at the point where the road continued past the mill. The wooden bridge was replaced in 1924 by a 600-ton steel span.

She was known for voluntarily donating her ornaments to Gandhi when the latter visited Vatakara in 14 January 1934 which was acknowledged by Gandhi when he wrote an article \\"Kaumudi's renunciation\\" in Young India. Kaumudi Teacher died on 4 August 2009 at Kadachira in Kannur.  Early life  Kaumudi Teacher, an ardent Gandhian whose voluntary act of renunciation of her gold ornaments to Mahatma Gandhi in the year 1934, for the cause of freedom struggle elevated her to an inspirational figure in the freedom movement. Kaumudi was born in a royal family to A K Ramavarma Raja and Devaki Kettilamma on May 17, 1917 at Vatakara in Kannur. She later began to take interest in the India freedom struggle and pledged to not wear ornaments after her act of renunciation for the cause of Harijans in 1934.  Career  After matriculation, she studied Hindi and got appointed as the first Hindi teacher in Malabar, at the Government Girls High School. A disciple of Vinobha Bhave, she had also been associated with the Bhoodhan Movement. She retired from service in 1972 and worked in the ashram of Vinobha Bhave in Thiruvananthapuram. She was also a frequent visitor to Sewagram and Paunar ashrams. She later devoted herself to propagation of khadi and teaching Hindi and decided not to wear ornaments. Kaumudi Teacher‚Äôs heroic sacrifice has been included in text books as well. She remained unmarried and has been honoured by various Gandhian organizations.  Kaumudi's renunciation  Gandhi had been on a visit to Vatakara on January 14, 1934, in connection with the fund raising for the Harijan Sahaya Samithi. Answering Gandhi‚Äôs appeal for donation, Kaumudi Teacher gave her gold ornaments to him for the larger cause of the Indian freedom movement. She was only 17 years of age at the time. Her sacrifice was acknowledged by Gandhi in his article titled, ‚ÄòKaumudi‚Äôs Renunciation,' which was published in 'Young India.' This text was later translated to all Indian languages and made part of school syllabus. In his article, Gandhi mentions gives an account of the events that had transpired on the day the renunciation was made. After Gandhi finished giving his speech at Badagara, he had made a reasoned appeal to the women present for jewellery to be donated for raising funds for the Harijan Sahaya Nidhi. Following the speech, Kaumudi took out one bangle and asked Gandhi if he would give his autograph. He was preparing to give it, when off came the other bangle, she had only one on each hand. Upon seeing this, Gandhi said, ‚ÄúYou need not give me both, I shall give you the autograph for one bangle only.‚Äù She replied by taking off her golden necklace, even as she struggled to disengage it from her long plait of hair, in which the necklace was entangled. She did so, in the presence of a large gathering of both men and women. Upon being asked by Gandhi, on whether she had had the permission of her parents to donate the jewellery, she gave no answer and went ahead in also donating her earring. Gandhi later claims to have found out that her father too was as generous as her, in fact he too was a part of the meeting and was even helping in bidding for the addresses that Gandhi was auctioning. Gandhi then scribbled in an autograph for her, Tumhara tyag tumhara bhushan hoga. As he handed her the autograph, he prefaced it with the remark, ‚ÄúYour renunciation is a truer ornament than the jewellery you have discarded.\\"  Death and legacy  Kaumudi Teacher died 4 August 2009 in Kannur at the age of 92, due to her failing health. She died a spinster at her brother‚Äôs residence at Kadachira, after struggling with age-related health problems. On the day of cremation, many a people gathered to pay their respects to her. A contingent of police personnel also offered a gun salute before the body of the 92-year-old Gandhian was taken for cremation. The ceremony observed, the Additional District Magistrate Sudheer Babu also placing a wreath on behalf of Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan.

Under the patronage of William IV, Duke of Aquitaine, the assembly of clergy founded the Pax Dei, or Peace of God. This agreement granted immunity from violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves, beginning with the peasants and the clergy.

In the early eleventh century, the Count of Poitou asked the monks of Saint-Sernin in Poitou to rebuilt the church and institute reforms for the monks. The abbey church was rebuilt in the 11th century, and was \\"one of the most distinguished houses in Southern France.Jenkins, E., The Mediterranean World of Alfonso II and Peter II of Aragon (1162‚Äì1213), Springer, 2012, , p. 161 The new church was dedicated in 1096 by Pope Urban II. Following the death of Richard the Lionheart, King of England and Duke of Aquitaine, in April 1199, the king's brain was buried at Charroux Abbey.Weir, Alison, \\"Eleanor of Aquitaine\\", Pimlico, London, 2000, p.350 The abbey was burned in 1422, during the Hundred Years War, and was plundered three times during the Wars of Religion, in 1562, 1569 and 1587. In 1762 the abbey was abandoned. Following the French Revolution, the buildings, already in ruins, were sold for the national good in 1790. It was sold in five sections, and the buildings partly demolished to form a racecourse. However, the owner of the Charlemagne Tower resisted pressure to demolish the structure. Charles de Cherge and Prosper M√©rim√©e intervened to save the remains of the monument, and the sculptures on the gate were purchased by the French state. The remains were classified as monuments historique in 1945 and 1950. Today, the remains are in the care of the Centre des monuments nationaux, and are open to the public. Architecture =Abbey church= The only remaining structure of the church is the 11th-century lantern tower, known as the Charlemagne Tower. It formed the central rotunda of the abbey. Overall, the church was long, although the site of the nave was built over in the 19th century. =Monastic buildings= Some of the monastic buildings survive, to the south of the abbey church. The chapter house was an extension of the south transept, and was built in the 13th century. In the 15th century by the abbot Jean Chaperon, including a flamboyant Gothic doorway which connected with the church. Three Gothic gateways were built in front of the Romanesque church facade in the 13th century. 27 sculptures of kings and abbots, and several parts of the gates, were preserved following the demolition of the church, and they represent the height of Gothic sculpture in the Poitou region. The sculptures are displayed in the chapter house.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and it incorporates a section of the Chester Rows. History Cowper House was built in 1664, following the destruction of many buildings in Chester during the Civil War. It was built above undercrofts dating from 1350‚Äì75, or possibly earlier. Alterations have been made to the building in the 19th and 20th centuries. Thomas Cowper had been mayor of Chester in 1641‚Äì42 and a Royalist supporter in the Civil War. The rear undercroft was excavated in 1839, and it is thought that the front undercroft is older than that in the rear. Architecture Detail of Cowper House showing the inscription =Exterior= The house is constructed in sandstone, brick, and timber framing with plaster panels. The roof is of grey slate. It has four storeys and a gable overlooking the street. The street level consists of a modern shop front on the right of which is a flight of 11 stone steps leading to the Row level above. At the Row level is another modern shop front. Between this and the street is a walkway, a sloping stallboard and a rail with balusters overlooking the street. Above the Row opening is a carved fascia. In the storey above is a window running almost the whole width of the building. Its frame projects from the wall and is carried on eight corbels. The window has 14 lights, is mullioned and transomed, and contains leaded lights. Below and on each side of the window are timber-framed panels. The top storey is jettied. At its base is a bressummer carved centrally with \\"‚Ä¢T‚Ä¢C‚Ä¢1664\\" (the initials are those of Thomas Cowper), on each side of which are carved patterns. The top storey has a ten-light mullioned and transomed casement window containing leaded lights. Below the window are eight panels containing wooden carvings, and two similar panels are on each side of the window. Above the window are quadrant-braced panels. The bargeboard is decorated with carvings and at its peak is a finial. =Interior= Two steps lead down from the street to the front undercroft which is 16m long. At its rear, six steps lead down to the rear undercroft which is 13m long. This undercroft has six bays and is rib vaulted. At the far end is a three-light window. On the left side in the fifth bay is a stone stairway. In the third storey is a sandstone fireplace with a beam inscribed \\"TC 1661\\" on each side of a blank shield.

Described in 1871 by Henry Woodward, he correctly identified it as an arachnid and renamed it Eophrynus prestvicii ‚Äì whereby the genus name comes from (', meaning 'dawn'), and Phrynus, a genus of living whip spider (Amblypygi). Description Eophrynus prestvicii can reach a length of about . These arachnids were similar to modern spiders, but they could not produce silk. Recent x-ray imaging revealed that Eophrynus prestvicii were covered by protective spikes on the back-half of its body. This creature had long legs enabling it to run and hunt on the forest floor. Scientists at Imperial College London created a detailed 3D computer model of the arachnid from fossils.Science Daily Distribution This species is known from a handful of good quality fossils preserved inside siderite concretions. Fossils of this species have been found in the Carboniferous sediments of United Kingdom. References * Jason A. Dunlop and Russell J.

The first article appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News on June 22, 1997, with the headline \\"Hope & Heroes\\". Michael Weiner, MD, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Oncology at CUMC, adopted the name as part of his efforts to attract funding for programs that needed philanthropic support. Fundraising The charity raises approximately $3.5 million per year to support the Division's prestigious clinical care, research and supporting programs. The full-time staff currently consists of an executive director, a senior director of development, and an events and outreach manager. The funds are raised through a multitude of events, annual giving and multi-year gift agreements with major donors. Events include a golf tournament, a gala dinner, a walk and a luncheon, along with community and family run functions throughout the tri-state area. Services The Herbert Irving Child & Adolescent Oncology Center has three pillars of care for children with cancer‚ÄîLeukemia/Lymphoma, Solid tumors and Neurooncology (Brain Tumors). Each of these three endeavors consists of a basic science research component and a clinical component. The clinical component is further divided into two areas: clinical investigation and patient care. This overall structure of laboratory investigation linked with a clinical enterprise has been established in order to translate the laboratory findings into improved treatments for children with cancer. The research component of the Leukemia/Lymphoma program consists of the laboratory of Dr. Adolfo Ferrando and his colleagues Drs. Maria Luisa Sulis and Teresa Palomero. In January 2005, the recruitment of Dr. Ferrando from Harvard University and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute was made possible, in part, by prior commitments of the Wipe Out Leukemia Forever Foundation and a grateful patient family. The Leukemia/Lymphoma program currently has a highly developed and successful laboratory component and currently performs clinical research through our membership in the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Consortium and the Children's Oncology Group. Solid Tumors are investigated in the Tay-bandz research laboratory under the direction of Dr. Darrell Yamashiro. Clinically, the novel initiatives discovered in Dr. Yamashiro's laboratory have allowed the establishment of the Pediatric Cancer Foundation Developmental Therapeutics program, under the direction of Dr. Julia Glade-Bender. An example of this bench-to-bedside initiative has been the laboratory's work in anti- angiogenesis and a national study using treatment with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, Avastin. The Pediatric Cancer Foundation Research gift has allowed the hiring of a research nurse practitioner and an administrative coordinator to assist Dr. Bender. With respect to Neuro- Oncology (Brain Tumors), the basic laboratory research is being conducted by Drs. Antonio Iavarrone, Anna Lasorella, and Saadi Ghatan. The clinical portion of the brain tumor enterprise, the Alfano Family Foundation Neuro-oncology program, is led by Dr. James Garvin. Working with Dr. Garvin is a full-time clinical research nurse and an administrative coordinator/assistant. Together as a team, they are conducting clinical research and providing patient care. =Four Supporting Programs= The Herbert Irving Child & Adolescent Oncology Center has four overarching clinic-wide programs that support its three pillars of care. They are Integrative Therapies, Psycho-Social/Child Life, Developmental Therapeutics and the Center for Survivor Wellness Each program combines a clinical care component with research. The Integrative Therapies Program for Children with Cancer was the first program of its kind to mainstream complementary medicine into a conventional program of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The mission is to disseminate reputable information on complementary therapies; to lessen the side effects of conventional treatments; to perform clinical research; and to evaluate the safety and potential interactions of complementary therapies with conventional treatments for childhood cancer. Services provided at no cost to patients include acupressure, acupuncture, aromatherapy, chef program, massage therapy, Reiki, nutritional and herbal counseling and yoga instruction. This program is 100% supported by philanthropic donations. The Valerie Fund Psychosocial Program includes a child psychologist, child-life specialists, social workers, and clergy. This is the only program in New York City that receives support from the New Jersey-based Valerie Fund. The team provides counseling, therapeutic play, pet therapy, music therapy, pastoral care, and the \\"Big Apple Circus Clown\\" program. Individual and age-appropriate group therapy is available to patients, families, and siblings. Child life therapists use play, art projects and other activities to help children learn about and gain skills for coping with upcoming procedures and to work through any fears that may arise. Developmental Therapeutics is a new initiative made possible by a gift by the Pediatric Cancer Foundation. It includes basic research to define novel therapeutic targets, translational research to adapt observations from the laboratory to patients and clinical research to examine the behavior of novel therapeutics. Drs. Julia Glade Bender, Darrell Yamashiro and Alice Lee will collaborate to research new agents and bring them to clinical trial. The Center for Survivor Wellness is a newly created program made possible by funding from the Joseph LeRoy and Ann C. Warner Fund, Inc. The program is a joint clinical collaboration between pediatric and medical oncology. Its goal is to diminish the long-term effects of cancer treatment, including second malignancies, and to introduce healthy lifestyle changes to patients who have survived cancer. The program is led by Jennifer Levine, MD and staffed by a collaborative roster of current Columbia University pediatric and medical oncology physicians as well as a nurse practitioner and a clinical coordinator.

Today, hundreds of cheap derivatives are available from tens of manufacturers. This makes the architecture very interesting for professionals and hobbyists. It is surprising that this 8-bit architecture is still in use today, and is still so popular. Of all 8051 compilers, several widely used C compilers exist, but only a few Pascal compilers. Turbo51 is available as freeware and was created with the goal to make a Pascal compiler for MCS-51 processors that will be as fast as Turbo Pascal, will use the same syntax and will generate high quality optimized code.
