Adjacent stations History The private Kyushu Railway had, by 1909, through acquisition and its own expansion, established a track from to . The Kyushu Railway was nationalised on 1 July 1907. Japanese Government Railways (JGR), designated the track as the H≈çsh≈´ Main Line on 12 October 1909 and expanded it southwards in phases, with Saiki opening as the new southern terminus on 25 October 1916. It became a through-station on 20 November 1920 when the track was extended further south to G≈çnohara (today ). On 15 December 1923, the H≈çsh≈´ Main Line was renamed the Nipp≈ç Main Line. On 15 January 1962, the reading of the station name was changed from \\"Saeki\\" to \\"Saiki\\" with no change to the kanji characters. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR Kyushu. On 17 September 2017, Typhoon Talim (Typhoon 18) damaged the Nipp≈ç Main Line at several locations. Services between and Saiki were suspended. Rail services were restored on 18 December 2017. However JR Kyushu reported that recovery work was difficult at the site of the Tok≈´ra Signal Box between Usuki and which had been covered by a landslide. Of the two tracks there, only one would be restored. According to JR Kyushu, having only a single track there (effectively closing down the signal box) would not have a large impact on its timetables and believed that it amounted to a full restoration of service. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 805 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 191st among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

In 1976, 37 different singles topped the chart, which at the time was published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine. Chart placings were based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. At the start of the year the song at the top of the chart was \\"Convoy\\" by C. W. McCall, its third week at number one. The song remained in the top spot until the issue of Billboard dated January 31, 1976, when it was replaced by \\"This Time I've Hurt Her More than She Loves Me\\" by Conway Twitty. \\"Convoy\\" also topped the magazine's all-genres singles chart, the Hot 100. It was one of three 1976 country number ones to capitalize on the prevailing fad for citizens band radio (CB), along with \\"The White Knight\\" by Cledus Maggard & the Citizen's Band and \\"Teddy Bear\\" by Red Sovine. CB also featured, to a lesser extent, in the song \\"One Piece at a Time\\", which was the final chart- topper for Country Music Hall of Famer and icon of the genre Johnny Cash. C. W. McCall's total of four weeks at number one in 1976 was matched by Willie Nelson, who spent one week in the top spot with \\"If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time\\" and three with \\"Good Hearted Woman\\" in collaboration with Waylon Jennings, as well as by Tammy Wynette, who spent three weeks at number one with two solo singles and a further week at the top with \\"Golden Ring\\", a duet with her former husband George Jones. The couple had divorced the previous year, but nonetheless continued to record together. As well as Jennings, Conway Twitty, Marty Robbins and Red Sovine each spent three weeks at number one. Twitty was the only act to take three different singles to number one in 1976. Acts to top the chart for the first time in 1976 included novelty artist Cledus Maggard, who reached the number one position with his first ever Hot Country chart entry. He would go on to enter the listing with three more singles but his chart career ended in 1978, after which Maggard (real name Jay Huguely) would concentrate on the field of television production. Two female singers gained their first number ones via duets with established male vocalists: Mary Lou Turner with Bill Anderson and Helen Cornelius with Jim Ed Brown. Vocal group Dave & Sugar topped the chart for the first time with \\"The Door Is Always Open\\", the third version of the song to chart in less than three years, but by far the most successful.

In 1975, 43 different singles topped the chart, at the time published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine. Chart placings were based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. Merle Haggard had the most number ones in 1975, taking four different singles to the top spot. The four singles spent a total of five weeks at number one, tying Haggard with Freddy Fender for the highest number of weeks spent atop the chart by a single artist in 1975. When Fender reached number one with \\"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\\" in the issue of Billboard dated March 15, he achieved the feat of topping the Hot Country chart with his very first hit. The Tex-Mex-influenced song went on to be a crossover success, topping Billboards all-genre singles chart, the Hot 100, in May. Five other singles released in 1975 reached number one on both charts: \\"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\\" by B.J. Thomas, \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" by Glen Campbell, both \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\\" and \\"I'm Sorry\\" by John Denver, and \\"Convoy\\" by C.W. McCall. \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" spent three non-consecutive weeks atop the country listing, the only song to spend more than two weeks in the top spot. In October, Willie Nelson had his first number one single with \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\", taken from his breakthrough album Red Headed Stranger. The song's arrangement was simple and contrasted with the lush country-pop style prevalent at the time which characterized the recordings of crossover artists such as Glen Campbell. Nelson had been active as a singer and songwriter since the 1960s and several of his songs had been chart-toppers for other artists, but his own recordings had not achieved great success prior to 1975. \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\" marked the start of his transformation into a major star of country music who remained a regular chart-topper for a decade and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993. Eight other artists topped the Hot Country chart for the first time in 1975. T. G. Sheppard achieved his first number one in February with \\"Devil in the Bottle\\", and followed it up later in the year with his second, \\"Tryin' to Beat the Morning Home\\". Billie Jo Spears gained her only number one with \\"Blanket on the Ground\\", as did Gary Stewart with \\"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)\\". Linda Ronstadt and B. J. Thomas each topped the country chart for the first time having already achieved a chart-topper with an earlier single on the Hot 100. Other acts to achieve a first number one on the Hot Country chart in 1975 were Jessi Colter, Dickey Lee, and C. W. McCall, whose song \\"Convoy\\" reached the top of the chart in the issue of Billboard dated December 20, beginning a run which would ultimately last for six weeks.

In 1973, 36 different singles topped the chart, at the time published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine. Chart placings were based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. At the start of the year, the number one song was \\"She's Got to Be a Saint\\" by Ray Price, which had reached number one the previous week, and remained atop the chart for two weeks in 1973. Price returned to the top spot for a single week later in the year with \\"You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me\\". This marked his final appearance at the top of the Hot Country Singles chart, fifteen years after he had been at number one on the very first combined country sales and airplay chart published by Billboard. Conway Twitty spent the highest number of weeks at number one by any artist in 1973 with six, including one week at the top with a duet with Loretta Lynn. Twitty and Lynn had a run of success with duet recordings in the early 1970s alongside their ongoing solo careers, and each had three number one singles during the year, tying with Charley Pride, Tammy Wynette and Merle Haggard for the most number ones by an artist. Despite being banned by some radio stations due to its lyrical content, Twitty's \\"You've Never Been This Far Before\\" spent three weeks at number one, tying for the longest unbroken run of the year with \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\" by Charlie Rich. Artists to reach number one for the first time in 1973 included Tanya Tucker, who took \\"What's Your Mama's Name\\" to the top spot at the age of 14. Later in the year, another 14-year old, Marie Osmond, reached the top spot with \\"Paper Roses\\". She became the first female solo artist to top the chart with her debut single and set a new record as the youngest female artist to top the chart. A number of other artists achieved a first country number one in 1973. Joe Stampley was the first when he spent one week at the top of the chart with \\"Soul Song\\" in January. In March, Cal Smith topped the chart for the first time with \\"The Lord Knows I'm Drinking\\", as did Barbara Fairchild with \\"The Teddy Bear Song\\". In April, Charlie Rich gained his first number one with \\"Behind Closed Doors\\", beginning a run of five consecutive first-time chart-toppers which also included Roy Clark with \\"Come Live with Me\\", Tucker's \\"What's Your Mama's Name\\", \\"Satin Sheets\\" by Jeanne Pruett, and Johnny Rodriguez's \\"You Always Come Back to Hurting Me\\".

In 1972, 27 different singles topped the chart, at the time published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 53 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports supplied by stores. In the first issue of Billboard of the new year, \\"Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'\\" by Charley Pride spent its fifth week at number one. The following week, it was displaced by the double A-sided single \\"Would You Take Another Chance on Me\\" / \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" by Jerry Lee Lewis. Freddie Hart spent the most weeks at number one in 1972, occupying the top spot for a total of 11 weeks with \\"My Hang-Up Is You\\", \\"Bless Your Heart\\" and \\"Got the All Overs for You (All Over Me)\\". \\"My Hang-Up Is You\\" had the longest unbroken run at number one, spending six weeks at the top of the chart in the spring. This was twice as long as any other song spent at number one during 1972. Hart had been a recording artist since the early 1950s and made his first appearance on the Hot Country chart in 1959, but had never reached the top 10 until 1971, when \\"Easy Loving\\" went to number one. That song began a run of top 10 entries which lasted until 1975, when his chart performance began to decline again. In addition to Hart, Merle Haggard and Pride each achieved three number ones in 1972, spending six and seven weeks respectively at the top of the chart. Three artists topped the chart for the first time in 1972. Donna Fargo spent three weeks at number one in June with her first chart entry, \\"The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A.\\", and went on to gain her second number one in the fall with \\"Funny Face\\". Jerry Wallace achieved his only country chart-topper with \\"If You Leave Me Tonight I'll Cry\\", which spent two non-consecutive weeks at number one after being featured in an episode of the television show Night Gallery. Finally, Mel Tillis topped the chart for the first time with \\"I Ain't Never\\", more than a decade after he had first charted in Billboard. Tillis co-wrote the song with Webb Pierce, whose version went to number two on the chart in 1959, but Tillis did not record the song himself until 1972, when his version outperformed Pierce's and became his first number one. The final number one of the year was \\"She's Got to Be a Saint\\" by another singer who had been charting since the 1950s, Ray Price.

The coalition was established in 2001 by fishery associations, communities, Community Development Quota (CDQ) groups, harvesters, processors and support businesses, to promote science-based conservation measures to ensure sustainable Alaska fisheries. After its initial formation, MCA worked to address regional fisheries management issues and promote science-based fishery management practices. Alaska produces more than half the United States' seafood and MCA looks for practical solutions to conservation concerns to promote long term ocean health, sustainable fisheries, and the communities that depend on them. The organization works with Alaska fishery participants and communities to educate them about regulations and laws that affect Alaska's fisheries such as the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and regulations to address Endangered Species Act issues. Today, MCA is working on issues including habitat protection, catch shares, bycatch, and Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning. In 2003, MCA created a foundation to tackle issues related to the commercial fishing industry in Alaska such as bycatch and marine debris. The Marine Conservation Alliance Foundation (MCAF) brings fishermen and scientists together to address problems, initiate research and find workable solutions. NOAA has been a strong supporter of this program including a 2009 grant through NOAA's Ocean Service, Office of Response and Restoration,http://www.thecordovatimes.com/article/0929noaa_awards_1_million_for_alaska_beach to track, coordinate and fund the disposal or marine debris which washes up on Alaska shores. MCAF has removed over 1.9 million pounds of debris from Alaska beaches so far. MCA was recognized for its conservation work with the 2008 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Sustainable fisheries Leadership Award for Coastal Habitat Restoration, and most recently, MCA was awarded the 2010 Alaska SeaLife Center's Award for Stewardship and Sustainability at the Alaska Marine Gala in Anchorage. This award was created to recognize outstanding achievements in marine focused media, industry, research, education and resource management.

In 1956, he was sentenced to death after the murder of two grocery store clerks during an armed robbery in Salt Lake City, Utah. Kirkham chose to die by hanging to generate publicity and become an inconvenience to the state of Utah. Though an attempt was made to appeal his conviction by questioning his sanity, prison officials noted that Kirkham's defiant attitude remained remorseless until shortly before his execution, at which point he started crying and is reported to have wet himself. His hanging at Utah State Prison in 1958 was the first to be carried out by the state in 46 years. Kirkham is the last prisoner to be hanged by the state of Utah. Background Barton Kay Kirkham was the eldest of five children raised by a Mormon family in Salt Lake City. He was a fan of bop music and described himself as \\"a rebel.\\" Kirkham left his family's church life and school in the 11th grade and joined the United States Air Force. After 18 months, he committed a robbery while absent without leave in Colorado, and was given an undesirable discharge from the service. Kirkham spent the next 9 months in a reformatory and was paroled in July 1956. =Murders= On the night of August 12, 1956, Kirkham entered the Nibley Park Market grocery store in Salt Lake City to rob it. When he thought 50-year-old storekeeper David Avon Frame was not giving him all of the money that he had, Kirkham took Frame to the back of the store. There he found 37-year-old Ruth Holmes Webster, mother of four children in Sandy, Utah. Kirkham had them kneel on the floor and shot them in the head. He netted $54 from the robbery. Kirkham was apprehended the next morning after he forced a brother and sister to take him on a joyride through Provo Canyon. When later asked about his motive for killing Frame and Webster, he said, \\"Man, I don't know...\\" =Trial and sentencing= The first-degree murder trial commenced on December 12, 1956, with Judge Martin M. Larson presiding over the case. Kirkham was defended by attorneys Lamar C. Duncan and Wayne L. Black. On December 14, Kirkham was found guilty of murdering Frame and faced a mandatory death penalty. He was never tried for the murder of Webster. Kirkham was remanded to Utah State Prison on January 11, 1957, as the sentencing phase of the trial proceeded. Kirkham's attorneys immediately filed an appeal with the Utah Supreme Court. The appeal claimed that their client's mental state was not properly taken into account. On March 25, 1958, the court upheld Kirkham's conviction and denied his request for a rehearing, sending his case back for sentencing. Kirkham said he was certain he would be executed and resented his attorneys' \\"trying to prolong the waiting and stalling around.\\" On April 26, 1958, Judge Larson sentenced Kirkham to death. When asked to select between the option of execution by firing squad and hanging, he responded: \\"What costs most?\\" Kirkham said he chose to be hanged \\"because of the publicity... the novelty... to put the state to more inconvenience.\\" He also noted that the state might not execute him in that manner, and he might therefore get off \\"scot free\\". It would be the first hanging in Utah since 1912. Kirkham said that he hoped \\"to set some sort of record.\\" =Incarceration= Kirkham awaited execution on death row at Utah State Prison. While on death row at Utah State Prison, Kirkham followed newspaper articles and legal briefs of his case and read psychiatric texts and medical journals. Warden Marcell Graham described him as a good prisoner who caused little trouble. Kirkham grew out his hair and beard for 13 months until ordered to get a haircut. He then shaved himself bald to annoy the prison officials. Kirkham maintained a hardened image and reportedly laughed off concepts of mercy or religious salvation. He claimed to have no regret over the killings. On June 4, 1958, Kirkham appeared before the state pardons board for a final hearing for clemency. His attorneys had planned to demonstrate that he was insane with the help of psychiatrists. Kirkham initially told the board that he was a loner and felt \\"no remorse or anything like that.\\" In the final minutes of the hearing, he broke out into an appeal that he would prefer involuntary commitment in a mental institution over capital punishment. The board declined to commute his sentence. Execution Kirkham was visited by his parents the night before his hanging. Prison guards noted that he changed his demeanor as he received his parents warmly and was seen by Mormon and Roman Catholic chaplains. His mother was near collapse. Kirkham watched a movie with his parents and said farewell shortly before midnight. Kirkham ordered a last meal of pizza and ice cream, telling the prison steward that \\"you get cheese, meat and everything in one meal. Not so much fuss.\\" In the auditorium of Utah State Prison, Kirkham ate his pizza and played classical music on a piano in the company of the chaplains, news reporters and deputy sheriffs. He joked about his impending execution and commented on his keyboard skills: \\"I'll just have to practice more.\\" At dawn on June 7, 1958, Kirkham was driven two miles to a pasture on the prison's farm. After a black hood was placed over his head, Kirkham was led up a ramp to a newly built gallows. His drop had been measured at 6 feet to accommodate his reported weight of 200 pounds. A professional hangman from the Northwest was paid $400 () for his services. Kirkham trembled slightly as the hangman fitted a noose around his neck and placed the knot under his left ear. As directed by state law, Sheriff George Beckstead walked up to Kirkham to receive his last words. At 4:57 a.m. MST, the official time of dawn, Beckstead signaled the hangman, who pulled an iron lever opening the trap door under Kirkham. The Kirkham family did not come to witness the execution. Prison physician W. C. Knott climbed on a stepladder to examine Kirkham's hanging body, which was concealed from view by burlap and canvas hung under the 11-foot-high platform. He was pronounced dead at 5:11 AM. In February 1980, the Utah State Legislature replaced the option of hanging with lethal injection.

Carey is the moniker of musician Sean Carey of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Carey is best known as the drummer and supporting vocalist of indie folk band Bon Iver. In August 2010, Carey released his first solo album, All We Grow, which he began working on in 2008 during hiatuses from performing with the band. Comparisons have been drawn between Carey's harmonies and those of Brian Wilson in his 2004 album Smile. His music has also been likened to that of Sufjan Stevens, Fleet Foxes, Iron & Wine, Jos√© Gonz√°lez, Steve Reich, and Talk Talk. Background Sean Carey grew up in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. As the child of a singer and a music teacher, Carey has been immersed in music his entire life. He was raised listening to James Taylor, The Beach Boys, and Bruce Hornsby. At the age of ten he learned to play the drums and developed a deep love of jazz percussion after hearing his oldest sister perform in the middle school jazz band. In 2007, Carey graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire with a performance degree in classical percussion. That same year, upon hearing through mutual friends that Justin Vernon was planning on forming a band (Bon Iver), Carey listened to For Emma, Forever Ago on MySpace until he had learned all the songs. Said Carey: After singing a few songs backstage, Vernon and Carey realized how good their voices sounded together. Vernon asked Carey to play the show with him that night, and officially signed him to the band later that same evening. Solo career and debut album Carey's solo career came about semi-accidentally. After each month-long stint of touring with Bon Iver, Carey would return to Eau Claire for three weeks. During his time at home, Carey would record songs and experiment with layering sounds together. Carey recorded most of the music on All We Grow by himself with few exceptions. Jeremy Boettcher (bass), Nick Ball (guitar), and Bon Iver bandmate Mike Noyce (viola) played a large percentage of the music that Carey could not. Sean's sister Shannon Carey provided background vocals on two tracks, and Aaron Hedenstrom and Chris Thompson provided miscellaneous musical support. The song \\"In the Dirt\\" appears in the last scene of the episode The Dig from the Season 7 of the TV series House M.D. and also in the last scene of the episode \\"What Went Wrong\\" from season 3 of the TV series The Good Wife. Carey produced and appears on Owen's ninth album The King of Whys. Tour From September 8 to October 3, 2010, S. Carey toured North America with Swedish folk singer Kristian Matsson, otherwise known as The Tallest Man on Earth. During that time, the group performed fourteen times in Vancouver, Seattle, California, Arizona, Texas, Toronto, Montreal, New York City, Pennsylvania, and Washington DC. When asked what it was like touring with Matsson, Carey responded: S. Carey performed at CMJ 2010, and was considered \\"the most buzzed-about act of the day.\\" He spent a great deal of the summer of 2011 opening for David Bazan before joining the Bon Iver tour as band director and one of two drummers.

The series premiered on 4 October 2010, in an afternoon time-slot, replacing It's Academic after its series 12 finale. Spit it out was originally invented by Alan Curtis as a board Game. This game was then further developed by Grant Rule and Alan Curtis into a Television game show.  Format  Two school-based teams compete against each other in numerous word-related games. Each team has a clue leader, whom obtains the word given by the host. The leader tells the four other teammates to find the 'letter blocks' based on a clue. The team members then attempt to guess the word relating to the clue. The series uses a round-robin format, meaning that each school competing has two chances to battle for the prizes. Elimination stages soon follow when the series finals draw near, which ultimately leads to one of the schools winning the major prize. Unlike many other children's game shows which included Sydney-based schools and were produced in Sydney, this game show was the first in many years to include Victorian-based schools as well as being produced in Melbourne.  Rounds  =Head to Head= Both team leaders are given a mystery word, which along with their team-mates use gigantic foam blocks and place them on the clue bank (similar to Boggle) with only giving a clue to the word, and the team captains must guess the actual word. Teams get one guess per clue and 3 points for each words solved correctly. =Frenzee= In series one, two team members from each school use an electronic touch-screen device with fourteen random letters (nine consonants and all five vowels) and aim to create more as many four to seven letter words in ninety (90) seconds. If there is an 's' in the set of letters no plurals are allowed and names of people and places are not allowed. Teams score one point for each word they create. In the quarterfinals, for every seven letter word the team spells out, two points are scored instead. In series two, the format was similar with a few alterations. Instead of the option to create words four letters or more, teams must find a four letter word, a five letter word, then a six or seven letter word in that order and then the cycle repeats itself until time. This is done to prevent teams from quickly finding four letter words that rhyme with each other or are homonyms as well as to find more words that are six or seven letters long. One point is scored for every four letter word, two points for every five letter word, three points for every six letter word and five points for every seven letter word. =Every Second Counts= Both clue leaders are again given a mystery word and with their team-mates place blocks on the table. The team captains have an option on which time during the round they want to have a guess, and if they do not guess the right answer, they will be locked out of guessing and the team doesn't have to provide anymore clues. The time limit is two minutes long and the points start at three points and increase by three points for every thirty seconds elapsed (maximum of twelve points). The mystery word is always an adjective. =Head to Head: With A Twist= Follows the format of Head to head with the exception of multiple points, depending on the remaining time. The first mystery word is worth ten points, the second mystery word is worth twenty points, the third thirty, fourth forty and so on. The time limit as in the first round is three minutes. During the final stages of the round, Elliot will allow any team to put down a clue. This allows the trailing team to quickly put in clues as the leading team could purposely run the clock down and win the game. If the scores are tied after four rounds, a golden word tiebreaker will occur. In this tiebreaker, only one mystery word is given to both team leaders and provide the clues like in Head to head. The first team to correctly solve this word will score one point and win the game. There is no time limit in this tiebreaker. In one of the quarterfinal rounds on 22 December 2010, after four rounds, Albert Park (green team) and Canterbury (blue team) were tied at 53 points each. In the tiebreaker, after Canterbury provided the clue \\"MUSIK\\", Albert Park buzzed in and correctly guessed the mystery word, \\"SONG\\". As a result of this, Albert Park won 54-53 and a spot in the Friday final. Series 1 =Summary= When Albert Park versed St Kilda Park in the Friday final, Albert Park lost to St Kilda and the scores were 72‚Äì65. The four schools who will be in the Grand Final are Elwood, Port Melbourne, Bundoora and St Kilda. =Grand Final Week= On Monday, Port Melbourne lost to Bundoora. On Tuesday,St Kilda came from behind to defeat Elwood. On Wednesday, Elwood defeated Bundoora and were the first team to go to the Friday final. On Thursday, Port Melbourne had the lead after Frenzy, but lost the lead to St Kilda who correctly answered \\"FLUFFY\\" in Every Second Counts. However, in Head to head with a twist, St Kilda scored 20 points, but it was Port Melbourne who managed to guess \\"AVATAR\\" in the final seconds after the clues \\"BLUE\\", \\"MOVIE\\" and \\"PANDORA\\" for 30 points and managed to score 40 points and won the game and a place in the Friday final. On Friday, after Head to head, Elwood scored 3 points while Port Melbourne scored 6 points. In the last few seconds of play, Port Melbourne avoided giving clues in order to run the clock down and paid off. In Frenzy, both teams scored 13 points each. In Every Second Counts, Elwood wanted to guess when nine points were on offer. However, Port Melbourne tactically buzzed in few seconds before nine points were on offer and correctly guessed \\"FIZZY\\" with the clues \\"SOFT DRK\\" and \\"SPRITE\\" scoring six points. In Head to head with a twist, despite Elwood made several guesses scored no points. Port Melbourne correctly guessed \\"PURSE\\" with the clue \\"WALLET\\" for ten points; \\"FRISBEE\\" with the clues \\"DISC\\", \\"THROW\\", \\"FLY\\", \\"SPIN\\" and \\"DOG\\"; and \\"INTERNET\\" with the clue \\"WEB\\" for thirty points. After four rounds, Port Melbourne won the game and championship against Elwood 88‚Äì16. Series 2 =Summary= The second series started on 11 July 2011 after the conclusion of It's Academic. After a hectic Quarter-Final run-up, the four teams qualified in the Grand Final Week were: St Oliver Plunkett, Albion North, Yarrambat and Apollo Parkways. New Frenzee rules were introduced for the Grand Final Week, that the Frenzieeists must now create a Frenzee stack with 4, 5, 6 AND 7 words, and each worth only one point. In day one of the grand final week, Yarrambat played against Apollo Parkways, Yarrambat won 53‚Äì21. In day two of the grand final week, St Oliver Plunkett played against Albion North, St Oliver Plunkett won 75‚Äì24. On the first two days all four teams still succeeded because of the round-robin reset. In day three of the grand final week, Yarrambat was knocked out with a score of 101‚Äì27 to Albion North; And St Oliver Plunkett also lost to Apollo Parkways (81-63) in day four of the grand final week. \\"64 games ago, we started with 32 schools, but after many mystery words and more clues, we are now down to just two schools. Make no mistake, they are both well deserved to be here this afternoon, where they will both play for the Spit It Out Grand Final Prize Package and of course, the sensationally shining Spit It Out Trophy!\\" - Elliot Spencer, Spit It Out Host at the start of the Spit It Out Grand Final Afternoon. These two teams were the Hard-Rock Albion North and the Book-won-do Apollo Parkways (who later fought back and won to a score of 84-17). Grand Final Breakdown: Round 1 Head To Head: Albion North solved three mystery words and earned 9 points to a total of 9 points. Apollo Parkways solved one mystery word and earned 3 points to total of 3 points. Round 2 Frenzee: Albion North spelt 11 words but no reference was found for 3 of them so they earned 8 points to a total of 17 points. Apollo Parkways spelt 12 words so earned 12 points to a total of 15 points. Round 3 Every Second Counts: With clues including 'too many' and 'busy', Apollo Parkways correctly solved the mystery word \\"crowded\\" earning themselves 9 points to a total of 24 points. Round 4 Head to Head With a Twist: The hard-rock Albion North rocked their guesses into the game but didn't solve any mystery words so they ended with a total of 17 points, but the book-won-do Apollo Parkways had read their guessing books right and solved three mystery words, 'chain', 'artist', and 'spine' earning themselves 60 points and boosted to win with a total of 84 points. Spencer, the schools and the crew waved goodbye as usual - and so did the clue cube stacks - like Spencer's everyday saying, \\"Bye for now, not for ever!\\" saying \\"BYE FOR NOW\\" on one and \\"NOT FOR EVA\\" on the other.

She served at first on the China Station and from 1883 on the Australia Station. She was hulked in 1895 sold for breaking in 1924. Design and construction Designed by Sir Edward Reed, Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy, the Ariel-class gunboats were the first gunboats of composite construction. Swinger was engined by Humphrys, Tennant & Co. with a horizontal single-expansion steam engine (the rest of the class had compound-expansion engines) developing an indicated horsepower of . She was armed with two 64-pounder (56cwt) muzzle-loading rifles and two 20-pounder Armstrong breech loaders. All 4 guns were mounted on traversing carriages. Some of the class were re-armed in the 1880s with two 5-inch and two 4-inch breech loaders. All the ships of the class carried a three-masted barquentine rig. Operational service Swinger served at first on the China Station and since it was Royal Navy policy to ship entire crews out to the far-flung stations, she recommissioned at Hong Kong on 18 February 1877. She commissioned at Devonport on 2 October 1883 for service on the Australia Station. She arrived in Australia in 1884 under the command of Lieutenant Marx and was employed in preventing the blackbirding trade. Soon he fell in with the Forest King to the East of New Guinea, and sent Mr. Millman, the civil Magistrate, on board to investigate. On finding 60 illegally taken islanders in the Forest King, he told the master that he would be taken into port the following day, and that he would be sunk if he tried to escape. That night Swingers quartermaster reported to Marx that the Forest King was throwing coconuts overboard. Rushing to the deck, Marx could see through binoculars that the blackbirders were throwing their human cargo over the side in order to be rid of the incriminating evidence. Still half naked from their hammocks, Swingers seamen manned the boats and rescued 18 men from the water; about 20 men had drowned. In the morning Marx boarded the Forest King and carried her into Brisbane, where the master was tried by the Vice Admiralty Court of Inquiry. Marx was warned not to walk the streets in uniform since considerable vested interests were affected. Nevertheless, after three days the court convicted the master of Forest King and vindicated Lieutenant Marx.Jones (2008) In 1886 at St. Agnau Swinger had been trading with some natives, and considering them friendly, Marx decided to go ashore.

His real name was Nikolai Petropavlovsky; his pen name was S. Karonin. A number of later Russian sources refer to him as Nikolay Karonin-Petropavlovsky. Biography Nikolai Petropavlovsky was born in Samara province, where his father was a village priest. His father provided him with his primary education. He then studied at a seminary, and afterward at a classical school. In May 1874 he met the revolutionary populist Porphyry Voinaralsky, and helped him to create and organize an underground circle of self-education. This soon led to his expulsion from school. He was arrested in Summer of 1874 for \\"participating in illegal activity, with the intention of overthrowing the government\\". In December he was transferred to the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg. He spent three and a half years in confinement in Saint Petersburg, which had a negative effect on his health. In 1877 he was acquitted of his charges and released. He spent 1877-78 conducting revolutionary activities, and in February 1879 he was arrested for a second time. At the end of 1879, while in detention, he began writing, his first work being an essay entitled The Mute, which attacked wealthy populists and the way the autocracy dealt with the problems of the poor. In 1881 he was exiled to Siberia for a term of 5 years. In Siberia he lived in Tobolsk province (present-day Tyumen Oblast), and engaged in economic research in its southern districts, for which he received an award from the West Siberian Division of the Russian Geographical Society. After he returned from exile, he lived first in Kazan, then in Nizhni Novgorod, before settling in Saratov, where he wrote for the local newspapers, and contributed stories to the magazines Russian Thought, and the Russian Gazette. He had planned to write an epic novel, but was unable to begin work on it before his death in 1892. In an article on Karonin-Petropavlovsky, Maxim Gorky wrote: Writing He published his first work, an essay The Mute (1879) in Otechestvennye Zapiski (Annals of the Fatherland). After this he published stories in Notes of the Fatherland and the magazine Russian Word. In his first stories, he drew a vivid picture of the village, with its desperate financial need, powerlessness and helplessness. Against a background of general savagery he revealed the intimate life of the peasant. The majority of his works deal with the issues of the peasants, and with lower-class intellectuals, whose purpose he felt it was to devote themselves to the people.

Design The Banterer class was designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Admiralty Director of Naval Construction. They were of composite construction, meaning that the frame, keel and sternpost were of iron, while the hull was planked with timber. This had the advantage of allowing the vessels to be coppered, thus keeping marine growth under control, a problem that caused iron-hulled ships to be frequently docked. They were in length and displaced 465 tonnes.

Their prominent locations are in the Central and North End neighbourhoods of Winnipeg. The Manitoba Warriors is an exclusively Aboriginal gang that began in 1984 on the Lake Manitoba First Nation to Rival the notorious Indian Posse street gang. Common nicknames that the Manitoba Warriors are referred to as include MW, Mdubbz, 1323 and the Warriors.  Origins  The Manitoba Warriors were formed as a prison gang in 1993. They originated as an exclusively Aboriginal criminal organization at the Stony Mountain Institution. They created the MW to protect Native and Metis inmates and to rival traditional prison gangs. As incarcerated members were released, they recruited disenfranchised, young Aboriginals from their neighbourhoods. Unlike other Aboriginal gangs, they chose a structure similar to that found in outlaw biker culture. Each member holds a specific ranking, similar to the ranks found in outlaw biker clubs. However, according to former president Brian Contois, the Warriors were founded on a code of ethics aimed at bringing some level of morality, pride, and dignity to a way of life that would otherwise be unobtainable to these youth. This gang lifestyle promised them employment, money and brotherhood. By creating this place to find their identity there was a boom of recruitment, which might explain the variations in the MW's actual size. There are 300 active members listed in the City of Winnipeg‚Äôs gang unit database and a further 140 inactive. They first caught the attention of the police in 1993 and have since become a focal point of police investigation due to the volume and intensity of their activities. There have been three major operations against the Manitoba Warriors starting with Operation Northern Snow in 1998. The police then launched Project Octopus after finding out that the Warriors were exploiting Government funding for a homelessness initiative called Paa Pii Wak. One of the Warriors most recent setbacks was a raid, labeled Project Falling Star, resulting in the arrest of 57 members and associates. As the Warriors expanded out of prison into Winnipeg and the surrounding area they also expanded their prison network. Their main territories are in the Central and North End neighborhoods of Winnipeg.  Insignia  The patch or insignia of a criminal organization is an important visual representation of the group. The patch of the Manitoba Warriors is an eight-pointed sun with the head of a Native American Warrior in the center. It is also often customary that a gang is represented by a colour, and for the Warriors it is black. Besides their patched vests, there are jerseys, sweaters and tank tops displaying symbols of the Manitoba Warriors as is common among similar organizations. The Manitoba Warriors often refer to their gang as 1323, and those numbers have become synonymous with the MW. The numbers 13 and 23 stand for the location of \\"M\\" and \\"W\\" in the alphabet.. These numbers have become common in reference to the Warriors and is common in tattoos of their organization.  Structure  The Manitoba Warriors began rejecting the structure of similar rival gangs and instead their organization is structured similar to outlaw motorcycle clubs. Senior members' ranks are indicated by tattoos and titles including a president, vice-president and sergeant-at-arms. Prospective members are apprentices before they become a fully fledged members, analogous to the process of \\"striking\\" in biker gangs. After the police operation Northern Snow the Warriors changed from classic biker culture and formed three distinct cells the Ruthless Warriors, Central Warriors, and Notorious Krew. The strategy behind this was that if one of the cells is compromised by a police interdiction it would not affect the other cells. A short time later they scrapped the three-cell strategy and returned to a single cohesive organization, because rival organizations were expanding too quickly for the three separate cells. The Warriors reinstated leadership titles and a new \\"council\\" of high-ranking members was created to make decisions and pass down orders to other members in a way that protected the council from direct involvement in crime.  Territory  The Manitoba Warriors are typically located in the central and northern suburbs of Winnipeg. Other organizations that have adopted the \\"Warriors\\" banner such as the Alberta and Saskatchewan Warriors, helped spread the gang's influence to other cities. However, their turf is not exclusive to these areas, and the Warriors also have a substantial prison network. = Prison network = The Manitoba Warriors started out as an exclusively Aboriginal organization designed to protect Native and M√©tis inmates against aggression from other prison groups at the Stony Mountain Institution but have since spread to the Headingley Correctional Institution and Edmonton Institution.  Affiliated criminal organizations  The Manitoba Warriors have been known to work with and align themselves with other criminal organizations. The Saskatchewan Warriors, Alberta Warriors, Rock Machine, CENTRAL, Loyalty Honour Silence and MOB Squad are some of their more well known affiliations. An interesting thing about the Manitoba Warriors is that they created the Warriors banner that was adopted to create new criminal organizations. Criminal Organizations like the Alberta Warriors and Saskatchewan Warriors originally adopted this banner under the Manitoba Warriors and have since separated and expanded. Saskatchewan Warriors originally worked for the MW but have become a separate affiliated criminal organization. The SW is also an Aboriginal street gang that are active mainly in the Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert areas of Saskatchewan. Although MW and SW are in separate cities with similar street codes the AW SW gangs, they have been known to work together from time to time.  Rival criminal organizations  Due to the nature of criminal organizations, it tends to be easy to make enemies, and the Manitoba Warriors are no exception. Indian Posse, Native Syndicate, Terror Squad, Manitoba Blood Family, PK Mobsters, Redd Alert, Mad Cowz, Bloods, Hells Angels, the Zig Zag Crew, and MOB are all known rivals of the MW. The Most Organized Brothers or MOB squad was once affiliated with the MW but due to an unspecified \\"blow out\\" the alliance fell apart. This falling out has caused an air of bad blood between the two organizations to exist even today. =Indian Posse= Throughout the years there has been a violent rivalry between the Indian Posse and the Manitoba Warriors. The Indian Posse is also an Aboriginal street gang that started out as a prison gang. The Manitoba Warriors met their first rivals in the form of the Indian Posse. On April 25, 1996 the Manitoba Warriors and the Indian Posse members got into an altercation at the Headingley Correctional Institution, causing a riot. The riot lasted 8 hours and caused approximately seven million dollars in damages. Eight guards and 31 inmates were injured in the riot. =Hells Angels= There has been an on- again off-again relationship between the Hells Angels and Manitoba Warriors over the city of Winnipeg‚Äôs drug distribution network. The Manitoba Warriors leaders began seeking control of the Winnipeg drug trade in the mid 1990s. The Angels were the main distributors of methamphetamines and crack cocaine. Because The Hells Angels are perhaps Canada's most powerful criminal organisation, one of the Manitoba Warriors' first targets in the early 2000s would be the Manitoba Hells Angels motorcycle gang. The Angels lacked the numbers of the larger Manitoba Warriors. The Manitoba Warriors eventually gained control of the Winnipeg drug trade by murdering 3 Manitoba Hells Angel bikers. At the time, they were the only street gang with the ability to successfully challenge the Angels and push the Hells Angels back. The MW and Hells Angels have been known to work together; however, there is a lot of bad blood between the two criminal organizations.  Police interventions  = Operation Northern Snow = In 1998, the Winnipeg police were given the authority to begin a long investigation called Operation Northern Snow to counter the gang's drug trafficking. Thirty-five gang members were arrested and charged under new federal anti-gang legislation and held in a maximum security court house without the option for bail. Some members spent 20 months in jail waiting for trial and for 10 of those months they were being transported back and forth to the court house to plead their innocence. The case fell apart because of the length of time it took the Crown to begin the case. Some of the accused were released after their time imprisoned awaiting trial. Others faced an additional 18 months, and 22 of the accused accepted plea bargains. The Manitoba Warriors' growth was not slowed by Operation Northern Snow. = Project Octopus = In 2008, the police were again involved in an investigation into the Manitoba Warriors who were becoming a notorious street gang. The RCMP alerted the Winnipeg police that the Manitoba Warriors were exploiting government funding for a \\"homeless\\" initiative called Paa Pii Wak. The investigation was launched in December 2008 and it did not take long for it to become clear that the Manitoba Warriors were using Paa Pii Wak to further their criminal activities. The investigation showed that the Warriors exploited Paa Pii Wak in a few different ways. They used the organization to give active gang members and associates a legitimate source of income. it also gave gang members the authority to supervise gang members on court ordered release and gave the MW a way to extract active gang members from the centre. It also gave the Manitoba Warriors the ability to amend court orders rendering them ineffective. It was also known that the \\"staff\\" permitted the use of alcohol and drugs in the shelter. This was a real blow for the Homeless community because the Paa Pii Wak facilities that were supposed to help them were being used by a criminal organization.

The Act was amended in 1977 and then superseded by the Citizenship Act of 1985. Provisions of the 1958 Act The preamble and first two articles of the Act describe its promulgation as a series of changes to the previous nationality law. It also states that King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck promulgated the Act on the advice of royal advisers, the Bhutanese people, and the monastic body. They also define its name and jurisdiction ‚Äì the Kingdom of Bhutan. =Bona fide Bhutanese nationals= The Act's third article provides Bhutanese citizenship to residents whose fathers are Bhutanese nationals, and to children born anywhere after the enactment of the Act whose fathers are Bhutanese nationals at the time of the child's birth. This provision is an example of a patrilineal jus sanguinis, or blood-based, nationality law. The provisions of this article contain the only statements of citizenship as a matter of right within the Act. =Naturalization= The Act's fourth article provides a framework for two paths of naturalization. Foreigners who have reached the age of majority and are eligible may present a petition to an official appointed by the King and take an oath of loyalty \\"according to the rules laid down by the official\\" and be enrolled as a Bhutanese national. Eligibility for naturalization requires applicants be residents of Bhutan for more than fifteen years and own agricultural land within the kingdom. Naturalization is also available to wives of Bhutanese nationals who submit a petition and take the oath of loyalty \\"to the satisfaction of the concerned official,\\" provided that they have reached the age of majority and are otherwise eligible. Those who have been deprived of, have renounced, or have forfeited Bhutanese nationality cannot become a Bhutanese national again unless the king gives his approval. The provisions of this article illustrate a high degree of discretion, particularly at the administrative level, in granting Bhutanese citizenship. The Act's fifth article provides the basic process of naturalization as well as further conditions. Foreigners who submit a petition to the King may receive a Bhutanese Nationality Certificate provided they have served satisfactorily in Government service for at least five years in addition to the ten year residency requirement. Once the certificate is received, applicants may take the oath of loyalty \\"according to rules laid down by the Government\\" to be enrolled as a Bhutanese national. Applicants may receive a Nationality Certificate provided that in the opinion of the King their conduct and service as a Government servant are satisfactory. The provisions of this article illustrate a high degree of discretion at the highest levels of government in granting Bhutanese citizenship. =Loss of nationality= The Act's sixth article provides the grounds for forfeiture of citizenship. Bhutanese nationals who become citizens of foreign countries where they reside; who have renounced Bhutanese nationality having settled abroad; who claim to be citizens of a foreign country or who pledge an oath of loyalty to that country; who have naturalized but have since left their agricultural land or stopped residing in Bhutan; or who are bona fide nationals but have stopped residing in Bhutan or failed to observe the laws of Bhutan all forfeit their Bhutanese nationality. This provision emphasizes continual residency as a requirement for citizenship and discourages residency abroad. The Act's seventh article provides further grounds for deprivation of citizenship. It states that the government may cancel Certificates of Nationality obtained on presentation of false information or omission of facts. It also provides that the government may deprive citizens of their citizenship without notice if they engage in activities or speech against the King or the people of Bhutan; if they conduct business with, correspond with, or aid enemies during war; and if they are imprisoned in any country for more than one year within five years of attaining Bhutanese nationality. Such a provision is an example of laws on fraud, sedition and treason as well as a policy against allowing serious criminals or convicted felons. =Further provisions= The Act's eighth article provides that the King may incorporate additional rules if necessary for the implementation of the Act. This article also illustrates a supreme degree of discretion and authority vested in the King, including his ability to enact ad hoc changes to the law. The ninth article provides that the Act supersedes all previous laws, rules and regulations, ordinances relating to the acquisition and forfeiture of Bhutanese nationality. Amendments of 1977 The 1958 Citizenship Act was altered by the Bhutanese royal government in 1977 through a series of amendments titled \\"Act on Grant of Citizenship in Bhutan\\". The 1977 Amendments supersede all conflicting prior law. The 1977 Amendments introduced both substantive and procedural changes in Bhutanese citizenship law, clarifying the role of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Amendments enacted further conditions and procedures for naturalization, namely lengthening the residency requirement. They further clarified the status of certain bona fide Bhutanese citizens abroad and refined the requirements and procedures surrounding census registration. The Amendments also restate loss of citizenship as the penalty for sedition. =Naturalization= In Article KA (‡ΩÄ), the residency requirement for naturalization is lengthened to 15 years for those in the service of the Bhutanese government and 20 years for all other applicants. In addition, foreigners are required to show \\"some knowledge\\" of written and spoken Bhutanese and the history of Bhutan in order to apply to the Ministry of Home Affairs. After investigating, the Ministry forwards the application to the royal government. Article KHA (‡ΩÅ) provides that the power to grant or reject applications rests solely with the royal government, and disclaims that the fulfillment of all conditions does not guarantee applicants' eligibility. This Article also prohibits dual citizenship, naturalization of criminals, and naturalization of those \\"related to any person involved in activities against the people, the country and the King.\\" This law is an example of a de jure imputation of political opinion. Article KHA also requires naturalized citizens to register their names in the census record of the royal government from the date of naturalization, and to take an oath administered by the Home Minister. This Article codifies a particular oath of citizenship, which pledges allegiance to the King alone, pledges to obey the law and to \\"observe all the customs and traditions of the people of Bhutan.\\" The oath pledges \\"not [to] commit any act against the country, the people and the King.\\" The oath is then solemnized in the name of Yeshey Goempo and with a promise to serve the country to the best of one's ability. The next Article, GA (‡ΩÇ), permits a Special Grant of Citizenship to foreigners with \\"special or extraordinary qualifications\\" to be granted citizenship, waiving all conditions except for the administration of the oath. This is a significant substantive and procedural departure from the original 1958 Act. =Renouncement and reacquisition of citizenship= Article NGA (‡ΩÑ) requires citizens who leave Bhutan, return, and apply for citizenship to undergo \\"probation for a period of at least two years.\\" If the applicant is successful, this Article grants citizenship for applicants provided they are \\"not responsible for any activities against the Royal Government.\\" This is another significant substantive and procedural departure from the original 1958 Act. The maximum duration and exact investigatory nature of the probation period are undefined, however, apparently leaving much to discretion. Naturalized Bhutanese citizens may renounce Bhutanese citizenship (\\"apply for permission to emigrate\\" from Bhutan) together with their family members. The government grants the request after an investigation. Thereafter, the same person may not re-apply for Bhutanese citizenship. Adult family members who wish to remain in Bhutan may apply to remain. After the Home Minister investigates the matter, the government permit adult family members to remain in Bhutan \\"after ascertaining that Bhutan's interest is not harmed.\\" There are, however, no guidelines for approval, which thus appears highly discretionary. This Article preemptively stays requests of both bona fide Bhutanese and naturalized Bhutanese citizens to emigrate during times of crises such as war. =Transmission of citizenship= Article CHA (‡ΩÖ) restates the patrilineal jus sanguinis law under the 1958 Act in explicit terms. This Article also deprives Bhutanese citizenship from those who reside abroad outside the service of the royal government, private business, or religious practices, and who live abroad serving foreign governments and people, or who have settled abroad or hold official posts in a foreign government. =Registration procedure and authentication= Article CHHA (‡ΩÜ) requires all children of Bhutanese citizen fathers to be registered in the official record within one year of birth whether born inside or outside Bhutan. It also requires all children born within the country to be listed with the Dzongkhag or the Dungkhag of their birth. It further requires children of Bhutanese parents born abroad to be recorded at the Bhutanese Embassy, or through correspondence to the Home Ministry. It allows local authorities to apply to the Home Ministry for census registration on behalf of children over the age of one. The Ministry has the authority to investigate the matter, grant, and deny registration. This is a further significant substantive and procedural departure from the original 1958 Act, which did not address census registration of infants. Article JA (‡Ωá) provides that all census records must bear the seal of the royal government and the signature of an officer no lower in rank than Dzongdag (district administrator; there are twenty in all Bhutan), and bars consideration of other records. This substantive addition to the law prevents the consideration of gewog, village, and other civil documentation. Article NYA (‡Ωâ) provides that all fraudulent Kashos (certificates) not granted by the King himself be investigated by the Home Minister and reported to the royal government. =Penalty for violations= The sole penalty is deprivation of citizenship. Article TA (‡Ωè) restates the 1958 law that punishes all citizens who are \\"involved in acts against the King or speaks against the Royal Government or associates with people involved in activities against the Royal Government\\" with deprivation of citizenship. This Article also punishes anyone who knowingly presents false information during naturalization with deprivation of citizenship \\"after due verification of the false information presented.\\" On its face, this law represents a procedural safeguard, or an element of due process, on the tails of Bhutan's sedition and speech laws. This law is also an example of de jure imputation of political opinion by the government due to association. Repeal The Act and its Amendments were superseded on June 10, 1985 by the Citizenship Act of 1985.

The company later expanded to include Matt Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Steven Kostanski, who are now equal partners in the company. Astron-6 is known for producing low-budget, 1980s-centric independent movies that often combine horror with comedy. A planned 2012 documentary No Sleep, No Surrender, which detailed the making and production of their 2011 film Father's Day, was never completed, though a teaser trailer was released. The follow-up to Father's Day, a Giallo-inspired horror comedy, The Editor, was directed by Adam Brooks and Matthew Kennedy in 2014. In 2016, Astron-6 produced the web series Divorced Dad. The series was described by the filmmakers as 'a love letter to the endearingly incompetent cable access television shows created by far from screen-ready small town celebrities during the 1980s and 90s'. Gillespie and Kostanski directed the 2016 horror film The Void, intended as a departure from Astron-6's more comedic work.

As a child, Ciampa had been fascinated by the acrobatic agility of film stars such as Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and by the character of Tarzan of the Apes as portrayed by Elmo Lincoln and later Johnny Weissmuller. Inspired by his screen heroes, Ciampa began to climb trees and buildings in his Brooklyn neighborhood at a young age, persisting with the activity into his teenage years and early adulthood.  Career in the entertainment business  By 1942 Ciampa's unusual hobby had gained him some local notoriety. Coincident with the release of the feature film Tarzan's New York Adventure, Ciampa was featured in a Paramount Pictures newsreel exhibiting some of his feats of acrobatic buildering and freestyle tree climbing. A bricklayer by profession, Ciampa also worked in the entertainment business throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, starring in Larry Sunbrock's Rodeo and Thrill Circus in New York City and then traveling with the circus to various U.S. and Canadian cities. Notably, his act did not include the typical, tightly choreographed feats of circus acrobatics such as trapeze swinging or trampolining, but rather improvised climbing and leaping stunts making use of scaffolding and circus rigging. Spectators were frequently alarmed by the apparently ad libbed and obviously dangerous nature of his performances. In 1947 Ciampa was arrested for having scaled the exterior of the Astor Hotel as a publicity stunt for the Sunbrock Circus, concerning onlookers who feared that he might have been attempting suicide. In 1950 Ciampa performed in the Olsen and Johnson comedy show \\"Pardon Our French\\", in which he startled theater audiences by leaping between boxes and running along balcony railings high above the stage, occasionally while costumed as a gorilla and billed as \\"Ciampa, the Swinging Ape\\". When the show toured to Boston, Ciampa's antics ran foul of local safety ordinances and he was required to reduce the height at which he performed his stunts.  Appearance in Gizmo! documentary  The 1977 documentary film Gizmo! included footage from the Paramount newsreel of John Ciampa's climbing and jumping stunts, but did not credit Ciampa and ran the footage together with unrelated film of the also uncredited German stuntman Arnim Dahl, causing some confusion as to their identities. In the Gizmo! sequence, Ciampa is first seen eating a spaghetti dinner with his family before running outside, acrobatically climbing a tree, leaping between buildings, running up a wall, quickly scaling a tall drainpipe, climbing a narrow alleyway by pressing his hands and feet against opposite walls and then repeating the latter feat with a young boy riding on his back, before waving to the camera from a rooftop. Arnim Dahl is then seen jumping on board a tram, and Dahl is featured for the remainder of the sequence.

Throughout the further course of ECU development, these models serve as a base for analysis, testing and integration of the bus systems and ECUs. Data is displayed and evaluated in either raw or symbolic format. Back in 1992, Vector developed the DBC data format, which has become a de facto standard for exchanging CAN descriptions in the automotive field. Other relevant standards are supported for other bus systems, e.g. FIBEX for FlexRay, LDF for LIN, Fibex for SOME/IP, EDS/DCF/XDD for CANopen. While CANoe can simulate the whole communication in a vehicle, it also includes a Test Feature Set, for creating automated test sequences. These automated test sequences can be controlled fully automated by usual CI tools (such as Jenkins etc). The Test Feature Set included in CANoe has a long history and is therefore available in variants; creation of test cases can be created in CAPL (Communication Access Programming Language - a C-like programming language), in XML, or in C#. The tests can either be manually programmed or generated automatically by different generators. CANoe's Ethernet option includes Ethernet Conformance Tests (TC8 test suite). CANoe's LIN option includes LIN Conformance slave tests.

He left the village because of poverty and worked as an errand boy, salesman, plumber, laborer, and even as a guide for a blind merchant. These experiences gave him material for his writings. His first story Two Brothers (1887) was praised by Leo Tolstoy, who supported and encouraged Semyonov throughout their long acquaintance. His debut, 1894 collection Krestyanskiye rasskazy (Peasant Stories) came out with a foreword by Tolstoy, who cited \\"sincerity, substantiveness, simplicity and seriousness, as well as the expressiveness of language, rich in folklore imagery\\" as the author's prose major features.Romanova, T.V. –°–µ–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –¢–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç—å–µ–≤–∏—á at the Russian Writers Biobibliographical dictionary // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏. –ë–∏–æ–±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å. –¢–æ–º 2. –ú-–Ø. –ü–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π –ü. –ê. –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∞. –ú., \\"–ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ\\", 1990 He published poetry, several plays, a book of memoirs called Twenty-Five Years in the Village, and a volume of essays.Introduction to Gluttons, The Salt Pit, Raduga Publishers, 1988.

She has also represented English Premier League clubs Arsenal Ladies and Leeds United Ladies, as well as Memphis Mercury in America. Club career Thorpe began her career with Redlake before moving to St. Catherine's in 1999. After helping the club to promotion, she joined Arsenal Ladies in August 2000 along with compatriots Susan Heapes and Yvonne Tracy. Thorpe was one of seven Irish players then in the Arsenal squad, and with Emma Byrne and Ciara Grant, one of three who were regulars in the first team. On her debut Thorpe scored two goals in a 5‚Äì0 win over Tranmere Rovers. She won the domestic treble in her first season, and was an unused substitute as Arsenal beat Fulham in the 2001 FA Women's Cup final at Selhurst Park. Despite this success Thorpe returned to St. Catherine's in May 2001. She was back in the FA Women's Premier League in 2001‚Äì02, but with newly promoted Leeds United. In summer 2002 Thorpe played in the American W-League with Memphis Mercury, before returning to Leeds for 2002‚Äì03. Thorpe and her ex-Arsenal teammate Susan Heapes both played in St. Catherine's 1‚Äì0 FAI Women's Cup final defeat to St Francis in July 2009. A third Arsenal player from that era, Grainne Kierans, was on the opposing side. International career Thorpe's first representative games for Ireland came as a 16-year-old. In September 2000 Thorpe scored against Scotland and Northern Ireland as the Republic won the Celt Cup, a quadrangular tournament also featuring the Isle of Man. That year she was nominated Under-18 International Player of the Year at the FAI International Football Awards. She later featured in the qualifying tournaments for the 2003 World Cup and 2005 European Championship. In October 2004 Thorpe scored Ireland's winner in a 2‚Äì1 friendly win in the Faroe Islands and then played in a 5‚Äì1 loss to the United States at Soldier Field.

A follower of Paracelsus, he is now remembered for important if transitional alchemical theories. He called sugar toxic, saying: ‚ÄúUnder its whiteness, sugar hides a great blackness.‚Äù Biography Duchesne was born around 1544 in Armagnac and studied at Montpellier, and then at Basle, where he received a medical diploma in 1573. During the 1570s at Lyon, he married Anne Trie the granddaughter of Guillaume Bud√©, and became a Calvinist convert. He went into medical practice and became physician to Francis, Duke of Anjou. He left Lyon in 1580 for Kassel in Hesse, and moved on to Geneva, where in 1584 he received citizenship. Duchesne was elected to the Council of Two Hundred in 1587, and undertook diplomatic missions to Bern, Basle, Schaffhausen and Zurich in the years 1589 to 1596. In 1594 he became a member of the Council of Sixty. In 1598, following the Edict of Nantes, Duchesne returned to France and became physician-in-Ordinary attending Henry IV of France. In 1601 Nicolas Br√ªlart de Sillery gave him a mission as envoy to the Swiss cantons. In 1604 he went to the court of Maurice of Hesse-Cassel where he gave scientific demonstrations in a laboratory set up for him.

He lived in Cardiff, Wales, between 2004 and 2012, where he worked and studied for his PhD at the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) (2010) where he also worked. He left work at the university in 2009 and completed his PhD in 2010. In 2010 he set up and ran Third Floor Gallery along with Joni Karanka and Bartosz Nowicki.

Dakowicz is best known for his series of photographs of Cardiff night-life titled Cardiff after Dark, also the name of his later book. Photographed over four years, photographs from the series have featured in magazines and been exhibited in galleries. Individual images from the series have also been used out of context and with misleading captions by the British tabloid media to support a single narrative about alcoholic excess. This tabloid practice has been criticised; for example, Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian that \\"Humour is the most obvious thing about his pictures, and their attraction lies in the way they balance grotesque abandon with poised, coolly beautiful lighting.\\" Sean O'Hagan said in The Guardian that \\"it is not all outrageousness and vulgarity: Dakowicz also catches the sense of camaraderie and celebration in Cardiff on a Saturday night.

A grade is separated from a place in the line hierarchy of a company, it underlines the very possibility of recognizing a person (top) level without being necessarily in a management functions. The most commonly used system of grading consultants is the following: *Associate consultant: In some fields, an associate consultant is at the beginning of their consulting career and will typically do work to support the consultants and senior consultants - data collection and analysis, workshop support, etc. An associate consultant can also refer to a day rate contractor at any level, differentiating them from an employee of the firm (e.g. associate managing consultant). However, in engineering, urban planning and some environmental consulting fields the term Associate consultant is used differently and is typically a higher grade than Principal consultant. *Consultant: A consultant is ‚Äòlearning the trade' within a specific domain of expertise. A consultant is developing in most competency dimensions and work in different roles on different projects in a specific domain. *Senior consultant: A senior consultant has developed a specialisation within a specific domain of expertise. A senior consultant is capable of working independently as well as in teams. A senior consultant is often responsible for the completion of a part of a project or activities for which he/she leads a small team. A senior consultant is more client oriented and explores sales activities. *Managing consultant: A managing consultant has started to excel in some of the competency dimensions. A managing consultant is known for domain expertise and is capable of generating his or her own work and that of others. As such the managing consultant is often responsible for business volume, through (add-on) sales and delivering a project. A managing consultant can act as a team lead or counsellor for other team members. *Senior Managing consultant: A senior managing consultant has developed excellence within some of the competency dimensions. A senior managing consultant is known for domain expertise and is capable of generating his or her own work and that of others. As such the senior managing consultant is often responsible for business volume, through (add-on) sales and delivering a project. A senior managing consultant leads a team or counsellor for other teams. *Principal consultant: A principal consultant has a strong business impact and is often part of the company's leadership. A principal consultant is capable of shaping a piece of business being the leader in a specific domain and in any other domains. A principal consultant develops high-level business relations and high-impact projects. A principal is capable of leading large teams and also generates new business ideas.

Diego Vel√°zquez, markedly inferior to Yankee in armament, managed to return to Cienfuegos, where it was joined by the small gunboats Lince and Cometa. After the appearance of the latters, Yankee decided to withdraw. Background At the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Cienfuegos was a strategically important port due to its facilities and good communications with Havana. Some prewar plans recommended its prompt capture, but instead it was blockaded, along with some other important ports of the southern coast of Cuba such as Santiago de Cuba and Manzanillo. The most powerful Spanish naval units of the island, meanwhile, had been gathered in Santiago, and submarine defenses consisting mainly of torpedoes had been installed in the major ports of Havana, Cienfuegos, Santiago and San Juan de Puerto Rico.Franco Casta√±√≥n, p. 6 The naval units based in Cienfuegos consisted of the 541-ton torpedo gunboat Galicia under Teniente de Nav√≠o de 1¬™ clase Ari√±o, the 300-ton torpedo gunboat Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa under Teniente de Nav√≠o de 1¬™ clase Izquierdo, the 318-ton torpedo gunboat Alsedo under Teniente de Nav√≠o Suences, and the 200-ton torpedo gunboat Diego Vel√°zquez under Teniente de Nav√≠o de 1¬™ clase Carranza, plus the 179-ton gunboat Contramaestre and the 43-ton small gunboats Gaviota, Cometa, Lince and Sat√©lite, commanded respectively by Tenientes de Nav√≠o Freire, Rivero, G√≥mez Aguado and Moreno Eliza.Franco Casta√±√≥n, p. 9 Various engagements were fought near Cienfuegos during the war. On 29 April the American protected cruiser Marblehead and the auxiliary Eagle exchanged fire for half an hour with the Spanish small gunboats Sat√©lite, Lince and Gaviota. On 2 May the gunboat Alcedo and the small gunboats Almendores and Gaviota escorted several transport vessels to Casilda, delivering to the town more than 3,000 men and about 800 horses and mules. A week later two small boats of Marblehead and the gunboat Nashville tried to cut telegraph cables linking Cienfuegos with Madrid. Two undersea cables were cut, but a third cable near the shore remained untouched. On 1 June a convoy of blockade runners and the transport Mar√≠a Cristina were successfully escorted into the port. Battle Teniente de Nav√≠o de 1¬™ clase Juan de Carranza, commander of Diego Vel√°zquez. On 13 June Teniente Carranza's Diego Vel√°zquez was dispatched to inspect a steamer near the port thinking that it could be El Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, a blockade runner which was expected to arrive to Cienfuegos at that time. Carranza took precautions in case the suspicious steamer proved to be an American warship. Wooden objects were left ashore, and bags of coal were emplaced around the guns to protect their crews from the American fire. The unknown steamer was USS Yankee, a 6,888-ton auxiliary cruiser under Commander Willard H. Brownson armed with 10 5-inch guns, 6 6-pound guns and two Colt machine guns. Yankee was carrying out blockade tasks off the port, and was in fact waiting for the arrival of El Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n in order to intercept it.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships At about 1,400 meters range, the American ship put her helm over, unmasked her port battery, and opened fire. Diego Vel√°zquez opted for a running fight, presenting the smallest possible target and only allowing Yankee to bring one or two of her guns to bear without turning away from her target's course. The Spanish gunboat was hit twice, receiving minor damage. A grenade entered through the starboard hawse and broke the retainers of the redbout, throwing up the parapet of coal.El Mundo Naval Ilustrado, p. 382 Another grenade pierced the hull of the cone that served as a carriage for one of the guns. Boatswain D. Jos√© Cacho Torres, cabo de mar de primera Eustaquio Bilbao, seamen Antonio Ferrer and Jos√© Gonz√°lez, and gunners Francisco Gonz√°lez and √Ångel Bermudose were injured. Diego Vel√°zquez fired 193 shots, some of which hit Yankee inflicting some casualties and causing a small fire on board which forced the gunfire to be temporarily suspended. After 69 minutes of combat, Diego Vel√°zquez reached Cienfuegos, where the wounded men were disembarked and reinforcements were requested to face Yankee, which was exchanging fire with the shore batteries of Cienfuegos. Diego Vel√°zquez exited the port shortly after accompanied by the small gunboats Lince and Cometa. According to Spanish sources, the American ship decided to withdraw from the battle at this point, and the Spanish vessels returned to Cienfuegos. According to American sources, the Spanish gunboats withdrew to Cienfuegos harbor and Yankee continued firing on Sabanilla Battery until it withdrew at 1500 hours. Teniente Carranza was acclaimed as his force re-entered the port. The fierce opposition of his gunboat confused the Americans, whose commander Willard H. Brownson believed that the ship that he was facing was the torpedo gunboat Galicia, a ship almost three times larger than Diego Vel√°zquez. El ur√≠sima Concepci√≥n eventually reached Cienfuegos without difficulties while Yankee set a course back to the eastern end of Cuba.Solar, p. 19 Aftermath The Action of 13 June 1898 was the last naval engagement fought near Cienfuegos. Land operations to capture the town, which remained open as a supply route to Havana and was the headquarters of one of the five corps in which Cuba had been divided, were recommended by the Cuban general M√°ximo G√≥mez to General William Shafer, but that plan was never carried out. The action of Cienfuegos was one of the events in which the Spanish coastguards successfully battled the American auxiliary fleet or Mosquito Squadron. At the end of the war Diego Vel√°zquez sailed to the French colony of Martinique and then back to Spain, but was eventually sold to Venezuela on 17 July 1899.Gonz√°lez, p. 246 Named Miranda, she served in the Venezuelan Navy for many years.

A kaassouffl√© is a Dutch snack of melted cheese inside a thin dough-based wrap which has been breaded and then deep- fried. Overview A kaassouffl√© is thought to be influenced by Indonesian street food called gorengan (fritter). It is either bought ready-made frozen and deep-fried at home, or ordered at snackbars in the Netherlands, where it is one of the few vegetarian fast-food snacks available. At certain Dutch fastfood outlets, such as FEBO or Smullers, it is possible to purchase a kaassouffl√© without having to order it at the counter; instead it can be had directly from an automatiek, a coin-operated vending machine. Kaassouffl√© is also a popular snack to be served at a borrel, an informal Dutch gathering with drinks and snacks (the word \\"borrel\\" originally referred to a small glass in which distilled beverages, usually jenever, is served). Typically this snack comes in two different shapes: either as a large rectangle measuring approximately 10 cm by 5 cm (4\\" by 2\\"), or shaped like a half moon of about 10 cm (5\\") in length. Smaller versions, called mini-kaassouffl√©s, are usually sold for consumption at home, or for at the aforementioned borrel where they are usually eaten as part of a bittergarnituur, a selection of snacks to go with drinks. Kaassouffl√©s are not limited to having only a Gouda-like cheese as a filling. Additional flavourings can be added to the cheese, such as ham and spinach, or it can also be made with different types of cheese. Another variety of kaassouffl√© is the oven-baked type. This is simply done by wrapping a slice of cheese, with or without additional spices, inside puff pastry and then baking it in an oven. Although the name of this snack contains the word \\"souffl√©\\", it has very little in common with a real souffl√© which, indeed, can contain cheese and can therefore also be called a kaassouffl√© in the Dutch language.  Consumption practices  A kaassouffl√© is usually eaten on its own, with mustard, mayonnaise, regular ketchup, or curried ketchup. A broodje kaassouffl√© is the snack served in a bun.

It is serves part of Leith, formerly an independent burgh and since 1920 a part of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. Building The portico at North Leith Parish Church The current building in Madeira Street (at the junction with Prince Regent Street), Leith, was designed by the architect William Burn and was completed in 1816. It has a notable neo- classical portico (with four large Ionic columns), above which is a clock tower surmounted by a slender spire. A pipe organ (by Wadsworth of Manchester) was added in 1880. The building was damaged by bombing during World War II (in 1941), but was repaired by 1950. It is a category A listed building. The church was designed to accommodate 1300 people.1854 OS map William Burn was also responsible for several other notable buildings in Edinburgh, including the Edinburgh Academy and John Watson's College (now the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art). The associated manse (presumably also by Burn) and known as \\"Leith Mount\\", stood on a substantial plot to the south-east of the church, on Ferry Road. The manse and its gardens and orchards were removed in 1920 to provide the site for Leith Theatre.OS maps 1845 to 1945 History St Ninian's Manse incorporates the tower of the 17th-century former parish church The church connection dates to 1128, when King David I of Scotland granted lands for the construction of Holyrood Abbey. In 1493 Robert Bellenden, Abbot of Holyrood, built St Ninian's Chapel on the north-west bank of the Water of Leith, on lands owned by the Abbey. The small chapel was subsequently rebuilt after the Reformation. The replacement church opened in 1586, and later became the parish church of North Leith, which was created a quoad omnia parish, i.e. a civil and sacred parish, by a resolution of the Parliament of Scotland in 1606. A Dutch-style tower was added in 1675. The discovery of rot in this building in the 18th century led to extensive renovation and the construction of galleries within the building, but the church remained too small for the congregation, leading to its replacement by the current building in 1816 (then in fields just outside the built-up part of Leith). The Dutch-style tower of the old church still stands, although it was later incorporated into a mill. In the old churchyard of St.Ninians stands the altar tomb of Thomas Gladstones (1732 - 1809), a prosperous Leith merchant, and the grandfather of the famous Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. Thomas Gladstones was a church elder for the 'Hill' district of Leith for over 40 years.Russell, John, The Story of Leith, Edinburgh, 1922, p.177. At the point of the Disruption of 1843 North Leith parish was \\"vacant\\" (having no fixed minister) which seemed an encouragement to many to leave. North Leith Free Church was built on the corner of Coburg Street and North Junction Street, east of the church. 600 members of the congregation left, together with all the elders. The first minister was Rev William MacKenzie. The church could hold 1000 people. In 1857 Rev Robert MacDonald replaced MacKenzie. He organised the building of a magnificent new free church on Ferry Road, south of the original church. This was completed in 1859 and could hold 1100 people. The 1844 site was redeveloped as tenements. The 1859 church was demolished in 1981. A datestone was salvaged and re-used in the current church halls. North Leith Free Church no longer exists in any form. Rev Robert MacDonald served as Moderator of the General Assembly for the Free Church in 1882.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church North Leith Parish Church united with Bonnington Church in 1968, creating Leith North & Bonnington Church (using the Madeira Street building). In 1982, Leith North & Bonnington Church further united with Leith St Ninian's Ferry Road Church, creating the current congregation with the historic name North Leith Parish Church. Parish The parish largely consists of the north-west part of Leith, including the Fort housing scheme, Leith Docks, including the Ocean Terminal shopping centre, the Royal Yacht Britannia and the Scottish Government offices at Victoria Quay. Ministry A greatly loved cleric, Dr. David Johnston, was minister of St.Ninians from 1765 until 1824, some 59 years.Russell, p.177. Dr. Johnston was succeeded by his long-time assistant, The Rev. Dr. Walter Foggo Ireland, who died four years later in 1828. Both ministers are buried in the old churchyard of St.Ninians.

History  The Dortmund-Gronau-Enschede Railway Company (, DGE) began to build its line from Dortmund DGE station (later called Dortmund East station) to the east of the central city. As a result, its line had to cross the original Dortmund‚ÄìHamm trunk line of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, CME). The first section to L√ºnen Nord station was opened on 25 November 1874 for passenger trains; the first goods trains ran a week later. Six months later, the line reached Dulmen, where it crossed the Wanne- Eickel‚ÄìHamburg line (also a CME line) to reach D√ºlmen DGE station (later called D√ºlmen Ost (east) station), which was located north-west of the CME station. The other parts of the line were opened at short intervals after each other. It reached Coesfeld on 1 August 1875 and Gronau on 30 September 1875, when the M√ºnster‚ÄìEnschede line of the Royal Westphalian Railway Company (KWE) was also opened to the station. The last section to Enschede in the Netherlands was built in cooperation with the KWE and opened on 15 October 1875 and subsequently operated jointly. With the opening of Duisburg‚ÄìQuakenbr√ºck railway by the Rhenish Railway Company four years later, Coesfeld station became an interchange station. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Empel-Rees‚ÄìM√ºnster line (the eastern part of which is called the Baumberge Railway) was opened, which also intersected at Coesfelder Station, making it the major railway junction of western M√ºnsterland. Temporary closure  The Gronau‚ÄìEnschede section was closed on 27 September 1981 for passenger and freight services. After lengthy negotiations, the cross-border passenger services were resumed in 2001. Current situation  The section from Dortmund to L√ºnen is double track, electrified and classified as a main line. The section from L√ºnen to the border at Gronau is single track, non- electrified and has been classified as a branch line since 2007. This section is operated as part of Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs M√ºnster-Westphalia Regional Network, based in Munster. Operations  The route is now served hourly by the RB 51 (Westm√ºnsterland-Bahn) Regionalbahn service. Trains pass each other in L√ºdinghausen, Coesfeld and Epe. Because of the single-track, services operating in the opposite direction and departing on the symmetry minute delay services by several minutes. RB 50 (Der L√ºner) also runs hourly between Dortmund and L√ºnen towards M√ºnster.

Mostly known in France, Italy and the US for his work-in-progress about angels, he is also active in publishing, theatre, music, cinema and advertising. He specialises in black-and-white portraits, for which he has won several prizes; his most acclaimed works include live performances of Corrado Rustici, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Ute Lemper. Personal expositions of his pictures have taken place in Milan, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Avignon, Chicago, Montreal and Toronto.  Biography  Born in Genoa, Italy, 11 March 1961, of a middle-class family, Terrile shows a strong interest in the figurative arts since he is a child. His years until a teenager are spent in his home town, located on the sea and a prominent port of the Mediterranean, and Iola di Montese, a small village in the Apennine Mountains at the border of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna, where Terrile's family has a countryhouse. The stark cultural and human contrast between the two places lies at the heart of his later artistic development; it is also probably at this time that Terrile develops his love for wild, uncontaminated nature (especially woods and mountains) and solitude ‚Äì an attitude which is clearly visible throughout his work as a photographer. = Early years and education = Fluttuare, parte II (\\"To float, part 2\\"), 1979 At the age of 14 Terrile enters the Artistic High School Nicol√≤ Barabino of Genoa, officially as an apprentice painter. His natural attitude to painting and arts in general is not apparent, at least to his teachers, to the extent that in his first year he is suggested to move away from the artistic career and \\"find a good job instead.\\"reportedly, Terrile tells this story at the beginning of his own photography course, every year. He actually never mentions the name of the teacher who tried to discourage him. Nevertheless, after the high school and with the support of his parents, Terrile enters the Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti (Ligurian Academy of Fine Arts) in Genoa, where he further pursues his interests in visual arts and music. A portrait of the sculptor Lorenzo Garaventa, 1985 At the Academy, Terrile uses his fellow coursemates as models. The general atmosphere of rebellion against the rules and the desire to experiment lead him to realise, among others, a series of colour portraits shot in low key, almost monochromatic, but with overtly red lips or blue eyes. Bodies and faces are crammed into a single frame as if immersed in water or boxed in a fish tank. The set called Fluttuare (\\"To float\\") is a good example of his early style. In these years his activity is extremely heterogeneous, ranging from analytic painting (a branch of abstract painting) to pop music and colour photography; among his early works, of remarkable value are Calligrafie (\\"Callygraphies\\"), Tracce (\\"Traces\\") and Segni (\\"Signs\\"), three series of portraits realised from 1977 to 1979 on large vertical surfaces, tape rolls, in video or with other heterogeneous materials. These series are finally collected in a work called Quelle improbabili immagini (\\"Those unlikely images\\") exposed in Genoa, Grosseto, Cosenza, Bari. In 1979‚Äì1980 he also writes an experimental score for alto sax for the contemporary composer Luca Barbieri-Viale called Cromofonie. The score will be played in Genoa, Milan and Certaldo, near Florence.Il Buongiorno, July/August 1983. = Apprenticeship in Milan = Live performance of Ute Lemper during the Illusion tour, 1992 By 1984, after successfully completing the Accademia, Terrile has found his way into photography and starts an apprenticeship in Milan, as the third assistant of Paolo Gandola, then a young but already renowned fashion photographer. During the 80s Milan develops its character as the Italian capital of fashion and finance; money becomes more and more the main engine of human relationships and corruption spreads at all levels of the local government. Not incidentally these years mark the rise of Silvio Berlusconi as a building and television entrepreneur. In a then famous commercial ad of the Ramazzotti liqueur, Milan is dubbed ' (\\"the Milan you can drink\\") with reference to the endless possibilities offered by the rampant capitalism, a lifestyle akin to that of the US, and so far unknown in Italy. Terrile's time in Milan is anything but an easy one. His simple, almost na√Øve attitude to life and people, and his total disregard of money, do not match the high style of the city. Terrile has little or nothing to do with Milano da bere, and after a few years he is back to Genoa. The remarkable technical teachings of Gandola are all he is left with, plus a sheer rejection of fashion photography and all that revolves around it. In an interview shortly after his coming back, he says, not without a certain pride: \\"I find it unbearable that just four or five big photographers are freely allowed to give their vision of things [...] no more American faces! [...] beauty can as well be found on a bus, you need not look for it in Los Angeles or London.\\" In the same interview Terrile declares his love for cinema, which is just about to start shaping his style forever. Although he is only 25 years old, his artistic vision is already clear: \\"Cinema is, for me, Truffaut, Arthur Penn, Altman, Wenders [...] Randomness is a relatively important component of my works, but it is always under strict control [...] A photographer is always an artist and a craftsman at the same time.\\"in Il Lavoro, 15 June 1986. This last statement denotes the will to overcome the well-known problem every artist has to face in the beginning, namely that art does not pay. As a matter of fact, from 1985 on Terrile will be living off his activity as a pro photographer. = Artistic maturity = In moschea (\\"In the mosque\\"), Baghdad, Iraq, 1993 Terrile's return to Genoa marks the beginning of an all-round photographic activity. During these years he keeps in close touch with the vibrant artistic underground scene of Genoa. He attends artists of all sorts also outside the Academy; in particular, he develops a close friendship with the sculptor Lorenzo Garaventa. While in Garaventa's workshop, Terrile shoots a number of portraits of the artist himself, obtaining one of his most remarkable early pictures (1985). Particularly evident in this work is the use of natural light (in this case, coming from above) and the violent, sort-of expressionistic use of contrast obtained in the camera obscura. (An almost manic attention to printing is one of the long-standing traits of his work;see, for instance, Ferruccio Giromini, La gelida sensualit√† di Alberto Terrile (\\"Alberto Terrile's chilly sensuality\\") in Blue nr. 89, 1998. Terrile has many a time acknowledged Stefano Grondona for teaching him his printing skills.) A portrait of the movie director Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski at the Venice Film Festival, 1994 His commercial activity is initially deeply interwoven with music, especially live and studio performances. The list of artists he cooperates with includes at least Pierangelo Bertoli, Ren√© Aubry, , and Bob Wilber. Terrile also specialises in album and book covers, establishing links with the major Italian book editors (, , Mondadori, Costa&Nolan;). As a freelance photographer his works appear on Le Monde, Diario della settimana, Glamour, Frigidaire, World Music. Live performance, in whatever artistic field and in natural light, becomes one of Terrile's favourite subjects, leading him to shoot, among others, Corrado Rustici and Dee Dee Bridgewater. His probably best known portrait-in-action is that of Ute Lemper taken during the Illusion tour in 1992, with the choreography by . In 1993 Terrile is in Baghdad, Iraq to document the people's condition in the embargo-starved country, two years after the first Gulf war.Guido Festinese, Uno scatto da Genova a Babilonia (\\"A snapshot from Genoa to Babylon\\") in Il Lavoro, 10 October 1993. His style fully develops in this time, to the extent that he is awarded the Best Portrait of the Year prize by the magazine Progresso fotografico in 1989referenced in Progresso fotografico (\\"Photographic progress\\"), April 1989. and the Kodak European Gold Award in 1994 and 1995.reported in Italy, e.g., in Il fotografo professionista (\\"The professional photographer\\"), June 1994 and June 1995. In the same years he is one of the official photographers of the Venice Film Festival, an event which enables him to shoot some of his favourite cinematographers and actors, such as Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski, Chazz Palminteri and Robert Altman. A complete exhibition of these pictures will eventually appear in a personal exhibition in Milan in 2000, ideally reconciling the city and the artist.see, for instance, Roberto Di Perna, Divi e divine 'scattati' da Alberto Terrile (\\"Stars and goddesses shot by Alberto Terrile\\") in Il Secolo XIX, October 2000. = Experimental works; teaching = A portrait of Pasquale Montemurro from the series Dalla miniera, 2010 Terrile has kept on experimenting with non-standard techniques and materials, probably reminiscent of his early years at the academy. One notable example is the print of one of his pictures on light marble. According to Terrile himself, the negative was first printed on AGFA Record Rapid paper (at that time already out of production), then digitally acquired and plotted on a marble slab using a Durst Rho 205 special plotter. \\"After two trials on marble\\" Terrile says \\"I decided to raise the highlights, so that the natural grain of the marble would shine through and give an original volume to the model's white dress, with the effect of enhancing the sculptorial quality of my image.\\"see the catalogue of Fare Arte 2004, Disegnare il marmo ‚Äì drawing marble, Hopefulmonster publishers, 2005. The final result was part of an exhibition of marble sculptures held in 2004 in Carrara, Italy. Very unusual subjects, as well as a surrealistic use of post-production (in digital form too) and/or weird settings characterise some of his later production. Among the most original works, a set of portraits of disabled persons and their inner world based upon Alice in Wonderland, and a remarkable series of hyper- realistic digital portraits called Dalla miniera (\\"From the mine\\"). One of the most interesting pictures in this series depicts Pasquale Montemurro, a former pupil and assistant to Terrile, while squeezing his own head between his hands in resignment or desperation, a feeling elicited using violent contrast on the scalp. As opposed to this, the model's look is somehow serene. Montemurro, at the time also a close friend of Terrile, died of cancer in 2010 at the age of 45, a few months after the picture was taken. In recent times Terrile has also developed an interest in industrial architecture and abandoned buildings. Genoa, formerly a town of heavy industries and steel production now undergoing a somehow traumatic conversion, is a perfect location for this. The Cornigliano steel plant, recently shut down, and the Hennebique building, once a grain deposit of the harbour now home to junkies and tramps, are examples of this trend. In settings such as these Terrile and his pupils have portrayed a number of dressed up characters, creating an alienating semantic contrast. Terrile is also very active in teaching and dissemination. Since 2000 he has held yearly basic- and advanced-level photography courses, usually transferring to the advanced level some of the pupils of the basic courses. The advanced courses have therefore kept on accumulating new people, knowledge and experience ‚Äì Terrile usually employs his pupils in his own professional activity ‚Äì so that they represent nowadays a small but active community of amateur photographers in Genoa.Lucia Compagnino, Il volto della citt√† nel ritratto di duemila genovesi (\\"The face of the city in the portraits of 2000 Genovese\\") in Il Secolo XIX, March 2010. In 2007 Terrile founded a non-profit society called Percorsi magici (\\"Magic paths\\"), devoted to the organisation of the courses, as well as of exhibitions, lectures, conferences and workshops. Terrile's teaching style is reported to be extremely informal and non- technical but highly practical. = Nel segno dell'angelo = Angel No. 30 Francesca S., 1994 Since his childhood, Terrile is admittedly fascinated by magic, exoterism and, in general, what is not visible ‚Äì a very peculiar attitude for a photographer. This is, in general, the main drive to his somehow somber, hyper-contrasted black-and-white style, mostly realised on film and in large format (e.g., with old-style Hasselblad cameras). It is during a particularly hard time spent in Paris in 1993, namely in a bar while drinking,Sous le signe de l'Ange (\\"Under the sign of the angel\\"), Petit Palais Editions, Avignon, France, 1998. that he fully realises the importance of time in photography. Using a very fast time (1/500th of a second) he enforces a logical paradox: to photograph what cannot be photographed, an instant which the human eye cannot fully appreciate. This is the theoretical basis of his work-in-progress Nel segno dell'angelo (\\"In the sign of the angel\\"), a series of highly stylised portraits of people framed in the act of jumping. Angel No. 40 Arbalete, 1996 Terrile's angels are common men and women, alone, in couples or in groups. They can be surrounded by a threatening, dark sky or placed in a relaxed garden-like atmosphere. Stark contrast is usually employed to generate a sort of aura around the subject. The act of jumping is framed exactly at that peculiar moment when vertical velocity is nil, leaving the spectator with the illusion of a still frame, an impossible pose. (As a matter of fact, Terrile's angels look at first sight as carefully contrived photomontage.) Terrile's angels admittedly echo the imaginative world of Wim Wenders's Wings of desire (\\"Der Himmel √ºber Berlin\\", 1987), in turn inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's poems, and co-authored by Peter Handke. Nel segno dell'angelo spawns more than three decades, the first attempts dating back to 1979 (the very pictures Fluttuare can be considered early angels)Interrotti transiti, edited by Fabrizio Boggiano, Genoa, Italy, 2008. and is currently an ongoing work ‚Äì on average, Terrile has been shooting one angel every year. Traces and critical reviews of this work are found in some of the major photography magazines around the world (see the section about critical evaluation) and the related pictures have appeared, altogether or in batches, in exhibitions in Berlin, Avignon, Genoa, Milan.

Previously known as MonteVideo, the institute was founded in 1978 by Ren√© Coelho as one of the first Dutch exhibition spaces and production facilities for artists working and experimenting with art and new technologies. Nowadays NIMk plays a role in exhibiting, disseminating and researching new technologies in media art. Its catalogue comprises more than 2000 works, ranging from installations, video performances, software-based and internet art, from recognised international artists such as: Marina Abramoviƒá, Gary Hill, Juan Downey, Dennis Oppenheim, Marcel Odenbach. Also a large collection of Dutch artists' works and documentation of performances can be viewed in its mediatheque, among them are Livinus van de Bundt, Bill Spinhoven, Bert Schutter, Han Hoogerbrugge, Bas Jan Ader, Daniel Brun, Guido van der Werve and Erwin Olaf.http://catalogue.nimk.nl/ In front of Netherlands Institute of Media Art - 2010 Main areas =Presentation= NIMk has 4 exhibitions per year with Dutch and international artists working with video, film, Internet and other technological media.http://www.nimk.nl This is to promote new and upcoming artists as well as established artists. The presentation of media art also come in the form of symposiums, screenings and live performances of image and sound. Most events are within NIMks own facilities, but also in collaboration with other institutions and venues. =Research= NIMk supports artists researching into the use of new media in the visual arts by a programme called The Artist in Residence (AiR). The programme provides a residing artist with a studio, technical support and exhibition equipment to create new work. Some of the former and current artists in residence are : Dave Griffiths, Aymeric Mansoux and Marloes de Valk, Sonia Cillari, Knowbotic Research, Esther Polak, Linda Hilfling, Lilia Perez Romero, Chris Ziegler, Rob Davis & Usman Haque, Blender, Linda Wallace, Simon Yuill, Jaromil, Kelli Dipple, Adam Hyde, Marjorieke Glaudemans & Karen Lancel, Stansfield/Hooykaas. NIMk also does research in documentation and preservation of media art. One project is the digitisation of video art work in collaboration with the Foundation for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (SBMK) and Virtueel Platform (VP). Between the years 2004 and 2007 NIMk participated in an international research project concerning preservation and documentation of installations called Inside Installations,http://www.inside-installations.org from 2007 to 2010 it led the European project \\"Gateways to Archives of Media Art\\" (GAMA) providing access to a wealth of information about the works of both well-known and emerging artists from European collections of media art.http://www.gama-gateway.eu/ =Collection= The Mediatheque, here works can be viewed from the catalogue - 2010 NIMk has built up an extensive collection of video and media art for the last 30 years which constitutes one of the largest video art collections in Europe. The video collection consists of a distribution and a documentation collection, which are both available in the Mediatheque at NIMk. The catalogue is published online, with short excerpts of most of the works. This way the NIMk seeks to promote media art to a wider audience. The distribution collection comprises more than 2000 works; varying form the earliest experiments through recent productions. These works are lend out for a wide range of purposes, like international and national festivals, exhibitions at various art institutions and for educational use. The distribution department presents video art, media art and installations to professionals and they organise and facilitate presentations of works from the collection. NIMk also maintains the collections of the Appel Foundation (De Appel), the former Lijnbaan Center in Rotterdam and the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN). History What was going to become NIMk, started out as MonteVideo, founded in 1978 by Ren√© Coelho a former camera man.Boomgaard, J. & Rutten, B.. The Magnetic Era. Video Art in the Netherlands 1970-1985. NAi Publishers, Rotterdam 2003. Ren√© Coelho made an exhibition space in his own home as well as equipment and documentation available for artists. In 1983 MonteVideo moved to a bigger space in Amsterdam North and was now showing works of international as well as Dutch artists. The first artist to exhibit was Livinus van de Bundt. Later followed by artists such as Bert Schutter, Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Shelly Silver. MonteVideos collection of contemporary art kept growing into a large collection of works, which was rented out. Another organisation for new media art was founded that year, by Association of Video Artists, called Time Based Arts. For some time MonteVideo and Time Based Arts where competing against each other to get recognition and funding. From 1986 to 1993 Monte Videos government funding was reduced and Ren√© Co√´lho continued on his own. During this period the exhibition of Dutch media art \\"Imago\\" toured worldwide. In the meantime the death of Aart van Barneveld, the director of Time Based Arts, was followed by a lot of conflicts in between the associated artists in Time Based Arts, which almost resulted in the collapse of the organisation. But in 1990 Montevideo and Time based Arts decided to collaborate on a joint art program for Amsterdam cable TV called channel zero. The two organisations ended up merging in 1993 and became what it is today, Netherlands Media Art Institute.

It is set in 42 acres of parkland, 34 miles south-west of London and adjacent to the A3, which runs between the capital and the south coast. Current ratings The school was founded in 1902 with seven pupils. Today 440 pupils aged 11 to 18 attend Prior's Field, with a third of UK and foreign students boarding on a full, weekly or flexible basis. The Headteacher is Mrs Tracy Kirnig, who joined in 2015 from Caterham School, Surrey and is the school's 11th head. In its most recent report, the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) awarded Prior's Field its top rating ‚Äì excellent ‚Äì across all categories of inspection, including quality of achievement, teaching, pastoral care, boarding and links with parents. Prior's Field pupils typically take 9 GCSEs in Year 11 and have a choice of 24 A-levels in the Sixth Form. In 2016, at A-level, 15 per cent of girls achieved A* grades, 76 per cent A-B grades and the pass rate was 100 per cent. At GCSE, 28 per cent gained A* grades, 55 per cent A*-A and 79 per cent A*‚ÄìB. Students participate in over 40 termly clubs, including silversmithing, philosophy, riding, chess and debating. A supportive university application process ensures that girls move to higher education, the majority to Russell Group universities. History Prior's Field School opened on 23 January 1902. It was founded by Julia Huxley, who was the mother of Julian Huxley and Aldous Huxley, niece of the poet Matthew Arnold and granddaughter of Dr Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School, immortalised in the novel Tom Brown's Schooldays. The Huxley Family is interesting historically for achievements across the fields of science, medicine, literature and education. Julian Huxley became a biologist, the first Director of UNESCO and a founder member of the World Wildlife Fund. Aldous Huxley was the author of Brave New World (1932).Prior's Field School - A Century Remembered 1902-2002 by Margaret Elliott, published by Prior's Field School Trust Ltd, W. B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and Lewis Carroll were family friends. The school motto, \\"We live by Admiration, Hope and Love,\\" is from The Excursion by William Wordsworth. Starting with a five-acre (2 ha) plot and a moderately sized house designed by C.F.A. Voysey, Julia Huxley opened her school with one boarder, five day girls, a wire-haired terrier and her -year-old son, Aldous. Julia Huxley was married to Leonard Huxley, a biographer and writer and former assistant master at Charterhouse School. She died in 1908 at the age of 46, after only six years as Headmistress, and was succeeded by Mrs Ethel Burton-Brown, who was Head from 1908 to 1927. The school magazine first appeared in June 1908, by which time there were 85 pupils and 86 Old Girls. Both Julia Huxley and Ethel Burton-Brown are buried in Compton Cemetery, the grave of the latter being designed by Mary Watts, wife of the painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts (1817‚Äì1904). Architecture Voysey Air Vent depicting Birds and Trees Motif Prior's Field, originally called Prior's Garth, was designed by prominent English Arts and Crafts movement architect C.F.A. Voysey. The house has been Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England since May 1985. Many of Voysey's original features ‚Äì stylised keyholes, door handles, air vents, and fireplaces ‚Äì can still be seen in the school today, for instance in the Oak Hall, the Senior Common Room and the Bursary offices. The additions to the original house ‚Äì formerly known as Private Side ‚Äì were designed by Voysey's pupil, Tom Muntzer. =Garden inspired by Gertrude Jekyll= The design of Prior's Field's rose garden was created by Leonard Huxley in collaboration with Gertrude Jekyll. It includes herbaceous borders, dry Bargate stone walls, a dipping pond and rock garden. In the early years, the care of the gardens was in the hands of lady gardeners trained at Swanley Horticultural College. =Prior's Field Centenary and 110th Anniversary= To mark the school's centenary in 2002, a ¬£1.2 million sports hall was built. Designed in the style of Voysey and named the Centenary Sports Hall, it was opened by the physiologist and biophysicist Andrew Huxley, the recipient of the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and younger son of Leonard Huxley by his second marriage to Rosalind Bruce. The 110th anniversary of Prior's Field's foundation was marked in 2012 by a service in Guildford Cathedral, construction of an all-weather sports pitch opened by the British Olympian hockey player Crista Cullen, and the annual Huxley Lecture in memory of the school's founder, delivered by the scientist and academic Susan Greenfield in November. In September 2013 the actress Diana Rigg opened a new three-storey teaching centre, siting the Creative Arts subjects in one area, providing six additional classrooms, a new school entrance and facilities for maths and modern languages.

Many data-driven stories begin with newly available resources such as open source software, open access publishing and open data, while others are products of public records requests or leaked materials. This approach to journalism builds on older practices, most notably on computer-assisted reporting (CAR) a label used mainly in the US for decades. Other labels for partially similar approaches are \\"precision journalism\\", based on a book by Philipp Meyer, published in 1972, where he advocated the use of techniques from social sciences in researching stories. Data-driven journalism has a wider approach. At the core the process builds on the growing availability of open data that is freely available online and analyzed with open source tools.Lorenz, Mirko (2010) Data driven journalism: What is there to learn? Edited conference documentation, based on presentations of participants, 24 August 2010, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Data-driven journalism strives to reach new levels of service for the public, helping the general public or specific groups or individuals to understand patterns and make decisions based on the findings. As such, data driven journalism might help to put journalists into a role relevant for society in a new way. Since the introduction of the concept a number of media companies have created \\"data teams\\" which develop visualizations for newsrooms. Most notable are teams e.g. at Reuters, Pro Publica, and La Nacion (Argentina). In Europe, The Guardian and Berliner Morgenpost have very productive teams, as well as public broadcasters. As projects like the MP expense scandal (2009) and the 2013 release of the \\"offshore leaks\\" demonstrate, data-driven journalism can assume an investigative role, dealing with \\"not-so open\\" aka secret data on occasion. The annual Data Journalism Awards recognize outstanding reporting in the field of data journalism, and numerous Pulitzer Prizes in recent years have been awarded to data-driven storytelling, including the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting and the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in Public Service Definitions The data-driven journalism process. According to architect and multimedia journalist Mirko Lorenz, data- driven journalism is primarily a workflow that consists of the following elements: digging deep into data by scraping, cleansing and structuring it, filtering by mining for specific, visualizing and making a story.Lorenz, Mirko. (2010). Data driven journalism: What is there to learn? Presented at IJ-7 Innovation Journalism Conference, 7‚Äì9 June 2010, Stanford, CA This process can be extended to provide results that cater to individual interests and the broader public. Data journalism trainer and writer Paul Bradshaw describes the process of data-driven journalism in a similar manner: data must be found, which may require specialized skills like MySQL or Python, then interrogated, for which understanding of jargon and statistics is necessary, and finally visualized and mashed with the aid of open-source tools.Bradshaw, Paul (1 October 2010). How to be a data journalist. The Guardian A more results-driven definition comes from data reporter and web strategist Henk van Ess (2012).van Ess, Henk. (2012). Gory of data driven journalism \\"Data-driven journalism enables reporters to tell untold stories, find new angles or complete stories via a workflow of finding, processing and presenting significant amounts of data (in any given form) with or without open tools.\\" Van Ess claims that some of the data-driven workflow leads to products that \\"are not in orbit with the laws of good story telling\\" because the result emphases on showing the problem, not explaining the problem. \\"A good data driven production has different layers. It allows you to find personalized that are only important for you, by drilling down to relevant but also enables you to zoom out to get the big picture\\". In 2013, Van Ess came with a shorter definition in van Ess, Henk. (2013). Handboek Datajournalistiek that doesn't involve visualisation per se: \\"Data journalism is journalism based on data that has to be processed first with tools before a relevant story is possible.\\" Reporting based on data Telling stories based on the data is the primary goal. The findings from data can be transformed into any form of journalistic writing. Visualizations can be used to create a clear understanding of a complex situation. Furthermore, elements of storytelling can be used to illustrate what the findings actually mean, from the perspective of someone who is affected by a development. This connection between data and story can be viewed as a \\"new arc\\" trying to span the gap between developments that are relevant, but poorly understood, to a story that is verifiable, trustworthy, relevant and easy to remember. Data quality In many investigations the data that can be found might have omissions or is misleading. As one layer of data-driven journalism a critical examination of the data quality is important. In other cases the data might not be public or is not in the right format for further analysis, e.g. is only available in a PDF. Here the process of data-driven journalism can turn into stories about data quality or refusals to provide the data by institutions. As the practice as a whole is in early development steps, examinations of data sources, data sets, data quality and data format are therefore an equally important part of this work. =Data-driven journalism and the value of trust= Based on the perspective of looking deeper into facts and drivers of events, there is a suggested change in media strategies: In this view the idea is to move \\"from attention to trust\\". The creation of attention, which has been a pillar of media business models has lost its relevance because reports of new events are often faster distributed via new platforms such as Twitter than through traditional media channels. On the other hand, trust can be understood as a scarce resource. While distributing information is much easier and faster via the web, the abundance of offerings creates costs to verify and check the content of any story create an opportunity. The view to transform media companies into trusted data hubs has been described in an article cross- published in February 2011 on Owni.euMedia Companies Must Become Trusted Data Hubs ¬ª OWNI.eu, News, Augmented . Owni.eu (2011-02-28). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. and Nieman Lab.Voices: News organizations must become hubs of trusted data in a market seeking (and valuing) trust ¬ª Nieman Journalism Lab. Niemanlab.org (2013-08-09). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. Process of data-driven journalism The process to transform raw data into stories is akin to a refinement and transformation. The main goal is to extract information recipients can act upon. The task of a data journalist is to extract what is hidden. This approach can be applied to almost any context, such as finances, health, environment or other areas of public interest. = Inverted pyramid of data journalism = In 2011, Paul Bradshaw introduced a model, he called \\"The Inverted Pyramid of Data Journalism\\". = Steps of the process = In order to achieve this, the process should be split up into several steps. While the steps leading to results can differ, a basic distinction can be made by looking at six phases: # Find: Searching for data on the web # Clean: Process to filter and transform data, preparation for visualization # Visualize: Displaying the pattern, either as a static or animated visual # Publish: Integrating the visuals, attaching data to stories # Distribute: Enabling access on a variety of devices, such as the web, tablets and mobile # Measure: Tracking usage of data stories over time and across the spectrum of uses. = Description of the steps =  Finding data  Data can be obtained directly from governmental databases such as data.gov, data.gov.uk and World Bank Data API but also by placing Freedom of Information requests to government agencies; some requests are made and aggregated on websites like the UK's What Do They Know. While there is a worldwide trend towards opening data, there are national differences as to what extent that information is freely available in usable formats. If the data is in a webpage, scrapers are used to generate a spreadsheet. Examples of scrapers are: Import.io, ScraperWiki, OutWit Hub and Needlebase (retired in 2012). In other cases OCR software can be used to get data from PDFs. Data can also be created by the public through crowd sourcing, as shown in March 2012 at the Datajournalism Conference in Hamburg by Henk van Ess.Crowdsourcing: how to find a crowd (Presented at ARD/ZDF Academy in. Slideshare.net (2010-09-17). Retrieved on 2013-08-16.  Cleaning data  Usually data is not in a format that is easy to visualize. Examples are that there are too many data points or that the rows and columns need to be sorted differently. Another issue is that once investigated many datasets need to be cleaned, structured and transformed. Various tools like Google Refine (open source), Data Wrangler and Google Spreadsheets allow uploading, extracting or formatting data.  Visualizing data  To visualize data in the form of graphs and charts, applications such as Many Eyes or Tableau Public are available. Yahoo! Pipes and Open Heat Map are examples of tools that enable the creation of maps based on data spreadsheets. The number of options and platforms is expanding. Some new offerings provide options to search, display and embed data, an example being Timetric. To create meaningful and relevant visualizations, journalists use a growing number of tools. There are by now, several descriptions what to look for and how to do it. Most notable published articles are: * Joel Gunter: \\"#ijf11: Lessons in data journalism from the New York Times\\" * Steve Myers: \\"Using Data Visualization as a Reporting Tool Can Reveal Story‚Äôs Shape\\", including a link to a tutorial by Sarah Cohen As of 2011, the use of HTML 5 libraries using the canvas tag is gaining in popularity. There are numerous libraries enabling to graph data in a growing variety of forms. One example is RGraph. As of 2011 there is a growing list of JavaScript libraries allowing to visualize data. JavaScript libraries Publishing data story There are different options to publish data and visualizations. A basic approach is to attach the data to single stories, similar to embedding web videos. More advanced concepts allow to create single dossiers, e.g. to display a number of visualizations, articles and links to the data on one page. Often such specials have to be coded individually, as many Content Management Systems are designed to display single posts based on the date of publication. Distributing data Providing access to existing data is another phase, which is gaining importance. Think of the sites as \\"marketplaces\\" (commercial or not), where datasets can be found easily by others. Especially of the insights for an article where gained from Open Data, journalists should provide a link to the data they used for others to investigate (potentially starting another cycle of interrogation, leading to new insights). Providing access to data and enabling groups to discuss what information could be extracted is the main idea behind Buzzdata, a site using the concepts of social media such as sharing and following to create a community for data investigations. Other platforms (which can be used both to gather or to distribute data): * Help Me Investigate (created by Paul Bradshaw) * Timetric * ScraperWiki Measuring the impact of data stories A final step of the process is to measure how often a dataset or visualization is viewed. In the context of data-driven journalism, the extent of such tracking, such as collecting user data or any other information that could be used for marketing reasons or other uses beyond the control of the user, should be viewed as problematic. One newer, non-intrusive option to measure usage is a lightweight tracker called PixelPing. The tracker is the result of a project by ProPublica and DocumentCloud.Larson, Jeff. (2010-09-08) Pixel Ping: A node.js Stats Tracker. ProPublica. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. There is a corresponding service to collect the data. The software is open source and can be downloaded via GitHub.documentcloud/pixel-ping √ÇÀá GitHub. Github.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.

The temple is popularly known as Sankaranayinarkoil (or Sankarankovil) and she is the consort of vanmikanathar and seen along with sankaranarayanar(the unification of shiva and vishnu). This temple is 900 years old and was built by Ukkira Pandian (Tamil:‡Æâ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ∞ ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Øç) a king from Pandiya dynasty. Adi Thabasu is very famous festival celebrated there every year.http://property.tnhrce.org/magazine/pdf/e-book_november_2015.pdf Story The goddesses is a yogini who was performing her penance on the tip of the needle to please lord Shiva and merge with him. Two snake kings namely \\"sangan\\" and \\"padman\\". Sangan was worshipping lord shiva and padman was worshipping lord narayana. One day they had a quarrel on who is great whether lord shiva, the destroyer or narayana, the protector. They were trying to prove their own power and finally went to the yogini and pleaded her to give them a proper judgement. The yogini grew out of her grace pleaded the almighty to show his universality form so that not only the snake kings but also for every human being. By the intense penance lord shiva appears before the yogini in the form of half shiva and half vishnu showing the world that they are equal and it is with love and sacrifice they could reach them. Hence sangan and padman worshipped the lord and prayed to the yogini for showing them a way to attain the god and they stayed with her. the yogini was none other than goddesses gomathi. Gomathi means repository of wealth. Since the snakes stayed with the goddesses, this place is free from all venomous creatures and praying to this goddesses can eliminate the fear of venom. One of the 18 siddhas, the great pambatti siddhar worshipped this goddesses as valai kumari and he regarded this goddesses to be the great serpent power which can make miracles in taking aspirant in yogic transformation. Pambatti siddhar samadhi is seen behind the temple. Chakra Peetam and Aadi Thapasu There is a circular hole in front of the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Goddess with a design of Sri Chakra inside it. There is a popular belief that any one afflicted with mental disorder worships the deity sitting on the hole will be cured of the disease. \\"Aadi Thapasu\\" is one of the important festivals of Gomathi amman celebrated in the Tamil month of Aadi in a grand scale. The story on this: Sri Gomathi Ambal did Thapas at Punnai kshetra and Lord Shiva gave Her darshan as Sankaranarayanaswamy on the Uthirada day in the month of Adi (July‚ÄìAugust) and thereby indicating that God Shiva and God Vishnu are same. Further to prove this theory, it is also said that Sankaranarayanasami gave darshan to Sankan and Padman. It is in practice to make the psychiatric patients, or those suffering from diseases and persons believed to have been haunted by evil spirits, to sit on Sri Chakra peetam, in front of Goddess Gomathi Amman continuously for 40 days so that they could be cured. Maavilakku (offering made of rice) is an important offering to this amman. Those who come to visit this temple also offer miniatures of snake, scorpion and other reptiles to get rid of curses. Snake Pit When a farmer was working in a nearby field (Perungulathoor) to destroy an ant hill, he found blood flowing out from the Ant Hill after hit by the axe. He immediately rushed to the king and reported the incident. When the king came and searched he found the siva lingam inside the Ant Hill with two snakes (believed to be Sankan and Padman) protecting it. This lingam is brought from that place to the current temple. Mud is taken from this place every year on a particular occasion and placed inside the temple (on the praharam of gomathi amman's sanctum santorum) and it is believed that applying the holy sand/mud taken from the snake pit on one's body can cure various diseases. It is believed that all devotees who pray to the goddess Gomathi amman have always found solace.

His name was sometimes spelled Melville van Carnb√©e. His grandson Pieter Melvill van Carnbee (1816-1856) was a notable geographer. Life He is most noted for his involvement in the 1781 Battle of Cape St Mary. In 1793 Melvill van Carnbee (by then a Schout-bij-nacht) was made commander of the squadron on the Maas River and the Hollands Diep. He also had to oversee the Dutch line of defence and the major rivers whilst French troops under Charles Pichegru were advancing. However, in winter 1795, the rivers froze over and Melvill's ships were trapped, meaning he could do nothing to prevent the French from conquering Holland, Utrecht and Zeeland. A supporter of the Prince of Orange, he left the navy on 24 February 1795 after the formation of the Batavian Republic Melvill was later released from his oath by William V, Prince of Orange and on 16 July 1806 king Louis Bonaparte made him Staatsraad in charge of the navy section, as well as a Commander of the Order of the Union. According to a letter in the Daendels family archive, Melvil was at that moment (on 17 February 1807) \\"aux Grandes Indes\\", that is in the Dutch East Indies. in 1809 he was made a Secretary of State. From 30 November 1811 to 1 January 1813 he was 'President of the Assembly of the 's-Gravenhage Canton' in the First French Empire. In 1814 Melvill returned to the navy itself after the formation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 8 July 1815 William I of the Netherlands, in his decree number 16 on \\"past services\\", made Melvil a Commander of the Military William Order. In Melvil's case the \\"past services\\" being rewarded were loyalty to William I's father William V and the 1781 frigate action. He also served as a member of the Dutch Council of State. On 16 September 1815 he was raised to the Dutch peerage and on 6 May 1822 awarded the title of baron.

Life Melvill van Carnbee traced his descent from an old Scottish family, originally, it is said, of Hungarian extraction. Destined for the navy, in which his grandfather Pieter Melvill van Carnbee (1743‚Äì1810) had been admiral, he had a taste for hydrography and cartography as a student in the college of Medemblik, and he showed his capacity as a surveyor on his first voyage to the Dutch Indies, in 1835. In 1839, he was again in the East, and was attached to the hydrographical bureau at Batavia. With the assistance of documents collected by the old East India Company, he completed a map of Java in five sheets, accompanied by sailing directions, in Amsterdam, in 1842. He remained in the East until 1845, collecting materials for a chart of the waters between Sumatra and Borneo, which was two sheets that were published in 1845 and 1846. In his absence, Melvill received the decoration of the Netherlands Lion in 1843, and that of the Legion of Honour in 1849. On his return to the Netherlands he was attached to the naval department with the charge of studying the history of the hydrography of the Dutch East Indies. He also undertook, in connexion with P. F. von Siebold, the publication of the Moniteur des Indes, a valuable series of scientific papers, mainly from his own pen, on the foreign possessions of the Netherlands, which was continued for three years. In 1850, Melvill returned to India as lieutenant of the first class and adjutant to Vice-Admiral van den Bosch; and after the premature death of this commander he was again appointed keeper of the charts at Batavia. In 1853, he obtained exemption from active naval service that he might devote himself to a general atlas of the Dutch Indies. But, in 1856, he fell a victim to climate, dying at Batavia. In spite of delays in engraving, twenty-five sheets of the atlas were already finished, but it was not until 1862 that the whole plan, embracing sixty sheets, was completed by Lieutenant Colonel W. F. Versteeg. In 1843 Melvill received the decoration of the Netherlands Lion, and in 1849 that of the L√©gion d'honneur.

Flowering plants have a rosette of stalked, dark green leaves and a single white flower with green and brown markings, and a wide gap between the petals and lateral sepals. It occurs mostly in New South Wales but is also found in coastal Queensland and north-eastern Victoria. Description Pterostylis baptistii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Flowering plants have a rosette of between four and eight stalked, dark green leaves, each leaf 30‚Äì80 mm long and 20‚Äì25 mm wide. A single flower 40‚Äì60 mm long and 20‚Äì30 mm wide is borne on a spike 200‚Äì400 mm high. The flowers are white with green and brown markings. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with a sharp tip and is the same length as the petals. There is a wide gap between the petals and the lateral sepals which have swept-back, thread-like tips 25‚Äì35 mm long. The sinus between the lateral sepals is almost flat with a central notch and bulges forward. The labellum is 18‚Äì22 mm long, 5‚Äì6 mm wide, reddish brown and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering mainly occurs from July to November. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis baptistii was first formally described in 1875 by Robert FitzGerald from a specimen collected near Hen and Chicken Bay in Sydney. The description was published in Fitzgerald's book Australian Orchids. The specific epithet (baptistii) refers to Baptist Gardens, a nursery in Surry Hills who sent the type specimen to Fitzgerald. Distribution and habitat The king greenhood grows mainly in coastal areas from southern Queensland through New South Wales to north-eastern Victoria and grows in moist to wet soils on sheltered slopes in forest and near swamps.

Hadriaan Beverland (Hadrianus Beverlandus, September-December 1650 Middelburg, Zeeland ‚Äî 14 December 1716 London) was a Dutch humanist scholar who was banished from Holland in 1679 and settled in England in 1680. Early life Hadrian Beverland, in a painting attributed to alt= Beverland was born between 20 September and 14 December 1650 in Middelburg, son to Johannes Beverland (?-1654) and Catarina van Deijnse (?-1665). He had two older brothers: Johannes (1638?-1695) and Christoffel (1646?-1676). His father worked in the military village of Lillo and died in March 1654. In September 1654, Beverland‚Äôs mother Catarina married Bernard de Gomme, an important military engineer for the English army. The couple moved to England around 1660. Beverland and his brothers remained in Middelburg to finish their education and lived in different households. Hadriaan Beverland ca. 1687 by Isaac Beckett (after Simon du Bois). In 1663 Beverland was registered at the Latin School of Middelburg. In July 1669 he was registered at the University of Franeker. He also studied at the universities of Leiden and Utrecht in the decade that followed and spent a year at the University of Oxford in 1672, a move that was partly inspired by (the threat of) war in the Dutch Republic. During his studies, Beverland befriended other humanist scholars: Jacob de Goyer, Nicolaas Heinsius, Jacobus Gronovius, Johann Georg Graevius, and Isaac Vossius. He earned a doctorate in Law at the University of Utrecht in 1677. From his early twenties onwards, Beverland focused on compiling a grand work on sexual lust, which would be titled ‚ÄòDe Prostibulis Veterum‚Äô (‚ÄòOn the prostitution of the ancients‚Äô). By 1677 Beverland contemplated the publication of his ideas and in 1678 he offered a first glimpse of his conclusions in Peccatum Originale (Original Sin). To silence the criticism he received after his first publication, from members of the Dutch Reformed Church in particular, Beverland decided to edit the work. He published a second edition, De Peccato Originali (On Original sin), in 1679.  Studies  In his studies Beverland defined sexual lust as the original sin. He argued that Adam and Eve had had sexual relations in the Garden of Eden, disobeying God‚Äôs commands. As a punishment, all people were henceforth dominated by sexual desire. Beverland concentrated on the past to display the universal power of lust in human nature. Yet he also made sure to point to the gross discrepancy between the official restriction of sex to marriage, prevalent in Calvinist doctrine and secular laws in early modern states, and the actual sexual behaviour of men and women in his contemporary society. He came up with a simple solution the problem of lust: sexual liberty for the educated men of the higher ranks of society, who could responsibly enjoy the unavoidable sin. In the De Stolatae Virginitatis Iure (On the Law of Draped Virginity, 1680), his work on female lust, he outlined practical solutions on how to deal with the problem of lust in human nature in general and the abundance of sexual misbehaviour in his contemporary Dutch society in particular. He proposed for instance that prostitution should be legalized.  Banishment and exile  During a provincial Synod in Gouda in July 1679 Beverland‚Äôs works were discussed by members of the Dutch Reformed Church. Concluding that his study on sex and sin was licentious and injurious, deputies from the Synods of North- and South-Holland sent a request to the States of Holland. On 12 September 1679 the States approved the request of the deputies of the Synods, in which they had asked to prohibit and repress Beverland‚Äôs publications to conserve God, his Word, and the Dutch Reformed religion, and to protect young people in Dutch society from Beverland‚Äôs ideas. The States concluded that the University of Leiden, where Beverland was enrolled as a student at the time, should advise them on the appropriate course of action.Gedrukte resoluties van de Staten van Holland, National Archives The Netherlands, 3.01.04.01, B.1.1, 112, 851. On 26 October 1679 Beverland was arrested. While in prison, he managed to have a third edition of his work on sex and sin printed, titled Poma Amoris (The Fruits of Love). Beverland‚Äôs arrest was handled by the university court of the University of Leiden (Academische Vierschaar). The prosecutor Johan Dirckszoon van Vesanevelt submitted a request to the university court, in which he pleaded for Beverland‚Äôs conviction. It was discussed by the Vierschaar on 11 November 1679. Beverland made his first appearance before the university court during a private hearing on 15 November. He responded to Van Vesanevelt‚Äôs accusations by asking the judges to treat him in a fatherly manner and to refrain from punishing him too harshly, if there was any evidence of sacrilege, blasphemy, heterodoxy, or obscenity found in his works. On the same day, after the Vierschaar heard his confession, they convicted Beverland of writing godless, profane, and perverse works. In addition to a series of minor punishments, Beverland had to retract his heterodox and erroneous statements on the Bible, and had to ask God, and the people he offended with his work, for forgiveness. The De Peccato Originali was censured, he had to hand in the ‚ÄòDe Prostibulis Veterum‚Äô manuscript, and to promise not to publish any more scandalous works. He was expelled from the University of Leiden and was banished from Holland and Zeeland. If he returned to these provinces without special permission, he would meet with corporal punishment.National Archive The Netherlands, Vierschaar der Universiteit te Leiden, Crimineele klachtboeken. 1631-1810, part 13, Litt. E, 1647-1695, 115r-116d. On 4 December 1679 Beverland signed a written statement, in which he promised to never again write or publish anything against the Bible or decent virtues, that he would hand over the ‚ÄòDe Prostibulis Veterum‚Äô manuscript, and that he accepted all the other punishments of the Vierschaar. He was released from prison the same day. Beverland travelled to Utrecht. Situated outside the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, he was allowed to stay in this city without violating the terms of his punishment. In March 1680, as part of his sentence, Beverland handed over the manuscript of the first book of the ‚ÄòDe Prostibulis Veterum‚Äô to the authorities of the University of Leiden and in the same month he travelled across the Channel. He was welcomed into the home of his friend Isaac Vossius in Windsor. He continued to work on his ‚ÄòDe Prostibulis Veterum‚Äô (he had sent copies of the first, second, and third book of the work to England before his departure). Sometime in the next two decades, however, he gave up on his master thesis. He seems to have realised that the work would never be published and he started focusing on other things. Beverland did continue his classical studies concentrating for instance on Martial‚Äôs epigrams, the satires of Juvenal, and De Rerum Natura of Lucretius. In addition to classical scholarship, soon after his arrival in England Beverland started working as a sort of secretary, librarian, and broker in the service of Dutch friends, such as Vossius, and new English contacts, like Hans Sloane. Beverland soon started contemplating his return to the Dutch Republic. He composed a plea to the judges of the University of Leiden in 1684, which stated that he had renounced his youthful bravado. By the late 1680s, since his appeal had gone unheard, he started working on an apologetic work titled De Fornicatione Cavenda Admonitio (Warning about fornication which should be avoided, 1697, 1698). In the treatise Beverland repudiated the lewd contents and lascivious style of his earlier works. In the end it was the sale of the library of Isaac Vossius to the University of Leiden, in which Beverland played an important role, that secured Beverland a pardon for his sentence. The University of Leiden retracted his conviction and in 1693 he received a pardon from King William III, the highest judge of the United Provinces in his position as Stadholder. Beverland never returned to the Dutch Republic however. From the 1690s onwards, mental and financial troubles started to determine his life. He lived together with his partner, Rebecca Tibbith, and their daughter Anna in different places in and just outside London. Beverland died in London on 14 December 1716 and was buried four days later, in the yard of St. Paul‚Äôs Church in Covent Garden.

This church was built upon the first chapel erected by the Spanish conquistadors after landing on the coast where they would later build the city. This church is the main temple of the city, which is why it is called \\"the Cathedral of Santa Cruz\\". However, it not is a cathedral; the Cathedral of La Laguna is the cathedral of Tenerife. In 1500 work began to build a church dedicated to the Holy Cross founded by Father Juan Guerra. It was one of the first churches built on the island of Tenerife. Specifically, the Church of the Conception of Santa Cruz was built near the place where the first Christian mass observed on the island of Tenerife after the founding of the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife was held. The Iglesia de la Concepci√≥n is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. In this church is the image of St. JamesLa capital rinde culto a su santo (patron saint of Santa Cruz de Tenerife). Inside the church is kept the cross that gave rise to the founding of the city.

The order was abolished in 1811 when the French Empire absorbed the Kingdom of Holland. It was succeeded by the Order of the Reunion. Variants Louis Napoleon with star and grand sash of the order. Louis Napoleon was highly active despite the short length of his reign and so there were six variants of the order, though these all had more or less the same form, rules and decorations and the different names were all for more or less the same order ‚Äì the orders have been described by authors such as Mr. , , George Sanders, and as an organic whole. These variants were: * Order of the Union (12 December 1806 ‚Äì 13 February 1807) * Royal Order of Merit (12 December 1806 ‚Äì 13 February 1807) * Royal Order of Holland (13 February 1807 ‚Äì 23 November 1807) * Royal Order of the Union (23 November 1807 ‚Äì 6 February 1808) * Royal Order of the Union of Holland (so-named in the decree of 6 February 1808) * Royal Order of the Union (6 February 1808 ‚Äì 1 April 1811?) The Order of the Union (1806‚Äì1807) and the Royal Order of Merit (1806‚Äì1807) merged to become the Royal Order of Holland (1807). This new order became the Royal Order of the Union (1807‚Äì1808), also known as the Royal Order of the Union of Holland (1808) and finally the Royal Order of the Union (1808). The order's chaotic history has led some to argue that the Royal Order of Holland broke up in 1807. Other authors such as Schutte, Van Zelm van Eldik and George Sanders emphasize its continuity. They write that the order established in 1806 died out at the same time as the Kingdom of Holland. The continuity is reflected in a letter or circular in French in which Grand Chancellor Maarten van der Goes van Dirxland explains that all these orders all actually made up one order and that \\"the Knights of the Royal order of Holland can also bear the name of Knights of the union. Union is the aim and foundation of the order. This article must be inserted into the order's statutes. Perhaps it would be convenient to make it the first one?\\". History Louis was made king of the new Kingdom of Holland on 6 June 1806. Like the other Bonapartes, he wanted to add the luster of pomp and knighthood to his reign. Until 1806 the Netherlands had always been a republic and so had no pre-existing system of orders so, on 24 August 1806, Louis wrote to Napoleon (then in Aachen): Seating plan for the third meeting of the Royal Order of the Union in June 1809.

Port Isabel was a seaport established on Port Isabel Slough in 1865 during the American Civil War in Sonora, Mexico in the mouth of the Colorado River on the Gulf of California. It was founded to support the increased river traffic caused by the gold rush that began in 1862 on the Colorado River and the Yuma Quartermaster Depot newly established in 1864 to support the Army posts in the Arizona Military District. The slough was discovered in 1865 by the Captain W. H. Pierson of the schooner Isabel, that first used the slough to transfer its cargo to steamboats safe from the tidal bore of the Colorado River. Shortly afterward Port Isabel was established 3 miles up the slough and replaced Robinson's Landing as the place where cargo was unloaded in the river from seagoing craft on to flat bottomed steamboats of the Colorado River and carried up to Fort Yuma and points further north on the river. The Arizona sentinel, 1882-01-14, p.2, col. 1, What's in a Name? By 1867, Port Isabel, was situated on Port Isabel Slough whose mouth lay to the east of the main channel of the Colorado River on its channel east of Montague Island about 2 miles from its entrance, at the first good landing place, the shores below being of very soft mud. Port Isabel, served as a location for repairing the river steamers and barges at a location about 2 miles above Port Isabel on what was called Shipyard Slough that became the site called Ship Yard, which had a few frame buildings, a dry dock and a ship way where steamboats could be constructed or repaired.

Trade by sea was replaced with cargo carried by rail. In 1877, George Alonzo Johnson sold his Colorado Steam Navigation Company to the Southern Pacific Railroad. Yuma then became the head of navigation for steamboats operating on the river. Port Isabel was abandoned by 1879, its shipyard being moved to Yuma, Arizona.

It started as a small children's film festival and has now grown into a large organisation that develops activities for children in the areas of film, television and new media throughout the year. These activities are presented alongside the festival, whereas the festival itself screens films from all over the world and a selection of the best television programs for children. It also organises several new media activities. Each year the festival is attended by over 50,000 children, parents and (international) guests. Cinekid Foundation The Cinekid Foundation is the organisation behind the festival and accompanying activities. The foundation's goal is to improve the quality of visual culture for children as well as to stimulate children's active and creative participation in the media in order to strengthen their position in relation to the media. To achieve these goals, Cinekid's core activities include: 1\\\\. Festival The Cinekid Film, Television and New Media Festival is the main event each year. It is preceded by a series of school screenings throughout Amsterdam and a satellite program held in 30 cities throughout the Netherlands: Cinekid On Location. 2\\\\. Cinekid for Professionals The Cinekid for Professionals Conference is a new addition to Cinekid's activities. The conference has a seminar program and co-production markets where media professionals can view a selection of children's films and television programs. 3\\\\. Development and renewal Cinekid focuses on development of the intercultural field defined as Child and Media. This is a central element in Cinekid's core activities and includes trainings, test, knowledge, development and innovation programs. Media Literacy Cinekid focuses on media education through broad culture participation. Children from all layers of society are allowed festival participation through leading discussions, voting, creating media productions, talking to industry representatives and (child) actors, joining workshops etc. In order to introduce diverse quality media productions, passive participation included, Cinekid aims to stimulate less accessible genres like child documentaries and cultural interactive media as well. A tool for this is Cinekid Studio, an interactive environment which allows children to create their own media productions throughout the year. The goal is to improve media consciousness in a playful way. Cinekid Studio is part of the media literacy program that Cinekid offers. The Cinekid Klappers is a children's film canon, an international list of around one hundred films that are considered essential. The list has been compiled by a broad commission of experts and consists of high quality contemporary and older films, for different age groups and with several themes.

It stars David Yip, Lucy Sheen, and Robert Lee. The film was produced by Picture Palace Films for Film Four International. Sheen in her debut role plays Elaine Choi, a law clerk brought in to carry out the will of a prominent restaurateur. Plot In Chinatown, London, restaurateur Sam Wong dies in a telephone booth after making a call. Law clerk Elaine Choi is tasked with executing his will. After attending Mr. Wong's funeral, she reads the will to the family. Mr. Wong leaves one of his restaurants to his eldest son Mike on the condition that it be run as a traditional Chinese restaurant, and another to Jimmy Lee if he agrees to run the restaurant. To his wife Ah Ying, he leaves the family home and warehouse. He leaves ¬£90,000 to be shared equally between his two sons and his daughter Cherry. The latter also receives the family store. For his friend Mr. Chen, he gives the family farm on the condition that he visits it weekly. The last recipient named Sarah Lee is unknown to the family and receives his vintage sports car if she learns to drive. The final condition of the will is that Mr. Wong is to be buried in his home village in China, but the Chinese embassy rules require that his body be accompanied by a family member, which initially all the family members refuse to do. In order for the will to be valid, it needs to be signed by its recipients; Choi finds they are reluctant to do so for a variety of reasons. Mike, who runs a successful Italian restaurant, lives a very Anglicised life and wants to build a multiplex complex over his father's restaurant. Cherry and her husband are disappointed that they did not receive the family warehouse which they ran. Mr. Chen is an illegal immigrant who arrived with Mr. Wong in 1936; while Mr. Wong later gained citizenship, Mr. Chen has kept away from the authorities and has not left Chinatown for the last two decades. In her pursuit of getting the will signed by all parties, Choi acts as a go- between for the different family members. Ah Ying eventually signs the will and agrees to accompany her husband's body back to China. This act prompts Cherry to sign the will. While trying to persuade Mike to sign, Choi falls in love with him. On the day that Mr. Wong's body is due to be sent to China, Mike finds his mother and agrees to accompany her. While waiting for Mike's return, Choi discovers that Sarah Lee was Mr. Wong's secret British mistress. Choi and Mike reunite at the family farm now owned by Mr. Chen who has left Chinatown. Mike gives Choi a gift from China of a traditional dress. Choi also discovers that the last phone call Mr. Wong made was to his brother in China informing him that his wife and his son Mike would soon be visiting the village.

It was also the first film directed in the United Kingdom by Leong who previously shot films in Hong Kong. The idea for the film was created by Leong during the filming of his 1984 comedy Banana Cop. The name of the film is derived from Elaine Choi's role in the film as a go-between in executing the will which she compares to a ping-pong ball. Lucy Sheen made her acting debut in this film. Release and reception Ping Pong premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 1986. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 17 July 1987, where it made $67,421 at the box- office. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Sheen's performance was its \\"strongest asset\\". He described the film as a \\"quest for identity\\" for Anglo-Chinese torn between integrating with British culture and the fight in trying not to lose their cultural heritage. Walter Goodman of The New York Times commented that although the film showed some promise \\"...mostly the movie was not funny or touching...\\". Time Out praised the film's \\"engaging characters\\", \\"lively pace and quirky humour\\".

History The company originates from three former companies: Yates's, SFI Group and the Laurel Pub Company. =Laurel Pub Company= Slug and Lettuce in Leeds The group has its origins in the Laurel Pub Company, which was owned by Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz, two Iranian businessmen. It originally owned the Hogshead pub chain. In May 2004, it sold 432 neighbourhood pubs for ¬£654m to Greene King. Robert Tchenguiz's R20 bought the company for ¬£151m in November 2004. In June 2005, it bought the Slug and Lettuce, and Bar Med for ¬£80m when the Surrey-based SFI Group went into administration. It also bought Yates's for ¬£202m, with many becoming Slug and Lettuce outlets. In February 2006, it sold the Forno Vivo and Santa Fe chains. In April 2007, it bought the La Tasca chain for ¬£123m, but in 2011, La Tasca demerged into a standalone business under La Tasca Holdings Ltd. =Financial difficulties= On 27 March 2008, the Laurel Pub Company went into administration; this was thought to be due to high rents. R20, Robert Tchenguiz's company, with its 378 pubs, bought the company back via pre-packaged insolvency, with most of the former company becoming the Bay Restaurant Group on 28 March 2008, financed by Kaupthing bank. In a few months, many Icelandic banks such as Kaupthing would spectacularly collapse in October 2008. In February 2009, Tchenguiz was sued by the Kampthing bank for an unpaid overdraft of ¬£643m.HeH was relieved of his involvement with the company by the banks to which he owed debts through an offshore company called Oscatello based on the British Virgin Islands. On 27 July 2009, it was bought by two banks, Commerzbank of Germany, and Kaupthing Bank of Iceland, in a move to recoup debts from him. That was done via a debt-for-equity swap, where Kaupthing became the major shareholder, and the company's debt was reduced by around ¬£150m. In May 2010, the company was put up for sale, with Tragus Ltd. a potential buyer, for around ¬£70m. In September 2010, it sold Ha Ha Bar and Grill (22 pubs) to Mitchells & Butlers for ¬£19.5m, which saw the disappearance of the brand, with 12 becoming All Bar One. Hogshead and Yates's are now owned by the Town & City Pub Company, which is based in the same building as the Bay Restaurant Group. This company was established on the same day Tchenguiz, and is the other part of the former Laurel Pub Company, and also owned by Kaupthing. The Town & City Pub Company bought the Slug and Lettuce chain (82 pubs) in February 2010 so it is still based in the same building.

It is situated between the town of Conquista and the hamlet of Minas del Horcajo, in Almod√≥var del Campo. Around 2003 it was bought on leaseThe princes‚Äô secret Spanish playground, December 7, 2007, Cordoba, The Olive Press, Jon Clarke and renovated by Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster. Prior to Grosvenor's acquisition, the estate was property of the Duke of Bavaria.Vanity Fair: De La Mancha a Extremadura: Estas son las fincas donde monarcas, nobles y empresarios van de caza La Garganta is the largest privately owned hunting estate in EuropeCadena SER: El Valle de Alcudia recuerda al duque de Westminster (In Spanish), and occupies a surface larger than the entire city of Barcelona.Voz Populi: El √∫ltimo gran latifundio espa√±ol, en la herencia del Duque de Westminster History The property was formerly owned by the British mining company Rio Tinto, which mined the hills for a variety of minerals. Since the early 20th century it was converted to a hunting ground by a consortium of European landowners. They managed it through the company Villamagna SA, before the mostly aristocratic German owners started leasing it to Gerald Grosvenor. Infrastructure In 2007 it was reported that the private accommodation consists of six large villas, some in the process of renovation, besides accommodation for nearly 100 staff. A converted railway station allows for rail access, while the headquarters is supplied with its own petrol station to service a fleet of over 20 jeeps. Economic activity includes production of olives, cereal and cork. Strict security was reported, while all but one of the former public entrance roads have been closed. This recent move towards higher exclusivity and privacy proved controversial with some members of the public and local environmentalists. Wildlife The hilly and extensively forested property, has a perimeter of about 40 miles and ranges from 585 to 1,266 meters in altitude. Its wildlife is described as diverse by European standards. Despite low and erratic rainfall, significant woodlands occur, which include cork oak, strawberry trees, poplars and alder, the latter limited to the river valley. These woods are flanked by pine forests in the north and east, besides commercial olives and exotic eucalypts. The estate is stocked with boar, Iberian red deer, Iberian ibex, Mouflons, Fallow deer and partridge, for hunting. The numbers of smaller species like partridge, hares and rabbits are encouraged for the sake of raptors. Rare wildlife like the black stork and Spanish imperial eagle occur, while black, griffon and Egyptian vultures, and the golden eagle are resident species.Grosvenor Estate web page The estate manager as of 2007 was Jos√© Mar√≠a Tercero.

The research has been conducted in the United States by researchers from the Center for Sexual Health Promotion in the School of Public Health at Indiana University in Bloomington. TIME magazine called the NSSHB \\"the most comprehensive survey of its kind in nearly two decades and the first to include teenagers.\\" Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders has written the following about NSSHB findings: \\"These data are important for keeping the nation moving forward in the area of sexual health and well being. In the absence of scientific data available to construct an accurate and up-to-date view, opinions in the field of sexual science can vary widely from person to person.\\" There have been a total of seven waves of the NSSHB, all conducted between 2009 and 2018. More than 30 scientific articles have been published from these data. Articles based on the first wave of the study, the 2009 NSSHB, were initially released in a supplement to the October 2010 issue of Journal of Sexual Medicine.\\"Sex in the U.S.: Survey Finds 'Enormous Diversity'\\" article by Michael Smith, North American Correspondent, MedPage Today, October 04, 2010, reviewed by Adam J. Carinci, MD; Instructor, Harvard Medical School, accessed October 4, 2010 Since the NSSHB's inception in 2009, there have been a total of six additional waves of data collection. The NSSHB was the first U.S. nationally representative probability survey of sexual behavior in the United States conducted since the 1992 National Health and Social Life Survey. In Fall 2018, the researchers were honored with Indiana University's Outstanding Faculty Collaborative Research Award Lecture. The 2009 NSSHB surveyed nearly 6,000 individuals between the age of 14 and 94, living in the United States. Findings showed a wide variety of sexual behavior. According to one of the lead investigators, Debby Herbenick, PhD, of Indiana University in Bloomington, \\"Adult men and women rarely engage in just one sex act when they have sex.\\" In addition to Dr. Herbenick, the original core NSSHB team included Drs. Michael Reece, J. Dennis Fortenberry, Brian Dodge, Stephanie Sanders, and Vanessa Schick. Significant findings include use of condoms in about 25% of instances of vaginal sex by adults, about 33% if they were single, with teenagers using condoms 70 to 80% of the time. Only a low level of sexual activity among the approximately 800 teenagers surveyed was found with incidence increasing with age. It was discovered that about one third of women reported pain during intercourse. A discrepancy was discovered between men's perception that their female partner had experienced orgasm, about 85%, and women's self-reporting of 64%. The NSSHB has been supported by funding from Church and Dwight maker of Trojan condoms. The sponsor offered limited input on the survey development, mostly with respect to gathering information on how often Americans use condoms, settling with a formulation which requested information on whether condoms were used or not during the last 10 sexual encounters of each respondent. With respect to condom use results were encouraging especially with respect to teenagers. Ethnic populations impacted by HIV/AIDS showed a higher rate of condom use than then general population as did dating adults. Discrepancies remain between the level of condom use considered optimal for public health and reported rate of use particularly by people over 40. Women reported less satisfaction with sexual activity than men with less pleasure, less arousal, and fewer orgasms. This was hypothesized by one of the researchers as being related to the greater incidence of pain also reported by women. In the 2012 NSSHB, researchers found that pain during vaginal intercourse was reported by 30% of women and 7% of men. Additionally, pain during anal intercourse was reported by 72% of women and 15% of men. In a publication from the 2016, the researchers found that although most sexually active adults between ages 18 and 50 were aware that Zika could be transmitted by mosquitos, only about 40% identified sexual intercourse as a possible route of transmission. In a 2018 NSSHB publication, it was found that about 60% of Americans who reported on a recent sexual event reported having ejaculated somewhere outside of the vagina at least once. Looking at the most recent sexual event, findings showed a lack of concordance between the percentage of people indicating they used \\"withdrawal\\" at their most recent sexual event compared with where they said they ejaculated.

This Huron ancestral village was located on of land and the settlement was fortified with multiple rows of palisades. The community arrived ca. 1625, likely moving en masse from the so-called Mantle Site located nine kilometres to the south-east in what is today urban Stouffville. The Aurora/Old Fort site is located at the south-east corner of Kennedy Road and Vandorf Side Road, east of the hamlet of Vandorf in the town of Whitchurch‚ÄìStouffville. The Aurora site was occupied at the same time as the nearby Ratcliff site.See a map of sites in Birch, \\"Coalescence and Conflict in Iroquoian Ontario,\\" Archaeological Review from Cambridge (2010): 35 (Ratcliff is five kilometres north-west of the Mantle site; Aurora is another four kilometers). Note that the Mantle community originated with people who migrated from the Draper Site, which had developed from smaller villages. The Rouge River trail, used by the Huron and then later by the French to travel between Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe / Georgian Bay, ran through the Aurora site. > Perhaps the busiest and best documented of these routes was that which > followed the Humber River valley northward ... although another trail of > equal importance and antiquity and used earlier than the former by the > French, extended from the mouth of the Rouge River northward to the > headwaters of the Little Rouge and over the drainage divide to the East > Branch of the Holland River at Holland Landing.Ron Williamson, \\"'It's not > the trail, but the land that it crosses': The Origin of the name 'Toronto' > \\", Heritage Toronto, official website (accessed October 6, 2010); the Aurora > site is specified on Williamson's \\"Map of Various Iterations of Rouge > Trail.\\" Rouge Trail Map, ca. 1673 by Louis Jolliet The Aurora/Old Fort site was indiscriminately looted by collectors throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The Aurora/Old Fort site was completely excavated in 1947 and 1957 by the University of Toronto. The 1947 dig was the first student excavation by the university, and it was led by John Norman Emerson.\\"Aurora Site.\\" Partners in the Past: Ontario Archaeological Society / University of Toronto, (webpage); see pictures of selected artifacts found at the Aurora Site: \\"Aurora Artifacts,\\" Partners in the Past: Ontario Archaeological Society / University of Toronto (webpage; accessed October 4, 2010). Emerson's doctoral work was largely based on the excavations of the Aurora/Old Fort site. This excavation contributed to the conclusions of archeologists and anthropologists that the Wendat coalesced as a people in this area, rather than further east in the St. Lawrence River valley, as was thought at one time. Findings in the late twentieth century at the Ratcliff Site and in 2005 at the Mantle Site have provided more evidence of sixteenth-century settlements by ancestral Wendat in this region.See List of archaeological sites in Whitchurch‚ÄìStouffville. The use of technological and analytic advances, such as radiocarbon dating and Bayesian analysis, has resulted in new conclusions about the occupancy of these varied sites. The Mantle site is now believed to have been occupied 1587 to 1623.

Greece (application No. 14307/88) is a landmark case of the European Court of Human Rights, decided in 1993 and concerning compatibility of certain sanctions for proselytism with Articles 7 and 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It ruled by a vote of six-to-three that a Jehovah's Witness man's freedom to manifest his religion, protected by Article 9, had been violated by the Greek government. One of the judges wrote that this case was \\"of particular importance\\" because it was \\"the first real case concerning freedom of religion to have come before the European Court since it was set up\\" in 1959.ECtHR judgment, partly concurring opinion of Judge Pettiti Facts The crime of proselytism, according to Greek law, meant \\"in particular, any direct or indirect attempt to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion (eterodoxos), with the aim of undermining those beliefs, either by any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance, or by fraudulent means or by taking advantage of his inexperience, trust, need, low intellect or na√Øvety\\". Greek court has later clarified that \\"purely spiritual teaching does not amount to proselytism, even if it demonstrates the errors of other religions and entices possible disciples away from them, who abandon their original religions of their own free will; this is because spiritual teaching is in the nature of a rite of worship performed freely and without hindrance. Outside such spiritual teaching, which may be freely given, any determined, importunate attempt to entice disciples away from the dominant religion by means that are unlawful or morally reprehensible constitutes proselytism as prohibited\\".ECtHR judgment, paras. 16-17 Mr. Minos Kokkinakis, a Jehovah's Witness, and his wife, called at the home of Mrs Kyriakaki in Sitia and engaged in a discussion with her, described by Ms. Kyriakaki as follows: \\"They immediately talked to me about Olof Palme, whether he was a pacifist or not, and other subjects that I can‚Äôt remember. They talked to me about things I did not understand very well. It was not a discussion but a constant monologue by them. ... If they had told me they were Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, I would not have let them in. I don‚Äôt recall whether they spoke to me about the Kingdom of Heaven. They stayed in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. What they told me was religious in nature, but I don‚Äôt know why they told it to me. I could not know at the outset what the purpose of their visit was. They may have said something to me at the time with a view to undermining my religious beliefs... [However,] the discussion did not influence my beliefs\\". Mrs Kyriakaki‚Äôs husband, who was the cantor at a local Orthodox church, informed the police and Mr. Kokkinakis was convicted for proselytism.ECtHR judgment, paras. 7-12 Mr. Kokkinakis appealed to the ECtHR under Articles 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.ECtHR judgment, para. 25 The court's Commission unanimously held that there had been a violation of Kokkinakis' rights under Article 9.ECtHR judgment, para. 26 Court's judgment The court held that the measure complained of was prescribed by law and was in pursuit of a legitimate aim under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.ECtHR judgment, paras. 37-44 However, it found a violation of Article 9 (by six votes to three), reasoning that the interference with Kokkinakis' freedom of religion was not necessary in a democratic society since: a \\"distinction has to be made between bearing Christian witness and improper proselytism. The former corresponds to true evangelism, which a report drawn up in 1956 under the auspices of the World Council of Churches describes as an essential mission and a responsibility of every Christian and every Church. The latter represents a corruption or deformation of it. It may, according to the same report, take the form of activities offering material or social advantages with a view to gaining new members for a Church or exerting improper pressure on people in distress or in need; it may even entail the use of violence or brainwashing; more generally, it is not compatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of others. Scrutiny of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 shows that the relevant criteria adopted by the Greek legislature are reconcilable with the foregoing if and in so far as they are designed only to punish improper proselytism, which the Court does not have to define in the abstract in the present case. The Court notes, however, that in their reasoning the Greek courts established the applicant‚Äôs liability by merely reproducing the wording of section 4 and did not sufficiently specify in what way the accused had attempted to convince his neighbour by improper means. None of the facts they set out warrants that finding. That being so, it has not been shown that the applicant‚Äôs conviction was justified in the circumstances of the case by a pressing social need. The contested measure therefore does not appear to have been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\\".ECtHR judgment, paras. 48-49 The Court rejected (by eight votes to one) applicant's claim that the provision of Greek law serving as ground for his conviction was not sufficiently precise and clear, violating Article 7.ECtHR judgment, paras. 51-53 The Court held unnecessary to examine the case under Article 10 or 14. Judge Pettiti submitted a partly concurring opinion, considering that the criminal legislation in Greece on proselytism was in itself contrary to Article 9. Judge De Meyer submitted a short concurring opinion. Judges Foighel and Loizou, jointly, and Judge Valticos filed two dissenting opinions, regarding Article 9 as not violated. Judge Martens filed a partly dissenting opinion, offering his own rationale for the finding of violation of Article 9 and also considering Article 7 to be violated.

LeBaron was one of the many prominent coachbuilders in the 1920s to provide bodies for luxury cars. Until World War II most of the great prestige automakers ‚Äî Rolls-Royce, Hispano- Suiza, Duesenberg, Packard ‚Äî would readily supply only a running chassis which wealthy buyers would have fitted with custom bodywork. It eventually became part of Chrysler Corporation. LeBaron, Carrossiers Inc LeBaron, Carrossiers Inc. free-lance design consultants was founded in New York City in 1920 by American designers Raymond H. Dietrich (1894-1980) and Thomas L. Hibbard (1898-1982) who had met while working for Brewster & Co. Dietrich and Hibbard remained among the Brewster personnel so they invented a new name LeBaron, Carrossiers from a list of French words that could be easily pronounced but still sounded impressive. Within twelve months Brewster learned what they were doing and ended their Brewster & Co business relationship. They found more work and Hibbard offered the LeBaron administrative jobs to his friend, Ralph Roberts, who had just gotten his Bachelor of Science degree from Dartmouth College. Most design work came to LeBaron through dealers. =Hibbard & Darrin= Hibbard met fellow designer, Howard A. \\"Dutch\\" Darrin (1897-1982) in 1923. Hibbard and Darrin decided to go to Paris, initially to try to sell LeBaron designs where manufacturing costs were lower but once in view of the opportunities decided to set up their own business in Paris and founded Hibbard & Darrin. Hibbard resigned from LeBaron in 1923. LeBaron Inc. Dietrich and Roberts continued operating LeBaron with a new illustrator, veteran Roland L. Stickney. LeBaron took over the Blue Ribbon and Bridgeport Body companies thus becoming body builders as well as designers and changed name to LeBaron Inc. =Dietrich Inc.= Dietrich received a lucrative offer from Murray Corporation, one of Ford's and Lincoln's main body builders, in 1925 and resigned from LeBaron to start Dietrich, Inc.. With both founders gone, LeBaron could have been in trouble. But Roberts continued to run the company and orders kept coming in. Walter O. Briggs began talks with Roberts in 1926 to buy LeBaron and move it to Detroit, setting up operations at Mack Avenue Stamping (Old Mack Factory).History of Mack Avenue factories Briggs Manufacturing 1932 Chrysler Imperial CH designed by Ralph Roberts LeBaron was purchased by Briggs Manufacturing Company of Detroit in 1926 and operated as a subsidiary. Briggs was already supplying bodies to nearby Chrysler, Essex, Ford, Hudson, and Overland. As a Briggs subsidiary, LeBaron handled special custom work, provided design ideas for the main business, and supplied exquisite custom bodies for various car companies such as Chrysler's luxury Imperial line, Duesenberg, Packard, and Cadillac.

Dr. Eugene Heimler developed this approach out of his work in the United Kingdom within the National Health Service in the late 1950s and early 1960s (drawing on his earlier life experience in WWII concentration camps). He formulated a precise and powerful structure for counselling along with a sensitive questionnaire, The Heimler Scale of Social Functioning (HSSF). HSF is ideal for focused short-term work which is goal- and action- orientated, it can be used among diverse client groups, by a variety of professional disciplines on a one-to-one basis, with couples, or with groups. These include Counselling (at all levels), Supervision (management, coaching, training and counselling), Staff support, and Meetings (formal as well as informal). A method of therapy In HSF, the therapist is taught to listen at depth, rather than hear and interpret, and thus is more likely to genuinely share another's world. For many people this is the best form of help that could be given. The underlying ethos \\"the client knows best\\" enables the therapist to support individuals to make their own choices within their own framework. The expertise of this approach lies in being a genuine and effective listener rather than providing a framework in which to understand people's problems. For the listening process to be effective a structure is helpful to both participants. The stages of this can be identified, quickly learned and readily applied. This structure for listening has applications within a number of spheres from problem solving to a deeper psychotherapeutic approach or in team development; with adults or children. As a further structuring to the interviewing process, the HSSF can also be administered during counselling.Heimler, E. (1975), Survival in Society, London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Research has yielded detailed analysis that accurately identifies support needs Burnell, G. (1989), Research applications of Human Social Functioning in a health care setting, in Rodway (Ed.) Counselling Diverse Client Groups. Lampeter, Edwin Mellen Press, 105‚Äì136 and appropriate therapeutic responses with great accuracy. Some of the research studies concentrated on identifying specific coping patterns,Bates, D. (1989), A coping index derived from the Heimler Scale of Social Functioning, in M. Rodway (Ed.) Counselling Diverse Client Groups. Lampeter, Edwin Mellen Press, 139‚Äì202. while others have examined the diagnostic and predictive use of the HSSF.Thomas, J.B. (1974), A descriptive study investigating diagnostic and predictive use of the Heimler Scale of Social Functioning, unpublished dissertation for MA, Simon Fraser University Other practitioners have described the use of HSF method with different types of groups: for instance with family therapyRodway, M. (1980), Family Human Social Functioning: an integrative approach to family practice, in D. Freeman (Ed.) Perspectives on Family Therapy, Toronto, Ontario, Butterworth, 19‚Äì32 HSF theory and method Heimler's theory reflects John Donne's well-known statement that \\"no man is an island entire of itself\\": that it is our relationships, positively or negatively perceived, that give life its meaning. For Heimler this means that society has a pivotal role with its more deprived members, to permit connection and meaning in their environment and that we can exist as sane or useful people only as long as we can transform and utilise the negative in us.Heimler, E. (1975), Survival in Society, London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 11 Heimler's principles include the importance of the relationship between satisfaction and frustration. He observed that \\"those who functioned in society ... had the common feature of a subjectively felt satisfaction that corresponded with their level of bearable frustration.\\"Heimler, E. (1975), Survival in Society, London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 8 Too much frustration or too little satisfaction is detrimental to good functioning for an individual. The person's life experience is valued and used as a resource for healing in addition to recognising where their energy is distributed. This enables the person to make changes that will allow more positive use of energy. Another important principle which Heimler introduces is the use of the individual's past experience to dialogue with the present experience and project on to the future. Using a process, called the \\"Fragmenta Vitae\\", the person is enabled to become aware of the current emotional triggers and helped to access their early antecedents recalling childhood stories with the same emotional content. By engaging with the child in the past, the individual is encouraged to dialogue between the present and the past and to a projected future. This can help break patterns from the past and provide for an altered future outcome. Heimler understood his theory in a developmental model with three levels. Briefly put: Level 1 (L1) is the infant world of instinctual responses to pleasure or pain; Level 2 (L2) \\"revolves\\" around L1 as it were by taking the growing and developed child into social interactions with all the satisfactions and frustrations this can entail; while Level 3 (L3) revolves around life itself, often as a more dominant force in later life, but as well, a creative force than many people tap into from earlier years. All these levels are relatively fluid as development ebbs and flows. Heimler identified that \\"when a psychiatric or medical history is taken, it is looking at what is wrong or what went wrong\\" [and he continues:] \\"... rarely ... will you find ... that which seeks what is right with people\\".Heimler, E. (1977), Keynote address, in L. Dick, & G. de Cocq (Eds), First Conference on Human Social Functioning: international dialogue, Banff, Alberta, Faculty of Social Welfare, University of Calgary, 7 The HSF method sets out the whole of a client's current experience so that positive and negative can be set together and the client can see her/himself as a whole. In this methodology, the individuals stand firmly at the centre of their own world, exerting their will and abilities to change their own situation. Rodway sums up Heimler's philosophy as: \\"the belief that man has choices, that choices should be made available to man and that freedom is equated with self-determination as man makes his choices\\".Rodway, 1977, p44 Heimler's approach engages with the need to clarify the crux of the problem so as to facilitate a remedy. Although the concepts of social functioning were not new, Heimler sought a practical integrative tool which would \\"focus on the positive, and how frustrations, abnormalities and difficulties could be turned into ultimate gain\\".Heimler, E. (1985), The Healing Echo, London, Souvenir Press (E & A) Ltd,14 Heimler recognised that his ideas were not original but he sought an integrative whole which would offer a therapeutic tool. Along with his colleagues he produced a visual scale that showed to both therapist and client the connection between the individual's subjective experience and objective reality. =Training= HSF training is largely experientially-based with participants using their own life material when learning the interviewing techniques. Further training in therapeutic applications follows a similar pattern and incorporates imaginative techniques. Traditionally those wishing to use the HSSF have had to complete the full Human Social Functioning methodology with its disciplined structured mirroring approach as well as the administration of the HSSF. However most practitioners have a prior training in a form of counselling and find it irksome to learn another approach. Although HSF practitioners still consider that the methodology has its own distinctive value, there is a recognition that many want to use the HSF more as an assessment and add-on to their own core practice. Training in the Heimler scale includes an understanding of the ethos of the scale, administration, calculation, understanding, therapeutic aspects as well as the diagnostic opportunities it affords. Learning is through practical administration, video practice in feedback and written work to achieve a required standard in diagnosis and scale analysis. Training in the full HSF method is open to anyone with a professional health care qualification, taking 60 training hours with 20‚Äì40 hours of private study. For those who have prior counselling training, the HSSF (tool specific) training takes 30 hours with 20‚Äì30 hours of private study. Successful participants to both parts receive a certificate from The British Association of Social Functioning (BASF) and practitioner status with Heimler International. HSF training from qualified trainers in HSF has been recognised by BACP as contributing to the theory and skills development hours that are required for BACP accreditation. Heimler Scale of Social Functioning The Heimler Scale of Social Functioning (HSSF) is a unique tool in that it covers a wide area of an individual's life experience, encouraging him to see himself in his societal setting. It was initially developed in the 1960s and has been widely used in a variety of contexts. It sets out, through a series of 55 questions, (most of them answered by a simple \\"Yes\\", \\"No\\", or \\"Perhaps\\") a pattern of energies in terms of \\"Satisfactions\\" and \\"Frustrations\\". It also puts these alongside an overall (existential) life view ‚Äì Outlook. Satisfactions are set out in 25 questions under five headings: \\"Work\\", \\"Finance\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Family (past & present)\\", and \\"Personal\\". These are set alongside Frustrations where there are also five areas, each with a sub-set of five questions: \\"Activity\\", \\"Health\\", \\"Influences\\", \\"Moods\\", and \\"Escape Routes\\". The final section, the Outlook, has five questions, which are answered in terms of a scale response. While recognising its diagnostic capabilities, Heimler used the scale primarily as an aid to counselling. From early in its development, researchers have shown it to be an extremely sophisticated diagnostic instrument. The balance of Satisfactions to Frustrations provides an accurate picture of how well a person feels that he or she is coping, what help, if any, they may require, and likely outcomes. These energy balances vary according to how life is being experienced at the time of filling in the questionnaire. How these energies are distributed allows for a deeper analysis and therapeutic use of the scale. More recently, through research studies, it has also come to light that definite themes emerge among different groups of people. For instance those in the caring professions are likely to be more questioning and flexible in their life approach than top managers in industry, and very high achievers in sport have greater frustration than those whom they beat.Coleman, J.A. (1980), Personality and stress in the shooting sports, Journal for Psychosomatic Research, 24, 286-296Jones, E.S. (2008), Use of the Heimler Scale of Social Functioning within the context of the Edinburgh International Health Centre, unpublished thesis for MPhil, University of Wales at Bangor Administration of the Scale is a simple matter and takes about 15‚Äì20 minutes to complete: scoring the questionnaire allows for an immediate diagnosis of support needs. A deeper analysis of the answers can be deduced in a comparatively short period of time compared with what would otherwise take hours of interviewing. The discipline of this analysis takes time and patience to acquire ‚Äì that of understanding a person's world from within and seeing the logic of that world. Once acquired it is an invaluable aid to genuine understanding and sensitive response. Criticism Criticism has largely centred around the lack of availability of the HSSF for peer review. The copyright that was meant to protect it from abuse in the hands of non-practitioners had the effect of removing it from the critical analysis of those who use psychometric tools. Despite considerable interest and research in its earlier years, this restrictive copyright has continued to prevent appropriate scrutiny. The Eugene Heimler Literary Trust (EHLT) has now accepted this and is taking steps, albeit belatedly to permit the scale to be disseminated more widely for the purpose of such examination. Another area for concern has been the response range to the questions: \\"Yes\\", \\"Perhaps\\" and \\"No\\" have been thought to be too limited and it has been suggested that a Likert scale with a range between 1 and 5 might give more accurate results. Van Breda, a moderate critic of the HSSF, attempted to test this out, using a large number of scales, but found that similar results were obtained when the original scale and the Likert scale were used.Van Breda, A.D. (2003), Enhancing an instrument's measurement properties through extending its response range, unpublished document for the Military Psychological Institute of the South African National Defence Force.

Lesser was one of the chief advisers to the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later known as the Sesame Workshop) in the development and content of the educational programming included in the children's television program Sesame Street. At Harvard, he was chair of the university's Human Development Program for 20 years, which focused on cross- cultural studies of child rearing, and studied the effects of media on young children. In 1974, he wrote Children and Television: Lessons From Sesame Street, which chronicled how Sesame Street was developed and put on the air. Lesser developed many of the research methods the CTW used throughout its history and for other TV shows. In 1968, before the debut of Sesame Street, he led a series of content seminars, an important part of the \\"CTW Model\\", which incorporated educational pedagogy and research into TV scripts and was used to develop other educational programs and organizations all over the world. He died in 2010, at the age of eighty-four, and was survived by his wife, a daughter, a son, and a grandchild. Early life and professional career Lesser was born on August 22, 1926 in Queens. The younger of two children, he grew up in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens and graduated from Jamaica High School. After two years at Columbia University, he served in the United States Navy during World War II and returned to finish his undergraduate degree and earn a master's in psychology at Columbia. He earned a Ph.D. from Yale University in child development and psychology in 1952, studying the effects of visual media on children and the design of educational programming. He married Stella Scharf in 1953. Lesser taught education at Adelphi University and Hunter College, until hired by the Harvard School of Education (HSE) in 1963, where he taught developmental psychology and its application to education. He was also chair of Harvard's Human Development Program for 20 years, which focused on cross-cultural studies of child rearing and was responsible for recruiting developmental psychologists and cultural anthropologists who influenced the studies of child development and education in the U.S. The HSE honored Lesser with a professorship, the Gerald S. Lesser Professor in Early Childhood Development; former Harvard dean Kathleen McCartney was a recipient. Lesser retired in 1998, and was a professor emeritus at Harvard until his death. Lesser's colleagues reported that he had a big impact on his students and colleagues. Even though he worked all over the world, he remained dedicated to his students and \\"remained an integral presence in the lives of his graduate students\\". Lesser was one of the first scholars to study the effect of television on young children.Davis, p. 59 He was hired in 1961 by NBC as an educational consultant for the TV show Exploring, which was created in response to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Newton Minow's charge to the networks to create more quality shows for children. Lesser studied how Exploring helped children learn in order to help the producers improve it, observed children while they watched it, and was able to see how TV shows were produced.Lesser, p. 4 Lesser's experiences at NBC led to his involvement with the development of Sesame Street. In 1964, Lesser wrote, with Gordon Fifer and Donald H. Clark, Mental Abilities of Children in Different Social and Cultural Groups. Random House published his 1974 book Children and Television: Lessons From Sesame Street, which was called a \\"how-to\\" in creating and producing a children's television show, and was an account of the hard work and dedication required to put Sesame Street on the air. Sesame Street In 1967, Lesser was asked to help develop and lead the research department of the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible for the production of Sesame Street and other educational television programs. He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice-president and Sesame Street co-creator Lloyd Morrisett, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale. At first, Lesser was skeptical about the new show's potential and its ability to teach children; according to Morrisett, \\"he took some convincing\\".Davis, p. 118 As Lesser later reported, he would be involved only if he was able to make a real contribution. When he saw that Morrisett and his co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show, and that it would be an \\"experimental venture in education by television\\", he became the first chairman of the CTW's advisory board, a position he held from 1967 to 1997. Lesser was skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first CEO, although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974, she stated in the book's foreword, \\"...I couldn't begin to measure how proud I am to be Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company\\".Cooney, Joan Ganz. \\"Foreword\\", in Lesser, p. xix According to The New York Times, Lesser \\"poured the pedagogy into [Sesame Street], helping ensure from the start that the new, experimental venture in education by television would be both enjoyable and instructive\\". Fellow CTW researchers Edward Palmer and Shalom M. Fisch credited Lesser, along with Cooney and Morrisett, as a main architect of the show, and stated that \\"its extensive use of innovative television techniques meant that it would be highly experimental in nature\\". Lesser and Palmer developed many of the research methods used to study the show's impact on children throughout the show's history.Blatt, event range 0.21.07‚Äì0.32.55 According to Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell, Lesser \\"trail blazed a path for an entire industry\\" and \\"set the standard for education's intersection with media\\".Blatt, event range 0.33.10‚Äì0.39.06 Knell also stated that Lesser challenged the conventional wisdom of the time that television could not teach young children, and proved that \\"TV was something organic in itself; it was a technological species that lived under its own rules of engagement\\". Beginning in June 1968, the CTW conducted a series of seminars at Harvard and in Manhattan, which were led by Lesser. These seminars became an important aspect of \\"the CTW model\\", which incorporated educational pedagogy and research into TV scripts and was used to develop other educational programs and organizations all over the world. The purpose of the seminars was to expose the production team and other filmmakers and illustrators involved in the creative aspects of the new show to scholars, educators, and experts, and to encourage that both groups work together to create a curriculum and goals for the new show. The production team was skeptical regarding the place of research and objective analysis in the production of a television show, but Lesser's previous experience in television, his warm, informal, unpretentious, and collaborative manner, and his proficiency in leading the meetings, convinced them.Davis, p. 117Davis, pp. 139‚Äî140 CTW researcher Keith Mielke stated, \\"He was masterful at running meetings. He was never stiff and formal, but casual and friendly\\". According to producer Sam Gibbon, despite the participants' personalities, experiences, and dispositions, Lesser was the only reason the seminars were successful. Lesser set the meetings' tone and agenda, and recruited the participants. He stated, \\"The message was clear; we were there to work. No pretension was going to be allowed\\".Blatt, event range 0.26.04‚Äì26.07 Lesser never appeared on Sesame Street, but he did appear in the promotional films the CTW created to persuade television stations to air the program. He worked on other CTW shows, including 3-2-1 Contact, Square One TV, and Ghostwriter, and was involved in developing versions of Sesame Street created in other countries. Death A resident of Lexington, Massachusetts, Lesser died at the age of 84 on September 23, 2010, in Burlington, Massachusetts due to a cerebral hemorrhage. He was survived by his wife, a daughter, a son, and a grandchild.

The square is located in the centre of town, 1.4 km north of the Auditorio de Tenerife. This square is considered one of the \\"main squares\\" of the island of Tenerife, together with the Plaza del Cristo de La Laguna in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna and the Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias in Candelaria. It hosts an artificial lake fountain, a work of Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. The square was built in 1929 on the historic Castillo de San Crist√≥bal, a bastion for defending the island of piracy, currently there are only a few walls of the original building on display in a tunnel under the square. Recently the square was refurbished by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Plaza de Espa√±a is surrounded by the Palacio Insular de Tenerife, the Palacio de la Carta and the Plaza de la Candelaria. In the centre of the square stands Monumento a los Ca√≠dos (a tribute to the fallen in the Spanish Civil War).  Location  The plaza is located between Calle del Castillo and the port of Santa Cruz.  History  = Castle of San Crist√≥bal = The location of the square was originally the site of the San Crist√≥bal Castle, which was the city's main line of defense, responsible for defending the port. = Construction of the plaza = The creation of the plaza was first conceived in the 19th century. The square was constructed in 1929. = Refurbishment = The park was refurbished by Herzog & de Meuron in 2006. The refurbishment added a pond and pavilions. In June 2006 the remains of the castle were rediscovered, leading to the creation of an underground gallery to display the castle remains.  Tourist sign  Tourist sign A large sign of the tourist brand of the city (introduced in September 2016) is located at one end of the plaza, adjacent to the lake. The sign reads \\"Santa Cruz\\", short for the tourist slogan of \\"Santa Cruz, el coraz√≥n de Tenerife\\" - \\"Santa Cruz, the heart of Tenerife\\". The letters are white except for the last \\"a\\" of the word Santa, which is an inverted blue heart, on top of which is an upright green heart. Erected in December 2016, the structure is long and high (double that height at the hearts). It is made of galvanised steel with epoxy paint. The sign is repainted in different colors and with different symbols during important events.

Built about 1760, it is a well-preserved example of a Georgian colonial residence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The John Humphrey House is located in Simsbury's rural East Weatogue area, on the west side of East Weatogue Road north of its junction with Talcott Mountain Road. It is a two- story frame house, five bays wide, with a centered entry and a large central chimney. Its exterior is finished in wooden clapboards. Additions extend the main block to the right and rear. The interior follows a typical center- chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule that has a winding staircase to the second floor. On either side of the chimney are parlor spaces, with the original kitchen in a long room behind. The parlor spaces have fine original Georgian wooden paneling; the left parlor has a more elaborate fireplace surround, with fluted pilasters, and an elaborate builtin corner cabinet. The ell extending to the right, a 19th-century addition, retains features period to its original construction, although one of its fireplaces has been bricked over. The house's construction is estimated to have been in 1760, based in part on land records, and in part from the location of the bake oven in the kitchen, which is not typically sited where it is in earlier construction. The land on which it stands was granted to Michael Humphrey in 1668, but there is no firm evidence of a house until 1760, when the estate of his grandson John was inventoried. and See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut References Houses in Simsbury, Connecticut Houses completed in the 18th century Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut British colonial architecture in the United States ","title":"John Humphrey House (Simsbury, Connecticut)"},{"id":"29054561","text":"How to Dress Well is the stage name of Tom Krell, an American multimedia artist, singer-songwriter, and producer from Boulder, Colorado. His experimental musical work has engaged with styles like ambient music and experimental electronic music. Krell also gained recognition under the tag of alternative R&B;, although he has spoken about how this is not something he stands behind. Krell's initial releases were lo-fi, sometimes gothic or depressive, and impressionistic. He began releasing music independently through his own blog around 2009, but began releasing on labels like Tri Angle, Lefse Records, Weird World and eventually Domino later on in his career. He is currently working on his sixth LP and touring behind his 2018 LP The Anteroom. Biography =Early life and education= Krell was born in Boulder, Colorado. He is a high school dropout, finishing his pre-college schooling by alternative means. Krell then received a BA from Cornell College in Iowa before graduating from The New School with an MA in Philosophy in 2008. He then moved from New York City to spend a year in K√∂ln, Germany; he has also spent extensive time in Berlin, Germany. He then returned to the United States, moving to Chicago and joining the philosophy department at DePaul University where he is writing a doctoral dissertation on nihilism and German philosophy in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. In 2016 Krell moved to Los Angeles, where he has since been making music and writing his dissertation. =Career= Formation Beginning in 2009, Krell started to turn out free EPs on his blog under the name How to Dress Well. He released 6 EPs in 6 months. He didn't release his name or his photo, but critics quickly picked up on Krell's music and brought him out of the shadows. Love Remains (2010) How to Dress Well's debut album, Love Remains, was released in 2010 on Lefse in the United States and on Tri Angle in Europe and Asia. The album assembled the best of Krell's early EPs and garnered vast critical acclaim. It received a score of 8.7 and the \\"Best New Music\\" designation from music review site Pitchfork Media. Stereogum recognized How to Dress Well as one of its \\"40 Best Bands of 2010\\". Spin gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, calling it \\"as meditative as it is evocative... conjuring fractured memories of Shai or TLC\\". Just Once EP (2011) In 2011, How to Dress Well released the Just Once EP ‚Äî a four-song suite of \\"Suicide Dream\\" songs set against a string quartet. The EP collects two previously released tracks bearing the name \\"Suicide Dream\\", adds a third with that title, and throws in a new version of \\"Decisions\\". The set was inspired by and is dedicated to a friend of Krell's who died. Limited to 1000 copies, the 10\\" vinyl release donated $1 of every record sold to a nonprofit working to raise awareness about mental illness. Total Loss (2012) Krell performing in 2013 On the heels of the success of Love Remains, Krell signed a deal with Weird World Records, an imprint of Domino Records. Total Loss was released on September 18, 2012 in North America by Acephale Records and worldwide through Weird World Records. Krell wrote the album over the course of 15 months or so, in Brooklyn, Chicago, Nashville, and London. The album received a ‚ÄúBest New Music‚Äù nod from Pitchfork Media, where Ian Cohen wrote that it is \\"a work of poignant and devastating art.\\" It was also named by Pitchfork as one of the \\"Top 50 Albums of 2012\\". \\"What Is This Heart?\\" (2014) In April 2014, How to Dress Well released the first single off their forthcoming third studio album, \\"Repeat Pleasure\\". The album was released on June 23, 2014 via Domino Records / Weird World Records and was very well received by music critics, earning an 8.8 and ‚ÄúBest New Music‚Äù designation from Pitchfork. Paste Magazine noted that ‚ÄúKrell has managed to indulge his experimental tendencies while at the same time achieve his most accessible sound to date.‚Äù Capitalizing on the success of \\"What Is This Heart?\\", How to Dress Well embarked on a world tour, beginning in the spring of 2014. The tour started off with shows in Europe, and continued on to include stops in North America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and cities throughout Asia. The band performed at a number of major European, North American and Asian festivals, including Flow Festival, Hostess Club Weekender, and Pitchfork Music Festival, to name a few. Care (2016) On July 27, 2016 How To Dress Well announced his fourth full-length album, Care. He also released the album's first single ‚ÄúLost Youth / Lost You‚Äù along with an accompanying music video.

On September 19, 2016 KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic premiered the next single \\"Can't You Tell.\\" Care was released on September 23, 2016 on Weird World / Domino Records, and was very well received by critics. The New York Times commented that the songs on Care \\"build dreamlike edifices of electronic and acoustic sounds: sometimes anthemic, sometimes danceable\\" and Stereogum raved \\"there‚Äôs the music itself, which is fucking gorgeous, which goes beyond even the levels of gorgeousness that Krell managed on 2014‚Äôs great ‚ÄúWhat Is This Heart?‚Äù The Line of Best Fit wrote \\"Care is as close to a perfect example of modern music as you're likely to find ‚Äì it‚Äôs self-reliant, self-assured and packed with more hooks than a cloakroom.\\" The Anteroom (2018) In September 2018, How To Dress Well announced his fifth studio album, The Anteroom. It was created as a 'testament' to a two-year period in his life where he \\"felt [himself] slipping out of the world and into a cosmic loneliness in which [he] would eventually be dissolved\\". With the album, he sought to explore the experimental sounds of his early work, as well as influences from the works of Coil, Prurient, Gas and Grouper. It was released on October 19.

She was involved in a theological controversy among the Quakers, which led to her joining the Anglican Church. Her books reflect a literal belief in biblical Creation: \\"A watch must have a watchmaker.\\" Life and family Maria was born to John Barton (1755‚Äì1789) and his wife Maria Done (1752‚Äì1784) in Carlisle on 16 February 1777. Both her parents were Quakers. The family moved to London before Maria's mother died. Her father married again to Elizabeth Horne (1760‚Äì1833) of Tottenham, with whose family Mary lived after her father's death. Maria married the Chichester currier Stephen Hack (1775‚Äì1823) on 17 November 1800 in Tottenham. The Hacks had four sons and six daughters. At some point the family moved from Chichester to Gloucester. Her eldest son, John Barton Hack (1805‚Äì1884), emigrated to South Australia, as did her youngest, Stephen (1816‚Äì1894). Both later left the Quakers. Her daughter Margaret Emily (1814‚Äì1886) also wrote educational books, and married Thomas Gates Darton (1810‚Äì1887) of Darton and Harvey, the publisher of some of her mother's books. Another son, Thomas Sandon Hack (1811‚Äì1865) was an architect who designed several buildings in Southampton, including the Royal Southern Yacht Club (opened 1846) and the original Royal South Hants Infirmary (opened 1844). Hack, influenced by the Evangelicalism of her time, became involved in a religious controversy among the Quakers, supporting a Manchester minister, Isaac Crewdson, in arguing that Scripture, not Inner Light, should be the ultimate authority and that the sacraments of Baptism and Communion should be performed. She left the Quakers in 1837 and joined the Anglican Church soon after, as a sister and three of her children had already done. Her contribution to the controversy was a tract entitled The Christian Ordinances and the Lord's Supper... (1837). Hack moved from Gloucester to Southampton in about 1842 and died there on 4 January 1844.Rosemary Mitchell: Hack, Maria... Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). Retrieved 4 October 2010. Writings According to a younger brother, the poet Bernard Barton (1784‚Äì1849), Maria was an \\"oracle\\" to him in his youth.Selections from the poems and letters of Bernard Barton, ed. L[ucy] Barton (London: Hall, Virtue & Co., 1849), Her interest in education began with her own family and soon extended into writing. The earliest of many books is thought to have been First Lessons in English Grammar (1812). Winter Evenings (1818) teaches geography through travellers' tales told to two children. The same approach was taken in Grecian Stories (1819) and English Stories (1820‚Äì25). Others of her textbooks covered geology and optics. Some of these were still being reprinted in the 1870s. Hack's best known work was Harry Beaufoy, or, The Pupil of Nature (1821), in which a boy is encouraged by his parents to look closely at creation and discover the marks of a Creator, for \\"a watch must have a watchmaker\\" (p. 183). Other examples given as marks of God's creation are the circulation of the blood and the workings of a beehive.

The film stars Nandamuri Balakrishna and Mohini while Amrish Puri, Tinnu Anand, and Suthivelu play supporting roles with a soundtrack composed by Ilaiyaraaja. Considered as the first Indian film based on time travel, Aditya 369 dealt with exploratory dystopian and apocalyptic themes. The film opened to critical acclaim and was a big commercial success. The film received two Nandi Awards for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction. It was dubbed into Hindi as Mission 369 and into Tamil as Apoorva Sakthi 369.  Plot  In 1991, Prof. Ramdas is a scientist who does vigorous experiments to invent the time machine at his home laboratory. Even after tremendous efforts, the machine does not seem to work. Meanwhile, Raja Verma, a high-profile thief has a peculiar hobby of burglary of antique pieces from the world's museums. His henchmen steal a 16th-century diamond, belonging to the period of the Vijayanagara empire from the Salar Jung Museum. The robbery is witnessed by Kishore, a school kid who is trapped in the museum on his school excursion. He manages to escape from the robbers and gets rescued by Krishna Kumar. However, no one believes Kishore, and the diamond is replaced by its duplicate in the museum. Kishore gets to know that Prof. Ramdas is working on the time machine through his daughter Hema. One night, he along with other kids set it off in an attempt to go the day of the robbery. Hema and her fianc√© Krishna Kumar rescue them but get accidentally trapped in the machine. The time machine takes off and visits the past, to the reign of the emperor Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara empire in the year 1526. There, Krishna Kumar saves Simhanandini, a dancer in the royal court of Krishnadevaraya from an attempted raid, and she introduces them to the Emporer. Krishna Kumar surprises Krishnadevaraya by reciting the poem of his court's poet Tenali Ramakrishna before it's even written and explains to him that they have come from the future. Though Krishnadevaraya finds it hard to believe, he nevertheless offers them hospitality. A police constable who also happens to be trapped in the machine joins them. Later one night, they catch the sight of the stolen diamond which is then in the possession of Krishnadevaraya. The emperor tells that when moonlight on the night of Karthika Punnami falls on the diamond, it radiates seven colours of the rainbow. Fascinated by it, they stay back to witness the event. It is also prophesied that the diamond would be stolen twice, once in the emperor's reign and again after 500 years. Later, Simhanandini who lusts on Krishna Kumar accuses him of cheating her. However, Krishna Kumar is deemed innocent after a trial. To seek revenge, Simhanandini conspires with Senadhipathi to frame Krishna Kumar in the diamond's robbery. Upon witnessing the diamond in Krishna Kumar's hand in a tussle with Senadhipathi, Krishnadevaraya sentences him to death. Though on the day of the execution, Krishnadevaraya who believes Krishna Kumar's innocence saves him. This is later confirmed to him by Ramakrishna who witnesses the diamond being robbed by Senadhipathi. Krishna Kumar, Hema, and the constable escape and board the time machine which sets off again. The machine takes them to the year 2504, a dystopian world destroyed by radiation after the end of the Third World War. Scientists of that era who already know about their arrival, receive them. In this era, the entire city is built in the underground and is powered by Krishnadevaraya's diamond. During their stay, they also watch the news from the year 1991. It reports that the diamond is retrieved from Raja Verma with the efforts of Krishna Kumar but he is killed in the process. The malfunctioning time machine is now repaired and when the environment begins to negatively affect them, they leave. The time machine brings them back to the present.

He was a major contributor to the newspaper The Hindu for more than two decades, becoming a household name with his front-page articles every day. The G. K. Reddy National Memorial Award for Journalism is given in his memory.  Early life  Reddy was born in Nellore, Madras Presidency (now in Andhra Pradesh), in 1923.\\"Remembering G. K. Reddy\\" in , reprinted from Blitz, 29 August 1987.  Career  = Kashmir = Reddy's journalistic career began as the editor of the newspaper Kashmir Times in the then princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in the 1940s. Reddy also served as the correspondent for the Associated Press of India in Srinagar, reporting to its Lahore chief Malik Tajuddin.Mir Abdul Aziz, Good old days, Greater Kashmir, 3 January 2011. Kashmir Times, owned and published by Abdul Rahman Mittha in Srinagar, advocated accession of the state to the Dominion of Pakistan. Reddy's coverage of the events in Kashmir was highly prized in Pakistan and regularly reported on Radio Pakistan in Lahore. By 7 October 1947, the Government of Maharaja Hari Singh imposed rigorous press censorship in the state and told Kashmir Times to cease the publication of accession matters. The newspaper suspended publication in protest. Reddy was detained at Domel near Muzaffarabad for 10 days in mid-October. After that, he was transported to Kathua under military escort and expelled from the state at the Pathankot border. Mitha was also externed at the same time and sent over to Pakistan, and he worked with the Muslim Conference leader Sardar Ibrahim leading a rebellion against the Maharaja's government. Reddy went to Lahore by 19 October,: \\"Mr. G. K. Reddy, former Editor of the Kashmir Times who has been externed from Kashmir for advocating the State's accession to Pakistan, arrived in Lahore on Sunday.\\" to work for the Associated Press of India, which was still a united agency across India and Pakistan (but would later split into the Associated Press of India and the Associated Press of Pakistan). Reddy was incensed with the treatment of Muslims by the Maharaja's government. On 26 October, he gave a detailed interview to the Lahore-based daily Civil & Military Gazette, where he described the \`mad orgy of Dogra violence' against unarmed Muslims in the Jammu province. While in Lahore, on 21 October 1947, Reddy received a phone call from Lt. Col. Alavi, the Public Relations Officer of the Pakistan Army headquarters in Rawalpindi, stating that the Ramkot post of Kashmir was being attacked that night and the news should be published as coming from the Azad Kashmir Headquarters in Palandri. He was also told that all further news of the invasion would come from the Rawalpindi headquarters and the practice of a Palandri dateline should be maintained. He was subsequently forced into the position of Director of Public Relations for the rebel forces in Kashmir and only managed to escape seven months later. In Rawalpindi, Sardar Ibrahim was proclaimed as the head of a provisional government of Azad Kashmir on 24 October, with nominal headquarters at Palandri. Mitha and Reddy worked with the new government to create press releases. They stayed at the 'Poonch House' in Rawalpindi. They were also close to the Chief Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan of the Northwest Frontier Province, and acted as press advisors to him as well. At some point, Reddy is believed to have been interned by Pakistani authorities who regarded him as a spy. He escaped to India in 1948, and the evidence he carried with him of the US and Pakistan involvement in the invasion of Kashmir was published in the weekly Blitz in a series of articles starting 9 June 1948, causing a national and international sensation.B. K. Karanjia, \\"G. K. with Blitz\\" in = India = Reddy worked for the Blitz from 1948 to 1951, writing incisive articles that put him up against the Government authorities. His journalistic accreditation was cancelled twice by the authorities due to his irksome coverage. While at Blitz, Reddy also wrote a \\"Delhi Daily\\" column with humorous coverage of Delhi's developments, which used to rock the capital into splits of laughter. B. K. Karanjia mentions that Reddy's output from Delhi was so prolific that they had to sometimes produce mid-week editions of Blitz. In 1951, Reddy became the foreign correspondent to The Times of India. He reported from various locations such as Korea, Beijing, Taipei, Bandung and London. His lively \\"Letter from London\\" was published in The Times of India every week.

Fiorano is situated in the vicinity of Rome near the Via Appia Antica in the Latium district. Famed wine writer Burton Anderson dubbed Fiorano's wines 'the noblest Romans of them all' in his 1980 anthology Vino.Anderson, Burton (1980). Vino. The Wine and Winemakers of Italy. Little Brown & Co. The estate, its methods, wines and its proprietor were all noted for their unorthodoxy in comparison to norms of the wine industry.Asimov, Eric, The New York Times (December 22, 2004). An Italian Prince and His Magic CellarAsimov, Eric, The New York Times: The Pour (December 10, 2009). A Family Gets Back to Its Roots Though limited in terms of fame, the red wine and two white wines produced at Fiorano during its period of activity achieved reputations for innovation and longevity.Dallas, Philip (1974). The Great Wines of Italy. Doubleday. pp. 293; 296. Since the late 1960s a small number of devout 'cognoscenti', especially among restaurant owners in Rome, knew about the extraordinary qualities of the two whites Fiorano Bianco (100% Malvasia) and Fiorano Riserva Semillon, and overcame numerous obstacles in order to get the wines. History While the Boncompagni Ludovisi family lineage may be traced back ca. 1,000 years, the Fiorano estate, located from Rome, had viticulture from local grape varieties first starting in the 1930s.Parzen, Jeremy, vinowire.com (March 29, 2008). Fiorano Rosso 91, 89, 86 Prince Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi inherited the estate in 1946, and replaced the existing vines with the Bordeaux international grape varieties of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and S√©millon as well as Malvasia di Candia. This change of viticultural direction took place several years ahead of what later became a trend. Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi also practiced organic agriculture during an era when chemical agriculture methods were more commonplace.Yarrow, Alder, vinography.com (December 12, 2005). 1986 Fiorano (Boncompagni Ludovisi) Malvasia Bianca VdT Botte 25, Latium, ItalyYarrow, Alder, vinography.com (May 11, 2006). 1989 Fiorano (Boncompagni Ludovisi) Botte 48 Semillion, Roma, Italy This happened after consultation with Dr. Giuseppe Palieri who remained an advisor until his death. Later, Boncompagni Ludovisi received advice from Dr. Tancredi Biondi Santi, of whom he was a fan since tasting a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino Biondi Santi 1946 which he described in letter to him as \\"a majestic red, severe, masculine, medieval\\".O'Keefe, Kerin (2005). Franco Biondi Santi. The gentleman of Brunello. Veronelli Editore. The wines were almost unknown until Italy's famous wine and food critic Luigi Veronelli discovered them by chance in the early 1960s. Veronelli recounted his first meeting with the Prince: 'I was in Latium writing on the region's wines, and while driving on the ancient Appian Way I spotted the most beautiful vineyards. I followed the road until I came to an imposing estate where I stopped and rang the bell. When nobody responded I tried the gate and found it open. Audaciously I went in and was walking around when I suddenly heard the sound of horse hooves racing up behind me. I turned and found myself looking down the barrel of a gun.' After Veronelli explained who he was and his interest in the vineyards, the Prince invited Veronelli to try his wines. 'As soon as I tried his wines, I knew he truly was a prince' said Veronelli, who convinced him to sell some of the wines, up to then only for personal consumption. Luigi Veronelli stated that Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi was the first to employ \\"biological farming\\" practices in Italy. He compared Fiorano red wines to Sassicaia, and once wrote of them, \\"They enchant you with the first taste, burrow in your memory and make you forever better\\", and, \\"If I lived in Rome, I would beg for them at the prince's door every morning\\". It was the whites though that most impressed him. The Fiorano Bianco from Malvasia di Candia soared to new heights of complexity while the Semillon, a variety that has never had much success in Italy, astounded Veronelli. The relationship between Boncompagni Ludovisi and his wine merchants has been described as strained due to the Prince's eccentric manner of doing business. Over time, import of the wines ceased, and although wine was made until 1995, the sale of bottles had ended some time before. Elio Mariani, owner of the Checchino restaurant in Rome, confirms that the Prince was unusually stubborn. According to Mariani: 'The Prince never really wanted to sell the wines. He made it very difficult; one had to call up to order the wines and come in person to collect them on the assigned day at a specified time and bring the exact amount in cash. They would not give change, and cheques were out of the question.' In 1966 Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi's sole daughter Francesca married Piero Antinori, a winemaker with a reputation associated with the modernist wine movement. When Boncompagni Ludovisi pulled out nearly all Fiorano vines following the 1995 harvest while giving no explanation, subsequent rumours claimed this was in order to prevent his son-in-law from ruining the Fiorano legacy. Antinori told Eric Asimov that he believed Boncompagni Ludovisi could not bear the thought of anybody else making his wines after he could no longer do it himself. In a 2001 interview, Boncompagni Ludovisi stated that his reasons were the vines' advanced age and poor health. Due to his poor health Prince Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi went to live in Rome. His cousin Prince Paolo Boncompagni Ludovisi and his son Alessandrojacopo came to help him run the estate. Recognizing Alessandrojacopo‚Äôs passion for the job, Prince Alberico gave him the replanting rights and a small portion of the estate and, considering him as his successor, suggested he replant the vineyard (The Prince said he would destroy all his vines rather than see Piero get hold of them. I do not think he likes the modern methods that Piero uses to make Antinori wine. When the Prince was asked if he would save the vines for his grandchildren, he said that they learned about wine from their father, Piero, and not from him.). Under Prince Alberico‚Äôs precise instructions, Alessandrojacopo restored the vineyard by planting Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot to resume production of Fiorano Rosso wine. As for the white grapes, Prince Alberico insisted that the old varieties be abandoned in favor of Grechetto and Viognier to make Fiorano Bianco wine. Alessandrojacopo did everything Prince Alberico told him to do, from the choice of soils, to the clones and the system of vine-training, all done by organic method, right through to the making of the wine which is still done with the same craftsmanship as under Prince Alberico. In other words, Alberico gave all his past experience. Alessandrojacopo inherited Tenuta di Fiorano estate after Prince Alberico died in 2005, enhanced its vineyards and put Fiorano Rosso back on the market starting with vintage 2006. Today Tenuta di Fiorano is run by Prince Alessandrojacopo Boncompagni Ludovisi and extends for a total of some 200 hectares including vineyards, olive groves, and crop and pasture land. And above all there is the historic cellar with the wines that Prince Alberico so jealously conserved and where only a lucky few, including Veronelli, were allowed to visit. Out of respect for Prince Alberico Alessandrojacopo continues this tradition even today. Production From a vineyard area of , three wines were produced at the estate, one Rosso, a red Bordeaux-style blend from plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot,Asimov, Eric, The New York Times: The Pour (April 24, 2009). Bygone Bottles and two white varietal wines, a S√©millon and a Malvasia di Candia. The grapes are pruned to extremely reduced yields described as \\"ridiculously low\\", which resulted in marked levels of flavour concentration.Albertson, Lynda, The American (January 12, 2006). Grape Expectations The wine is aged in large numbered barrels which are reused every year. The Fiorano cellars have a widespread culture of white mold that covered the barrels and bottles, which Boncompagni Ludovisi believed to be beneficial to his production and left to develop undisturbed.

In 1943, nearly all the families of the Jewish community in Podhajce, Eastern Galicia, about 3,000 Jews, were slaughtered by the Nazis. A small group, many of them children and teenagers, escaped from the Podhajce (Pidhaytsi) Ghetto on the eve of its liquidation, and survived the Nazi extermination finding their way to the Bilecki farm. They were hidden in various bunkers near the Bilecki family farm for almost a year until they were liberated by the Russian Army on March 27, 1944.http://www.shoah.dk/Courage/Bilecki.htm  Early/Family life  Julian Bilecki was born in 1928, eleven years before the start of WW2. His father's name was Yevgenyi Biletskiy, and his sister was Anna Kifor (n√©e Biletskaya). He had a cousin name Roman Biletskiy, who played a key role in hiding the Jews with him.  War years  right On the eve of Shavout, with the liquidation of the ghetto the next day, 120 Jews escaped, after being attacked by Ukrainian Nationalists only 23 were left. On June 6, 1943, the Bilecki family heard a knock on their door, they were surprised to see their friends, neighbors, and even a few strange faces. The Bilecki's decided to take them in and with their family and the few strong, abled men in the group decided to build a bunker in the woods and camouflage it with twigs and branches. The biggest problem was providing food. Food was scarce during these times, but how do you feed 23 extra people without arousing suspicion? Somehow the Bilecki family was able to do it. Soon the bunker was discovered by those passer-by, scared for their friends lives the Bileckis were forced to look for another location to build another bunker. In the winter, the ground was covered with snow on the ground would show prints to and from the hiding place. A survivor Mrs. Grau Schnitzer, recalled how a young Julian Bilecki would jump from tree to tree in to deliver necessary items to his Jewish friends in order to avoid leaving tracks in the snow.  Later Years  After the Bilecki Jews were liberated on March 27, 1944 everyone went their separate ways, some immigrated to the US such as Julian's cousin Roman, and some stayed in Europe as Julian himself did. Over the years, the survivors sent packages of food and clothing to the Bilecki family who remained poor in Ukraine as well as correspond with them by letters. Half a century later Bilecki (a retired bus driver), and his son Jaroslav flew to NYC thanks to the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous where he was able to be reunited with 5 survivors in the JFK airport terminal. Bilecki with tears in his eyes then said, \\"I see you all have gray hair. I too have gray hair. I thought I would never see you again. I feel lost. I thought this would never happen. All I did was help. It is very pleasant that people remember. Now I am getting paid back by God\\".

He subsequently exhibited with Durand-Ruel, to whom he remained under contract for the rest of his life. Returning from Brittany, Maufra was the first painter to take up residence in the Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, a famous Parisian residence for artists. He returned to Brittany each year, in particular to the Quiberon region. He found inspiration for his art in his travels which took him to the Dauphin√© (1904), the Midi (1912), Algeria (1913) and Savoy (1914). Work Maufra was mainly an artist of landscapes and marine views. In his compositions, Maufra sometimes quoted the pointillist technique of Camille Pissarro or Alfred Sisley, and also took from the strong colors and powerful drawing of the Pont-Aven School. Maufra remained an independent artist his all life through and dedicated his art to recording the beauty of nature. He also explored etching and lithography.

Early life Little is known of her early life although records indicate that she was originally a slave, belonging to Captain William Cornwallis, brother of Charles, Earl Cornwallis. The details of her release from slavery are also not known although there are references suggesting that she and Captain Cornwallis were lovers. When freed she was appointed by Cornwallis as his housekeeper whilst he remained in Jamaica. On his departure, she settled permanently in Port Royal and began her career treating sailors for the many and varied diseases and injuries they sustained. She purchased a small house which she converted into a combination of rest home, hotel and hospital. Famous patients Cubah became so well known for her treatment of the sick that in 1780 when Horatio Nelson, then a captain, fell ill with dysentery during an expedition to Nicaragua, he was taken to her by Admiral Parker, the commander-in-chief of the Royal Naval forces in Jamaica. Later she was entrusted with the treatment of Prince William Henry, later William IV when he was stationed in the West Indies. The Prince was so grateful to Cubah that many years later he told the story to his wife, Queen Adelaide. The Queen was so grateful that she sent Cubah a dress that was so expensive and beautiful that Cubah refused to wear it. She wore the dress only once in 1848 as her funerary gown. According to Jamaican mixed- race campaigner and author Richard Hill, Nelson too remarked in his correspondence to friends and family how indebted he was to Cubah. Whenever a friend or colleague was despatched to Jamaica he requested that they pass his good wishes to her. Although it is not known when she was born, Cubah must have lived a long life. It is documented that she assisted in Nelson's recovery in 1780 and was, by then, already an established and respected figure on the island. Her date of death, 68 years later, is a testament to her longevity. Herbal practice Cubah, and other nurses in the West Indies during the period, treated patients with traditional home remedies, often mistaken for magic, religion or witchcraft. These women thought and misunderstood with magical practices and often feared or respected or loved depending on the \\"magic\\" they cast and the individual over whom they cast it. Their magic was little more than hygiene, a healthier diet than could have been expected on board ship and a positive attitude. Another contemporary \\"doctress\\" of Cubah's was Sarah Adams, who also practised good hygiene and used herbal remedies throughout her long career. Adams also worked in Port Royal, and she died in 1849. Other Jamaican doctresses of the 18th century included Mrs Grant, the mother of Mary Seacole, and Grace Donne, who nursed Jamaica's wealthiest planter, Simon Taylor. Cubah Cornwallis, Mrs Grant, Grace Donne and Sarah Adams used hygienic practices long before it became one of the main planks in the reforms of Florence Nightingale, in her book Notes on Nursing in 1859.\\"notes on nursing by florence nightingale\\" References External links  * Female wartime nurses 1848 deaths Women of the Victorian era People from Kingston, Jamaica Jamaican nurses Year of birth unknown Obeah 19th-century Jamaican people ","title":"Cubah Cornwallis"},{"id":"29054759","text":"Varicostele is a genus of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Streptaxidae.

A sequel to the 1999 comedy film East Is East, it was written by Ayub Khan-Din and produced by Leslee Udwin for Assassin Films and BBC Films. The film was first shown at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September. It premiered at the BFI London Film Festival on 19 October 2010, followed by UK and Irish release on 25 February 2011. The first US showing was on 2 November 2010 at the South Asian International Film Festival, followed by several other US festivals. While it was released in Canada on 25 March 2011, it never received a US release. Plot In 1976, five years after the original film East Is East, little is known about most of the Khan children, except that they seldom communicate with their parents. Tariq is now a hippie (looking like George Harrison) who runs a new age store with older brother Nazir, and his English girlfriend is unaware of his true ethnicity. Maneer lives with his extended family in Pakistan where he is searching for a suitable wife, but without success. Sajid, the youngest Khan child, no longer wears a parka, and is a truant constantly bullied due to his Pakistani background, but the headmaster‚Äîa former British soldier who served in the Punjab‚Äîis sympathetic, encouraging him to embrace his heritage. After Sajid is caught shoplifting, his father George, who has retained his bullying nature, attacks him at home. When Sajid retaliates, calling him a \\"dirty Paki bastard\\", a devastated George states all his other children in England have become British and he cannot lose Sajid as well. He takes him to Pakistan to meet their extended family and show him life in their native land is better, though Ella openly disapproves. On arriving in Pakistan, George and Sajid are greeted by relatives including Tanvir, a lazy man who often tries to swindle George‚Äîand is his son-in-law through his marriage to one of George's daughters with his first wife Basheera. On the family farm, George is reunited with Basheera and their daughters whom he had abandoned thirty years before, and hands out gifts to all, telling them he is staying for a month to find Maneer a wife, but soon discovers no family will give their daughter away as they fear Maneer will leave his wife for an English woman as his father George did when he left Basheera for Ella. Furious, George blames his family in England, but Maneer reminds him he himself is at fault. Basheera is also angry with George for abandoning her when she needed him. When Tanvir explains to Sajid he will not tolerate any trouble, he is abruptly told to \\"fuck off\\". Sajid is taken to the local school for enrolment where he meets spiritual teacher Pir Naseem and local boy Zaid who Sajid loathes at first, and refuses to enrol. Zaid, who can speak basic English, advises him, and the two become firm friends. Zaid teaches him Pakistani culture, and Pir Naseem promises George he will discipline his son when he misbehaves. Sajid gradually appreciates his culture and new surroundings which pleases George, except he is slightly jealous of the bond between his son and Pir Naseem. Eventually Sajid discovers Rochdale- born Pakistani woman Neelam who bears a striking resemblance to Maneer's favourite singer Nana Mouskouri; like Maneer she is also looking for a spouse in Pakistan, and with her approval Sajid plans a meeting between the pair. Meanwhile, upon discovering George has withdrawn the family savings, Ella travels to Pakistan with her best friend Annie in tow. She is furious to discover her husband is building a house for his family there, and plans to take Sajid back to England with her, but he refuses to leave. During her stay, Ella fights with Basheera and her daughters, and refuses to give them access to the new house, but upon realising how alike they are the two women put their differences aside. Maneer and Neelam soon marry, and George for the first time in years begins to appreciate Ella as a wife who stood by him during hard times. The film ends with George and his England-based family returning home and Sajid finally proud of his Asian background, whilst George's chippy now serves Pakistani-style kebabs.

Smith regards the album as a new form of narrative rock music, which he calls \\"songstory\\". Curly's Airships tells about the R101 airship, crashing in France during its maiden overseas voyage in 1930. Amongst many others, Peter Hammill, Hugh Banton, Arthur Brown, David Jackson, John Ellis and Pete Brown perform on the project. Smith believes that the 2 hr 20 min work might be one of the largest and most ambitious single piece of rock music ever recorded. The Clash's album Sandinista! (1980) is 13 seconds longer. Production Smith worked on the project for many years, between 1993 and its release in 2000. The writing alone took two years. Smith was able to finance the project thanks to a small grant from the National Lottery, distributed by the Arts Council in a scheme called A4E, Arts For Everyone. A part of the recording was done in the Cathedral of Saint Pierre in Beauvais, the city near the R101 disaster, where Hugh Banton played the organ. Another part was recorded in Cardington parish church, which was the local church for the Airship Works, and yet another part was recorded inside the (extremely large) R101's shed at Cardington. Mixing and mastering of the album, by David Lord, took almost a year to complete. Release On HTV, 10 July 1997, a documentary about the project was shown in the arts series Frieze Frame. The film contains parts where Lene Lovich can be seen, playing Marthe, Princess Bibesco, who was Lord Thomson's lover. However, Lene Lovich/Marthe Bibesco does not perform in the songstory. The release of Curly's Airships on 5 October 2000 coincided with the 70th anniversary of the R101 disaster of 1930. On exactly the same point where the original airship crossed the English coast on its maiden voyage to India in 1930, some of the creators of Curly's Airships launched two model airships on their way to France, each one carrying a voucher for a free copy of the album. Themes Musically, Curly's Airships embraces rock, jazz, tango, Indian music and eerie atmospherics, with repeated passages identifying key characters' appearances. Basically, the line-up is vocals, guitars, organs, bass and drums, with some saxophone touches. There is no rhyme and no regular metre, and the vocal lines of many sections are single, non-repeating tunes. This sets Curly's Airships musically apart from many \\"regular\\" rock or rock opera albums. As for its subject matter, Curly's Airships sketches images of post-WW1 bravery, obedience and stupidity, resulting in the disaster. The events are seen through the eyes of Curly McLeod, a fictional aviator. Almost all other persons and events though are based on reality, like Lord Thomson, whose part is performed by Peter Hammill. The libretto (a 44-page booklet) contains many 1920s slang words.

Club career Born in Ibi, Valencian Community, Arcos started his managerial career with Pe√±a Madridista de Ibi. In 2002 he joined CD Torrevieja as a fitness coach, and three years later moved to UD Altea and was assigned the same role. Arcos moved abroad in 2006, being named in Zoran Vuliƒá's staff at HNK Hajduk Split, as a fitness coach.

Hunt is the author of the Biblical Counseling Library, a 100-volume collection of topical, Biblical counseling manuals, that serves as the foundation for Hope for the Heart's international broadcasts, training, publishing, teaching and biblical counseling ministry. Hunt's two radio broadcasts‚ÄîHope in the Night, a live 2-hour call-in counseling program, and Hope for the Heart, a half-hour teaching program‚Äîair on approximately 900 radio outlets worldwide. Early years Hunt was born as daughter of H. L. Hunt and Ruth Ray. She grew up in Dallas, where Hunt attended the Hockaday School. Hunt then graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1966SMU M Award Recipients ListSMU Rotunda Yearbook for 1966 with a Bachelor of Music degree, and later earned a Master of Arts degree in Counseling from Criswell College,  Career  Hunt initially worked as Junior High Division Director‚Äîand later as College & Career Director‚Äîat First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, overseeing the spiritual formation of 1,200 members combined. In these roles, she was often called on to answer questions from students and parents about Christian living. Later, as a conference speaker, she was likewise approached by conference-goers to answer questions about \\"what the Bible has to say\\" on a myriad of topics. To respond to these questions, Hunt created curriculum for a multi-year Bible survey course. Between 1989 and 1992, she developed and taught Counseling Through The Bible, a scripturally-based counseling course addressing 100 topics in categories such as marriage and family, rocky relationships, emotional entrapments, Christian apologetics, as well as addictions and abuse. Since then, the coursework has been continuously refined to form the basis for the Biblical Counseling Library, composed of 100 topical training manuals, each called Biblical Counseling Keys. The Counseling Library has served as the foundation of the ministry's steady expansion, including the 2002 creation of the Hope Biblical Counseling Institute (BCI). Initiated by Dallas' Criswell College, the Institute equips spiritual leaders, counselors, and other caring people to find solutions for emotional, relational and spiritual problems. During this time, Hunt also appeared as a guest on numerous national TV and radio programs, including NBC's Today Show. She also toured overseas with the USO and was a guest soloist with the Billy Graham Crusades. Hope for the Heart Hope for the Heart's Biblical Counseling Library provides a foundation for Hunt's two daily radio programs, Hope for the Heart and Hope in the Night. Hope for the Heart is a half-hour of interactive teaching. Hope in the Night is a live two-hour call-in counseling program. Together, the programs air worldwide on nearly 900 radio outlets. The ministry is growing internationally as the Biblical Counseling Keys have been published in more than 30 languages and are being translated into many more. They can be found in more than 60 countries on six continents. HOPE-sponsored walk-in counseling centers operate internationally. In Canada, the ministry airs a Chinese language version of HOPE's radio briefs, Moment of Hope, and sponsors a call center through which Chinese-speaking listeners receive biblical counsel. In 2008, Hope for the Heart created a new Chair of Biblical Counseling at Criswell College. The Biblical Counseling Library is required curriculum for counseling students enrolled in this program. Recent Updates Hunt is the founder and CEO of The Hope Center in Plano, Texas, a permanent home for nearly 50 nonprofit Christian ministries that share common space, a technology backbone, and amenities under one roof. Hope for the Heart is the Center's anchor tenant and offers walk-in counseling by appointment at the Center. Hunt has been a regular guest professor at colleges and seminaries. She trains peers annually at the American Association of Christian Counselors conference and speaks at numerous other national and international conferences, as well as religious and broadcasting events each year on topics such as forgiveness, anger, fear, childhood sexual abuse, and domestic violence.

Its masthead for some years described itself as, \\"Authentic World News on Steam Power for Cars, Launches and Small Stationary Units\\".  Publishing history  The magazine was self-published by its editor John Ness Walton of Kirk Michael, Isle of Man. It began when he took over an earlier magazine, Steam Car Developments and Steam Marine Motors in 1945, renaming this in 1949. For most of its existence it was published bi-monthly, although the first and last volumes were published at three- and four-month intervals. In its last years, from 1977 it changed its name to Steam Power and re-located to Loughborough. The magazine continued under this name until 1981. In more recent years, there was a website maintaining the magazine's archives, but this has now gone. In 2009 an agreement was made with the National Steam Car Association for them to hold the rights to Light Steam Power and other Walton publications. Mr. Walton died March 19, 2013, aged 91.  Coverage The two main applications of steam power covered were steam cars and small steam launches. Much of the magazine's content was influenced, if not indeed written, by skilled and enthusiastic amateurs describing their own projects and so their choice of these projects influenced the magazine's own direction. Steam turbines and large steamships were less frequent, being beyond the constructional capacity of most readers, but they were described as news items when particularly interesting events took place. One aspect that oddly was only lightly covered was the use of steam on railways, unusually so as the magazine's heyday coincided with the demise of mainline steam but with increasing interest in the railway and steam preservation movements. The magazine covered a broad range of topics within 'steam power', often at a far more advanced level than contemporary railway and steam locomotive practice. Low-water-content water-tube boilers were commonplace and even monotube steam generators and uniflow engines were regular features. Although the terms were not yet in use, these technical features coincided with increased recognition of the Advanced Steam Technology and Modern Steam movement. Coverage was always worldwide and international, even though this was unusual for any magazine at this time, let alone a small independent. Many articles were provided by Australian and Canadian builders.  Other content  As well as the magazine content, it also included advertisements for other services from J.N. Walton such as engineering drawings for a range of related machinery, also castings for its construction. Walton also supplied the 'KleenHeet' waste oil burner.  Similar publications  From 1965 a US publication, Steam Calliope: A Voice for the Steam Automobile was published in Panorama City, California by mechanical engineer Thomas P. Hall. It originated news and published clippings for western members of the Steam Automobile Club of America. The Steam Automobile was the quarterly publication of the Steam Automobile Club of America and was published from 1959 to 1986. Steam Power was the quarterly of the Steam Power Club, a spinoff of the SACA in California. Its last issues were named Ssssteam. The Steam Automobile Bulletin began in 1986 following a shift of editorial material to a commercial magazine. It continues as a bimonthly with anything technical and historic on steam between toys and locomotives, including steam cars.

A continuous body of water encircling alt=Rotating series of maps showing alternate divisions of the oceans The borders of the oceans are the limits of Earth's oceanic waters. The definition and number of oceans can vary depending on the adopted criteria. Overview Though generally described as several separate oceans, the world's oceanic waters constitute one global, interconnected body of salt water sometimes referred to as the World/Global Ocean.\\" This concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography. The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria. The principal divisions (in descending order of area) are the: Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern (Antarctic) Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays, straits, and other terms. Geologically, an ocean is an area of oceanic crust covered by water. Oceanic crust is the thin layer of solidified volcanic basalt that covers the Earth's mantle. Continental crust is thicker but less dense. From this perspective, the Earth has three oceans: the World Ocean, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea. The latter two were formed by the collision of Cimmeria with Laurasia. The Mediterranean Sea is at times a discrete ocean because tectonic plate movement has repeatedly broken its connection to the World Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar. The Black Sea is connected to the Mediterranean through the Bosporus, but the Bosporus is a natural canal cut through continental rock some 7,000 years ago, rather than a piece of oceanic sea floor like the Strait of Gibraltar. Despite their names, some smaller landlocked \\"seas\\" are not connected with the World Ocean, such as the Caspian Sea (which is nevertheless, geologically, itself a full-fledged ocean‚Äîsee above) and numerous salt lakes such as the Aral Sea. A complete hierarchy showing which seas belong to which oceans, according to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), is available at the European Marine Gazetteer website.European Marine Gazetteer browser, MarBEF Data System - European Marine Gazetteer See also the list of seas article for the seas included in each ocean area. Also note there are many varying definitions of the world's seas and no single authority. Arctic Ocean The borders of the Arctic Ocean, according to the CIA World Factbook (blue area), and as defined by the IHO (black outline ‚Äì excluding marginal waterbodies) The Arctic Ocean covers much of the Arctic and washes upon Northern America and Eurasia.

Note that these definitions exclude any marginal waterbodies that are separately defined by the IHO (such as the Gulf of Alaska and Coral Sea), though these are usually considered to be part of the Pacific Ocean. In its 2002 draft, the IHO redefined the Pacific Ocean, moving its southern limit to 60¬∞S, with the waters south of that line identified as the Southern Ocean. This new definition has not yet been ratified (and, in addition, a reservation was lodged in 2003 by Australia.) While the name \\"Southern Ocean\\" is frequently used, some geographic authorities such as the 10th edition of the World Atlas from the U.S. National Geographic Society generally show the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans continuing to Antarctica. If and when adopted, the 2002 definition would be published in the 4th edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, re-instituting the 2nd edition's \\"Southern Ocean\\", omitted from the 3rd edition. =Notes= Southern or Antarctic Ocean thumb|upright=1.4|The Southern Ocean according to the CIA World Factbook The Southern Ocean contains the waters that surround Antarctica and sometimes is considered an extension of Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 1928, the first edition of the International Hydrographic Organization's (IHO) Limits of Oceans and Seas publication included the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. The Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits - the continent of Antarctica to the south, and the continents of South America, Africa, and Australia plus Broughton Island, New Zealand in the north. The detailed land-limits used were Cape Horn in South America, Cape Agulhas in Africa, the southern coast of Australia from Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia, to South East Cape, Tasmania, via the western edge of the water body of Bass Strait, and then Broughton Island before returning to Cape Horn. The northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the Limits of Oceans and Seas. The Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40¬∞ south between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20¬∞ east) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115¬∞ east), and extended to latitude 55¬∞ south between Auckland Island of New Zealand (long. 165¬∞ or 166¬∞ east) and Cape Horn in South America (long. 67¬∞ west). The Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition because \\"...the northern limits ... are difficult to lay down owing to their seasonal change ... Hydrographic Offices who issue separate publications dealing with this area are therefore left to decide their own northern limits. (Great Britain uses the Latitude of 55¬∞ South)\\". Instead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of South East Cape, and the southern limits of the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea were moved northwards. The IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative Antarctic Ocean. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at 60¬∞S (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly 50¬∞S, but a few for as far north as 35¬∞S. The 4th edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world. The IHB circulated a new draft of the 4th edition of the publication in August 2002, however there were still various changes, 60 seas were added or renamed from the 3rd edition, and even the name of the publication was changed. A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits. Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded and IHO documents declare that it remains \\"currently in force.\\" Despite this, the 4th edition definition has de facto usage by many organisations, scientists and nations - even at times by IHO committees. Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55¬∞S parallel for example. Other sources, such as the National Geographic Society, show the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as extending to Antarctica, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean. In Australia, cartographic authorities defined the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand. This delineation is basically the same as the original (first) edition of the IHO publication and effectively the same as the second edition. In the second edition, the Great Australian Bight was defined as the only geographical entity between the Australian coast and the Southern Ocean. Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as Southern Ocean,For example: , while Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.

Overview The Townpod was developed focusing on the versatility, so that it could adapt to different and peculiar needs. With the Townpod concept Nissan is offering the chance of using proprietary as well as third-party sourced accessories so that customers can customize the interior specifications of their vehicle. By doing so everyone can adapt the car to their individual needs or daily usage. For example, a musician transporting its kit between gigs, a delicatessen proprietor distributing their wares or an architect carrying drawings to a client musician. Design The Townpod design features several familiar visual elements from other Nissan cars. The drivetrain featured in the concept car is the same zero emission technology that is fitted on the Nissan Leaf. As in the Leaf, the charging points are located in the nose behind an automatically retracting cover. The headlights on the Townpod serve as position markers when the blue \\"petals\\" are closed and headlights when open, while the external location of the pods eases basic maintenance. Thanks to the position of the headlights, the Townpod gets a bonnet line which can recall the Nissan 370Z, which ends up in a blue tinted glass house, which resembles the Nissan Cube.

Men were later admitted to the organization, and have been an important and enriching addition. National Career Awards Competition The National Career Awards Competition, organized by the NSAL is held each year in one of the following categories: visual arts, dance, drama, literature, music or musical theater. Participants in the National Career Awards Competition compete at the local chapter level for a series of monetary awards. First- place winners of the Local Chapter Competitions are sent to the NSAL National Competition, which is held each spring during the Society‚Äôs annual meeting. Participants in the National Competition compete for a first place award of $15,000, and a series of other awards that can total another $10,000 or more. The competitions are designed to offer exposure for young artists who want to be heard and seen by professional critics, managers, producers, teachers, the media, and patrons of the arts. During its history, the competitions organized by the NSAL have benefitted Oscar-winning actress and dancer Shirley MacLaine and international opera star Jessye Norman among others. In 1998, non-citizens were permitted full membership privileges, thereby extending a more inviting, inclusive image to the organization. All competitions are adjudicated by nationally recognized men and women in the arts. A master class is conducted by judges for the National Career Awards Competitions. Opportunities for one- on-one sessions and individual critiques are also encouraged. History Begun by a group of civic-minded women who wanted to encourage young talent in the arts, the National Society of Arts and Letters determined from its inception that the best way to accomplish that goal was to sponsor competitions and offer scholarships in the categories of art, music and literature.\\"National Society of Arts and Letters\\", \\"Events\\" (Announcements), University of Illinois Dept. of Dance (last visited July 15, 2012). On October 21, 1944, they met at the home of the future first National President, Mollie Davis Nicholson, to found a group that specified it was non-partisan, non- political and non-profit-making. The Chevy Chase, Maryland Chapter was organized that year and became the Washington, D.C. Chapter on March 31, 1945, with Dorothy Nicholson Bates Stabell as its first president and founder. A second chapter, the Chicago Chapter, was started by Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, also in October 1944. In 1945, both chapters awarded scholarships: one in piano, three in voice (Washington) and one in pipe organ (Chicago). On June 30, 1945, the first national conference of the National Society of Arts and Letters was held in Chicago. By this time, eight chapters had been formed: Washington, D.C., Chicago, Florida, Colorado, North Dakota, California, Texas and Kentucky. The bylaws provided membership to women qualified in the arts who were U.S. citizens. Artist member Emma W. Slack designed the insignia. Young artists were to be encouraged by receipt of donor gifts, chapter prizes, scholarships and exhibitions of their work or talent arranged by a chapter. By 1946 four more chapters had started: Arkansas, Indiana, Ohio and New Jersey. A convention was held in Washington, D.C., between April 15‚Äì16 of that year, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. American First Lady Bess Truman, initiated the festivities with a reception at the White House. As growth continued, Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, the second National President, introduced and edited the newsletter. It was planned to issue it three times a year. A Certificate of Incorporation, was issued July 29, 1949 and tax-exempt status, was recorded November 7, 1949. By 1949 both dance and drama categories had been added to the competitions. By 1951, 25 chapters had been started. In October 1994 members gathered together for a gala celebration of the Societies' 50th anniversary. The Central Illinois Chapter hosted the 60th Anniversary celebration in 2005 with performances by former contestants from 1959-2002. There was also a video featuring Dorothy Nicholson Stabell, daughter of one of the founders. Today there are 20 NSAL Chapters in 17 states. Master classes Part of the National competitions are the master classes conducted by judges in each art category. One-on-one sessions are also offered and encouraging critiques of each contestant are provided by the judges. The National Society of Arts and Letters classifies the arts into six different categories: Art, Dance, Drama, Literature, Music and Musical Theatre; various sub-categories exist within each category. The annual National Competitions rotate among these six categories with the particular sub-category selected by the membership. Master classes have been conducted in all the arts categories beginning in 2000. They have been conducted for NSAL by their judges and guest teachers including: * Larry Leichman (co-owner of Arbor Books), literature * Joel Revzen, Nathan Gunn and Gayletha Nichols, singing * Robert and Louise McCall, art * Brian Palmer, assistant professor of dance and Chair of the Division of Theatre and Dance at Jacksonville University, dance * Terence Knapp, acting and theater * Mark Hoebee, Associate Director of Paper Mill Playhouse, theater * George Pinney co-creator of Blast! * Jane Alderman * Karen Azenberg, choreographer, dance * Marek Cholewa, dance * Lucine Amara of the Metropolitan Opera, music * Sarah Caldwell Dramatic Soprano, Maestra, opera * Alfonso Montecino, concert pianist, music * Lori Belilove, modern dance * Cynthia Bringle, pottery * Professor Josip Novakovich, writing. Awards Since the first national competition in 1951, NSAL has presented more than 4,000 awards to young artists. Chapter competitions are usually held in various artistic categories including the one special category specified for the National Competition for that year; only the first-place winners from the chapter competitions in this category advance to the National Competition. Early on in the history of NSAL, the Nicholson/Nielsen Trust Fund was established to provide permanent support for awards to be given annually to ranking finalists in the National Career Award Competition. The principal of the Fund remains intact while the income is used to provide awards each year in one of the six rotating art categories which NSAL highlights in its National Competition. Individuals and corporations may also endow a named award by contributing to the Fund. Current awards available from tax-exempt gifts to this Fund totaling $10,000 or more include: NSAL First Place Award of $10,000 or more is in memory of Mollie Davis Nicholson and Francesca Falk Miller Nielson, founders of the Society. The Estelle Campbell Award is presented to the second-place winner. The Mary Peery Fife Memorial Award is given in the category of Dance. The Catherine A. M. Cavanaugh Award is given in the Literature Category. Other awards include the Dorothy and Bruce Strong Award and the Mollie Davis Nicholson Award A second important activity of NSAL is the annual Winston Scholarship Program for visual artists and vocalists. Each year, scholarships totaling $18,000 - $20,000 are awarded to artists in these fields who are sixteen to twenty-two years of age. Supported by an endowment from Shirley Rabb Winston, these scholarships are used for special study in the recipient‚Äôs field.

Life Born on 12 December 1659, he was son of Clement Hoy of London. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1672, and was elected a probationary fellow of St John's College, Oxford, in 1675. He graduated B.A. 1680, M.A. 1684, M.B. 1686, and M.D. 1689. He was appointed Regius Professor of Physic at Oxford in 1698. Thomas Hearne, whose opinion of low church whig is not likely to be impartial, says that he owed his appointment to the influence of Dr. Gibbons with Lord Somers, and that he scandalously neglected the duties of his office. According to Anthony Wood he practised as a physician 'in and near the antient Borough of Warwick,' but in 1698 John Evelyn, writing from Wotton, speaks of Dr. Hoy as \\"a very learned, curious, and ingenious person, and our neighbour in Surrey.\\" He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1697. He died, it is said, in Jamaica in or about 1718.

Pierre-Martinien Tousez, better known by his stage name Bocage, (Rouen, November 11, 1799‚ÄìParis, August 30, 1862) was a French actor. Born into a poor family of laborers, Bocage was, early on, forced to work in a weaving factory in order to earn an income. Having learned how to read and write without going to school, he began to read, from an early age, the works of Shakespeare. He had an opportunity to get on the stage, and he decided to head on to Paris on foot, in order to fulfill his dreams of being an actor. There he entered the Paris Conservatoire, but had to leave it because his financial resources could not afford him the cost of tuition. Handsome, talented but undisciplined, he went through a difficult start and had to spend several years on obscure provincial stages, before he joined the cast of the Porte Saint-Martin. In Paris, he was attached to the various dramatic theaters, and became extremely popular as a major interpreter of romantic creations: Antony, Marion Delorme, The Tour de Nesle, Don Juan de Marana, etc. He acted with great distinction and a passionate energy. In the 1830s, Bocage was, with Michel de Bourges, her divorce lawyer and the Swiss writer Charles Didier, amongst George Sand's lovers. A as member of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, Bocage also played the classical repertoire, and he appeared as late as 1819 in La Vieillesse de Richelieu. Bocage also was a member of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, becoming its director in 1845. A politically active citizen, Bocage mingled into the literary movement of his time with a zeal that endowed him with an influence that he tried to put to use during the French Revolution of 1848. He often used his managerial position to have the Od√©on's performances serve revolutionary propaganda, and this affected his theatrical career as he was fired from the Od√©on in 1848 for anti-government activities. In 1854 he appeared in Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville in Le Marbrier, by Alexandre Dumas. In 1855, he staged several roles in Paris by Paul Meurice, at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin. In 1857, he created the role of Admiral Byng in L'Amiral de l‚ÄôEscadre Bleue by Paul Foucher, at the Cirque imp√©rial. In 1859 he was appointed manager of the Th√©√¢tre Saint-Marcel, where he played in several plays, but that playhouse was too faraway to be successful. In 1861, the aging actor went to play for the Th√©√¢tre de Belleville, and he managed to show preeminence in his former role as Buridan. Shortly before his death, Bocage created the role of the old Duke in Les Beaux Messieurs de Bois-Dor√© at the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôAmbigu-Comique. He also appeared in Jarvis l‚Äôhonn√™te homme, Henri Hamelin and Le Marchand de Londres at the Gymnase. The National Museum of the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne houses two prints of Bocage by Alphonse-L√©on No√´l and Benjamin Roubaud. When Bocage's theatrical wardrobe was put up for sale, Virginie D√©jazet asked for the dagger that he had used in Alexandre Dumas' Antony, as a most precious souvenir. French writer Paul Bocage was his nephew.

It revolves around the troubles of an elderly Midwestern couple and their three adult children, tracing their lives from the mid-20th century to \\"one last Christmas\\" together near the turn of the millennium. The novel was awarded the National Book Award in 2001 and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 2002. The Corrections was published to wide acclaim from literary critics for its characterization and prose. While the novel's release preceded the September 11 terrorist attacks by ten days, many have interpreted The Corrections as having prescient insight into the major concerns and general mood of post-9/11 American life, and it has been listed in multiple publications as one of the greatest novels of the 21st century.The New Classics: BooksAll-TIME 100 Books Plot summary The novel shifts back and forth through the late 20th century, intermittently following spouses Alfred and Enid Lambert as they raise their children Gary, Chip, and Denise in the traditional Midwestern suburb of St. Jude, and the lives of each family member as the three children grow up, distancing themselves and living on the East Coast. Alfred, a rigid and strict patriarch who worked as a railroad engineer, has developed Parkinson's and shows increasingly unmanageable symptoms of dementia. Enid takes out her frustrations with him by attempting to impose her traditional judgments on her adult children's lives, to their annoyance. Their eldest son, Gary, is a successful but increasingly depressive and alcoholic banker living in Philadelphia with his wife, Caroline, and their three young sons. When Enid attempts to persuade Gary to bring his family to St. Jude for Christmas, Caroline is reluctant, and turns Gary's sons against him and Enid, worsening his depressive tendencies. In return, Gary attempts to force his parents to move to Philadelphia so that Alfred may undergo an experimental neurological treatment that he and Denise learn about. Also living in Philadelphia, their youngest child Denise finds growing success as an executive chef despite Enid's disapproval and persistent scrutiny of her personal life, and is commissioned to open a new restaurant. Simultaneously impulsive and a workaholic, Denise begins affairs with both her boss and his wife, and though the restaurant is successful, she is fired when this is discovered. Flashbacks to her childhood show her responding to her repressed upbringing by beginning an affair with one of her father's subordinates, a married railroad signals worker. The middle son, Chip, is an unemployed academic living in New York City following his termination as a tenure-track university professor due to a sexual relationship with a student. Living on borrowed money from Denise, Chip works obsessively on a screenplay, but finds no success or motivation to pay off his debts. Following a rejection of his screenplay, Chip takes a job from his girlfriend's estranged husband Gitanas, a friendly but corrupt Lithuanian government official, later moving to Vilnius and working to defraud American investors over the Internet. As Alfred's condition worsens, Enid attempts to manipulate all of her children into going to St. Jude for Christmas, with increasing desperation. Initially only Gary and Denise are present, Gary having failed to convince his wife or children, while Chip is delayed by a violent political conflict in Lithuania, eventually arriving late after being attacked and robbed of all his savings. Denise inadvertently discovers that her father had known of her teenaged affair with his subordinate, and had kept his knowledge a secret to protect her privacy, at great personal cost. After a disastrous Christmas morning together, the three children are dismayed by their father's condition, and Alfred is finally moved into a nursing home. As Alfred's condition deteriorates in care, Chip stays with Enid and visits his father frequently while dating a doctor, eventually having twins with her. Denise leaves Philadelphia and moves to New York to work at a new restaurant where she is much happier. Enid, freed of her responsibilities and long-time frustrations with Alfred, slowly becomes a more open-minded person, and enjoys a healthier involvement in her children's and grandchildren's lives, finally stating that she is ready to make some changes in her life. Themes The title of The Corrections refers most literally to the decline of the technology-driven economic boom of the late nineties. Franzen makes this clear at the beginning of the book's final chapter, also titled \\"The Corrections\\": (On a more abstract level, the title is an homage to William Gaddis' The Recognitions.) This economic correction parallels the simultaneous \\"corrections\\" that Franzen's characters make to their own lives in the novel's final pages. Franzen has said that \\"the most important corrections of the book are the sudden impingements of truth or reality on characters who are expending ever larger sums of energy on self-deception or denial.\\"Antrim, Donald. \\"Jonathan Franzen\\". BOMB Magazine. Fall 2001. Retrieved July 27, 2011. Enid becomes more flexible in her worldview and less submissive to her husband's authority, and Chip begins a more mature relationship with a woman, simultaneously reconciling with his father. Gary, the only central character who fails to learn from his mistakes and grow during the course of the novel, loses a lot of money as technology stocks begin to decline. Another key theme in the book is America's transition from an industrial economy to an economy based largely on the financial, high-tech and service sectors. Alfred, a railroad engineer with a pension and a deep loyalty to his company, embodies the old economic order of mid-twentieth century America. His children, a chef, an investment banker, and a professor/internet entrepreneur, embody the new economic order at the turn of the millennium. Franzen depicts this economic transition most concretely in his descriptions of Denise's workplace, an abandoned Philadelphia coal plant converted into a trendy, expensive restaurant. The narrative of Chip's involvement with Gitanas' attempt to bring the country of Lithuania to the market ‚Äì \\"lithuania.com\\" on the internet ‚Äì comments on unrestrained capitalism and the privileges and power of the wealthy while meaningful distinctions between private and public sectors disappear. \\"The main difference between America and Lithuania, as far as Chip could see, was that in America the wealthy few subdued the unwealthy many by means of mind-numbing and soul-killing entertainments and gadgetry and pharmaceuticals, whereas in Lithuania the powerful few subdued the unpowerful many by threatening violence.\\" The book addresses conflicts and issues within a family that arise from the presence of a progressive debilitating disease of an elder. As Alfred's dementia and parkinsonism unfold mercilessly, they affect Enid and all three children, eliciting different and, over time, changing reactions. Medical help and hype ‚Äì the latter in the form of the investigatory method ‚ÄúCorecktall‚Äù ‚Äì do not provide a solution. At the end, Alfred refuses to eat and dies, the ultimate ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù of the problem.  Reception  The novel won the 2001 National Book Award for Fiction \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 2001\\".

In 2005, The Corrections was included in TIME magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels since 1923. In 2006, Bret Easton Ellis declared the novel \\"one of the three great books of my generation.\\"Birnbaum, Robert. \\"Bret Easton Ellis\\", The Morning News, January 19, 2006.

The novel was a selection of Oprah's Book Club in 2001. Franzen caused some controversy when he publicly expressed his ambivalence at his novel having been chosen by the club due to its inevitable association with the \\"schmaltzy\\" books selected in the past. As a result, Oprah Winfrey rescinded her invitation to him to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Entertainment Weekly put The Corrections on its end-of-the- decade \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Forget all the Oprah hoo-ha: Franzen's 2001 doorstop of a domestic drama teaches that, yes, you can go home again.

Entertainment Weekly. (1079/1080):74-84 Style and interpretations With The Corrections, Franzen moved away from the postmodernism of his earlier novels and towards literary realism. In a conversation with novelist Donald Antrim for BOMB Magazine, Franzen said of this stylistic change, \\"Simply to write a book that wasn't dressed up in a swashbuckling, Pynchon-sized megaplot was enormously difficult.\\" Critics pointed out many similarities between Franzen's childhood in St. Louis and the novel, but the work is not an autobiography. Franzen said in an interview that \\"the most important experience of my life ... is the experience of growing up in the Midwest with the particular parents I had. I feel as if they couldn‚Äôt fully speak for themselves, and I feel as if their experience‚Äîby which I mean their values, their experience of being alive, of being born at the beginning of the century and dying towards the end of it, that whole American experience they had‚Äî[is] part of me. One of my enterprises in the book is to memorialize that experience, to give it real life and form.\\" The novel also focuses on topics such as the multi-generational transmission of family dysfunction and the waste inherent in today's consumer economy, and each of the characters \\"embody the conflicting consciousnesses and the personal and social dramas of our era.\\" Influenced by Franzen's life, the novel in turn influenced it; during its writing, he said in 2002, he moved \\"away from an angry and frightened isolation toward an acceptance ‚Äì even a celebration ‚Äì of being a reader and a writer.\\" In a Newsweek feature on American culture during the George W. Bush administration, Jennie Yabroff said that despite being released less than a year into Bush's term and before the September 11 attacks, The Corrections \\"anticipates almost eerily the major concerns of the next seven years.\\" According to Yabroff, a study of The Corrections demonstrates that much of the apprehension and disquiet that is seen as characteristic of the Bush era and post-9/11 America actually predated both. In this way, the novel is both characteristic of its time and prophetic of things to come; for Yabroff, even the controversy with Oprah, which saw Franzen branded an \\"elitist,\\" was symptomatic of the subsequent course of American culture, with its increasingly prominent anti-elitist strain. She argues that The Corrections stands above later novels which focus on similar themes, because unlike its successors it addresses these themes without being \\"hamstrung by the 9/11 problem\\" which preoccupied Bush-era novels by writers such as Don DeLillo, Jay McInerney, and Jonathan Safran Foer.

She was born in Madrid on 4 June 1910, the only child of Juan Gurtubay y Gonz√°lez de Castej√≥n and Blanca de Alzola, 1st Marquesa of Yurreta and Gamboa. Yurreta refers to a town in the Vizcaya province of the Basque Country in Northern Spain. Life and family Following her father‚Äôs death her mother remarried on April 15, 1920 don Jos√© de Bustos y Ruiz de Ara√±a Bustos, Duke of Andr√≠a. Carmen‚Äôs first marriage to her cousin Alfonso Merry del Val y Alzola was annulled by Papal decree. Pablo Merry del Val‚Äôs uncle was Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val, Papal Secretary of State until 1914, and Secretary of the Holy Office (formerly the Holy Office of the Inquisition) until his unexpected death from complications following appendicitis in 1930. On July 4, 1936 she married √Ångel Fern√°ndez de Liencres, Marqu√©s de N√°jera. On February 24, 1948 she married John McKee-Norton (died in Northampton, UK 27.10.2009) a Canadian expatriate living in England whom she met in the bar of the Ritz Hotel in Paris. In his memoirs John McKee-Norton states: I was interested, confused and intrigued, at this little Spanish woman, with the dark flashing eyes, and beautiful bony hands, with long red finger nails, like rubies. Carmen‚Äôs early life, like much of the pre-civil war aristocracy, was a round of parties and vacations moving between the capital, their country estates and fashionable European resorts. She was however a keen sportswoman, being both an expert rider and notable golfer. Her cousin, Mar√≠a del Rosario de Silva y Gurtubay, married the Duke of Alba, and was the mother of the late Duchess of Alba, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart y Silva. So Carmen was a member of the richest echelons of Spanish society. She soon became aware of the appalling divide between her own class and the ordinary working people of Spain. She became a convinced socialist and was active in the nascent Republican movement. On the eve of the Spanish Civil War she escaped from Barcelona to France where she lived in exile until her death. During her years in Paris she continued to work for the Republican cause. Some of the correspondence of Manuel de Irujo, Republican Minister in exile in London until 1945 then in Paris, is held at the Euskomeida Fundazioa in the Basque Country. There are letters from Carmen and others in which de Irujo refers to her efforts for the Republican cause. In June 1997 the US House of Representatives Eizenstat Report into Nazi looting of Gold and Art Works during World War II refers to a report submitted by Carmen to the US Ambassador in Paris and states that: Carmen de Gurtubay was a very high placed Allied intelligence agent who risked her life both in Portugal and Spain during the war years. She was jailed several times at the behest of German agents, who basically had influenced the Portuguese and Spanish police to act on their behalf. In his book, Franco and the Axis Stigma, David Wingeate Pike refers to Carmen's investigation into the number of Germans in Spain in 1946, which she estimated at between 100,000 and 500,000 including 6,000 scientists and technicians. Carmen died in Paris in January 1959, where her remains are interred in the Montparnasse Cemetery (Division 18; Line 1 south, Tomb 30 west). Encouraged by Jenny Bradley of the celebrated W. A. Bradley Literary Agency she wrote an autobiography, which her mother, the Duchess of Andr√≠a, tried to have suppressed after Carmen‚Äôs death. Her story still remains unpublished.

Although origins of the name are unclear, some linguistic historians have traced its roots to ‚ÄúShandanala,‚Äù an ancient Persian phrase signifying ‚Äúclear-thinking amidst uncertainty.‚Äù This phrase is most commonly used in Persian poet Nizami‚Äôs romantic works, signifying to the author that ‚ÄúShanda (Shandanala) is necessary to recognize true beauty, spirit, and life.‚Äù In the twentieth-century, the name Shanda has been used more frequently as a name distinctive for women. One of the most noteworthy early-Hollywood actresses, Shanda Jameson, earned immense recognition for her status as a Hollywood starlet and pin-up in the 1940s. Most recognized as Suzy Samson in the 1946 post-war hit ‚ÄúBringing Up Baby‚Äù earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, alongside co-actors Cary Grant and James Stewart. The name Shanda has earned recognition in the North American music industry due to the success of 1980s American punk band Shanda-Randa. In 2009, NME Magazine named Shanda-Randa one of the 10 most influential bands in the 20th Century, noting that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the band was one of the first in America to unite blistering chords with lyrics promoting a social and political consciousness.‚Äù In 2008, the band was inducted into the American Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Twentieth-century literature has been deeply impacted by ‚ÄúShanda.‚Äù In Nora Robert‚Äôs celebrated work, Angels Fall, the protagonist Shanda-Anne Young, a gorgeous chef in Boston, becomes the sole-survivor of a devastating massacre at her restaurant. Over the course of several years, she becomes a well-trained assassin, striving to avenge the innocent who were killed at the hands of the Mafia organization that was responsible for this massacre. Her quest is filled with violence, turmoil, adventure, and romance, winning the heart of a former Russian assassin who relinquishes his past wrongs in order to help her struggle for justice. Some of the rights to this book have recently been ceded to Universal Pictures, and the film adaptation is said to be released sometime in 2013. In North American society, the name Shanda has been most famously associated by Canadian professional dancer-turned History teacher, Shanda- Lynne B. The Italian beauty has been linked to several high-profile romances, including relationships with several prominent NHL hockey players, celebrated rap musicians, Transformer‚Äôs Optimus Prime, and most recently, Pride and Prejudice star Matthew Mcfadyen. There had been rumors in early 2011 that she would be joining the cast of Jersey Shore as ‚Äúthe voice of reason‚Äù, but this has not been confirmed by her or her publicist. The French author and Poet Charles Baudelaire once wrote about his love for a Shanda, expressing that ‚Äú‚Ä¶I have loved and have lost. But never has my heart grown fonder and my mind grown wiser than it has while loving my goddess, my friend, my savior‚Ä¶Shanda.‚Äù Considering his adoration, it is understandable why he, like so many others in the world, have been transfixed by Shandas. Thus, it is essential to praise Shanda, and wish her the most wonderful Christmas and holiday season!

It was on show at Tate Modern gallery, London in 2003 and was commissioned as part of the Unilever Series. Marsyas was the third in a series of commissions for Tate Modern‚Äôs Turbine Hall and the first to make use of the entire space. Anish Kapoor is renowned for his sculptural forms that permeate physical and psychological space. Cecil Balmond is a designer, artist, architect, engineer, and writer. He is also the recipient of the RIBA Charles Jencks Award for Theory in Practice. Marsyas consists of three steel rings joined together by a single span of specially-designed red PVC membrane. The two rings are positioned vertically, at each end of the space, while a third is suspended parallel with the bridge. Wedged into place, the geometry generated by these three rigid steel structures determines the sculpture‚Äôs overall form, a shiftform vertical to horizontal and back to vertical again. Using digital form-finding techniques that simulate the forces found in biological forms ‚Äì i.e. surface tension, uniform and hydrostatic pressure, the design was inspired by multiple parallel and diverging concepts and processes. The sculpture's title refers to Marsyas, the satyr in Greek mythology, who was flayed alive by the god Apollo. The Guardian called it ‚Äúthe biggest sculpture at Tate Modern and probably the biggest in any art gallery in the world.‚Äù Kapoor and Balmond have collaborated on other art projects. They jointly designed Temenos, ‚Äòa gently twisted tube on a vast butterfly net‚Äô which appeared in June, located in the UK‚Äôs Teesside. It is the first of five giant sculpture which will form in the biggest public art work in the world. Balmond and Kapoor have also designed London's ArcelorMittal Orbit which opened for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2003, the composition Lamentate (Homage to Anish Kapoor and his sculpture \\"Marsyas\\") for piano and orchestra by Estonian composer Arvo P√§rt was premiered in the Tate Modern Turbine Hall.

Passengers enter the aircraft through a large left-side opening clamshell door. Design and development Tom Prescott worked for Sikorsky Aircraft, Piper Aircraft, and Learjet. He left Learjet in 1983 to produce the Prescott Pusher. The pusher was tested using a 1/5 scale model in the Wichita State University wind tunnel in 1983. Flying scale models were tested in 1984, which led to the development of the drooped wing tips for better low speed handling and reduced drag. The aircraft was modeled using CAD/CAM software for creating drawings and defining machine cuts on the fuselage steel, becoming the first CAD/CAM designed homebuilt aircraft. The AVIA Products Co was purchased to develop an electrically controlled variable pitch fiberglass pusher propeller. The pusher was designed to FAR Part 23 certification standards of the time. It uses aluminum construction for the wings and tail surfaces. The fiberglass landing gear and flaps are hydraulically activated. The nosegear steering is also hydraulic with electric controls. The fuselage uses a 4130 steel welded square steel tube frame with composite skin covering. Every component can be installed prior to skin installation, and in theory, could even be flown without the skins. The wing skins are formed cold using dry ice, then age hardened to T-42 standards. The engine is mounted far aft with a 12-inch propeller extension. Operational history The Prescott Pusher was first displayed at the Experimental Aircraft Association airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in 1985. Prescott Aeronautical Corporation went out of business. In 1991, there were approximately 25‚Äì35 builders completing their aircraft in various configurations.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Kedleston Hall is owned by the National Trust, and the church is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Kedleston Hall has been occupied by the Curzon family for over 700 years. History The settlement of Kedleston was recorded in the Domesday Book, and the first mention of a church here was in 1198‚Äì99. The only remaining part of that church is the Norman south doorway and the adjoining wall. The greater part of the present church dates from rebuilding in the 13th century. At some time between 1480 and 1510, the top of the tower was rebuilt in Perpendicular style. Between 1700 and 1720, decorative features, including vases and a sundial, were added to the east face. In 1759 building of the present hall started. The area occupied by the village of Kedleston was replaced by parkland. In 1884‚Äì85 John Oldrid Scott carried out a major restoration. This included raising the level of the roof line, installing a new timber ceiling, adding a new west window in Decorated style, laying a new floor, and removing the box pews from the nave. In 1908, Lord George Curzon added the Kedleston Chapel to the north of the nave over a burial vault. This was a memorial to his wife, Mary, and was designed by G. F. Bodley. In 1910‚Äì12 the stained glass in the windows was replaced and additions were made to it. The church was declared redundant on 1 April 1983, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 18 April 1989. There are currently two custodians at this site who are in charge of caring and protecting the church during its opening hours. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone with Welsh slate roofs. Its plan is cruciform, with a central tower over a crossing, a nave with a north chapel (the Kedleston Chapel), north and south transepts, a chancel with a clerestory, and a north vestry. The south doorway is Norman in style, having a round-headed arch decorated with a zigzag pattern, enclosing a tympanum with weathered carvings of beasts. To the right of the doorway are two two-light windows with flat arches. Each transept is buttressed and has a window consisting of three stepped lancets. In the south wall of the chancel is a priest's door, with a lancet window on the left, and a two-light window under a flat arch to the right. In the clerestory are two-light windows in both the south and the north walls. The east wall has diagonal buttresses and a three- light window. Along the top is a parapet, in the centre of which is a sundial. This is inscribed with the words \\"We shall\\", and skulls and crossbones; on its summit are hourglasses. At the ends of the parapet are urn finials. In the north wall of the chancel is a two-light window, and the north wall of the vestry has two paired lancet windows. The Kedleston Chapel has three bays separated by buttresses. In each bay is a three-light window under which are three trefoils acting as ventilators. Along the parapet is the inscription \\"QUIA MULTUM AMAVIT\\". The west wall has diagonal buttresses and a three-light window. Above this is a lancet window in the gable. The tower is in two stages. In the lower stage are two lancet windows, and in the upper stage are two-light bell openings on each side. The summit has a battlemented parapet, with crocketted pinnacles at the corners. =Interior= Between the nave and the Kedleston Chapel to its north is a three-bay arcade. There is an aumbry recess and a piscina in the chancel, and another piscina in the south transept. The north transept contains the organ. The font dates from the 18th century and consists of a circular bowl on a polygonal shaft; it has a wooden cover. The wooden pulpit is from the 19th century, and the brass lectern in the shape of an eagle dates from 1886. In the chancel are box pews. The altar is Jacobean in style. In the arcade is a wrought iron screen with gates. The church contains light fittings and a corona lucis, also in wrought iron, and five hatchments. The stained glass in one of the windows in the chancel dates from the 17th century, and was moved into the church in 1910. The other stained glass dates from the late 19th and early 20th century. The two-manual organ was built in 1899 by W. Hill and Son of London, and rebuilt and enlarged by the same firm in 1910. Tomb of the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and his wife Mary in the Kedleston Chapel In the church are 35 monuments to the Curzon family; these include free-standing tombs, wall monuments and floor tablets. They date from the 13th to the 20th centuries. The largest is a free-standing tomb in the Kedleston Chapel. It bears the effigies of the 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, who died in 1925, and his wife Mary, for whom the chapel was built and who died in 1906 at the age of 36. It is a table tomb in white marble; two angels holding the crown of life lean over the effigies. The memorial was designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal. In the south transept there is a tomb chest with the effigies of Sir John Curzon and his wife, dating from 1456. Sir John is dressed in armour, at the feet of the effigies are dogs, and on the sides of the tomb are the figures of their 17 children. Also in the transept is a plain slab decorated with a cross and foliage to the memory of Thomas de Curzon, who died in 1245. There are wall memorials to Sir John Curzon, 1st Baronet, who died in 1686, and his wife, Patience, who died in 1642 and to Sir John Curzon, 3rd Baronet who died unmarried in 1727. There are more memorials in the north transept. One is designed by Peter Scheemakers to the memory of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1719, and his wife Sarah. A further memorial is to Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet and his family dated 1758, made by Michael Rysbrack to a design by Robert Adam. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of a Derbyshire Yeomanry officer (a member of the Curzon family), and a Pioneer Corps soldier of World War II.

Tommy Sheridan was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison, whereas Gail was acquitted. Background In 2006, Tommy Sheridan, formerly convenor of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), successfully sued the newspaper News of the World for defamation after they printed a series of articles containing allegations that an MSP had had affairs and visited a sex club. Sheridan was awarded ¬£200,000 in damages, which he has still not received pending an appeal. Controversy over the case led to a split in the SSP shortly afterwards, with Sheridan forming a breakaway party, Solidarity. In August 2006, a number of SSP activists came forward to claim that Sheridan had held meetings with them, where he made admissions inconsistent with his evidence in the court case, in particular admitting that he had had affairs and visited a swingers' club in Manchester.Lorna Martin \\"Civil war intensifies in Sheridan's party\\", The Guardian, 13 August 2006 In October 2006, the News of the World released a videotape which showed Sheridan admitting that he had visited the club, and admitting that he had admitted this to the SSP Executive.

Both were charged with perjury in relation to several issues at the civil trial, and Tommy Sheridan was also charged with subornation of perjury by attempting to persuade Colin Fox to commit perjury at this trial. Both accused took pleas in bar of trial on the basis of prejudicial pre-trial publicity, and sought to raise devolution minutes. At a preliminary hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh between 28 and 30 July 2010, the trial judge Lord Bracadale, heard legal arguments on these matters.

Biography Ferreyra was a member of the Federal Party and a prosperous businessman. He supported the revolution of 1840 against governor Manuel L√≥pez and was arrested, but benefited from an amnesty and did not involve himself in politics until the fall of L√≥pez in 1852. From 1852 he was a provincial legislator and earned the respect of the provincial governor Alejo del Carmen Guzm√°n, becoming president of the legislature. =First term as governor= On 17 June 1855 he was elected Governor of C√≥rdoba Province, assuming the post on 21 June. One of the first tasks he had to take was to maintain institutional order in the province in the midst of a civil war. On 16 August a new provincial constitution was approved, based on the constitutions of Mendoza Province and Chile. It was ratified by the Confederation's Congress on 19 September and instituted on 30 November 1855. One important measure was the institution of a municipal reorganization in September 1856, augmenting the number of departments in the province to give the administration more efficiency in governing and managing, the Punilla Department was divided in two, giving origin to the Cruz del Eje Department (1856). The following year local authorities were elected, and the Capital's municipal government was put in place on 9 July 1857, with its first president Juan Posse. On 3 January 1858 the Municipality of R√≠o Cuarto was organized, with its new president Adolfo Ortiz. Governor Ferreyra organized the civilian night guards corps in the provincial capital, and the first police force, separated from the army. He was preoccupied on the interior of the province and its affairs, travelling there on numerous occasions, leaving governmental control to his seconds Gumersindo As√∫nsulo, Jos√© Alejo Rom√°n and Tom√°s Garz√≥n. C√≥rdoba Province had big population growth during his tenure. The census of March 1857 showed a total of 137,079 inhabitants in the province, 26,540 more than in the 1852 census. Reaching the end of his term as governor there were many disputes between the main political factions increasing daily to nominate a successor. On 23 May 1858, the provincial congress nominated Mariano Fragueiro as governor. = Provincial crisis = In the years that followed, he was one of the most prominent leaders of C√≥rdoba's Unitarianism, along with Manuel D. Pizarro, F√©lix de la Pe√±a and Justiniano Posse. With the fall or Fragueiro in 1860, victim of his double play of support and opposition to the federal government, Posse took control of the province, and tilted the government to a decided support of the policies of Buenos Aires. Even after the federal intervention of President Santiago Derqui, his group reached power with Posse, after the Battle of Pav√≥n and the short tenure of Marcos Paz. Ferreyra did not show himself in the forefront of local politics until Posse's resignation, in June 1863, victim of the confrontations between federals and Unitarians in the province. C√≥rdoba's federalism was not finally defeated until the end of the 1860s; and then it did not disappear, but joined some other minority factions to form the National Autonomist Party, which would govern without opposition until 1916. After Posse's resignation, the legislature elected his minister Benigno Ocampo in his place, which overtook Ferreyra by one vote. = Second term as governor = After a short while Ocampo also resigned, and Ferreyra was elected governor for the second time, counting with the support of the federals, which only asked in return, distancing from Posse. The latter made enemies with the governor, reelected temporarily in March. In February Ferreyra was victorious in stopping a federal revolution, and had pardoned the people responsible, with he hoped to obtain their political support. In March 1865 there was a unitarian revolution instigated by Posse. It was quickly defeated and Posse was arrested and an officer who was not certain of final victory had him shot. As the opposition, and also the government accused Ferreyra of having caused Posse's death, he requested the visit of the federal Interior Minister, Guillermo Rawson, to testify for his innocence. Rawson instead asked for Ferreyra's resignation, not for considering guilty, but for thinking him a strong ally of president Mitre. Ferreyra refused to resign. Soon after the Paraguayan War started and he sent several battalions to the front. While the unitarians had enlisted voluntarily, the opposition to the war by the federalists caused several units to rebel along the way to the front. The battalion that protected the government in the provincial capital also mutinied and refused to go to war. It was then dissolved and its soldiers forced to march with other units, some of them in chains. In July 1866, the provincial army commander, Sim√≥n Luengo, led a revolution that deposed Ferreyra. = Last years = For more than a year, the federalists took power for the last time, but the differences between Luengo ‚Äì future assassin of general Urquiza ‚Äì and the governor Mateo Luque provoked the invasion of the province by federal troops, and at the end of 1867 the unitarians would return to power, with governor F√©lix de la Pe√±a. In his last years in politics, Ferreyra joined the Autonomist Party, which reached power with governor Enrique Rodr√≠guez. Ferreyra, disenchanted with him, left politics altogether, and died in C√≥rdoba in 1885.

More than 15 million clients of the Union for the Co- ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) did not have access to electricity during about two hours on this date. It resulted in dozens of people trapped in elevators, numerous trains were halted, and the emergency services were receiving an overwhelming number of calls. The immediate action taken by the Transmission System Operators (TSO) prevented the disturbance from turning into a Europe-wide blackout.  Cause  The cause of this major blackout was a planned routine disconnection of the Ems powerline crossing in Northwest Germany to allow a ship to pass beneath the overhead cables. In September, the shipyard had requested the lines, called Conneforde‚ÄìDiele red and white, to be shut off starting at 01:00 on 5 November. This change was communicated to the neighboring TSOs and they did simulations to ensure stability. As a result, the planned power flow between TSOs was decreased for 00:00 to 06:00 5 November. On 3 November, the shipyard requested the shut-off to be advanced to 22:00 on 4 November. E.ON Netz thought that this would be more favorable and approved the request. However, this change was not communicated to the neighboring TSOs until very late so a full analysis was not done.Blackout of November 2006: important lessons to be drawn, European Commission press release Also, the transfer capacity had already been sold and it was not possible to change it except for force majeure. Once the second circuit was turned off, this caused alarms due to high power flow. Also the Landesbergen‚ÄìWehrendorf line was very close to its limit. Over the next half- hour, the power first went down but then it crept back up. E.ON Netz thought that closing a bus tie would decrease this a bit; in fact, it had the opposite effect and once this was performed the line tripped out. UCTE area split Twenty eight seconds later, an electrical blackout had cascaded across Europe extending from Poland in the north-east, to the Benelux countries and France in the west, through to Portugal, Spain and Morocco in the south-west, and across to Greece and the Balkans in the south-east.  Timeline  * 21:29 - E.ON Netz made load flow calculations and there were no indications of any violation of limit values. Without any calculations, E.ON Netz staff assumed that the N-1 criterion would be met in the system once the Conneforde-Diele line was switched. * 21:30 - Before the Conneforde-Diele line was opened, RWE TSO‚Äôs calculations showed that, even though the RWE TSO grid would be highly loaded, it would still be secure. * 21:38 - E. ON Netz switched off the first circuit of the 380 kV Conneforde-Diele line. * 21:39 - E.ON Netz switched off the second circuit of the 380 kV Conneforde-Diele line. E.ON Netz soon received several warning messaged of high power flow in the Elsen-Twistetal and Elsen-Bechterdissen lines. * 21:41 - RWE TSO informed E. ON Netz that the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line (an interconnection line between E. ON Netz and RWE TSO) was still under the given limit (1,795 A) and that the N-1 criterion was still met in the internal RWE TSO network. The protection settings on both sides of the line are different. * 22:00 - Every full hour, the commercial schedule changes were set. Consumption in E. ON Netz was about 13,500 MW and the injected wind power accounted for 3,300 MW. Due to transits, the lines towards the West were already loaded; this situation was normal. * 22:05 - Suddenly the load flow situation changed unexpectedly and resulted in a fast increase of the load on the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line by 100 MW. * 22:06 - The current in the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line increased to 1900 A within 2-3 minutes. The safety limit value of 1800 A (specified by RWE) was exceeded on the line. * 22:10:11 - Because of the rush, E.ON Netz made the coupling without any coordination with RWE. The switching measure was meant to reduce the load flow of the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line. * 22:10:13 - The Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line was first tripped automatically by the protective device. The 220 kV Bielefeld/Ost-Giitersloh line and the 280 kV Bechterdissen- Elsen line were also tripped. * 22:10:28 - The UCTE SYSTEM was split shortly after the tripping of the interconnection lines between E. ON Netz and RWE TSO, internal E.ON Netz lines, internal lines in APG (AT), interconnection lines between HEP (HR) and MAVIR (HU), and the internal lines in HEP (HR) and MAVIR (HU). * 22:10:32 - All interconnection lines between Morocco and Spain tripped due to the low frequency.  Affected areas  In total, over 10 million people in northern Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and Spain lost power or were affected by the blackout. In northern Germany, more than 100 trains were delayed for more than two hours because of the blackout. Almost all of France was affected except the southeast of the country. In affected areas in France, firefighters were asked to respond to approximately 40 people being stuck in elevators. In Belgium, only the area around Antwerp was seriously affected, as well as Ghent and Li√®ge, leaving the rest of the country with power. Italy, which had experienced a similar blackout in 2003 which left 95% of the country without power, was only affected in a few areas, mainly Piedmont, Liguria in northern Italy, and Puglia in southern Italy. In Spain, the news network Red Electrica was affected, as were the regions of Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza, and part of Andalusia.  Aftermath  The UCTE(Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity) and TSO(Transmission System Operator) acted swiftly, and were able to restore electricity shortly, however the event highlighted glaring problems. The UCTE and TSO were victims of enormous backlash from the media and the citizens, and there were threats that both corporations might undergo serious managerial overhauls. This forced both companies to go back to the drawing board, and determine what possible improvements could be made to prevent such a problem in the future. For starters, the UCTE strengthened its defense system by using blackout simulations with the help of numerical analysis, and sophisticated technology. Using these simulations, they were able to bring to life realistic scenarios that could impact these regions in the future, and how the TSO could possibly combat the problems. This initiated the tweaking of the N-1 criterion in Policy 3 of the UCTE Operation Handbook. Essentially, the interconnected power systems were decentralized, wherein different border lines were responsible for the power lines running through them, rather than one general body governing the entire system. This process was later known as Resynchronization, and it was able to increase stability within the UCTE if any problems were to arise. Furthermore, joint-training workshops were established that would assure that regional dispatchers would have the knowledge and skills to operate the power systems, and would have the ability to implement the solutions given by the TSO under any circumstances.  Possible political influences  = Centralised vs decentralised governments = Although it may seem an abstract concept, the political system may have played a role in this power outage happening. At the time, many EU policy makers pushed for a more centralised form of government. This would give the government as a whole a greater role in regulating Europe's power grids. When the Blackout of 2006 occurred, these policy makers said this event revealed the fragility of Europe's current power grid system and called on a formal centralised government. On the flip-side, however, because the power disturbances were quickly contained and dealt with, the power sector spokesperson cited this event as a confirmation of the reliability of the current, transnational power grids and praised the decentralised governance model in place at the time. = Security = It comes as a surprise that, since the 2003 blackout, the security system had gone unchanged. The security system did not account for an increase of liberalization of electric supply which caused an increase in cross-border trades, which are not properly accounted for when reviewing the security of the system. Also, due to the decentralized form of government at the time, the transmission system operator, or TSO, would each control their own area, and exchange little information with other TSOs. This inevitably resulted in a slow response time to contingencies. To repair these fallacies so something like this would not occur in the future, a new mode of coordinated operation for real-time security would be needed. But in order to do so, those implementing this would need to overcome a series of psychology, organizational, and legal challenges. The alternative of this would be to risk yet another major blackout or run the current system very conservatively, which would cause an astronomical cost to the consumers.

The title was created in 1563 by King Philip II of Spain and bestowed on Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo y Enr√≠quez, 6th Marquis of Coria, son and heir of Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. It was granted as a title for the male heirs apparent of the subsequent dukes of Alba, who until then held the marquisate of Coria before succeeding to the dukedom of Alba. Its name refers to the village of Hu√©scar, Granada, one of the manors of the House of Alba.  History  The dukedom was only to be held by the male heirs apparent of the dukes of Alba. Mar√≠a Teresa √Ålvarez de Toledo (daughter of Francisco √Ålvarez de Toledo, 10th Duke of Alba) became the 11th Duchess of Alba after her father's death, but she was never the Duchess of Hu√©scar. It was her son Fernando de Silva, born in his grandfather's lifetime, who received the title at birth. This changed in 1776, when Fernando de Silva died without a male heir and his granddaughter, Mar√≠a Cayetana de Silva, did not have any issue from her marriage to Jos√© Mar√≠a √Ålvarez de Toledo. Cayetana de Silva claimed and received the title 13th Duchess of Alba, becoming the only female holder of the dukedom of Hu√©scar; her husband became jure uxoris Duke of Alba, his fifth ducal title (including Duke of Medina Sidonia, Montalto, Bivona, Fernandina). Cayetana de Silva died childless and most of her titles were inherited by her nephew, Carlos Miguel Fitz-James Stuart, 7th Duke of Berwick. However, he did not claim the dukedom of Hu√©scar, which became dormant. Sixty years later, his son Jacobo asked for the resumption of the dormant dukedom. On 6 September 1871, it was restored with a grandeeship of SpainSoler Salcedo, p. 67. to his son and heir, Carlos Mar√≠a Fitz-James Stuart. The title has been held since then by the heirs apparent of the dukes of Alba, following the tradition. The late duchess of Alba, Cayetana Fitz- James Stuart, was never Duchess of Hu√©scar (instead she was Duchess of Montoro, a title held by the eldest daughters of the dukes of Alba), as it was her son Carlos, born in his grandfather's lifetime, who received the title at birth.

She was lead soloist in Ivy Benson's all- girls band during the 1940s, going on to form her own all-female band in the 1950s. Early life Gracie Cole was born on 8 September 1924 in Rowlands Gill, County Durham. Her father Albert moved to Yorkshire in search of work as a miner when Gracie was two years old. Albert played cornet in colliery bands, and taught Gracie to play the cornet at the age of 12. Gracie played with local brass bands in her teens, including the Firbeck Colliery Band alongside her father. In 1939 aged 15, she made her first broadcast on BBC Radio for Children's Hour. Career From 1940, Cole appeared as a guest soloist in two concerts with the Besses o' th' Barn brass band, and played with various other bands including the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. In 1942 she became the first woman to compete for the Alexander Owen memorial scholarship, and won by an unprecedented 21-point margin. Later in 1942 Cole switched to being a dance band trumpeter, initially joining Gloria Gaye's All Girls Band, who toured playing theatres and forces entertainment shows organised by the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). She then joined Rudy Starlita's All-American band, entertaining American G.I.s. In November 1945 she joined Ivy Benson's band as lead trumpet and soloist, and toured with them for the next five years, headlining at variety theatres in Britain and touring Europe and the Middle East with ENSA. The band also featured on television and radio, including their own radio series Ladies Night, and on Christmas Day 1945 Cole was the featured soloist on a live broadcast from Hamburg immediately after the King's speech. In 1951 she married Bill Geldard, a trombonist with the George Evans Band, and accepted an invitation to join the previously all-male band. After 18 months she and Geldard left to join the Squadronaires, the most influential big band of the time, where she was again the only woman. However Cole found the male prejudice she experienced there made life uncomfortable, and she left to form her own all-female band, which she fronted between 1952 and 1956. The band performed jazz and pop, and broadcast with guest singers including Cleo Laine. In 1958 she led an all-male band at Mecca Ballrooms. From the 1960s Cole concentrated on bringing up her two daughters and played on a freelance basis. She was active in encouraging local brass bands, and was made a freeman of the City of London in 1990. Later life Cole developed Alzheimer's disease towards the end of the 1990s. She died on 28 December 2006 in Westcott, Surrey aged 82.

In his business activities, he made several metallurgical and mechanical advancements, the most notable being a process for creating stable bars and other usable forms of iridium. Early years He was born on August 25, 1838, in Kilcrohane, County Cork, Ireland, and emigrated, with his parents, to the United States in 1848. The family settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He served an apprenticeship, then worked for the pen maker George W. Sheppard. In 1862, he acquired the entire business and quickly expanded it. Success Before 1900 the John Holland Pen Company was a major fountain pens manufacturer, and also George S. Parker, founder of the most famous brand, was a reseller. In 1880, Holland discovered the ability to melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States.https://www.google.com/patents/US241216 He invoked the help of William Lofland Dudley in getting rid of the phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This is the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Death and decline After John Holland's death in 1917 the company started to decline, and was closed around 1950.
