S. Khandekar. One of Khandekar's best-known works, it retells the story of the mythical Hindu king, Yayati, from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata. The novel has multiple narrators, and poses several questions on the nature of morality. Scholars have analysed its hero, Yayati, as a represention of modern man. Accepted as classic of Marathi literature, Yayati has won several awards, including the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960 and the Jnanapith Award in 1974. Background In his preface to Yayati, Khandekar states that he was drawn to the original story from the Mahabharata at multiple levels, and for many reasons. The resulting novel is a modern retelling of the story of the mythological Hindu king, who enjoyed all the pleasures of the flesh for a millennium only to realise how empty of meaning was his pursuit of desire. Khandekar saw modernity, with its materialistic values, as an elephant on the rampage through the delicate garden of traditional virtues and feelings, blurring the distinction between good and evil, between selfishness and compassion, and blinding people to the evils of the world. In response, Khandekar looked to the past and chose the story of Yayati, making use of a kind of tale often dismissed as the fairy stories of old women to describe the vacuousness and futility of contemporary society's endless obsession with avarice and lust. Where Khandekar's previous writing had focused predominantly on style and imagination, in Yayati these concerns are integrated into a form of social realism the author had little explored until this point. The story is taken from the Yayatopakhyan ( The Story of Yayati), a sub-narrative in The Book of the Beginning (Adi Parva) of the Mahabharata. Khandekar builds the original material into a full-length novel, adding several new episodes and developing the narrative as a love story with a theme of morality. In so doing, Khandekar brings new relevance and meaning to the story in the context of modern life. For Khandekar, this novel represents the common man, who \\"in spite of varied happiness is always discontented and restless, and is blindly running after new pleasures\\". Characters The novel's main characters are: * YayatiKing of Hastinapur; married Devayani, daughter of Shukracharya, and her maid Sharmishtha * NahushaKing of Hastinapur; father of Yati and Yayati * YatiElder brother of Yayati, who became an ascetic * DevayaniDaughter of Shukracharya, wife of Yayati, and mother of Yadu * SharmishthaDaughter of Asura king Vrishaparva, and mother of Puru; childhood friend of Devayani * PuruIllegitimate child of Yayati and Sharmishtha * KachaFriend of Yayati; Devayani's love; like a brother to Sharmishtha * AngirasA sage, by whose blessings Yati and Yayati were born * ShukracharyaPreceptor of the Asuras, and father of Devayani * VrishaparvaKing of the Asuras, and father of Sharmishtha While most of the novel's characters appear in the Mahabharata, Khandekar created several new characters. These include Mukulika and Mandar. Plot The novel has three narrators: Yayati, Devayani, and Sharmishtha. Each section of the story is narrated in the first person, from the point of view of its respective narrator. The novel's characters generally use language that is romantic, ornamental, and poetic. Yayati centres on the life of its eponymous hero, Yayati, the king of Hastinapur. Disillusionment characterises Yayati's early life. His faith in motherly love is shattered when he learns that his mother weaned him for fear of losing her beauty. Later, he experiences cruelty and passion that challenge his manhood. He then has a fleeting experience of carnal love. When Yayati has to leave the security of the palace for Ashvamedha Yajna (a horse sacrifice ritual in Hindu tradition), he meets his elder brother, Yati, who has become an ascetic and abandoned all material pleasures. After this he meets Kacha, in whom he sees the model of a happy, peaceful life. But Yayati is traumatised when his father, Nahusha, dies, and for the first time he realises the destructive power of death. He is gripped by fear and helplessness. In this state of mind, he encounters Mukulika, a maidservant in the palace. Yayati's attempts to bury his grief in carnal pleasure constitute a critical period in his life. He later meets Alaka and experiences sisterly love. But Alaka ultimately falls prey to the Queen Mother's cruelty. Precisely at this time, Yayati learns of a curse that foretold that his father, and his father's children, would never be happy. The second part of the narrative recounts Yayati's married life. This section reveals Devayani's love for Kacha, and Kacha's quiet but firm refusal. Devayani seeks revenge on Kacha by making advances to Yayati, whom she ultimately succeeds in marrying. Sharmishtha, originally a princess, is now living with Devayani as her maidservant. At this time, Sharmishtha comes into contact with Yayati. Where Devayani is unable to establish any rapport with Yayati, Sharmishtha finds union with him both in body and in mind. A son is born to them, and for a time Yayati is happy. But, one stormy night, Sharmishtha runs away from Hastinapur. Yayati now suffers both estrangement from Devayani and the loss of Sharmishtha. The resulting vacuum in his life hastens him along a path of moral degradation. Over an 18-year period, Yayati neglects his royal duties and leads a life of pleasure, with women like Madhavi and Taraka. Even when Hastinapur is attacked by its enemies, Yayati continues to neglect his duties out of anger with Devayani and pursuit of a hedonistic lifestyle. His son Yadu is imprisoned. Puru, Yayati's younger son, secures Yadu's release. Then Devayani's father, Shukracharya, seeing his daughter's unhappy marriage and Yayati's degradation, lays a curse of old age on Yayati. When Yayati finds himself suddenly grown old, his unfulfilled desires trouble him. He asks his sons to lend him their youth. His son Puru comes to his aid and meets his request. But Puru and Sharmishtha's undemanding love for him help Yayati to realise his mistakes. Within a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, he resolves to return it. Devayani also undergoes a change of heart. At the end of the novel, Yayati hands over responsibility for government to Puru with his blessing, and seeks to retire to a life in the forest with Devayani and Sharmishtha. This completes Yayati's journey from attachment to detachment. Deviations from the Mahabharata In the novel, Khandekar makes several significant departures from the original story of the Mahabharata. The first of these concerns the death of Yayati's father, Nahusha. In The Mahabharata, Nahusha is cursed by the Rishis (sages) to live on earth in the form of a serpent. After long suffering, he eventually meets Pandava king Yudhishthira, who frees him from the curse. The novel, in contrast, shows Nahusha dying in his palace, desperately clinging to life. He pleads with his wife and son to give him a few hours of their own lives so that he may live a little longer. He fears death because of his remaining unfulfilled desires. Nahusha's helpless struggle with death leaves his son Yayati with a lasting sense of insecurity that affects his whole life. In the original story of the Mahabharata, Yayati enjoys his son Puru's youth for a thousand years. He then returns Puru's youth, and goes on to live for many years more with sages in the Himalayas before finally ascending to Heaven. In the novel, however, Yayati can return his son's youth only at the cost of his own life. Nonetheless, within a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth Yayati decides to return it. He is saved from death by Kacha, who uses the Sanjeevani Mantra. Analysis The main characters of Yayati have been interpreted as representing major attitudes to life. Yayati embodies material pleasure- seeking. Devayani shows excessive pride and desire for power, where Sharmishtha epitomises selfless, undemanding love. Kacha symbolises morality and moderation, a clean enjoyment of life and a sense of the well-being of the human race. Yati's rejection of all material pleasures serves as a counterpoint to Yayati. The novel poses several moral questions, which include: how to define a fulfilling life; where to place the boundary between morality and immorality; and where the pursuit of material pleasure fits into the context of spiritual values. Reception Yayati is one of Khandekar's best-known works, and has been described as one of the greatest works in Marathi literature. The novel has won several awards, including the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960, the Jnanapith Award in 1974, and the State Government Award in 1960. Yayati was translated into English in abridged form by Y. P. Kulkarni, as Yayati : A Classic Tale of Lust (1978). The Malayalam translation, by P. Madhavan Pillai, was serialised in the Malayalam weekly Mathrubhumi in 1980, and published in book form the same year.

The open awareness context, on the other hand, is a situation where everyone is aware of the condition of the patient.

Sauer 90 was released in 1982. Sauer 90 and 92 were produced until 2006.Welcome to ColtSauer.com After the Swedish rifle company Husquarna/Carl Gustaf for a while stopped producing civilian rifles, they decided to import finished and semi-finished rifles from Sauer. A variant of Sauer 80 was therefore produced in Sweden under the name Carl Gustaf 3000 (M.3000 or CG 3000). They were very similar to the original, but with a few differences in for instance the stock and scope mounts. Most of the rifle was made in Germany, while the barrel and final assembly was done in Sweden. All receivers were made in Germany, and the Carl Gustaf rifles therefore had house marks from Sauer. The Lux editions of CG 3000 were built completely by Sauer in Eckernförde, Germany, while the standard versions were assembled in Sweden using receivers made by Sauer, barrels from Carl Gustaf and MonteCarlo stocks from Sweden.  Technical  The rifle is known for having very good precision, and has been used by hunters and sport shooters, and also in a sniper version known as SIG Sauer SSG 2000 by police and defense forces. For being a hunting rifle, the Sauer 80/90 is known for having a somewhat high weight compared to competing models. = Stock = The rifle was delivered with different types of wood stocks, and especially the German stocks were known for having a high quality. The safety is conveniently placed on the tang of the stock, but little wood in this area makes it a weak spot which is known for breaking if the rifle falls. The rifle is also known for being difficult to glass bed due to the shapes of the recoil lug and barrel nut, as well as ensuring that the magazine is seated correctly. = Trigger = The trigger has a special construction built on rollers. It is known for being complicated and sensitive to dirt, and needs regular cleaning to avoid misfires. The rifle was also sold with a set trigger which could be activated by pushing the trigger forward.Hunters House - Sauer 80 = Bolt = The bolt has a lift of 60 degrees, making the rifle easier to operate with a scope sight mounted. There is a button on the bolt allowing the rifle to be emptied with the safety engaged.Carl Gustaf 3000 Lux. Three massive locking lugs can be found on the rear of the bolt. Rear locking lugs ensure a shorter bolt travel, but also makes the brass case stretch considerably more during firing. This gives more wear on the spent casings, and the brass can therefore not be reloaded near as many times as with more conventional rifles with locking lugs on the front end of the bolt. It is known that the bolt recesses should be cleaned regularly to avoid stoppages.Sauer 80/90 Review - Smoothest Bolt Action - YouTube \\"[...] the bolt lug recesses can become jammed due to excess dirt\\". Due to the rear locking lugs, the precision of the rifle is also known to be very sensitive to oil or water entering the chamber, even more so than the Krag–Jørgensen. = Receiver = The Sauer 80/90/92's and the Lux variant of CG 3000 have an empty chamber bolt hold open mechanism and a steel bottom metal. The standard edition of CG 3000 has an aluminium bottom metal and lacks an empty chamber bolt hold open. The receiver was produced in four variants. The different receivers (and some of the different calibers) used different types of single stack magazines. ; Short action :.222 Rem, .22-250, .243 Win and .308 Win. ; Medium action :.25-06 Rem, .270 Win .30-06. ; Magnum action :7mm Rem Mag, .300 Win, .300 Wby Mag and .375 H&H.; ; Safari magnum :Only in .458 Win Mag.

It was officially established on 6 February 1971, at the first public gathering of gay women and men in Australia, which took place in a church hall in Balmain, New South Wales.  History  CAMP aimed to support gay and lesbian people, raise awareness of challenges facing them, and campaign for an end to discrimination against them. The group was one of the first LGBTI rights groups to be established in Australia. Formed in Sydney, it soon expanded across Australia. Its aims, as expressed in its monthly newsletter, were \\"to bring about a situation where homosexuals can enjoy good jobs and security in those jobs, equal treatment under the law, and the right to serve our country without fear of exposure and contempt.\\" John Ware and Christabel Poll appeared in The Australian on the 19 September 1970 announcing the establishment of the CAMP group in an article called ‘Couples’. On 6 February 1971, it was officially established at the first public gathering of homosexual men and women in Australia, which took place in a church hall in Balmain. John Ware and Christabel Poll were confirmed as convenors and spokespeople for the new group. Lex Watson and Sue Wills were the first co- Presidents following a decision to establish a constitution and office-bearers in 1972. Founding members included Lex Watson, Peter de Waal and Peter Bonsall-Boone. CAMP also published a magazine, CAMP Ink, until 1977. The group's work included establishing a telephone counselling service called 'Phone-A-Friend', a service that continues as the Gay and Lesbian Counselling Service of NSW. CAMP campaigned for David Widdup, the first openly gay candidate to stand for office, in the seat of Lowe in the 1972 Australian federal election. CAMP held the first public gay rights demonstration in Australia in October 1971. = Recognition = The group was given the President’s Award at the 2018 Honour LGBTI Community Awards.

At the time I was a young journalist. It was a mistake. I look back and think I wish I hadn't done that.\\" Excerpts from the book were serialised in the Daily Mail, and the book also details Gove's life in Scotland as an adopted child. Bennett joined The Daily Telegraph as their Whitehall editor in August 2019.

It was located at the head of the Persian Gulf, bordering the Ottoman Empire to the west and the Zagros Mountains to the east. Although the emirate exercised self-rule for most of its history, imperial control over Arabistan would often vary, though starting from the 16th century most of Arabistan would be part of Safavid Iran until its fall in the 18th century. From 1800-1925, Arabistan would fall mostly within the Persian Empire as an autonomous polity. Before 1847, some regions within Arabistan, such as Abadan and Mohammerah fell within the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, in 1847, the Treaty of Erzurum gave Persia permanent jurisdiction over all of Arabistan, including the port cities of Abadan and Mohammerah. History =15th-18th Century: The rule of the Mush'ashayiah= Over many centuries, the Arab tribes crossed the Persian Gulf from Bahrain, Yemen, and Kuwait and settled in Khuzestan. In 1440, an Arab extremist Shia sect called the Mush'ashayiah, led by Muhammad ibn Falah ibn Hibat Allah, initiated a wave of attacks on Khuzestan, leading to a gradual increase in its Arab population. From the middle of the fifteenth century to the nineteenth century, they came to dominate much of western Khuzestan and were in continual conflict with the Safavid dynasty in the sixteenth century, as well as with other Arab tribes. In 1508, Shah Ismail Safavid captured Hawiza, Dizful and Shushtar, and received the submission of the Musha'sha sultans. As a consequence of Musha'sha rule, the western portion of Khuzestan province became known from early Safavid times as Arabistan.R.M. Savory. \\"K̲h̲ūzistān\\" in Encyclopedia of Islam, New Edition (eds, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, B. Lewis and Ch. Pellat). Brill. p. 80 In the latter part of the sixteenth century, the Bani Kaab Arab tribe from Kuwait settled in Arabistan. During the succeeding centuries, many more Arab tribes moved from southern Mesopotamia to Arabistan, and as a result, it became extensively Arabized. The rule of the Mush'ashayiah state ended in 1724, when the emirate of Bani Ka'b, under the Al Bu Nasir, took over and was able to extend its influence over all areas of Arabistan. =18th-19th Century: The rule of the Al Bu Nasir, Princes of Fallahiyah= For a long time prior to 1700, Arabistan, which had held a semi- autonomous position, was a subject of dispute between Teheran and Constantinople, as to whether the country should or should not form part of the dominions of the Shah/Sultan. Persian influence had usually been predominant but the population had become almost entirely Arab. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Arab element was further strengthened by the immigration of the great tribe of Bani Ka'ab, who were originally subject to Ottoman rule. As between Turkish and Persian domination, the Ka'ab had no preference, for both were equally distasteful to them, but when they spread eastwards they found themselves obliged to yield tribute to the Shah. Nominally subject to Persia, they were virtually independent and they appear now as allies of Persia, now as the allies of Turkey.” British relations with the tribes and Sheikhs of Arabistan go back over 250 years to the time when, in 1765, the Agents of the Honourable East India Company attempted naval operations against the Ka’ab. Between 1776-1779 and Basra was under Persian rule but this brief inter-regnum left little or no mark on Arabistan or its people. =19th-20th Century: The Rule of the Al Bu Kasib, Princes of Mohammerah= At the beginning of the 19th century a rival to the Cha’b in the Muhaisin appeared. This tribe determined to throw off the yoke of the Cha’b, to whom it was subject, and under an able and exceptionally long lived chief, Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw, who ruled from 1819 to 1881. He acquired large estates in Turkish territory that he might have a place of refuge and a means of livelihood in case of need, he aided the British government in its efforts to suppress piracy on the river, and he incurred the suspicion of his Persian Suzerain, who regarded relations between Great Britain and this Shaikh of Muhammarah with a doubtful eye and was inclined to listen to the rumour that the Shaikh intended to throw off his allegiance and transfer his Principality to the British. In 1890, British consulate established at Muhammarah, simultaneous with the opening of the Karun to foreign shipping and the advent of Messers. Lynch Brothers. Thence-forward the affairs of Arabistan began to assume more than academic importance to British diplomatic and political authorities. In 1897, Sheikh Khaz'al, Sheikh Jabir's youngest son inherited his father's Sheikhdom, and he would prove to be the most famous Emir of Arabistan. The British even mentioned in one of their military reports the following: \\"Sheikh Khaz’al is powerful, a fact which is realised by the Persian Government and the Bakhtiaris, and so long as he lives, Arabistan may hope for peace and prosperity, but the day of his death will be a bad day for Arabistan and possibly the British. Sheikh Khaz'al was, like his brother and father before him, to look for support to Teheran, and to pay his revenue to the Persian Government. He had, united the Cha'b as they had seldom, if ever, been united before, and was perhaps \\"...the most powerful Sheikh that Arabistan has ever known\\". Even in the days of Jabir and Miz'al, the Cha'b Sheikhs of Fellahieh were always more or less independent of Mohammerah. But Khaz'al kept the Sheikhs by him in Mohammerah, and Fellahieh was \\"a sort of Arab Republic, paying taxes, however, to Khaz'al.\\" Under Qajar Iran, the Sheikhdom of Mohammerah had a position as a semi-autonomous sheikhdom within the territories of Persia, however in 1925 when Reza, the first Pahlavi shah of Iran consolidated power, he dismantled all of the locally governed territories within Iran, including Mohammerah. As a result, Sheikh Khaz'al enlisted the support of Luri tribes, an ethnic group related to Persians to revolt against the new centralized government of Persian under Reza Pahlavi. The allied Luri and Arab tribesmen were defeated and the province was successfully brought under full central government control while Sheikh Khaz'al was placed under house arrest and the autonomy dismantled. Governance of the Emirate Arabistan was ruled by the hereditary Muhaisin Shaikh of Mohammerah. Sheikh Jabir realised that to control numerous tribes over a vast area the power must be in the hands of one man; he, therefore, gradually broke the power of the tribal shaikhs. His son Khaz’al, has always borne this in mind and discouraged the pretensions of tribal shaikhs. Since he was unable to control the tribes over the whole area, he appointed agents of his own selection, whom he sent out to the various districts and tribes to keep law and order and to collect revenue. These agents were rarely of high birth and stood to the Shaikh in the same relation as a non-commissioned officer to his officer in the British Army. They were appointed to obey his orders and if they failed in their duties they would be dismissed. These agents belonged to no tribe and owed their allegiance to no one but the Shaikh. The outcome of the system may be summarised as follows: #Revenue received was three and four times greater than when the Shaikh relied on tribal chiefs to collect from their own tribes. #The power of the tribal Shaikhs was broken and his own power was more firmly established. #The personal enmity for the Shaikh of all tribal shaikhs and others whose hope for power and wealth was thwarted. Relationship with Central Government The Arabs did not acknowledge the Persian claims to rule over them beyond the necessity of paying revenue to Persia, which they regard not so much as a token of dependence, but as a monetary payment for the protection which Persia afforded to them against Turkey. The tribes had never been more united than under Khaz'al's rule, and they owed no sort of allegiance to the person of the Shah. Although they hated Persian rule they had embraced the state religion Shia Islam. Statistics (pre-1925) =Districts= Mohammerah Mohammerah was the capital and most important town of Arabistan. This country was bounded on the east by the river Karun, on the west by the Shatt al Arab and the south by the Haffar canal. The town consisted of about 1,500 houses. Upon the river were some fine modern building; among the most conspicuous were the offices and residential houses of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and the palatial mansion of the Prime Minister of Arabistan, Haji Muhammad Ali, Rais- ut-Tujjar. There were 8 mosques, 3 public baths and 4 main bazaars, the Shaikh Khaz’al bazaar, which was widened and improved in 1921, the Suq-al-Shatt, Suq- Al-Bedah, and the Suq Al Khadarah. The town itself was divided into 4 quarters, Seef quarter, consisting of brick houses, Subba of mud huts and serifash, the Town, one third of which were mud and two-thirds brick houses and Sabakh. The Inhabitants of Mohammerah were chiefly local Arabs but there are also 100 families of Sabians and 300 families of Jews and Christians. Mohammerah was nominally governed by a deputy of the Shaikh, called Naib al Hukumah. This position would be occupied by members of the ruling family (specifically sons of Khaz’al). The Shaikh has a Hoshiyah, or personal guard, of 120 ghulam, whilst for the preservation of law and order in the town there existed a police force of four officers and ninety men. Failieh A village situated on the left bank of the Shatt Al Arab, 3 miles above Mohammerah, between the Shatt al Arab and the Abu Jidi canal. Failieh owed its importance to its being the headquarters of the Shaikh of Mohammerahs administration, where were the offices of his government and where was quartered his mercenary force of some 400 armed Arabs and Baluchis. The inhabitants were Muhaisin and mixed Arabs, Baluchis and Blacks. The principal buildings, were two palaces, which were occupied by the househould of the Shaikh, though he himself would reside in an imposing palace called Qasr al Khaz’aliya, three quarters of a mile farther up the same bank of the Shatt al Arab. Failieh was founded about 1860 by Shaikh Jabir, the first great Sheikh of the Muhaisin. The shaikh kept at Failieh 9 guns in a specially made gun room with 2 machine guns outside the gun room and 8 more machine guns in the castle. In the river lay 2 river streamers used by the Shaikh on his tours to Basrah and one seafaring ship, “the Ivy” on which he would make his periodical visits to Kuwait. Nasiriyah A town once situated on the left bank of the Karun immediately below the Ahwaz rapids, and about 1 mile from Al Ahwaz. It stood upon a slight elevation overlooking the river, and contained (as of 1923) 1,200 houses, 5 caravanerias, 6 baths, 5 mosques, 600 shops and two coffee shops. The population of Nasiriya was 7,000. The town was immediately under the power of the Sheikh and was administered by his son, the Crown Prince, Shaikh Abdul Hamid Khan. Hawizah Population of 700, entirely Shi’ah with the exception of a few families of Sabians. The district was Administered by Sheikh Molah, himself responsible to the Shaikh of Muhammarah. Hindian A town in the East of Arabistan with a population 1,000. Baghalahs would come from Bushire, Bahrain, Lingeh and Kuwait. Grain, live sheep and wool were exported. The Inhabitants consisted of Qanawtis and Bani Tamim. The district was governed by Khaz'al's son, Sheikh Abdullah Khan. Fallahiyah: Once the capital of Arabistan under the Cha'b leadership. In the 20th century, it was the capital of the Cha’b tribe with a population of 2,000. It is abundant in dates and rice. The district was administered by Khaz'al's son, Sheikh Abdulmajeed Khan. Baraim: A small village on the west coast of Abadan Island. Location of Anglo Persian Oil Company Refinery. Inhabitants are from the Muhaisin and Cha’b along with employees of APOC.

She is chief of the Molecular Neurogenetics Section.  Education  Sidransky graduated magna cum laude from Brandeis University in 1977 with a B.A. in biology, and received a M.D. in 1981 from Tulane University School of Medicine. She then trained in pediatrics at Lurie Children's Hospital, and completed fellowship training in clinical genetics at the National Institutes of Health Genetics Training Program.  Career  From left to right: Jenny Do, Ellen Sidransky and Bahafta Berhe in May 2019. Sidransky came to the National Institutes of Health in the late 1980s to learn molecular biology techniques. Sidransky has been a tenured investigator at NIH and a section chief since 2000. She is chief of the Molecular Neurogenetics Section and a pediatrician and clinical geneticist in the Medical Genetics Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute.  Research  Sidransky's research includes both clinical and basic research aspects of Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease, and her group first identified glucocerebrosidase as a risk factor for parkinsonism. She led two large international collaborative studies regarding the genetics of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Her current work also focuses on understanding the complexity encountered in \\"simple\\" Mendelian disorders, the association between Gaucher disease and parkinsonism and the development of small molecule chaperones as therapy for Gaucher disease and potentially parkinsonism. Sidransky directs two NIH clinical protocols, one evaluating patients with lysososmal storage disorders and the second prospectively studying patients and relatives with parkinsonism who carry mutations in GBA. The Sidransky group uses a translational approach, integrating both clinical and basic sciences. Over the past two decades, the Sidransky group has established a bank of clinical data, samples and ongoing clinical protocols on GD, to enable a better understanding of the natural history, the correlation of genotype with phenotype, and the contribution of factors modifying this disorder. Focusing on GD, the group is poised to investigate the intricate relationships between clinical manifestations, metabolic defects and molecular mechanisms, and to tackle the challenge of identifying genetic modifiers. Although GD is classically divided into three types, the section's research has shown that there is actually a continuum of manifestation, and they have uncovered several unexpected phenotypes.  Awards and honors  In April 2019, Parkinson's awareness month, Van Andel Institute honored Sidransky with the Jay Van Andel Award for Outstanding Achievement in Parkinson's Disease Research.

He was first mentioned as a rebel lord against his half-brother Muhammad Hasan Khan. He fled to Djaro-Belokani in 1784/1785. He later occupied Shaki when Muhammad Hasan travelled to visit new Qajar shah Agha Muhammad in Karabakh on November or December 1795. While Salim Khan lost the battle near Goynuk, a sudden arrest of Muhammad Hasan by Mostafa khan Davalu (a general under Agha Muhammad) on the charge of treason, led him to re-occupy Shaki using the opportunity. He was supported by Djaro-Belokani noble Aliskandar Huzzati. Muhammad Hasan khan was blinded by Qajars and sent to Tabriz as hostage, meanwhile his 7 underage sons were executed by Salim Khan.  First reign  His first reign started on November–December 1795. He submitted to Valerian Zubov in July–August 1796. However, abrupt end of Russian expedition in Caucasus and Agha Mohammad's new campaign in 1797 forced him to flee again on 9 May 1797. He struggled to take throne back and sought help who was now supported by Mustafa khan, however instead of battling, Muhammad Hasan surrendered himself to Mustafa khan, who spared him and sent viceroys to govern Shaki as a part of Shirvan. While Salim Khan informed his brother Fatali of this betrayal, locals enthroned Fatali Khan instead of Muhammad Hasan and Salim in defiance of Shirvan.Acts collected by the Caucasian Archeographic Commission: Volume 2, Tbilisi, 1868, p. 643-646  Second reign  He forced Fatali Khan to resign shortly in 1805 and defeated Mustafa khan with support from Tsitsianov who sent him 300 soldiers. Finally, he submitted to Russian authority on 2 June 1805 and soon was awarded with general-lieutenant rank on the order of Alexander I. He later mediated Mustafa khan's submission as well, forcing him to be Russian subject on 6 January 1806. After Tsitsianov's murder in Baku on 20 February and massacre of Ibrahim Khalil Khan's family (which also included Salim Khan's sister) by Russians on 2 June 1806, Salim Khan expelled the Russian garrison from Shaki on 24 June 1806. Russian general Pyotr Nebolsin attacked on November as retaliation and routed 8000 strong Shaki army composed of Dagestani mercenaries as well. According to Bakikhanov, he was paid by Qajar prince Abbas Mirza to secure mercenaries.  Life in exile  Salim khan fled to Iran in 1806 while he was succeeded by Fatali Khan in Shaki. He lived in Meshgin Shahr sometime around 1818 according to Mirza Fatali Akhundov and then in Tabriz, ultimately immigrating to Ottoman Empire. He initially petitioned to seek asylum and be appointed as a governor of Akhaltshikhe, sending his ambassador Muhammad Chalabi to Mahmud II. While he was granted asylum in Erzurum, he was not allowed to reside in Childir, Kars or Baghdad for security purposes. He was soon fell out favor for his demands to include his family members in Iran to be relocated to Erzurum and removed to Ankara in 1822. Salim Khan soon sent more requests, demanding more pensions, a visit to Constantinople and relocation to Bursa, which was denied by the Porte. He died on his way to Hajj on 12 April 1826 near Kırşehir.  Family  He was married to Tuti begim, daughter of Ibrahim Khalil khan of Karabakh, having issues: # Huseyn Khan Khan for a brief time in 1826. # Haji Khan Governor of Kermanshah in Qajar Iran. Later founded Hajikhanlou subtribe of Shahsevan. # Suleyman Khan Podpolkovnik in Imperial Russian Army. # Fakhrunnisa Khanum Married to Mahmud agha. # Asiya begum.

Description  Yoke lutes are defined as instruments with one or more strings, arranged parallel to the sound board and attached to a yoke lying on the same plane as the sound table, composed of two arms and a crosspiece. Most of the instruments of the lyre family are played by plucking the strings, but some involve the use of a bow instead. The sound box can be either bowl-shaped (321.21) or box-shaped (321.22). In the first case, the resonator is often a turtle shell, while the sound board is made of leather. In the second case, usually both the body and the sound board are made of wood.  Examples  Examples of yoke lutes are the lyre, the cithara and the phorminx from Ancient Greece, the biblical kinnor and the African nyatiti. However, there are other instruments called \\"lyra\\" or \\"lira\\" that do not belong, from an organological point of view, to this family, but rather to the handle lutes, such as: the Byzantine lyra, the Calabrian lira, the Cretan lyra, the lira da braccio, the lyra viol.

Tens of thousands of angry Ethiopian Jews protesters clashed with Israeli police and blocked at least 15 intersections across Israel,Staff. (3 July 2019) \\"Policeman Kills Youngman in Haifa: Ethiopian Jewish Community in Revolt\\", asianews.it. Retrieved 23 July 2019. while thousands of people were stuck in traffic congestion. According to police, the clashes between protesters and police caused a total of at least 110 officers and 26 rioters getting injured, and at least 130 demonstrators getting arrested. At first the police did not act firmly against the protesters. A few hours later, after recognizing that events were spiraling out of control, they began to employ riot dispersal methods, including the use of tear gas and stun grenades. Teka's family made a request to the demonstrators to stop protesting out of respect to the shiva (mourning period), which began immediately after their son's funeral on 3 July, and the protests were put on hold. But three days later the Ethiopian community leaders decided to restart the nationwide demonstrations. Background Israel's Ethiopian Jewish community numbers around 140,000 people out of Israel's 9 million citizens, with more than 50,000 being born in the country. Although the community had been cut off from the Jewish world for centuries, they were recognized as Jews by Israeli religious authorities. The government worked to move 80,000 Ethiopians to Israel in the 1980s and 1990s. While many Ethiopians have integrated well into Israeli society, with many serving in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and police, and others in sports, politics or entertainment, there is still widespread poverty, lack of opportunity and routine police harassment. Many have expressed feelings of being subjected to systemic bias, being considered second-class citizens, or having to constantly worry about police harassment due to their skin colour. According to Israeli media reports, 11 Ethiopians have been killed by police since 1997. Many African migrants and refugees living in Israel have stated that they too have felt anger against the state. In 2015, a video clip showing Ethiopian-Israeli soldier Damas Pakada being beaten by policemen set off protests that lasted for ten days. The protests turned into violent demonstrations, with the Israeli police using tear gas against the demonstrators, resulting in 7 protesters and at least 50 officers getting injured. One protester told the BBC, \\"We are not prepared to wait any longer to be recognized as equal citizens. It may take a few months but it will happen.\\" Although Pakada, an IDF soldier working in a cyber unit, believed the incident to have been motivated by racism, the court case closed without significant punishment being leveled against the defendants. In another case, on 18 January 2019, a 24-year-old Ethiopian-Israeli named Yehuda Biadga was killed by police officers, who said that he was holding a knife. His family stated that he was suffering from mental illness, and had not taken his medications when he was shot by police. Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv after Biadga's killing. Incidents of Ethiopian community members rising up in protest against police brutality and racism had happened before, but the killing of an 18-year-old Ethiopian in a park would soon reignite tensions. Incident On the evening of 30 June 2019, an off- duty police officer in Kiryat Haim, a neighborhood in the northern part of the city of Haifa, had gone on an outing with his wife and three small children to a playground. While there, he noticed some teens beating up a younger boy. The officer entered the fight scene and tried to break it up. Among the youths was Solomon Teka, an Ethiopian-Israeli who was born and grew up in Gondar, Ethiopia, and moved with his family to Israel around 2013, when he was 12. The officer identified himself, and the youths began to throw stones at him. According to the police statement, the officer felt his life was in danger, prompting him to use his gun against the attackers, firing one shot that he said was fired at the ground, but instead ricocheted and hit Teka, who was killed. The other youths and a local witness later claimed that the policeman was not being attacked, and that he just started shooting at the youths who had gathered at the playground. Teka's funeral took place on 3 July. On 17 July, Channel 12 reported that medical examiners had found a quantity of alcohol in Teka's body \\"at twice the level of a drunk person\\", along with traces of hashish. \\"An expert in the field\\" who was consulted stated that \\"the combination of the two can lead to recklessness and trigger violent behaviour.\\" The family's attorney dismissed the report as another attempt to smear Teka's name and justify his killing--in effect killing him twice.Nussbaum, Moshe (17 July 2019) \\"פרשת הירי בסלמון טקה ז\\"ל: בגופו נמצאה כמות אלכוהול גדולה, צרך סם מסוג חשיש\\", mako.co.il (in Hebrew). Retrieved 18 July 2019. On 4 February 2020, the police officer, whose name remained under gag order, was indicted by state prosecutors for negligent homicide.  Protests  At least 130 demonstrators arrested during the Ethiopian Jews protest in Israel Tens of thousands of angry Ethiopian protesters clashed with Israeli police and blocked at least 15 highways across Israel In the wake of the killing, thousands of Ethiopian Jews rioted and staged protests in several Israeli cities beginning on 2 July. Dozens of protesters blocked traffic at main highways in Haifa. Video footage showed numerous cars on fire, and other footage showed protesters jumping on a car and trying to break its windows. While many protesters were calm, others were violent, with some destroying what appeared to be police cars. In one video, many people are seen joining together to flip a car over and to set fires in the street as they are screaming \\"End the killing, and end the racism.\\" Approximately 200 demonstrators took to the streets of Afula, where they blocked traffic at a main intersection. Meanwhile, demonstrators created makeshift roadblocks in important intersections in several major Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and Haifa, by burning tires in them. Some 50,000 people were stuck in traffic across Israel as the result of the blocking of 15 of these major intersections by protesters. Teka's family asked the demonstrators to stop protesting and wait till the end of the seven-day shiva (mourning period), and on 3 July the protests were placed on hold. But three days later, Ethiopian community leaders held a Saturday meeting and decided to restart the demonstrations. Israel police commissioner Moti Cohen, while calling the protesters \\"lawbreakers\\", sent a message to all Israeli police officers asking them to exercise restraint ahead of any new wave of protests. The police initially allowed protesters to block some roads, and tried to avoid any direct confrontations with them. But when updated information about the number of injured officers reached supervisors, it was announced that they would start clamping down on the protesters. Eventually, the police started using force to clear the blocked roads, while simultaneously employing a tactic of negotiations with leaders of the community. Utilising a variety of riot dispersal methods at their disposal, including tear gas and stun grenades, police began to overpower the rioters. Nonetheless, in the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Ata a mass of over one thousand people converged on a police station, where some of the protesters managed to hurl smoke grenades into the building.Shpigel, Noa and Breiner, Josh (1 July 2019) \\"Off-duty Police Officer Shoots Dead Ethiopian Israeli Teen in Northern Israel\\", Haaretz. Retrieved 6 August 2019. Police said they arrested a total of more than 130 protesters, and that more than 110 officers were injured in the clashes. Among the hundreds of marchers many chanted, \\"There's no difference from blood to blood. We're all human beings.\\" Some referenced slogans of the U.S. Black Lives Matter movement, chanting, \\"I can't breathe.\\" One 26 year old protester told Agence France-Presse (AFP): Israel's emergency medical corps Magen David Adom (MDA) reported that some of the people who were stuck in traffic due to the roads blocked by protesters needed help and medicine. During the operations, six MDA ambulances were damaged by stone-throwing rioters, as were four MDA motorcycles and a mobile intensive care unit. Emergency services said that they treated 50 people with injuries, including protesters, police officers and even random drivers caught in the traffic jams created by the blockades. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld stated that the protesters were attacking both police officers and civilians. He added that the police officer in question was placed under house arrest, and that an investigation by the Justice Ministry had commenced. An Israeli judge proposed a seven-day investigation into the Teka case. Reactions Amir Peretz, winner of the primary for the leadership of the Israeli Labor Party on 2 July, postponed his victory celebration due to the protests. He said, \\"I've decided not to hold my victory celebration in light of the deep rift [in Israeli society] that is being intensified in front of our very eyes and the protest of the Ethiopian community. This outburst expresses the sense of discrimination they have been carrying for many years. Tomorrow we'll do everything that is required to reunite the party and make it a political home for every Israeli.\\" In a video statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, \\"We're all mourning the tragic death of the youth Solomon Teka... I know that there are problems that need to be solved. We have worked hard and need to work more to solve them. But I ask of you one thing: Stop blocking the roads. We are a nation of law, we will not tolerate the blocking of roads... I ask you, let's solve the problems together while upholding the law.\\" Minister Gilad Erdan, the Israeli Public Security minister, expressed his sorrow at Teka's killing and reiterated the Ethiopians' right to demonstrate non-violently, saying \\"We will fight for the rights of people to protest...but we will not tolerate anarchy and we will not tolerate a major hit to the public order.\\" He stressed that there had been a 21% drop in the arrest rate of Ethiopians, adding \\"The terrible incident in Kiryat Haim does not represent the processes that the Israeli police has undergone...The protest of the community is legitimate, but every democratic protest has limits that must not be crossed and that the police cannot ignore\\". Reuven Rivlin, Israel's President, appealed to the protesters for calm, saying \\"I ask all of us to act responsibly and with moderation. I know that you are doing everything in your power to convey the voice of your protest and to lead a change that is all about righting wrongs and creating a better future. No one wants revenge... We must all be partners in this process. We have no other choice. We have no other home... This is not a civil war.\\" Israeli Police Commissioner, Moti Cohen, called the protesters \\"lawbreakers\\" and said, \\"There is the law and there is a way to protest. Along with the rights of the demonstrators, there is an obligation to uphold the rights of the public and the citizens. There is no place for attacks on representatives of the government, on institutions, or against property, and there is certainly no place for unchecked rampaging. Solomon's father, Workah (David) Tekah supported the protests but appealed for calm, saying \\"I want to thank the Israeli people for their support of us. I'm asking the demonstrators not to use violence, and I am calling on the police to behave with restraint and tolerance. I can't have my son back, but we want there to be a fair trial and a just legal system. Let my son be the last, and no more children be killed.\\" Solomon's cousin, Amir Teka stated his opinion that his cousin was murdered, not killed. He pointed out that Solomon had not been hit by a car or killed in a work accident, but rather had been shot to death.

The Association is headquartered in the Vatican's Cortile di San Damaso. The current President is Domenico Ruggiero. History The association was founded in 1972 by Dr. Sergio Valci, a Vatican employee. He remained President of the Association until his death in 2012. Mass has been held for members of the Association at Saint Peter's tomb below St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican grottoes. Sports The Vatican Amateur Sports Association is currently involved with three sports: football, cricket, and athletics. =Football= Vatican City is one of the eight officially recognized and independent states whose national football team is not a member of FIFA (the others are Monaco, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Marshall Islands, and Palau). However, Vatican City has fielded a men's national team since as early as 1994 and a women's national team since 2019. In 2006 UEFA spokesperson William Gaillard told a media outlet that he saw no reason why the Vatican should not have a national team in international competitions. He said, \\"We already have states of 30,000 citizens like San Marino, Liechtenstein, and Andorra. If the Vatican wants to become a member of UEFA all it has to do is apply. If it meets the requirements, it will be accepted\\". At that time Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone insisted that the Vatican's football future lies only in amateur games and competitions. In May 2014, Domenico Ruggerio, president of the national football association, stated, \\"I prefer to be amateur...To join FIFA, at that level, will be like a business\\" after stating, \\"The important message of friendship and love is demonstrated by the sport — the real sport, not the business that is in football these days...It is not just important to win a match; it is how you carry yourself.\\" Therefore, that, he added, meant that \\"the ethos of the Vatican's soccer team was, at odds with FIFA membership. In addition to the national teams, the Association organizes the Vatican City Championship, Coppa Sergio Valci, and the Vatican Supercoppa. =Cricket= The Vatican Cricket Team is an amateur cricket team established by the Vatican in October 2012 to help establish ties between the Catholic Church and countries and regions where the sport is popular including India and the Caribbean and to encourage inter-faith dialogue. =Athletics= Vatican Athletics was launched in 10 January 2019 with 60 initial accredited members. Vatican Athletics is the first sports team to have legal status in the Vatican and is officially affiliated with the Italian Athletics Federation. The Holy See and the Italian Olympic Committee have made an agreement to set up an official athletics team with the intention making the Vatican City able to compete in international sporting tournaments including the Summer Olympics.

The increasingly high number of ECUs in vehicles and, alongside, the implementation of multiple different means of communication from and towards the vehicle in a remote and wireless manner led to the necessity of a branch of cybersecurity dedicated to the threats associated with vehicles. Not to be confused with automotive safety. Causes The implementation of multiple ECUs (Electronic Control Units) inside vehicles began in the early '70s thanks to the development of integrated circuits and microprocessors that made it economically feasible to produce the ECUs on a large scale. Since then the number of ECUs has increased to up to 100 per vehicle. These units nowadays control almost everything in the vehicle, from simple tasks such as activating the wipers to more safety- related ones like brake-by-wire or ABS (Anti-lock Braking System). Autonomous driving is also strongly reliant on the implementation of new, complex ECUs such as the ADAS, alongside sensors (lidars and radars) and their control units. Inside the vehicle, the ECUs are connected with each other through cabled or wireless communication networks, such as CAN bus (Controller Area Network), MOST bus (Media Oriented System Transport), FlexRay or RF (Radio Frequency) as in many implementations of TPMSs (Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems). It is important to notice that many of these ECUs require data received through these networks that arrive from various sensors to operate and use such data to modify the behavior of the vehicle (e.g., the cruise control modifies the vehicle's speed depending on signals arriving from a button usually located on the steering wheel). Since the development of cheap wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth, LTE, Wi-Fi, RFID and similar, automotive producers and OEMs have designed ECUs that implement such technologies with the goal of improving the experience of the driver and passengers. Safety-related systems such as the OnStar from General Motors, telematic units, communication between smartphones and the vehicle's speakers through Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and RKES (Remote Keyless Entry Systems) are just examples of how the vehicle has become externally connected to devices and, in some cases, to the internet. Furthermore, since 2016, with the development and implementation in marketed vehicles of V2X technologies, the long- and short-range communication interfaces of the vehicle have become considerably bigger. Although the implementation of new technologies and devices improved the safety and driving experience of the vehicle, the increasingly high number of externally-communicating units inside each vehicle has led to an increment in the dimension of the attack surfaces of each vehicle. As electronic control units nowadays have the capability of modifying the behavior of the vehicle, it is necessary to ensure that an attacker cannot have the capabilities to take control of critical systems inside the vehicle. Due to this, in the last ten to fifteen years, the new concept of automotive security started to become more and more important when designing new vehicles. Threat Model Threat models of the automotive world are based on both real-world and theoretically possible attacks. Most real- world attacks aim at the safety of the people in and around the car, by modifying the cyber-physical capabilities of the vehicle (e.g., steering, braking, accelerating without requiring actions from the driver), while theoretical attacks have been supposed to focus also on privacy-related goals, such as obtaining GPS data on the vehicle, or capturing microphone signals and similar. Regarding the attack surfaces of the vehicle, they are usually divided in long-range, short-range, and local attack surfaces: LTE and DSRC can be considered long-range ones, while Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are usually considered short-range although still wireless. Finally, USB, OBD-II and all the attack surfaces that require physical access to the car are defined as local. An attacker that is able to implement the attack through a long-range surface is considered stronger and more dangerous than the one that requires physical access to the vehicle. In 2015 the possibility of attacks on vehicles already on the market has been proven possible by Miller and Valasek, that managed to disrupt the driving of a Jeep Cherokee while remotely connecting to it through remote wireless communication. =Controller Area Network Attacks= The most common network used in vehicles and the one that is mainly used for safety-related communication is CAN, due to its real-time properties, simplicity, and cheapness. For this reason the majority of real-world attacks have been implemented against ECUs connected through this type of network. The majority of attacks demonstrated either against actual vehicles or in testbeds fall in one or more of the following categories:  Sniffing  Sniffing in the computer security field generally refers to the possibility of intercepting and logging packets or more generally data from a network. In the case of CAN, since it is a bus network, every node listens to all communication on the network. It is useful for the attacker to read data to learn the behavior of the other nodes of the network before implementing the actual attack. Usually, the final goal of the attacker is not to simply sniff the data on CAN, since the packets passing on this type of network are not usually valuable just to read.  Denial of Service  DoS in information security is usually described as an attack that has the objective of making a machine or a network unavailable. DoS attacks against ECUs connected to CAN buses can be done both against the network, by abusing the arbitration protocol used by CAN to always win the arbitration, both targeting the single ECU, by abusing the error handling protocol of CAN. In this second case the attacker flags the messages of the victim as faulty to convince the victim of being broken and therefore shut itself off the network.  Spoofing  Spoofing attacks comprise all cases in which an attacker, by falsifying data, sends messages pretending to be another node of the network. In automotive security usually spoofing attacks are divided in Masquerade and Replay attacks. Replay attacks are defined as all those where the attacker pretends to be the victim and sends sniffed data that the victim sent in a previous moment. Masquerade are, on the contrary, all those spoofing attacks where the data payload has been created by the attacker.  Real Life Automotive Threat Example  Security researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek have successfully demonstrated remote access to a wide variety of vehicle controls using a Jeep Cherokee as the target. They were able to control the radio, environmental controls, windshield wipers, and certain engine and brake functions. The method used to hack the system was implementation of pre- programmed chip into the controller area network (CAN) bus. By inserting this chip into the CAN bus, he was able to send arbitrary message to CAN bus. One other thing that Miller has pointed out is the danger of the CAN bus, as it broadcasts the signal which the message can be caught by the hackers throughout the network. The control of the vehicle was all done remotely, manipulating the system without any physical interaction. Miller states that he could control any of some 1.4 million vehicles in the United States regardless of the location or distance, the only thing needed is for someone to turn on the vehicle to gain access. Security Measures The increasing complexity of devices and networks in the automotive context requires the application of security measures to limit the capabilities of a potential attacker. Since the early 2000 many different countermeasures have been proposed and, in some cases, applied. Following, a list of the most common security measures: *Sub-networks: to limit the attacker capabilities even if he/she manages to access the vehicle from remote through a remotely connected ECU, the networks of the vehicle are divided in multiple sub-networks, and the most critical ECUs are not placed in the same sub-networks of the ECUs that can be accessed from remote. *Gateways: the sub-networks are divided by secure gateways or firewalls that block messages from crossing from a sub-network to the other if they were not intended to. *Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): on each critical sub-network, one of the nodes (ECUs) connected to it has the goal of reading all data passing on the sub-network and detect messages that, given some rules, are considered malicious (made by an attacker). The arbitrary messages can be caught by the passenger by using IDS which will notify the owner regarding with unexpected message. *Authentication protocols: in order to implement authentication on networks where it is not already implemented (such as CAN), it is possible to design an authentication protocol that works on the higher layers of the ISO OSI model, by using part of the data payload of a message to authenticate the message itself. *Hardware Security Modules: since many ECUs are not powerful enough to keep real-time delays while executing encryption or decryption routines, between the ECU and the network it is possible to place a hardware security module that manages security for it.

Career He joined Old Belvedere, who were coached by Ireland legend Ollie Campbell at the time, before joining Dublin University, the rugby club of Trinity College, which Cunningham attended at the time. In 1992, Cunningham's work took him to Dooradoyle, Limerick, and he joined Garryowen, for whom his father had also played for, and was pressed into the first XV after Keith Wood suffered a shoulder injury. He remained in the team throughout the 1992–93 season and won the Munster Senior Cup against Limerick rivals and newly crowned All-Ireland League champions Young Munster. With Wood focusing on his Ireland commitments for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Cunningham won a second Munster Senior Cup in 1995–96, and an injury to Terry Kingston saw him earn the first of eight caps for Munster in 1995. His performances for Munster saw Cunningham earn selection for the Ireland A squad and a contract offer from the IRFU, but three months into the contract he suffered a popped disc which hampered his career. Despite playing in Munster's interprovincial games in 1996–97, he was then dropped, though continued to play for Garryowen.

Born in the Piccadilly area of London, Reade was educated at Gibbs Preparatory School, Stonehouse Preparatory School, and Eton College, where his politics were influenced by the Earl De La Warr. In 1919/20, he attended the University of Strasbourg, then briefly became a journalist, working for the Daily Mail. He returned to the UK, studying history at Worcester College, Oxford, where he was active in the Labour Club and the Socialist Society, and edited The New Oxford journal.John McIlroy, \\"Reade, Arthur Essex Edgeworth\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XI, pp.205-211 In 1921, Reade joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and he launched The Free Oxford, an influential communist journal. Contributors to Free Oxford included Edward Carpenter, Louis Golding, A. E. Coppard, Edgell Rickword and Richard Hughes. Reade was expelled from the university in December, by the Vice-Chancellor Doctor Lewis Farnell. Farnell objected to Reade's publishing of Free Oxford, and he accused Reade of \\"advocating the methods of the Red Terror.\\"Don Chapman, Oxford Playhouse: High and Low Drama in a University City.Hatfield, University of Hertfordshire Press, 2008 , (p.34) Reade received widespread sympathy in the press, but was not readmitted, and focused on journalism, especially for the Workers' Weekly and Labour Monthly, working closely with Rajani Palme Dutt. In 1924, he became business manager of the Labour Monthly, and also served on the London District Committee of the CPGB. Reade was a supporter of Trotsky, the first British communist to describe himself as a Trotskyist, and from late 1924 this led him to fall out of favour in the CPGB. He was removed from his party posts, and went travelling in Greece and the Balkans. He returned to the UK in 1928, resigning from the CPGB and joining the Labour Party. He stood for his new party in Abingdon at the 1929 UK general election, taking third place, with 12.5% of the vote. In 1930, Reade joined the Inner Temple and studied to become a barrister. He resigned from the Labour Party in 1931, briefly joining the New Party, but then rejoined Labour. By 1936, he was disappointed with Labour's opposition to rearmament, and defected to the National Labour Organisation. He continued to regard himself as a supporter of Trotsky, and wrote in opposition to the Moscow Trials. He was adopted as the party's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Bristol East, but no election was held until 1945, by which time he had left politics. In 1940, Reade joined the British Army, and the following year was appointed to the Special Operations Executive, becoming its head of administration. In November 1942 he was sent on a mission to blow up HMS York which was lying partly submerged in Suda Bay before the Germans could relaunch it. The mission was considered suicidal and he was only supplied with faulty explosives, so the mission was aborted, and he was extracted in May 1943. Reade was sent back to England, but cleared of any errors, and instead promoted to major. After the war, Reade worked in Germany translating the German Penal code into English and once that was finished he worked for the War Crimes Commission in Germany, concentrating on war crimes committed in Northeast Europe. In 1950, he then became a resident magistrate in Kenya, moving to Cyprus in 1953 where he was the island's only English and Greek speaking lawyer. He retired in 1963, moving to Jersey, and died eight years later.

Text and theme  The text, written in the first person, is focused on an attitude of empty hands, limited knowledge and understanding, and many questions. In the second stanza, the old promises, such as being rescued from exile, are compared to the present situation, of doubt, feeling helpless, and caught in inability to change (\\"mein Unvermögen hält mich ganz gefangen\\"). The last stanza asks God to speak the words that console and make free (\\"Sprich du das Wort, das tröstet und befreit), leading to a great peace (und das mich führt in deinen großen Frieden\\").

This new engine, introduced in 1956, combined elements of both Colombo and Lampredi engines with new features. Engine architecture was more of Lampredi school but retained smaller Colombo internal measurements. Jano moved to Ferrari along with his designs for the Lancia D50 in 1955 and went on to design not only a new V12 but also a family of the Dino V6 engines soon after. Some of the technical ideas came from the Jano's Lancia V8 DOHC engine, intended for Formula One. This family of engines replaced Lampredi inline-4s known from Ferrari Monza line and went on to win many international races and titles for Ferrari. The design team comprised Jano as well as Vittorio Bellentani,Profiting from History quotes Phil Hill referring to the Jano V12 as the «Bellentani engine». Alberto Massimino (best known for the Maserati 250F), and Andrea Fraschetti. Andrea Fraschetti (1928–57), Ferrari engineer All Jano engines used dry sump lubrication and almost all of them had two spark plugs per cylinder with four coils. Also most of them had DOHC configuration with chain-driven camshafts and two valves per cylinder. Applications =290 MM= Type 130 was the first engine designed by Jano for Ferrari. Introduced in 1956 it remained the only SOHC in its V12 family. Bore and stroke was 73 mm by 69.5 mm for a total capacity of . At 9:1 compression ratio and, at first, with only three Weber 36 IR4/C1 carburettors this powerplant produced at 7200 rpm and could achieve 280 km/h top speed. Only four cars were made, all bodied by Scaglietti as spyders. The Ferrari 290 MM that used this engine was a highly competitive race car at its time. =290 S= Type 136 was introduced in 1957 for the Ferrari 290 S. Having same measurements as before (73 mm by 69.5 mm) and same capacity, this engine received a DOHC configuration. It was the first Ferrari sports racing car with a DOHC V12 engine, nine years before Colombo V12 received a quad-cam upgrade in 275 P2. Those twin camshafts per cylinder bank were inspired by the Lancia D50 Formula One car's engine, also designed by Vittorio Jano. With a new configuration also the fuel system was upgraded and now the 290 S sported six Weber 42DCN carburettors. The power grew slightly to but at higher, 8000, rpm. Compression and top speed remained the same. This car was very short lived and same year, after a couple of races, upgraded to the 315 specification. =315 S= Type 140 was a first step forward in terms of capacity. Redesigned in 1957 and enlarged to thanks to bigger 76 mm bore with the same stroke as before. Power output was now at 7800 rpm. Same six Webers setup, compression ratio and spark plugs arrangement remained. Double camshafts per bank engine was not only more powerful than previous single-cam engines but also lighter and more reliable, which was important in long distance racing. The Ferrari 315 S with this engine won the last ever Mille Miglia in 1957. =335 S= Type 141 also debuted in 1957 on the Ferrari 335 S. Having even bigger displacement than before at , this was also the last enlargement. Both bore and stroke were changed, now at 77 mm by 72 mm, respectively. Previous Weber carburettors were upgraded to 44 DCN type. Compression ratio was slightly upped to 9.2:1 which resulted in at 7400 rpm of maximum power. The Ferrari 335 S equipped with this engine could top 300 km/h. =312 S= Type 142 was very short lived installed in a single chassis ever produced. Due to tragic events at the Mille Miglia, new regulations forced limited displacement to 3.0 L for 1958 season. This new requirement-meeting engine had the same measurements as Colombo 250 at 73 mm by 58.8 mm resulting in total capacity of , difference being that this was a quad-cam configuration. Power output was at 8400 rpm, that is more than the 250 Testa Rossa from the same year. The only Jano V12 single spark plug engine with two magnetos. After only a single, unfinished race in the Spa Francorchamps Grand Prix in May 1958, the car was quickly converted into the 412 S. =412 MI= 412 S engine closeup The Ferrari 412 MI (MI for Monza Indianapolis) was one of only two Ferrari race cars, purpose- made for the 1958 500 Miles of Monza, a sort of Italian version of the Indianapolis 500. This single-seater used the 4.0 L engine from the 335 S. Now with a 9.9:1 compression ratio and a six Weber 42DCN carburettors, it could produce up to at 7700 rpm. It was the most powerful of the Ferrari engines to date. Luigi Musso won qualifying at a record average speed of . The actual race was divided into three heats and, with an aid from Phil Hill and Mike Hawthorn, the 412 MI was able to finish third overall, just behind two purpose-built American competitors. =412 S= Type 141 again found its way into a sports racing chassis. This time as a result of a conversion from the 312 S in 1958. This model is usually confused with the 412 MI due to a similar name. The engine was based on the 4.0 L unit from the MI with a higher compression ratio and the same 42-type carburettors. It could produce an impressive at 8000 rpm. The car was raced in California by Phil Hill, Richie Ginther and John von Neumann (Ferrari distributor for California). Racing successes Ferrari race cars sporting Jano-designed V12 engines scored many victories in Europe and internationally. In 1956, the 290 MM won the Mille Miglia, brought 1-2 victory at the Sveriges Grand Prix and placed third at the 1000 km Nürburgring. In 1957, the 290 MM won the 1000 km Buenos Aires. Same year the 315 S scored 1-2 victory at the Mille Miglia and third place at the 1000 km Nürburgring with the highest Le Mans score of fifth place. The 335 S won 1-2 at the Gran Premio de Venezuela and finished second at the Nürburgring and the Swedish Grand Prix. In the short-lived Race of Two Worlds, ran in 1957 and 1958 only, the highest place of any European entrant was achieved by the Ferrari 412 MI. The Jano V12 engines helped Ferrari achieve 1956 and 1957 World Sportscar Championships. In 1956 the 290 MM scored two out of five rounds and in 1957 three different Jano-engined models won three out of seven rounds. After rules change for 1958 season, imposing a 3.0 L total capacity limit, most of the Jano sports cars became obsolete. In the end Ferrari moved towards ubiquitous Colombo 250 engined sports and GT cars, winning 1958 World Sportscar Championship solely with the 250 Testa Rossas. D50 V8 Lancia- Ferrari D50 V8 engine Vittorio Jano being a talented engineer, designed many different types of engines in his career. When Enzo Ferrari brought him from Lancia in 1955 he also inherited their , DOHC, 90° V8 Formula One engine from Lancia D50 race car. In 1956 this car was reinstituted as the Ferrari D50 and was powered by a engine with 76 x 68.5 mm of bore and stroke and capable of at 8000 rpm. V8 engine was redesigned yet again for 1957 Formula One season and used in the Ferrari 801 F1 single-seater. Now it could deliver at 8400 rpm. Compression was 11.5:1 and four Solex 40 PII carburettors were installed. Engine was of a quad-cam configuration and had a dry sump. The 801 design team also included Carlo Chiti.

In 2015 she ordered the arrest of former governor Silval Barbosa on corruption charges. She retired from judicial office in March 2017 after serving as a judge for 22 years. In May 2019 Arruda was awarded the order of merit by the city council of Cuiabá for her fight against corruption. Political career In the 2018 Brazilian general election Arruda, along with Jayme Campos, was elected to the national senate from the state of Mato Grosso. Arudda was the most voted candidate in the state of Mato Grosso that election. Strong themes of Arruda's senate campaign agenda included anti-corruption and encouraging private property. On 10 April 2019 Arruda was unanimously ordered to be dismissed by the Regional Electoral Court of Mato Grosso, rendering her ineligible to serve in public office along with state deputies Gilberto Possamai and Clerie Fabiana. However, the senator can still appeal to the Superior Electoral Court without having to leave the office, while the conviction is questioned judicially. Selma and the others were accused of breaking campaign rulers by hiring irregular advertising before the official campaign began. Arruda said she will appeal the decision in the federal courts. On 10 December 2019 by the vote of 6 to 1, the Superior Electoral Court voted to disqualify Arruda from political office. On 18 September 2019 Arruda switched political parties and joined Podemos.

The game early access was released worldwide on Steam, on July 16, 2019. It is designed for 4 player online co-op play. The game is also playable single player. Killsquad is based on a science fiction universe where bounty hunter teams called Killsquads raid planets seeking for the little available resources left. It takes inspiration from 70s westerns, pulp fiction, as well as military science fiction such as Starship Troopers. Gameplay Upon entering the game, players are presented with a contract browser. Bounty Hunter Contracts are being offered to players in real-time, so they can either select one, or tag along with other players to fulfill missions together. Players can join forces with others on Steam, or tag along with unknowns. These contracts last approximately thirty minutes, and can be anything from hunting a large boss creature, escorting units, defending areas, etc. Heroes in Killsquad are class-based, and always start each contract at Level 1. Passive and active skills are specific to each hero, and can be available from the start, or unlocked as the contract progresses. By choosing skills, players can adapt their hero to the contract they need to undertake. Heroes also have a numeric value, the Vector. Vector is a metric of how good is the equipment currently assigned to that hero, be it weapons, or additional power-ups called Gears in the Killsquad universe. The Vector of a squad is a metric based on the Vectors of its team members. Fulfilling contracts and using the bounty to buy new weapons and gears is thus key, as Contracts require a certain vector to enter. If your squad has a Vector number below of the recommendation for the Contract, survival chances are lowered. Killsquad is a paid title, and so there is no microtransactions or loot boxes: once the contract is fulfilled, players get a reward in in-game currency, which they can spend on better weapons or equipment for their heroes. Planets on Killsquad are procedurally generated in a way similar to Left4Dead: the layout of the map is built by an AI, which also controls the spawning of monsters, the quests offered to the team, the reward, to keep players engaged. Planets are considered as another enemy on Killsquad, and so the AI can also spawn disasters to hamper the squad's progress, from meteor storms to minefields and police squads. =Multiplayer= Killsquad is class oriented, and so combining different heroes with different skills is key to survival. Some heroes, like Kosmo, follow a classic tank pattern, with aggro, huge life pools and melee attacks, whereas others, like Zero, are healer-style characters, which allow the team to heal mid-mission. Killsquad has four heroes to choose from, with more to be added. The game is playable solo, but this is used mostly for training, as the main game mode is four player co-op. Plot Reception At E3 2019, Killsquad received an Unreal Award nomination for Most Engaging Game from Epic Games. Upon previewing the title, Alana Hagues of the website RPGFan wrote: \\"Killsquad was one of the biggest surprises at this year's E3 for me.\\" References External links * Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Spain Category:Upcoming video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Early access video games ","title":"Killsquad"},{"id":"61203744","text":"Doiyang-Dhansiri is one of the ancient archaeological sites in Assam with evidence of ‘Pani Kheti’/ ‘Shali Kheti’ (rice cultivation).

Career =Oakland Athletics= Drafted out of Indiana State University by the Oakland Athletics in the 2012 Major League Baseball draft's ninth round, Bacus pitched mostly as a starter for the Class-A Beloit Snappers in his first full professional season in 2013. Bacus gained some media notoriety for a recurring on-field stunt in 2013 with Beloit, in which he would dress in all- white and stand on the warning track with his back to the white outfield wall during home games. \\"The Whitewall Ninja\\" would remain on the field, even when balls were put in play into the outfield, until he was noticed and told to go back to the bullpen. The Athletics' minor league coordinator ultimately stepped in to put a stop to the gag. =Washington Nationals= Bacus was traded to the Washington Nationals for catcher Kurt Suzuki on August 23, 2013. In the Nationals system over the next few years, Bacus made slow progress, briefly reaching the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, the Nationals' top minor league affiliate, in 2015. After an injury-marred 2016 season in which he didn't make it back to Class-AAA ball, Bacus considered retiring from professional baseball. In 2017, Bacus experienced a marked jump in performance, pitching to a 1.80 ERA out of the Class-A Advanced Potomac Nationals and Class-AA Harrisburg Senators bullpens. He was invited to pitch in the Arizona Fall League after the 2017 season, appearing with the Mesa Solar Sox. Bacus later told his hometown paper, The Rock Island Dispatch- Argus, that he had rediscovered what made baseball fun for him in 2017. After spending the 2018 season with the Senators, Bacus was promoted in April 2019 to the Class-AAA Fresno Grizzlies, his first return to the level in nearly four years. He was named a Pacific Coast League All-Star in 2019, alongside teammate Yadiel Hernández. By late June 2019, Bacus was being mentioned as a candidate for a promotion to the Nationals' major league bullpen by media outlets covering Washington baseball. Bacus did not end up contributing to the Nationals' championship season in 2019, playing out the year with the Grizzlies. He became a minor league free agent after the season's end. The Nationals promoted Bacus to the major leagues on August 14, 2020https://www.masnsports.com/masn-news-information/2020/08/nationals-select- contract-of-right-hander-dakota-bacus.html and he made his major league debut that day against the Baltimore Orioles.

The championship began on 20 October 2019 and ended on 19 January 2020. Corofin entered the championship as the defending champions. On 19 January 2020, Corofin won the championship following a 1-12 to 0-07 defeat of Kilcoo in the All-Ireland final at Croke Park. It was their fifth championship title overall, while they also became the first team to win three successive championships. Format County Championships All thirty two counties in Ireland and London play their county senior championships between their top gaelic football clubs. Each county decides the format for their county championship. The format can be straight knockout, double-elimination, a league, groups, etc. or a combination. Only single club teams are allowed to enter the All-Ireland Club championship. If a team that is an amalgamation of two or more clubs, a divisional team or a university team wins a county's championship, a single club team will represent that county in the provincial championship as determined by that county's championship rules. Normally it is the club team that exited the championship at the highest stage. Traditionally, the All- Ireland Club Championship Finals were held on St. Patrick's Day. The GAA decided to bring forward the Club Finals to 19 January 2020 with a view to completing the competition in the calendar year from 2021. = Provincial Championships = Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster each organise a provincial championship for their participating county champions. The Kilkenny senior champions play in the Leinster Intermediate Club Football Championship. London continue to compete in the Connacht championship – in previous years they played one of the provincial champions in a single match in December referred to as a quarter-final. All matches are knock-out. Two ten minute periods of extra time are played each way if it's a draw at the end of normal time in all matches including the final. If the score is still level after extra time the match is replayed. = All-Ireland = In a bid to shorten the break between the provincial finals and the All-Ireland semi-finals, the two semi-finals between the four provincial champions will be played in early January – previously they were held in mid-February. Traditionally, the All- Ireland final was played in Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day, the 17th of March, but it has also been moved to 19 January 2020.

Compared to 375 Plus, 410 S engine had a bigger bore and a shorter stroke at . The total displacement resulting was . This same basic Type 126 single plug engine powered the 410 Superamerica road car. A smaller 42DCZ/3 Weber carburettors and a lower compression ratio combined with a higher rpm meant only a slight increase in power from at 6200 rpm in its single plug form. When the engine was upgraded to a twin plugs per cylinder, four coils, and a three 46DCF/3 Webers, power rose to at 7000 rpm. Out of four cars only two factory race cars received the uprated Type 126/C competition engine. An additional spark plugs were located outside of the cylinder banks and were accessible by a trapdoors in the bodywork. This was the only Lampredi V12 with a twin plug arrangement and also the highest in output. A double ignition was designed for harsh conditions of the five-day Mexican race. The top speed was 280-303 kmh, depending on the version. The chassis was made of an elliptical section steel tubes. Mainly classified as the type 519C with a wheelbase measuring . The front suspension was independent with an unequal-length wishbones. The rear had De Dion axle and transverse leaf springs, already introduced on racing Ferraris a couple years back. Brakes were drum-type all round. The fuel tank could accommodate 195 litres of fuel. All cars used dry sump lubrication, triple-plate clutch and a 5-speed manual gearbox mounted in the rear of a transaxle type. Front and rear track was at , which was considerably wider compared to a preceding 375 MM or Plus and a succeeding 290 MM cars that had between of track. One of the race cars had a different, slightly shorter type 514 chassis with of wheelbase. Speciale 1955 410 S s/n 0592CM at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance A one-off Berlinetta Speciale by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, s/n 0594CM, was also created. It was a special order from Michel Paul-Cavallier, an industrialist and a former SEFAC director. The body design loosely resembled Pinin Farina-designed berlinettas but had to be transferred to a shorter chassis with a wider track. The engine was of a single plug type and used three Weber 42DCF/3 carburettors. The car was based on a race car type 519C chassis, completed by July 1955 and delivered with ivory paintwork with blue leather interior to its first owner. The same as the race cars it was also right-hand drive. Racing The 410 S' first outing was 1956 1000km of Buenos Aires, driven by Juan Manuel Fangio and Eugenio Castellotti. Although two cars entered and neither finished, they achieved an impressive top speed of 303 kmh and set a new lap record. This was the only race in which the 410 S was entered as a works car. Caroll Shelby raced one of those cars in United States with many victories in 1956: in Palm Springs, National Seafair, National Palm Springs, Governor's Trophy and New Smyrna Beach amongst them. Phil Hill and Richie Ginther also raced in the US, the latter winning the 1957 Riverside race. Cars had common problems with rear axles or transmissions that could not endure the immense power. In 1957 Cuban Grand Prix, among many entered Ferraris, the 410 S was able to achieve second place, driven by Caroll Shelby. The car was entered by John Edgar. Same feat was repeated in 1958 edition of the Havana Grand Prix, this time Masten Gregory was behind the wheel. Collectability The Ferrari 410 S is highly collectable due to its extremely low production values and very high performance. In 2012, Berlinetta Speciale s/n 0594CM was sold on RM Sotheby's auction in Monterey for US$8.25 million. In 2014 s/n 0592CM was sold on Rick Cole Auctions for US$23 million. This was the car with shorter wheelbase and single plug engine.

It was the first Ferrari powered by a new Aurelio Lampredi-designed V12 engine, created as a large displacement alternative to the initial 1,5 L Colombo V12, used in supercharged form in Ferrari 125 F1. Formula One regulations allowed for up to 4.5 L in naturally aspirated form. Development Because the naturally-aspirated, then supercharged Colombo engine did not fulfil its expectations in Grands Prix and Formula One so an alternative was required for Ferrari to stay competitive. Aurelio Lampredi designed the new V12 engine that was intended for Formula One race cars, but first had to be tested in a sports racing car. Only two examples were ever created. Both had Touring barchetta bodywork. None of them survive in their original form. Specifications The new 'long-block' engine displaced , thanks to of bore and stroke and had SOHC configuration with two valves and single spark plug per cylinder. Initially power output was at 7200 rpm with 8:1 compression ratio. Engine was fed by three Weber 40DCF carburettors and used wet sump lubrication. Top speed was 240 km/h. The chassis was a ladder frame aided by steel tubes of a short, , wheelbase, derived from 166 MM. This value will change when upgraded to 340 America specification. Front suspension was independent and rear had a live axle with semi-elliptic springs. Stopping was by four-wheel drum brakes. Racing The 1950 edition of Mille Miglia race was attended by both examples of 275 S. Alberto Ascari with Senesio Nicolini drove 0030MT and Luigi Villoresi with Pasquale Cassani raced in 0032MT. Both teams encountered transmission problems, that could not cope with high amounts of power, and did not finish the race. Cars raced only a couple more times in its 275 S guise. Despite poor initial results the engine proved its desired potential and was immediately used for a single-seater Ferrari 275 F1, as was its original purpose. 275 S/340 America 275 S/340 America Touring Barchetta at 1951 Susa-Moncenisio hillclimb Between 1950-1951 both cars were upgraded with the new 4.1 L, also Lampredi, engines, that in turn were derived from Formula One powerplants. After conversion power dropped to . Now converted into 340 America model-line, one car s/n 0030MT was further rebodied by a new coachbuilder, Scaglietti, after 1952. The other car remained in the original Touring barchetta form. S/n 0030MT was auctioned in 2015 by RM Sotheby's in Monterey for almost US$8 million.

After the initial racing successes of the 3.0-litre Colombo V12 engine, introduced in the 250 S one-off, Ferrari produced a serial racing model. It is best recognisable for the distinctive closed berlinetta bodywork by Pinin Farina. The \\"MM\\" in its name stood for the Mille Miglia race. Development The 250 MM was the second of the ubiquitous 3.0-litre, Colombo-engined Ferraris. The engine was derived from the 250 S with increased power, due to a different carburettors setup. The whole car could be seen as an incremental evolution over its predecessor. Chassis numbers for the first time had \\"MM\\" in their suffix, and used an even, race car sequence. Two body syles were available, each from a different coachbuilder. Pinin Farina designed an innovative closed berlinetta, which ushered in a whole new era in automotive design. It also served as a basis for future competition berlinetta models produced by Ferrari. Pinin Farina had created eighteen 250 MMs with berlinetta body. An open barchetta body was offered by Vignale and introduced in three series. Every example differed in slight detail from each other. An early series cars had open headlights and a small air vent in the middle of the bonnet. Later cars differed by having recessed and covered headlamps, a closed bonnet bulge, a triangular cutaways in the rear fenders and a lower door line. In total, twelve open spyders were made. Chief designer at Vignale was Giovanni Michelotti who penned all those designs. The first 250 MM, in a spyder form, was presented in 1952 at the Paris Motor Show. The first berlinetta was also shown in Paris in but a year later. A single berlinetta by Vignale, created in 1954, was owned at one point by Peter Monteverdi. In 1956 he had paid 10,000 Swiss francs for it and also traded in his Porsche 356. Its distinctive feature were the triple portholes on the bottom of the front fenders. One particular example, initially s/n 0352MM, was restamped as 0239EU after a crashed 212 Inter, that was entered in the 1952 Carrera Panamericana. His owner, Efrain Ruiz Echeverria, traded it in for a new car that was renumbered in the factory to avoid import duty. By 1953 Ruiz Echeverria could enter another edition of the Mexican marathon. The car was for sale in 2011. Offered by Talacrest it was bought by Nick Mason. Some examples, like the s/n 0266MM and 0356MM, used \\"166MM/53\\" type chassis but with a 3.0-litre, 250 MM-sourced engine. A single example of the Ferrari 340 MM Pinin Farina Berlinetta, that was raced by \\"Pagnibon\\", was downgraded to a 250 MM-specification for Andre Vanoni. Specifications Ferrari 250 MM that raced in 1953 Carrera Panamericana The engine, mounted longitudinally in the front, was a 60° Colombo V12. The total capacity of was achieved thanks to of bore and stroke. A 9:1 compression ratio with three Weber 36IF/4C carburettors helped produce at 7200 rpm. The engine had single overhead camshaft per cylinder bank, actuating two valves per cylinder. It also used a single spark plug per cylinder with two coils. The 250 MM had a new multi-plate clutch (the 250 S had only a single plate). A wet sump lubrication system was also inherited. A chassis type ‘’250MM53’’ was made out of a welded steel tubes and featured a short wheelbase. The whole car weighed with its berlinetta body, when unladen (The 250 S was ). The spyder was lighter at . The fuel tank had 150-litres capacity. Some significant advancements had been made also to the suspension setup. Mainly with the addition of Houdaille-type shock absorbers. The front suspension was independent with unequal-length wishbones, and transverse leaf- springs with Houdaille hydraulic shock absorbers. On the rear a live axle with semi-elliptic springs and Houdaille hydraulic shock absorbers were mounted. The 250 MM used a 4-speed, all-synchronised manual gearbox (The 250 S had a 5-speed), and drum brakes all-round. The top speed was 250 km/h. Racing The Ferrari 250 MM was used extensively in racing. Scoring many victories in Europe. The 250 MM was also successful in the United States with Phil Hill and in South America as well. The 250 MM had its first outing at the 1953 Giro di Sicilia. Three cars were entered, but non of them finished the race. Paolo Marzotto had led the race until Enna, but then broke down. The first victory came from the North American race track. At the Pebble Beach round of the SCCA National Sports Car Championship. In the category for Sports over 1500 cc, Phil Hill drove his spyder to the first place. At the Mille Miglia race, the same year, the race the car was destined for, a total of eight cars were entered. Only one managed to finish at all. Giulio Cabianca and Gianfranco Roghi drove their spyder s/n 0282MM, to the ninth place overall and eighth in- class. Paolo Marzotto and Marino Marini held a third place before their Berlinetta burst into flames a few kilometers before the finish. At the 1953 edition of the Targa Florio, three 250 MMs were entered. Only one finished at the sixth place. Giulio Cabianca took it, driving for Scuderia Ferrari and using the same spyder as in the Mille Miglia. The Portuguese Grand Prix of 1953 brought 1-2 victory by José A. Nogueira Pinto and Casimiro de Oliveira. Both were driving Vignale-bodied cars. Out of four total cars that entered, otheres scored a fourth place and a DNF. At the GP Monza, the same year, Luigi Villoresi won in a Pinin Farina Berlinetta. Giuseppe Farina in a Vignale Spyder was third. He drove the same car as Cabianca before. A total of seven cars were entered on Monza. Others scored a fifth, sixth and ninth places and two DNFs. Coppa d'Oro delle Dolomiti in 1953 also, saw Paolo Marzotto winning at the wheel of the Cabianca's spyder. Out of five entered cars, all have finished the race. At an endurance race called 10 Hours of Messina, five 250 MMs have been entered. Eugenio Castellotti / Giulio Musitelli duo won the race. Franco Cornacchia with Giovanni Bracco came second. Others arrived at fifth, sixth and eighth places. Cornacchia later won the Trieste-Opicina hillclimb. Following the early success in the States, Phil Hill won the Santa Barbara Trophy in 1953. He was still driving his spyder from the Pebble Beach. And at the 3rd Annual Madera Road Race, Hill chose a brand new Pinin Farina Berlinetta, that he shared with Bill Devin. Their car was painted white with a large blue stripe through the middle of the car. In a Modified +1.5 class he came first. Coppa d'Oro di Sicilia in 1953 was won by Casimiro de Oliveira. Two other cars arrived at the fifth place or did not qualify at all. The last major race of that year was the 1953 Carrera Panamericana where Ruiz Echeverría and Villegas Becerril finished eleventh overall and seventh in- class. They drove a Pinin Farina Berlinetta that was renumbered for import purposes. An involvement of the 250 MM on the racing scene continued throughout the 1954. The 1000 km Buenos Aires was organised on an Autódromo Municipal-Avenida Paz in Argentina. The 250 MM Vignale Spyder, driven by Harry Schell and Alfonso de Portago, arrived at the finish line on second place, also scoring a class win. Overall winner was much more powerful Ferrari 375 MM. At the Giro di Sicilia, the same year, Vittorio Colocci and Gaetano Spata finished seventh overall and fifth in-class, ironically just behind the 250 S, the predecessor of their model. The last two major races of the 1954 were the Mille Miglia and the Targa Florio. Five cars were entered for the Mille Miglia. Three arrived at the finish line and two did not. The best result was by a veteran Clemente Biondetti. He scored a fourth place overall and second place in-class. He drove a 250 MM barchetta that was rebodied in 1953 by Carrozzeria Morelli of Ferrara. The same year at the Targa Florio, the same 250 MM Morelli finished fifth overall and third in Sport +2.0 class also driven by Biondetti. The 250 MM continued to be competitive all over the world. Scoring victories in the United States, South America and Sweden. Its racing career lasted unusually long, till 1962. Collectability A very limited production combined with an undisputed racing pedigree, makes for a highly sought after collector's car. Its estimated value will also increase thanks to the innovative design of the berlinetta model. Over past years only a few examples were offered for sale and their value generally tend to rise. The Carrera Panamericana entrant, s/n 0352MM, was offered via Talacrest, a classic Ferrari dealer. The car was put on 2011 RM Sotheby's auction with an estimate of €2.5 - €3 million. It did not sell for a high bid of €2.15 million, but was later purchased by Nick Mason. Another example, an ex-Phil Hill white berlinetta, was sold for US$7.26 million at the Bonhams, Quail Lodge Auction in 2014. In 2018, the Swedish International Motor Show car was estimated at US$7.5 - US$9 million, but did not sell on auction. Gooding managed to sell a Vignale Spyder for US$5.395 million at the Scottsdale auction in 2019.

It was the first raced Ferrari powered by a new Aurelio Lampredi-designed inline-6 engine, created as a larger alternative to the inline-4 series of engines used in the Ferrari Monza race cars. The intention behind the development of this model was the 1955 Mille Miglia race. It was yet another attempt by Ferrari to match the new Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR in competition. All of the created cars were further converted into a bigger capacity models. 306 S The first Ferrari with an inline-six cylinder engine was the 306 S. It was a development prototype created in the late 1954. As the name suggests it sported a 3.0-litre (2,977.28 cc) Lampredi straight- six codenamed tipo 114. The new engine was created by adding two cylinders to the existing inline-four family of tested and tried Lampredi engines, particularly the Ferrari 500 engine. The 306 had a short wheelbase and was bodied by Scaglietti. The prototype never raced and, by January the next year, was converted into the 376 S model by increasing its capacity and stretching the wheelbase. Development Prior to 1955, the Ferrari 750 Monza race car could produce a maximum of . This figure was not enough to match the power output of the new Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR, with its engine based on the straight-8, W196 Formula One champion. After creating a 3.0-litre prototype, Ferrari decided to increase the capacity further. Now at 3.7-litre, the new car could produce . This combined with a low weight could be enough to remain competitive. It was also decided to change the wheelbase to . Chassis numbers had an \\"LM\\" suffix. Body style was very much an evolution of the 750 Monza also bodied by Scaglietti. One of the cars was later further rebodied by the same coachbuilder and received a distinctive, more round front grille and pontoon-fenders. The cars had raced in only a handful of races in 1955 and all four examples were subsequently upgraded to 4.4 L capacity, intended for the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. One car at the earliest by April 1955 for the Mille Miglia race. None of the 376 S' survive in their original form. Specifications The enlarged engine was identified as the tipo 118, hence the common \\"118 LM\\" name of the car, even though this version did not participate in the Le Mans race. The internal measurements of one cylinder at of bore and stroke, were the same as the Ferrari 625 engine on which they were based. The total resulting capacity was 3.7 L (). The three Weber 58DCOA/3 carburettors helped produce at 6200 rpm. The engine used twin spark plugs per cylinder with two coils and had twin overhead camshaft design for two valves per cylinder. It also used a dry sump lubrication system. The tubular steel chassis identified as the tipo 509 was the same as on the 306 S prototype. The whole car weighed only when unladen. The fuel tank had 150-litres capacity. The front suspension was independent with unequal-length wishbones. Coil springs with hydraulic shock absorbers were used, along with an anti-roll bar. Suspension at the rear used de Dion axle with twin arms and transverse leaf spring helped by hydraulic shock absorbers. The cars still used drum brakes all-round. Racing The 376 S first outing was at the 1000 km Buenos Aires, driven by Froilan Gonzalez and Maurice Trintignant. Unfortunately, the team took a short cut and was disqualified for an incorrect entry into the pits. The next major race was the 1955 Giro di Sicilia, where Piero Taruffi in one car and Umberto Maglioli in the other came first and second respectively in this 1088 km race. It would remain the only European victory for a straight- six Ferrari. At the 1955 Mille Miglia the new Ferraris met their German opposition. Three Ferrari 376 S' were entered, but only one finished the race. Maglioli with Luciano Monteferraio came third overall, behind the two SLRs, competing in the same class. Taruffi actually led the race for one time, before retiring with a broken oil pump. The remaining 376 S, driven by Paolo Marzotto, had an accident due to worn tire. Eugenio Castellotti received the new 4.4 L-engined 735 LM but did not finish the race due to engine problems. The last achievement of the 376 S was with Giuseppe Farina scoring sixth place in the Eifelrennen Nürburgring race in May 1955.

It was the second raced Ferrari, powered by an Aurelio Lampredi-designed inline-6 engine, created as a larger displacement evolution to the engines used in the Ferrari Monza race cars. Development The Ferrari 735 LM was converted from the 376 S sports car, that contested the Mille Miglia race, for the 1955 season. The first example was converted before Mille Miglia, the rest after the race. Most of the specifications remained the same apart for the engine, which received a much bigger displacement and power output. The 735 LM was developed to compete in the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race, that a year earlier, Ferrari had won with the 375 Plus. With lesser aerodynamics and outdated braking technology than the competition, as Enzo Ferrari had firmly believed in engine power to win at racing, the 735 LM with its new 4.4-litre engine, was designed to outpower the competitors. In the practice trial for the 24 Hours race, the 735 LM was the fastest. Unlike its predecessor, the 735 LM name referred to the displacement of one cylinder, as was the naming convention. The models “LM” suffix invoked the intended race – 24 Hours of Le Mans. Inherited chassis numbers also had an “LM” suffix. The 4.4-litre iteration was also the final capacity step in the inline-six model lineage. After the Le Mans disaster, the new race regulations forced a 2.5-litre cap, so Ferrari returned to the 625-engined Monza models for the 1956 season. Ferrari would also never return to the inline-six configuration and focused instead on a new V6 Dino engine. Specifications The enlarged engine was identified as the Tipo 121, hence the common \\"121 LM\\" name of the car. The internal measurements of one cylinder were at of bore and stroke, and were the same as the Ferrari 735 S’ inline-four engine on which they were based. The total resulting capacity was . The power output was at 5800 rpm, thanks to three Weber 50DCOA/3 carburettors. Ferrari decided to use smaller diameter carburettors on this model, compared to its predecessor. The engine used twin spark plugs per cylinder, served by two coils and had a twin overhead camshaft design to actuate two valves per cylinder. It also used a dry sump lubrication system. The compression ratio was at 8.5:1, slightly higher than before. The tubular steel chassis identified as the Tipo 509 was the same as on the 376 S predecessor. The whole car weighed only when unladen. The fuel tank had 150-litres capacity. The front suspension was independent with unequal-length wishbones. Coil springs with hydraulic shock absorbers were also mounted at the front. Suspension at the rear consisted of a De Dion axle with twin arms and transverse leaf spring helped by hydraulic shock absorbers. The cars were still not upgraded to, available at that time, disc brakes and used drums instead. Racing Ferrari 735 LM rear view Eugenio Castellotti during 1955 Swedish GP The first example of the 735 LM series raced in the 1955 Mille Miglia among smaller capacity 376 S and Monza siblings. Eugenio Castellotti entered the race as a privateer, but had to retire due to an engine problems. For the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, Scuderia Ferrari entered three cars. Umberto Maglioli and Phil Hill drove the car no. 3. Eugenio Castellotti with Paolo Marzotto raced in the car no.4, and Maurice Trintignant and Harry Schell duo were fielded as number 5. The 735 LM was entered in the top ‘Sport 5.0’ category. It was the category that also included the Jaguar D-Type, Lagonda DP-166 and Cooper T38. Castellotti in the Ferrari no. 4, recorded the best practice lap time of all time at 4min 14sec. Only a second slower was the Mercedes-Benz 300SLR of Juan Manuel Fangio. Also over the flying kilometre on the Mulsanne straight, the 735 LM recorded an impressive top speed of 291.2 km/h. Second was the Jaguar D-Type at 281.9 km/h. The actual race was much more disappointing for Ferrari as none of the fielded cars had finished the race. First, the car of Castellotti / Marzotto retired after 52 laps and five hours, with a broken engine. After the seven hour mark and covering only 76 laps, Maglioli and Hill fell out of the race with an overheating engine and clutch problems. Finally the last of the Ferrari entries, can no. 5 with Trintignant and Schell, retired with a faulty clutch after 107 laps and 10 hours of racing. The race itself remained a black card in the history of motorsport because of the catastrophic crash that occurred, which came to be known as the 1955 Le Mans disaster. Still in 1955, Umberto Maglioli entered the Aosta-Gran San Bernardo hillclimb and scored a first place overall. Later the same year, two cars were entered in the Swedish Grand Prix for sports cars. One finished third, driven by Eugenio Castellotti. The second, entered by Hawthorn, did not start. After the failed Le Mans and imposition of the capacity caps for the 1956 season, all four cars ended up in the States. Between 1955–1963 cars were raced by Jim Kimberly, Carroll Shelby, Phil Hill, Ray Cherryholmes, John Kilborn and Ernie McAfee with many victories in the SCCA and other race series in the US. McAfee, Shelby and Cherryholmes scored the most victories of all 735 LM drivers. In April 1956, during the Del Monte Trophy in Pebble Beach, California, a fatal accident occurred in which Ernie McAfee lost his life. His car hit a tree and he was killed on impact. This event caused a ban of racing in Pebble Beach. In 1957, three 735 LMs were entered in the Cuban Grand Prix. Two had retired and one had not arrived at all. Collectability Only fours cars were made and all are in the hands of avid Ferrari collectors. The s/n 0546LM was sold in 2017 on RM Sotheby's auction for US$5.72 million.

He is best known for his invention of the first electronic tone wheel organ, the Robb Wave OrganBrown, J. J. \\"Ideas in Exile\\". Toronto, McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1967. pp. 236-345., however he has several patents to his name, in areas such as television, fuel draught carburetors, and for devices such as an 'Electronic Viewscope for the Blind'. Robb's organ, when it was introduced in 1927, was the first electronic instrument which could mimic an acoustic organ, and predated the more well known Hammond organ, which was brought to market in 1934.  Early Life  Morse Robb, the son of William Doig Robb and Catherine Haggart Black, was born in Belleville, Ontario in 1901. Robb was the youngest of his siblings, among Joseph Robb, founder of Canadian company Robco Inc https://www.robco.com/en/about/company-profile/100-year-history, and Wallace Havelock Robb, poet and founder of the bird sanctuary \\"Abbey Dawn\\". William and Catharine were both Quebec-born. William's father had emigrated from Scotland to help build the Grand Trunk Railway. William joined the GTR in 1871 and moved from city to city before settling into Belleville. He became vice president of the GTR before becoming vice-president of the Canadian National Railways and spearheading the CNR Radio project. Morse left Belleville to attend school at McGill University, studying Arts, Science, and Commerce. He also studied music under Frederick H. Blair, the organist of the Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul in Montreal. Upon his return to Belleville in 1926, he began serious work on his electronic organ design, of which he had a working prototype of by November, 1927. Robb married Edleen Rose in 1930, and they had a son, Skye. In 1934, he released a two-manual, 32 pedal Robb Wave Organ to the public. Unfortunately due to the Depression, Robb was unable to find adequate funding to continue with his organ project, and in 1938 the Robb Wave Organ Company closed its doors. After his work on the organ, Robb turned to other pursuits, including designing and making hand-wrought sterling silver dishes. Once WWII came around, Robb found himself employed by his brother's firm Joseph Robb Company, where he developed and oversaw the manufacture of an improved lanyard ring for the recuperative chambers of large guns. He continued on with the company after the war, and eventually became the General Manager of the Anchor Packing Company Division. By the time he withdrew from the business world in 1957 he was a Senior Vice- President of the parent company. After his retirement from industry, Robb continued work on his inventions, obtaining patents in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom for his Electronic Viewscope for the Blind, among other inventions. The Viewscope is a headworn device that fits over the forehead, and converts light into tactile impulses. It was patented on November 28, 1972 in the United States, under patent number 3,704,378. Robb is also a published author, releasing his first and only novel, \\"Tan Ming\\", in 1955 under the pen name Lan Stormont. He has also published several short stories under the name Michael Shane..

Biography Carmen Calvo was born in Valencia in 1950. In her youth she worked in a ceramic factory, an experience which would later be reflected in her art, which includes fragments of pottery and clay. She studied advertising and entered that city's School of Arts and Crafts from 1965 to 1970. She attended the School of Fine Arts of Valencia from 1969 to 1972. She held her first individual exhibition in Valencia in 1976, and her second in Madrid in 1977. From 1983 to 1985 she lived in the Casa de Velázquez in Madrid. In 1985 she received a scholarship from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and moved to Paris, where she remained until 1992. Since then she has lived and worked in Valencia. Artistic career An admirer and follower of artists such as Giotto, Piero della Francesca, Filippo De Pisis, Carlo Carrà, Jean Arp, Joan Miró, and Jannis Kounellis, Calvo incorporated terracotta into her plastic compositions very early on so that this element would become an icon of her work. In addition to painting, Calvo is known for carrying out interventions, in some cases on a permanent basis, in public buildings. In the 1980s she received several scholarships, and won distinctions such as the LaSalle Seiko First Prize for Painting and the Alfons Roig Award from the . In 1980 she was one of nine artists chosen to participate in the exhibition New images from Spain at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 1982 she also exhibited at the first edition of , the contemporary art fair of Madrid, with the Fernando Vijande Gallery. In 1990 the Institut Valencià d'Art Modern presented a retrospective on her work since 1973. In 1995, Calvo created the Lápida-Mural, the result of a competition organized by the Regional Ministry of Public Works of the Valencian Community, for on metro Line 3, a project by Carlos Meri and . In the late 1990s she began to introduce photographic images into her compositions and created scenes based on installations, which synthesized, as Francisco Brines referred to it, her \\"saved and saving view\\" on contemporary reality. She represented Spain with a gallery of mirrors at the Venice Biennale in 1997, together with the Catalan poet Joan Brossa. In 2003 the Museo Reina Sofía dedicated an exhibition about her work. From 2 December 2016 to 29 January 2017, her exhibition Carmen Calvo. Todo procede de la sinrazón (1969–2016) was held at Sala Alcalá 31 in Madrid.

She also contributed to publications including The New York Times, New York Sun, Frank Leslie’s Monthly, Harper’s Weekly and Argosy. She investigated journalistic topics including corrupt charity executives and child abuse cases. Her fiction plots often centered around starving artists, women deceived by hypocritical suitors and farmers battling the elements. She founded the Ragged Edge Klub, a group of writers, filmmakers, politicians and performers who met for weekly dinners. She was considered \\"one of the most popular writers of newspaper sketches in the country\\" and known as a Queen of Bohemia. Biography Zoe was the 11th of 13 children of Henry Tompkins Anderson (1812-1872) and Henrietta Ducker Anderson (1819-1897). Henry, a Virginia native descended from the politician Garland Anderson (1742-1811), had two children from a previous marriage. (Anderson’s descendants include Rear Admiral Robert M. Morris, Rear Admiral Creed Cardwell Burlingame, Kentucky soldiers from the 192nd Tank Battalion who were captured in the Bataan Death March, the singer and teacher Mary Chelf Jones, a founder of the Ragged Edge Theatre, and the actors Sara Rue and Chris Stack.) Henry served as a Christian Church pastor and teacher in Kentucky while creating a new translation of the New Testament based on ancient Greek manuscripts. Zoe was born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where John Augustus Williams and his wife Mary, who ran Daughters College, took in the impoverished Anderson family. Henry, shortly before his death, moved to Washington, D.C., to preach at a church that James A. Garfield attended. Henrietta, as a widow, briefly farmed near Ellsworth, Kansas, with Zoe and other children. In 1878, Zoe graduated from Daughters College and married a Missouri native, Spencer William Norris (1856-1904). The couple settled in Wichita, Kansas, and had two children, Robert Grimes Norris (1879-1948) and Mary Clarence Norris, known as Clarence (1881-1967). The family lived on North Market Street, and Spencer ran a store specializing in fruit and ice cream at 104 North Main Street. By the late 1890s, Zoe had discovered Spencer’s infidelities (the couple divorced in 1898) and started writing fiction and journalism for magazines as well as a gossip column for the Wichita Eagle (under the pseudonym Nancy Yanks). She traveled to the Rockies and hiked along Pike’s Peak wearing thin slippers. Zoe and Clarence then spent more than a year in Europe (Robert Norris became a railroad executive) and settled afterwards in New York with Clarence’s infant son Robert M. Morris (1901-1984). In 1902, Zoe married an illustrator, J. K. “Jack” Bryans, but she left him upon realizing that he could not support her and did not tolerate her daughter and grandson. (Clarence and Robert eventually returned to Harrodsburg, where Clarence married Fletcher Chelf, a seed company owner, and had two more children; her daughter Mary Chelf Jones was a mentor of the pianist Kevin Cole.) Around 1906, Zoe moved to a seventh- floor apartment at 338 East 15th Street, and in 1909, she began issuing The East Side, which was illustrated pro bono by William Oberhardt. Ragged Edge members were known for dancing between meal courses and for smoking cigarettes while simultaneously inhaling spaghetti. Club members and other East Side readers included writers and editors such as Edith and Rex Beach, Grace Duffie Boylan, Guido Bruno, Charles E. Chapin, Winnifred Harper Cooley, James D. Corrothers, Maria Thompson Daviess, Benjamin De Casseres, Helen Hamilton Gardener, Sadakichi Hartmann, Waldemar Kaempffert, Leita and Owen Kildare, Richard Le Gallienne, Miriam Leslie, Sophie Irene Loeb, Edwin Markham, Roy McCardell, Shaemas O'Sheel, John Milton Oskison, Ameen Rihani, Sydney Rosenfeld, Helen Rowland, Grace Miller White and Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Zoe's works were also lauded and read by the philosopher and tastemaker Elbert Hubbard and the academics David Starr Jordan, James Hardy Ropes and Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman. Her writings appealed to politicians, lawyers and businessmen as well, including John F. Ahearn, Bird Sim Coler, Lee de Forest, Big Bill Edwards, Henry DeWitt Hamilton, John Temple Graves, Clifford B. Harmon, James Clark McReynolds, Herman A. Metz, William I. Sirovich, Arthur Stilwell and John Francis Tucker (president of the Twilight Club). Artists, photographers, performers and theater and film executives were in her circle, too, such as Arthur Bairnsfather, Jessie Tarbox Beals, Libby Blondell (first wife of actor Edward Blondell, father of Joan Blondell), Platon Brounoff, Louis H. Chalif, Beatrice deMille, Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale, Mary Theresa Hart (daughter of painter James McDougal Hart), Burling Hull, Ovide Musin, Wray Physioc, Betty and Will Rogers and Laurette Taylor. Zoe also befriended restaurateurs, including Joel Renaldo, as well as aviators such as Lincoln Beachey and Mortimer Delano. The East Side's January/February 1914 issue described Zoe's recent dream that her mother Henrietta had appeared at her bedside and warned of imminent death. Soon after the issue was mailed, Zoe collapsed after a Ragged Edge dinner and died of heart failure at People’s Hospital at 203 Second Avenue. (She is buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Harrodsburg.) Her magazine’s premonition was noted in newspaper obituaries around the U.S. and in Canada, including The New York Times, Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle. Works The villain of Norris's first novel The Color of His Soul (New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1902, and New York: R. F. Fenno & Co., 1903) was a hypocritical socialist orator, Cecil Mallon, who encourages rebellion among \\"wage slaves\\" but sponges off friends and relatives and abandons his pregnant mistress. The book was described as \\"a keen and relentless satire.\\" Funk & Wagnalls withdrew the 1902 edition after Courtenay Lemon, a chess player turned socialist orator, recognized himself blackly caricatured in the book and threatened to sue. Norris's novel The Quest of Polly Locke (New York: J. S. Ogilvie, 1902), about a young American woman traveling in Europe seeking true love, was said to have a \\"brilliant, vivacious style.\\" Her final novel, The Way of the Wind (New York: self- published, 1911), portrayed a Kansas farmer, abandoned by his wife, who loses their son to illness and commits suicide, bequeathing valuable real estate (Wichita is built there) to a young female friend who goes insane. Norris collected her short fiction published in the New York Sun in Twelve Kentucky Colonel Stories. Describing Scenes and Incidents in a Kentucky Colonel’s Life in the Southland (New York: J. S. Ogilvie, 1905). The Kentucky colonel raconteur was based on her brother-in-law John B. Thompson Jr.'s twin Philip, sons of the politician John Burton Thompson. Her fiction and poetry appeared in publications including 10 Story Book, Ainslee's, The Arena, Argosy, The Bankers Magazine, The Bohemian, The Book-Lover, The Bostonian, Brooklyn Life, The Clack Book, Etude and Musical World, Ev'ry Month, Everybody's, Four o'Clock, Frank Leslie’s Monthly, Harper’s Weekly, The Home Magazine of New York, The Ladies’ World, The Midland Monthly, The Mirror (published by William Marion Reedy), The Monthly Illustrator, Munsey’s, The New Age, The New Bohemian, People's, Pearson's, The Peterson Magazine, The Puritan, The Red Letter, Satire (published by Walter Pulitzer, the son of Albert Pulitzer), The Smart Set, Success, The Symposium (published by George Washington Cable), The Valley Magazine (published by William Marion Reedy), Wisdom Monthly, Woman’s Home Companion and Woman’s World. About 50 of her short stories were widely syndicated in newspapers. Recurring characters include male and female writers and artists running out of money, lovers reuniting after quarrels and lonely older people grateful for visitors to listen to their gossip. She included African-American characters such as cakewalk performers, and she wrote about Jewish immigrants traumatized by pogroms in their homelands. Her journalism appeared in The American Agriculturist, The Bohemian, The Bookman, The Criterion, The Manuscript, New York Press, New York Sun, New York Times and The Writer. She was a member of the Woman's Press Club. Her topics ranged from exhausted child laborers to Mark Twain's escaped cat Bambino. Her interviewees included Bat Masterson, Gutzon Borglum, Nat Goodwin, Oliver Herford and Mary Elizabeth Lease. The East Side documented immigrants overcrowded in tenements, working in sweatshops and suffering from disease and starvation. Norris also wrote about her own struggles to make ends meet. The publication was lauded as \\"written with great vivacity, though evidently inspired by a sincere, earnest, and sympathetic spirit.” Her masthead titles for herself included office boy, bootblack, printer's devil and circulation liar. She sometimes reported undercover, dressed as a blind street accordionist or a bedraggled recent arrival from Ellis Island, to see how policemen, streetcar conductors and passersby treated her. Papers Correspondence from Norris survives in a few institutional collections including New York University's Pleiades Club Collection and Eastern Kentucky University's John Wilson Townsend papers.

The company’s stock trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker symbol CL, and in over-the-counter markets in the United States with the ticker symbol CRLBF.  History  Cresco Labs was founded in 2013 by Charlie Bachtell, who currently serves as CEO, and Joe Caltabiano, who served as president until resigning on March 2, 2020. The co-founders met in 2007 while working together at Guaranteed Rate, a mortgage company based in Chicago. Despite founding Cresco in 2013, Bachtell continued working at Guaranteed Rate as its general counsel until 2015; Caltabiano remained with Guaranteed Rate as a vice president until 2017, and did not begin working full-time at Cresco until after a stint with BeMortgage. Bachtell, who earned a Juris Doctorate in 2003 at DePaul University College of Law, wrote a 25-page business plan within 72 hours of Illinois’ 2013 passage of its medical marijuana law on the suggestion of Caltabiano, a childhood leukemia survivor who maintained an active interest in cancer care and philanthropy. The company was initially formed with $3.5 million from the two co-founders and three of their friends, with 6% of the company’s initial equity given to Denver Relief Consulting as a fee for establishing operational know-how and infrastructure. Cresco’s initial retail locations, all in Illinois, were licensed for Joliet, Kankakee, and Lincoln, and were operational by the end of 2015. The company operated cultivation facilities beginning in November 2015, with its first retail cannabis sales occurring in January 2016. At the start of 2018, Cresco employed roughly 100 people. By the end of the third quarter of 2018, the company had 300 employees in six states. On October 5, 2018, Cresco raised $100 million in private investment capital. At the time, it operated three cultivation facilities in Illinois and employed roughly 300 people, about half of whom were based in Illinois. On October 9, 2018, Cresco announced its intention to go public on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) via a reverse takeover with Randsburg International Gold Corp. At the time of the announcement, Cresco was licensed to operate in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona, Nevada, and California as well as Illinois. It was the second Illinois-based cannabis company to go public on the CSE in 2018, after Green Thumb Industries. Cresco began trading on the CSE on December 3, 2018, raising $87 million; at this point, it had raised $205 million over the course of 2018. At the end of 2018, Cresco employed roughly 500 people. On December 20, 2018, Cresco announced the acquisition of two dispensaries in Illinois, which brought the company to the state-mandated limit of five. On June 1, 2019, Illinois became the 11th state to allow recreational use of marijuana; on June 3, Cresco CEO Bachtell announced plans to double the company’s employee headcount from 300 to 600 by the start of 2020 to meet recreational demand, which he estimated would initially be \\"four to eight times\\" the size of the medicinal cannabis market, with the potential to become \\"10 to 20\\" times as large as Illinois’ medicinal market, which was reported to be roughly $130 million at the time of the law’s passage. On CNBC’s Fast Money, Bachtell noted that Illinois would progress from a market with 70,000 medicinal marijuana patients to one with \\"13 million people [and] over 100 million tourists a year.\\" In March 2020, Cresco Labs President Joe Caltabiano announced his departure from the firm. = Acquisitions = On March 18, 2019, Cresco announced the $120 million acquisition of VidaCann, a Florida medical marijuana company with seven active retail locations and the potential to hold up to 30 total licenses for cultivation, manufacturing, and retail facilities in Florida. On April 1, 2019, Cresco announced an $850 million acquisition of Canada-based Origin House, heralded at the time as \\"the largest public company acquisition in the history of the U.S. cannabis industry\\". The deal, denominated at $1.1 billion Canadian dollars, was undertaken to increase Cresco’s presence in California, in which Origin House products were already sold through more than 500 dispensaries. The deal was not completed until January 9, 2020 because the two companies received requests for information from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division in on June, 2019.  Marketing and branding  Cresco hired marketing executives including Cory Rothschild, Gatorade's former director of consumer engagement; Cris Rivera, former senior director of marketing at MillerCoors; and Scott Wilson, a former global creative director at Nike who was named Cresco’s chief experience officer in November 2018. In February 2019, Cresco announced the creation of a subsidiary and new brand called Well Beings, which will offer versions of Cresco's other products containing only cannabinol (CBD). In late July 2019, Cresco announced plans to rebrand its 56 active dispensaries under the \\"Sunnyside\\" brand, in an effort to make the shopping experience more akin to that of other major retail brands located in prime shopping districts. Sunnyside will be oriented around a wellness theme, to replace and consolidate the 11 brands currently used by Cresco's retail locations.

The Robb Wave Organ is an electronic organ invented in 1927 by Canadian inventor F. Morse Robb in Belleville, Ontario. It uses a unique type of tone wheel synthesis to reproduce pipe organ tones and is one of the first electronic organs ever made.Morse Robb - The Canadian Encyclopedia While not as commercially successful as its main competitor, the Hammond organ, The Robb Wave Organ predates the Hammond (and other competitors such as Conn and the Baldwin) in conception, patents, and manufacture and release for public sale.Brown, J. J. \\"Ideas in Exile\\". Toronto, McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1967. pp. 236-345.  History  Frank Morse Robb began researching and developing an electronic organ. He started with the theory that the best way to duplicate an organ tone was to start with a recording of the waveform and then find some way to recreate it electrically. Achieving this, he demonstrated a small instrument in Belleville on November 4th, 1927. The instrument consisted of 8 notes, each of a different tone quality. The notes were: C E F G G# A B C1. The tone quality could be modified by dial control. Robb filed patents for the organ on September 29, 1927 both in Canada and the United States, and received Canadian Patent No. 284183 on October 23, 1928, and United States Patent No. 1785915 on December 23, 1930.Brown, J. J. \\"The Inventors\\". Toronto, McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1967. pp. 121-123. Robb then produced a five-octave single manual organ in 1932, followed by the Model \\"K\\", a two-manual, 32 pedal note organ in April of 1934. The tone generation portion of the organ was meant to be placed in a separate room from the organ console, thus minimizing the noise generated by the spinning motors and gears.Barnes, William. \\"The Contemporary American Organ\\". New York, J. Fischer & Bro., 1937. pp. 355-357. The completion of the Model \\"K\\" instrument precipitated a visit from Lady Flora Eaton, who then had Robb Wave Organs installed in both Toronto and Montreal Eaton's stores, where demonstrations were given to critics and the general public. : The Robb Wave Organ Company was incorporated on September 21st, 1934. Although there was good critical reaction to the organ, only 15 to 20 were ever made. Unable to find proper funding due to the depression, Robb shut down the project in 1938. Only one organ survives partially intact, at the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta.  Tone generation  The Robb Wave Organ, so called because of its method of synthesis of pipe organ waveforms, is a tone wheel organ like the Hammond organ, but uses a different type of tone wheel. While the Hammond relies on a form of additive synthesis by adding the frequencies of several sine wave tone wheels together at different levels in order to create the harmonics of a particular timbre\\"Electric Pipeless Organ has Millions of Tones\\". Popular Mechanics (April 1936): pp. 569-571., a steel tone wheel on the Robb Wave Organ contains the full waveform that is being recreated. This waveform has been carved from a picture of a pipe organ note that was played through an oscilloscope, showing the distinct waveform of that pipe organ note. The particular organ that Robb used to record these waveforms was installed at Bridge Street United Church in Belleville, Ontario. The only stop that does not use the waveform from this organ is the Flora 8' stop, which uses the sound of Lady Flora Eaton's voice for the waveform. Using twelve separate tone wheel shafts geared off of one axle and each containing several tone wheels of varying diameter and waveform pattern, Robb was able to use varying combinations of pickups around the tone wheels to create different sounding organ stops. The electrical signals generated by the pickups and the spinning tone wheels were then fed through a vacuum-tube amplifier to a loudspeaker unit. The construction and layout of the two manuals and pedal board conform to the specifications laid down by the Royal College of Organists. This was to ensure compatibility of playing between the Wave Organ and a pipe organ. The stops on the organ are as follows: Upper manual stops. Lower manual stops. Pedal stops. Upper Manual Stops ** 8' - Gamba ** 8' - Night Horn ** 8' - Oboe Dolce ** 8' - Stopped Diapason ** 8' - Viol ** 8' - Oboe ** 8' - Flora ** 8' - Cello ** 8' - Horn Lower Manual Stops ** 4' - Dolce Flute ** 8' - Dulciana ** 4' - Violin Diapason ** 4' - Concert Flute ** 8' - Diapason ** 4' - Harmonic ** 8' - Horn Diapason ** 8' - Salicional Pedal Stops ** 16' - Cello ** 16' - Bourdon ** 16' - Gedeckt Evidence from one organ reviewer, William Barnes, shows that he much preferred the attack of the notes on the Robb Wave Organ to that of a Hammond or an Orgatron (another electronic organ of the time, one that used reeds instead of tone wheels.) Barnes wrote, \\"I gained the impression that the \\"attack\\" of the tone was much more like that of an organ than either the Hammond or the Orgatron.\\" He describes the tones as \\"good organ tones\\", and \\"a better Trumpet quality was obtained than I had heard on any other electronic.\\" Barnes goes on to say that the Robb Wave Organ is at a disadvantage however because of its much higher price than the Hammond or Orgatron.  Notable uses of instrument  Frederick Silvester played the organ at a Toronto Promenade Symphony Concert on July 30th, 1936. The piece he played was Handel's Concerto No. 2. A reviewer from the Toronto Telegram wrote, \\"But the wonder of it was that an organ could be designed, as this one was designed, which would produce the remarkable body of tone revealed.\\"\\"Playing of Wave Organ Features \\"Prom\\" Concert\\".

It was concluded in 2019, and has not entered into force. The convention governs the recognition of judgements in civil and commercial matters. History The Hague Conference started with the \\"Judgements project\\" in 1996: the development of a convention regarding jurisdiction and recognition of judgements. Jurisdiction within such a convention would be classified in three categories: bases of jurisdiction which were obligatory, optional or prohibited. As the negotiators were not able to come to a consensus on such a convention, the scope of the work was reduced to jurisdiction and recognition of decisions based on a choice of court agreement between the parties. During the negotiations, parallels were drawn between the New York Convention on arbitral awards: the aim was to create a system of recognition of decisions based on court cases where the court was chosen pursuant to a choice of court agreements, which would create the same level of predictability and enforceability as is the case in arbitral awards in New York Convention states. The efforts led in 2005 to a convention with a narrower scope: the Hague Choice of Court convention focussing on recognition on judgments where jurisdiction had been assumed based on a choice of court agreement between the parties. After conclusion of the convention new rounds of negotiations led to the conclusion of this convention. Parties All states can become parties to the convention: either through signature followed by ratification or acceptance, or by accession. The convention enters into force 1 year after 2 states have deposited their instruments of ratification/accession. If a party objects to the ratification or accession of another party, the convention will not enter into force with regards to those parties. Also Regional Economic Integration Organizations (such as the European Union) can become a party if such an organisation governs recognition of judgments. The convention was signed on the day of its conclusion by Uruguay, and in 2020 by Ukraine.

Biography  He was born in North Berwick, Scotland, into a family long connected to the game of golf. His brother John Duncan Dunn was also an architect of golf courses. Their father Tom was a golf professional in London. Their mother, Isabella Gourley, was internationally known and a frequent winner of women's golf tournaments. Of their family, the most famous was William (\\"Willie\\") Dunn, who won the first United States Open in 1894. As a teenager, he began spending his summers in North America. When he was 15, he designed a nine-hole course at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. In the year 1906 he spent his first summer in Lake Placid, where he would soon return. By the age of 17, he was named pro at the Société de Golf de Paris. In 1907, he moved to New York and was hired by the Van Cortlandt Park Golf Club in the Bronx. Shortly after, he would take the position as Golf Professional and Golf Club Maker at the Wykagyl Golf Club in New Rochelle, NY. In 1909, he designed the Links Course at the Lake Placid Club. The same club gave him the position of Golf Architect and Professional. He was the golf pro at the Lake Placid Club from 1908 to 1929; despite the Great Depression he established the Dunn Golf School in that year, and it survived for four years. The school held its classes in Madison Square Garden and later in Rockefeller Center. He used his position in Lake Placid to start his career as a manufacturer of golf clubs. In 1910, Dunn had 10 employees working at the shop, some of them at an assembly-line, which produced clubs and sold them via mail order throughout the United States. He designed many golf courses. In Lake Placid, he designed the Craig Wood Course and the Lake Placid Club Links Course. In his long career, he was commissioned to design courses for King Leopold III of Belgium, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, and Philippe de Rothschild.

It spans the period from the first precursors of American yoga, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau, the arrival of Vivekananda, the role of Hollywood with Indra Devi, the hippie generation, and the leaders of a revived but now postural yoga such as Bikram Choudhury and Pattabhi Jois. Several critics gave the book positive reviews, praising its wide range and readability; other critics gave it mixed reviews, noting its strengths, but also its lack of a strong continuous argument and its tendency to gossip. Synopsis Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of the World's Religions (1893) Syman begins The Subtle Body by describing in turn the precursors of American yoga, namely Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau. She notes that Emerson's 1856 poem Brahma concisely introduced Hindu nondualism, repudiating \\"sacraments, supernaturalism, biblical authority, and ... Christianity\\". Thoreau, she states, tried to practice yoga, and was seen by some as \\"the first American Yogi\\", but by others as \\"a misanthropic hermit\\". However, Syman identifies the dramatic arrival of Vivekananda and his Raja Yoga as marking the start of modern yoga, and the key moment in this as being his appearance at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. From there, she presents the showman Pierre Bernard and his relative Theos Bernard, including sections detailing Pierre confusing yoga with tantric sex, complete with \\"lust, mummery, and black magic\\", and of Theos telling a carefully fictionalised account of his experiences with Hatha Yoga in India and Tibet. The book then includes stories about a variety of straighter advocates of yoga. Syman tells the story of Margaret Woodrow Wilson, daughter of American president Woodrow Wilson, writing how she \\"turn[ed] Hindu\\" after she \\"found peace\\" in Sri Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry. A Hollywood connection is then explored, featuring Prabhavananda, who translated the Bhagavad Gita; Aldous Huxley; Alan Watts; and Indra Devi. The books explains how Devi came to America, unknown, having learnt yoga directly from Krishnamacharya, and how she had grown up in pre-revolutionary Russia, escaping to Berlin and going to India with her diplomat husband. It also tells of the times that Devi taught many celebrity pupils, including Greta Garbo and Gloria Swanson; in a review, Sarah Schrank notes that Syman is interested in how \\"American fans, often rich and female\\", made suitable environments for yoga to spread, \\"shaping celebrity gurus in the process\\". Then Syman gives her view that, in the 1960s, the yoga scene was dominated by celebrity gurus, whether from India like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with his Transcendental Meditation, or home-grown like the \\"psychedelic sages\\" Ram Dass (aka Richard Alpert) and Timothy Leary, both at one time Harvard professors. It then tells how they were followed, towards the end of the 1960s, by Indian gurus of postural yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, founder of the precise Iyengar Yoga, and Vishnudevananda, founder of the more overtly spiritual Sivananda Yoga, along with Swami Satchidananda, giving the story of how the Swami made the crowds chant \\"Hari Om, Rama Rama\\" at the 1969 Woodstock Festival. The book ends with an account of the gurus of more energetic forms of yoga, in particular Bikram Choudhury and Pattabhi Jois. Publication The Subtle Body was published as a hardback book by Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux in New York in 2010. The book is illustrated with 25 monochrome plates, including portraits of many of the people described. Other illustrations are of the chakras from Arthur Avalon in 1919; a circus program from 1929 showing yoga- like contortions; the Hollywood Vedanta Temple; a naked woman in Laghuvajrasana, a back bend, at the Esalen Institute in 1972; and the Sri Ganesha Temple in Ashtanga Yoga New York in 2009. Reception Several critics gave The Subtle Body positive reviews, praising its wide range and readability. Other critics gave the book mixed reviews, noting its strengths, but also its lack of a strong continuous argument, its preference for colourful stories, and its tendency to gossip. One of the warmest receptions came in the New York Journal of Books from novelist Norman Powers. He calls Subtle Body \\"wide-ranging, flexible in its outlook, and satisfying in its inclusiveness, even if Ms. Syman never really defines what, exactly, yoga is.\\" In his view, the result is \\"really a cultural history of the United States\\"; Powers notes Syman's statement that yoga \\"is one of the first and most successful products of globalization\\", and observes that in America it helped to weave an isolationist population \\"into the fabric of the larger world\\". The scholar of Eastern religions Thomas Forsthoefel almost entirely agreed with Powers in his review of the book for Nova Religio, in which he called it \\"a compelling account of the complex social and philosophical interface\\" created by yoga's arrival in America, also describing it as mainly a social history. Forsthoefel, though, sees the book's strength as Syman's storytelling, which he says provides \\"key snapshots both of the sweep of yoga's evolution in America and of the lives of key figures\\" in that process, so that the book reads \\"almost like a novel\\". The readability has been noted by academics, too: the historian Sarah Schrank, writing in American Studies, calls Subtle Body \\"highly readable\\" as it traces the various \\"transmutations\\" of yoga in America. Bob Weisenberg, writing in Elephant Journal, states that the book \\"reads like a thriller\\" and is \\"so entertaining it clearly has an audience outside the Yoga world\\". Pierre Bernard, a major figure in the book, pictured in Ardha Padmasana (half lotus) in an article titled \\"Prizefighter Trains by Yoga Methods\\", Life magazine, 1939 Among the most critical was the historian Jared Farmer. Writing in Reviews in American History, he calls the book relatively vivid but \\"inconstant\\", switching between journalistic, historical, creative, and critical writing styles. Further, in his view it \\"lacks a strong argument\\" and \\"privileg[es] the most colorful stories\\". The most extreme of those is Syman's longest chapter, on Pierre Bernard, with Farmer writing that it \\"includes bizarre love triangles, menage a trois, tantric sex, Vanderbilt heiresses, private detectives, spies, circus elephants, baseball, and heavyweight boxing.\\" Though Farmer notes how Syman successfully illustrates the importance of women in shaping yoga in America, particularly Indra Devi, he affirms that today's yoga did not come straight from Devi; he instead asserts that, in the 1960s, modern yoga split into a mind-oriented stream with Transcendental Meditation and the Hare Krishnas, and a body-oriented stream with Iyengar. These are covered variously in other parts of the book. In another review, the literary critic Michiko Kakutani, writing in The New York Times, states that Syman deftly traces how Emerson and Thoreau enabled yoga to take root in America, providing a \\"lively gallery of larger-than-life characters\\" in the story of American yoga. Kakutani notes Syman's many \\"entertaining anecdotes\\" but states that the book fails to cover either yoga's ancient history or to show how the various schools of yoga evolved. Almost entirely disagreeing with Kakytani, Claire Dederer, writing in Slate, calls the book an \\"exhaustive historical survey\\". She notes that Syman writes of Devi that to her, yoga refers only to the asanas, calling this \\"a turning point ... from esoteric pursuit to health-giving practice available to all.\\" In Dederer's view, Syman \\"does a wonderful job of showing how yoga, like a virus, has kept evolving in order to survive\\", but all the same Dederer wonders if Syman wasn't trying too hard. Similarly, Tara Katir, writing in Hinduism Today, states that Subtle Body \\"proceeds systematically\\", and is \\"engaging, if at times a bit gossipy.\\" See also * Yoga Body, Mark Singleton's 2010 book on the origins of global yoga in physical culture * Selling Yoga, Andrea Jain's 2015 book on the commercialisation of global yoga  References  =Primary= These references indicate the parts of the Subtle Body text being discussed. =Secondary= Sources * Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:Modern yoga books Category:Social history of the United States ","title":"The Subtle Body"},{"id":"61204907","text":"Cherry is an unincorporated community in Lauderdale County, Tennessee, United States.

Created by writer Peter David and artist Gary Frank, the character debuted in The Incredible Hulk #418 (June 1994). The character is a well known member of the Skrulls due to not being able to shapeshift. He was a member of the United Front. Ben Mendelsohn portrays Talos in the films Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home (both 2019) set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history The character was created by Peter David and Gary Frank and first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #418 (June 1994). He was introduced as a guest at Rick Jones's wedding, he and other villains being invited by Impossible Man as a prank. In the following issue it is revealed he can't shapeshift and that he was captured by the Kree in the Kree–Skrull War. He returned during the Annihilation event, mainly in the four issue tie-in Annihilation: Ronan (2006). He joined the United Front, alongside characters like Star-Lord, Nova and Gamora. He made his last appearances in the 2015 ongoing of Howard the Duck, he infiltrated Earth with an actual, physical human disguise using an alter ego he called \\"Jonathan Richards\\". Fictional character biography Talos, considered a Mutant by his people, is a Skrull that was born without the ability to shape shift. He made up for it by becoming one of the most feared Skrulls on his planet earning the title Talos the Untamed due to his savage and sinister nature. However, after getting captured by the Kree, he refused to commit suicide in the hopes of gaining glory for his survival. Instead, he was ridiculed and renamed the more humiliating \\"Talos the Tamed.\\" Talos soon found himself at the wedding of Rick Jones and Marlo Chandler, courtesy of the Impossible Man. He found himself confronted by the Hulk and tried to get him to fight him in an attempt to reclaim glory from his people. When the Hulk found out what he was up to, he ceased fighting him. Talos left in frustration, but the Skrulls found his attempt to battle him impressive. Talos was called to the planet Godthab Omega by Glorian where he ended up battling Devos the Devastator. They were both captured and imprisoned when the planet suddenly came under attack by the Annihilation Wave allowing the two to escape. Talos soon ran into Ronan the Accuser, whom he hated for being a Kree, but was forced to heed his warning about leaving the planet. He was once again humiliated, this time by his own people, when Queen Veranke refused to allow him to be a part of the Secret Invasion due to him not having the ability to shape shift. Though Chancellor Kal'Dul didn't lose the hope of Talos' possible participation. Talos became a member of the United Front to fight the Annihilation Wave. Talos next showed up at Howard the Duck's private investigations in make up and a beard as Jonathan Richards. He tasks Howard with finding a necklace that was stolen by the Black Cat. When Howard finally retrieves it, Talos abandons his disguise to reveal that the necklace contains the Abundant Gems, less powerful versions of the Infinity Gems that can still make one \\"marginally\\" powerful, which he plans to use to gain favor with the Skrulls again. He was defeated by Howard and his friend Tara Tam, and apprehended by the Fantastic Four. Powers and abilities Unlike his Skrull brethren, Talos is incapable of shapeshifting and has been branded as having a genetic defect by his people. To make up for this, he has been granted superhuman strength and durability and can hold his own against the likes of the Hulk. He possesses a cybernetic eye after losing his real one in combat. In other media =Film= * Ben Mendelsohn portrays Talos in the films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: ** Talos first appears in the 2019 film Captain Marvel. Talos is the shape-shifting leader of the Skrull invasion of Earth, who is working undercover within S.H.I.E.L.D. as Nick Fury's boss. Mendelsohn described Talos' human persona as \\"buttoned up\\" and his natural Skrull persona as \\"more laid back, a bit tougher, [and] a little bit nastier.\\" Mendelsohn elaborated, \\"The thing is, when you're Skrullin', there's a kind of take-no-prisoners vibe about it, which is more relaxed. [As a human] This guy’s got to follow protocol because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.\\" When portraying Talos, Mendelsohn uses his native Australian accent, and an American accent when he is in his S.H.I.E.L.D. disguise, which Mendelsohn compared to that of American politician Donald Rumsfeld. Mendelsohn noted there was \\"a very lengthy discussion\\" regarding the accent for the Skrulls, adding \\"There's a certain kind of earthy correctness to an Australian delivery\\". It took Mendelson a \\"couple of hours\\" to have his makeup and prosthetics applied to portray Talos. Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \\"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor because he's very different in all of those parts.\\" Polygon noted that one of the big motifs in the film is the way that war can corrupt people on every side of it, and that a lot of Talos' character arc has to do with this. Den of Geek! considered Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of lead Skrull Talos a highlight of the film. Bustle considered that the film not following the comics precisely, allows Talos to become a far more fearful foe. Wired noted that the film turns General Talos into a character to be fought for, rather than fought against, allowing the film to show the universe through his eyes. This version does have the ability to shapeshift and leads a team of Skrulls, and has a wife named Soren (portrayed by Sharon Blynn) as well as a daughter. When Starforce arrives on the planet Torfa to look for a Kree scout named Soh-Larr, it turns out to be a trap where they make off with Vers. Using a mind-probing machine, Talos and his men enter Vers' memories until she recovers, breaks free, and flees to Earth. When he and his Skrulls arrive on Earth, Talos works undercover within S.H.I.E.L.D. posing as Nick Fury's boss Keller (also portrayed by Mendelsohn). Catching up to Carol Danvers and Nick Fury at Maria Rambeau's house, Talos arranges a parley and even recognizes Goose the Cat's true species which frightens him. He reveals to Carol, Nick, and Maria that the Skrulls are refugees who lost their homeworld after rejecting Kree supremacy. Talos soon becomes Carol and Fury's ally in taking down the Kree's various enforcers who threaten the Skrull refugees at Mar-Vell's space laboratory where his family are also residing. At the film's end, Talos and Danvers depart to find a new homeworld for his family and the rest of the Skrulls. ** In the post-credits scene of Spider-Man: Far From Home, it was revealed that the \\"Nick Fury\\" and \\"Maria Hill\\" who appeared in that movie were actually Talos and his wife Soren, taking their places while the real Fury was in space with the rest of the Skrulls on an undisclosed mission. Talos briefs Fury on their mission and obtaining E.D.I.T.H., until Fury hangs up half-way through the call. =Video games= * Talos is a playable 4-star character in Marvel Puzzle Quest.

It grows in moist places and regenerates rapidly after ground disturbance or fire. The long stems have various uses in making cord, baskets and mats, and the large leaves are used for wrapping food, for making utensils and containers, and in herbal medicine. Description Megaphrynium macrostachyum is a rhizomatous perennial plant up to tall. Each stem bears a single leaf and an inflorescence, the remaining leaves arising directly from the rhizome which can be long. These leaves are borne on petioles up to long which sheath the stem at its base and have calloused portions just below the blade. Each leaf blade is ovate/elliptical, up to , with a rounded base and acute apex. The inflorescence forms a spike just below the calloused portion of the petiole, with branches formed of zig- zag nodes. The small flowers are bisexual and subtended by bracts and are white to bluish-purple. They are followed by three-lobed, globular fruits which turn bright red and split open when ripe. The three seeds embedded in white pulp are purplish-black. Distribution Megaphrynium macrostachyum is native to tropical, sub-Saharan Africa, its range extending from Liberia to South Sudan and Uganda, and southward to Gabon, the Republic of Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, at altitudes of up to . Ecology Megaphrynium macrostachyum is a large, fast-growing plant. It occurs in wet habitats in both primary and secondary forests, in clearings, in logged areas and on fallow land. It regenerates from the rhizome after wildfires and other disturbances and may form dense, monospecific patches which may reduce the regeneration of trees. The flowers are attractive to bees and the rhizomes are eaten by gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Uses The leaves of Megaphrynium macrostachyum are used to wrap food while it is cooking, imparting a characteristic aroma to the food. The young leaves can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable and older leaves are used to make disposable table- wear, containers, funnels, pots, fans and parasols. The petioles, either whole or split, are used to make cord, baskets and mats. The leaves are also used in herbal medicine as a sedative and to treat epilepsy and mental problems, another use being as an antidote to snake venom and arthropod stings. Research Megaphrynium macrostachyum has been used in research into the manufacture of silver nanoparticles by plant extracts. The nanoparticles show antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and can \\"find immense application in the field of biomedical appliances and formulation of antimicrobial agents and in combination with antibiotics\\". Other research showed that a leaf extract given at low dose rates may positively affect blood producing tissues.

Gillham, which has a depiction of Anne Frank surviving her term in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and reuniting with her father, Otto Frank. Background Gilham stated that he conceived of the novel after reading The Diary of Anne Frank while in his late 20s and wondering what works an adult Anne Frank would have written. He had prior attempts to write the novel, but the one that ultimately created the book started circa 2011. As part of his research he conducted an interview of a Dutch person who was acquainted with Otto Frank, watched other interviews, and read memoirs of people who experienced Holocaust and other books about Anne Frank. He also did in-person visits of two concentration camps, Auschwitz- Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen, as well as doing a visit of Amsterdam. He was 61 when he released the novel. This is the second novel written by Gilham. Plot The novel traces Anne's life and depicts her sister Margot Frank dying. After the war Otto conceals Anne's diary, and Anne becomes argumentative with him. Steve Pfarrer of Daily Hampshire Gazette wrote that Gillham's Anne \\"is alternately angry, despairing, and ridden with guilt\\". Anne Frank attempts to have a tryst with a boy and begins smoking cigarettes, and she receives criticism from other people who had experienced the Holocaust. After the diary is revealed Anne becomes less combative and uses the diary to highlight what happened to her to the public. Reception Susan Ellingwood of The New York Times stated that Gillham \\"does a good job\\" in showing an Anne affected by survivor's guilt, but that the scenario between Anne and Otto annoyed her and \\"leave the reader disappointed with this girl they once loved.\\" Ultimately Ellingwood believed the readers were already well-served by the original Diary of Anne Frank. Patty Rhule of USA Today gave the book three of four stars. She concluded \\"a novel that reminds the world to remember Anne Frank is most welcome\\" even though \\"No novelist, however gifted, could rival the power of Anne Frank\\". Publishers Weekly argued that the book was \\"disappointing\\", citing the post-war segment, and that it \\"never lives up to the promise of its premise\\" despite the \\"noble effort\\" and the quality of the research. Kirkus Reviews stated that the writing quality was noticeably inferior to that of the original diary's and that \\"flat-footed storytelling weakens the impact\\"; it added that the concept was a \\"brave risk\\".

She first gained national recognition in 2018, placing as the third in Operación Triunfo of the Spanish reality television talent competition Operación Triunfo, behind Alba Reche and Famous Oberogo. While competing in Operación Triunfo, Lacunza tried to represent Spain at the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest and released \\"La Clave\\" as a solo song and \\"Nadie se Salva\\" alongisde fellow competitor Miki Núñez. In Spring 2019 she signed a record deal with Universal Music Spain and released her debut extended play \\"Otras Alas\\" in June 2019. The EP featured her debut single \\"Nana Triste\\", which features Spanish indie pop singer Guitarricadelafuente. The song reached the fourth position on the PROMUSICAE chart while the EP topped it for two consecutive weeks and earned a gold certification in less than a month. Her second EP, which she titled EP2, was released on March 13, 2020, topped the Spanish Albums chart for a week and spawned three singles.  Early life  Lacunza was born in Pamplona, Spain in January 1999. She began to show interest in music in her teenage years when she quit studying Audiovisual Communication at the University of Navarra to focus on her musical career. She started as a singer under the stage name Elian Bay which was inspired by James Bay, one of her biggest influences. In 2017 she auditioned for the musical television contest La Voz. She sand 'I Lived' by One Republic but was desqualified after the blind auditions. In June 2018 she audition for series ten of the Spanish reality television musical contest Operación Triunfo. In the summer she released a song in English titled \\"Don't Ask\\". She entered the show in September and made it to the final, which took place shortly before Christmas. She placed as the third. In January 2019 she was selected to represent Spain in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest but didn't make it. Although it would have been a great opportunity for her but she never showed interest in it.  Career  = 2019-present: Otras Alas and EP2 = After the singer left Operación Triunfo in December 2018 and failed to represent Spain at the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest, the singer began working on her solo projects. In February a co-headlining tour with her talent show collages started in Madrid and ended in Cádiz in August comprising 13 concerts and reuniting over 120,000 fans. In Spring, Lacunza signed a record deal with Universal Music Spain to release an extended play. Thus, on June 4, 2019 the singer revealed that she would be releasing her debut single alongside Spanish guitarist and novel artist Guitarricadelafuente on June 14. \\"Nana Triste\\" received very positive reviews by press and general public and impulsed the careers of both artists. A week later, on June 21, she released her debut EP \\"Otras Alas\\" which features collaborations with Guitarricadelafuente and Marem Ladson and drew comparisons to Billie Eilish.

The elections were notable for the gang-related violence which took place. Background The 1924 Cicero municipal elections were of special interest to the Chicago Outfit, as they sought to protect their base of operations both from reformist politicians and from rival gangs. Incumbent Republican mayor Joseph Z. Klenha and his administration were corrupt, and, before 1924, had run Cicero with little political opposition. Klenha had a bipartisan machine that had run Cicero for three consecutive terms. However, in 1924, the Democratic Party decided it would mount a serious challenge to Klenha in Cicero and run its own slate of candidates. In 1923 Chicago elected reformist William Emmett Dever as mayor. This led mobsters Johnny Torrio and Al Capone to move the Chicago Outfit's base outside of Chicago's city limits and into the suburban city of Cicero. The gang solidified their power over the suburb's political structure by ousting Republican political boss Eddie Vogel from power. The Chicago Outfit controlled the rum-running operation supplying Cicero's saloons. Rival gangs, seeking to usurp the Chicago Outfit's local Cicero monopoly, aligned themselves with the Democrats. Violence and gang activity on the day of the primary The Chicago Tribune declared that the elections were, \\"marked by shootings, stabbings, kidnappings, and other outlawry unsurpassed in any previous Cook County political contest.\\" The Chicago Outfit obliged to a request from Klenha for assistance in securing his reelection. In return for securing his reelection, they would be granted an effective immunity from the law in Cicero. Al Capone brought in more than 200 men from his gang and its allies. He also brought in his own brothers Frank Capone and Ralph Capone, and his cousin Charles Fischetti. On May 31, the eve of the election, the first person struck was Democratic nominee for town clerk William K. Pflaum, whose campaign offices were ransacked. Pflaum had his face beaten and his wife was thrown against a wall. To protect the Chicago Outfit's political control of Cicero, the Chicago Outfit unleashed a wave of terror on Cicero on the day of the April 1 election. They sent South Side gang members to the polling booths with submachine guns and sawed-off shotguns to make sure that local residents \\"voted right\\". Uncooperative voters were assaulted and blocked from voting. Cooperative voters were allowed by them to illegally cast multiple ballots. Frank Capone led an attack on an opponent's campaign headquarters, ransacking his office and assaulting several campaign workers. An election official named Joseph Price was beaten, then held gagged and bound. Rudolph Hurt, the Democratic challenger for mayor, saw his campaign headquarters shot-up. The Democratic challenger for City Clerk was pistol-whipped in front of his wife, his children, and many supporters. Cars filled with gunmen roamed the town's streets. A Cicero police officer was disarmed and terribly battered. Some voters were shot or cut to death. Polling places were raided and ballots were forcibly ripped from the hands of voters by thugs. Campaigners for both parties were beaten by roaming groups of \\"sluggers\\" in the streets. A Democratic worker named Stanley Stenkievitch was kidnapped, blindfolded, and brought to a Chicago basement where he was held as a captive until after the Cicero polls closed. Up to twenty men were similarly kidnapped, driven to a basement of a plumbing store in Chicago and chained to pipes and posts. One Democratic campaign worker name Michael Gavin was shot in both legs and detained with eight other Democratic campaign workers in the basement of a mob-owned hotel in Chicago, only to be released when Election Day was over.The Brothers Capone by Allan May Crime Magazine By the afternoon, election officials had sent out requests for help bringing order to Cicero. A Cook County judge named Edmund K. Jarecki deputized seventy Chicago police officers, five squads from the detective's bureau, and nine squads of motorized police to bring order to Cicero. At one point Frank Capone, Al Capone, Dave Hedlin, and Charles Fischetti were spotted by a squad car carrying uniformed police and detectives who leapt out of their car with their firearms drawn. Frank Capone began firing at them, and in the ensuing gunfight they shot and killed Frank Capone in the street. Hedlin was wounded, Fischetti fled and later surrendered, while Al Capone escaped. Mayoral election Incumbent mayor Klenha was the Chicago Outfit's favored candidate.\\"AL CAPONE\\" TruTV Crime Library Klenha was challenged by Democrat Rudolph Hurt. Klenha won reelection. Aftermath The Chicago Outfit succeeded in securing a favorable result in the municipal elections. Cicero would remain under their control and remained their headquarters until after Al Capone was sent to prison in 1931 for tax evasion. Klenha's Republican machine remained in power until the 1932 Cicero municipal elections, in which they were eviscerated by what the Chicago Tribune dubbed, \\"an outpouring of Democratic votes such as had never been approached in the town before.\\" References Cicero 1924 Chicago Cicero Category:Al Capone Category:Chicago Outfit Category:Cicero, Illinois ","title":"1924 Cicero, Illinois municipal elections"},{"id":"61205173","title":"Thodupuzha (State Assembly constituency)"},{"id":"61205178","text":"Amida-ji (阿弥陀寺) is a Buddhist temple located in Sakuragata, Okazaki, Aichi.

Its current president is José Luis Rodríguez Aguirre, head of Querétaro broadcaster Respuesta Radiofónica, who has occupied the position since 2018. History President Enrique Peña Nieto speaks at the 58th National Radio and Television Week in 2016 The first broadcasters' association in Mexico was the Asociación Mexicana de Estaciones Radiodifusoras (Mexican Association of Broadcasting Stations), soon changed to the Asociación Mexicana de Estaciones Radiodifusoras Comerciales (Mexican Association of Commercial Broadcasting Stations), which was formed in 1937. In late 1941, the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Radiodifusión (National Chamber of the Broadcasting Industry) was formally constituted, with Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta as its first president. The relationship proved critical for broadcasters who, because of World War II, could not obtain parts for their equipment from American suppliers; Azcárraga's connections to RCA Victor made it possible for small stations to obtain parts by way of affiliating with his Radio Programas de México. Historically, the CIRT has been aligned with larger broadcasters. In 1953, the CIRT supported a move that allowed large Mexico City radio stations to establish nationwide repeaters, adversely affecting local stations. It supported the Televisa Law in 2006, even when many of the association's smaller members would have been harmed by a measure that benefited Televisa and TV Azteca. Likewise, it opposed the Federal Telecommunications Institute's decision to auction new radio and TV stations in 2016. National Radio and Television Week The first National Broadcasting Week, now National Radio and Television Week (Semana Nacional de Radio y Televisión), was organized by the CIR in 1958. The organization changed its name and formally began including television broadcasters in 1970 after an internal restructuring. In 2017, the National Radio and Television Week was not held that November, the first such cancellation in the event's history, as a result of the two earthquakes that had struck the country that September.

Writing also as Keighley Snowden, today his writings are largely forgotten. Born as James Snowden in Preston, the son of Marianne née Haslam (1834–1911) and William Snowden (1833-1911), a Draper Master,1861 England Census for James Snowden he was raised in the West Riding of Yorkshire and educated at the School of Science and Art in Keighley. Snowden began a long career in journalism with the Keighley News and spent 10 years with the Birmingham Daily Post before joining the staff of The Yorkshire Post in 1893 as assistant lead-writer. He had already sold several of his short stories set in Yorkshire to the Black and White and The Pall Mall Magazine. In 1893 he published his first collection of short stories, Tales of the Yorkshire Wolds, sketched from scenes of life in the North West Riding in which he depicted memories from his youth and tales collected from his father and grandfather, both Yorkshiremen. In this early work Snowden described himself as a Yorkshireman \\"no longer privileged to dwell amongst his kinfolk\\" and referred to the book as \\"a tribute of affection.\\" From this book came the comic tale 'A Ghost Slayer', later included in the anthology Victorian Nightmares (1977) collected by Hugh Lamb.Hugh Lamb, Victorian Nightmares, Coronet Books (1980) Much of the dialogue in his Yorkshire tales was written in local dialect. His novel Barbara West (1901) is a tale of journalism set in the provinces of England during the 1880s, while Hate of Evil (1907) is a strange tale of a young clergyman who, to atone for an indiscretion during his youth opts for a life of poverty in a small and remote northern parish. Here his neighbour, the affluent Mrs Howard of Netherfell Hall, secretly adores him. He, meanwhile, seduces and subsequently betrays his charwoman while still keeping the love of Mrs Howard.

The detention center was being used as a holding facility for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe when a storage hangar that it used as a residential facility was destroyed in an aerial bombing. The United Nations Human Rights Council stated that \\"It was known that there were 600 people living inside\\" the facility. At least 53 people were killed and 130 were wounded. The LNA, which reportedly committed the strike targeting unarmed civilians, was condemned by several countries. The airstrike also raised scrutiny of the European Union's policy of cooperating with militias to detain migrants, and funding and training the Libyan Coast Guard which apprehended most of the migrants and refugees. The Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) initially claimed that the airstrike was conducted by the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Khalifa Haftar but later attributed the attack to a United Arab Emirates (UAE) aircraft. In November 2019, United Nations investigators suspected that a non- Libyan Mirage 2000-9 jet had bombed the center. A January 2020 report by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stated that the strike was likely to have been carried out with a guided bomb fired from a non-Libyan aircraft, again suggesting that a foreign Mirage 2000-9 had been used.  Background  The Tajoura Detention Center is located east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. It is part of a network of 34 migrant detention centers across northwestern Libya which house at least 5,000 people. The centers are operated by the Government of National Accord (GNA) and are used to detain migrants attempting to reach Europe. In April 2019, the Libyan National Army, under Haftar's command, began a major offensive to capture western Libya and the capital Tripoli. After an airstrike hit a target less than from the detention center in May, the UN Refugee Agency called for the evacuation of refugees and migrants in detention centers in conflict areas of Tripoli. On 1 July 2019, the LNA said it had begun an air campaign. The LNA's spokesman said that the air campaign destroyed the main control room for drones at Mitiga International Airport, which led to the airport—Tripoli's only functioning airport—suspending civilian flights.  Airstrike  Near midnight on 2 July an airstrike directly struck Tajoura Detention Center's residential hangar as migrant families were sleeping or listening to the conflict outside. A Doctors Without Borders medical coordinator counted 126 migrants living inside of the center's hangar unit shortly before it was hit by the strike. Aerial photos from the scene show that the explosion caved in the roof and blew out the walls of the section of the hangar where it struck. Reports were made to the UN that guards shot at refugees and migrants trying to flee from the air strike. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said there were two air strikes, one hitting an unoccupied garage and one hitting a hangar containing around 120 refugees and migrants. OCHA also agreed with reports that escaping refugees and migrants were fired upon by guards. The Tripoli-based interior ministry denied firing at fleeing refugees and migrants categorically. A media advisor to the Tripoli-based Ministry of Health said in the aftermath that \\"there was blood and body parts all over the place\\" and the Tripoli-based government described it as a \\"massacre\\". Hospitals worked at above-average capacities as they attempted to treat a flood of injured patients from the attack. According to the United Nations, at least 53 people were killed in the airstrike and 130 were injured. Haftar's forces, who are backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, have said they were targeting a nearby military site. According to Amnesty International, there was a weapons storage warehouse in the same compound as the detention center; GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha denied that weapons were stored at the compound.  Legal actions  = Calls for investigations = Foreign nations and international bodies like the UN and African Union collectively called for an investigation, condemning the airstrike and lamenting the loss of life. A spokesman for the United Nations Refugee Agency stated that the detention center's close proximity to a weapons warehouse made it a target by association. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's Human Rights Chief, said the airstrike might constitute a \\"war crime.\\" In an official statement, Secretary-General António Guterres demanded a probe into \\"how this happened and who was responsible and to bring those individuals to account.\\" The Middle East and North African director for Amnesty International, too, demanded that the International Criminal Court investigate the bombing as a war crime, highlighting the disaster as a \\"consequences of Libya and Europe's callous migration policies\\". =UNSMIL/OHCHR Jan 2020 report= In January 2020, UNSMIL and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) published a report on the pair of airstrikes. During 3–6 July 2019, United Nations personnel visited the Daman building complex, which includes both the Daman brigade, a pro-GNA militia, and the Tajoura Detention Center, holding 616 migrants and refugees at the time of the hit, of which 126 were in the part of the hangar that was hit by one of the airstrikes. The investigators carried out interviews, documented the site for analysis of the munitions used and obtained video recording from surveillance cameras. On 3 November survivors of the attack, relocated to a new building, were again interviewed by UNSMIL. The investigators found that the first bomb hit a workshop used by the Daman Brigade, and the second hit the detention center. Both were followed by the sound of a fighter jet and a drone was heard after the second attack. Detention centre officials claimed that all the deaths were the result of the airstrikes; migrant and refugee interviewees said that three deaths were from gunfire. The bomb that hit the hangar with the migrants and refugees hit at 23:39, making a crater on the ground about in diameter and deep. Both bombs appear to have been guided bombs, which, according to UNSMIL/OHCHR, neither the Libyan Army (GNA), the LNA nor other Libyan armed groups had available. Interviewees stated that between the first and second strikes, the head of the detention centre shot dead three men who were trying to escape from the hangar. The head of the detention center denied the claim. On 3 July, the LNA claimed to have carried out the first bombing but not the second. UNSMIL/OHCHR judged the airstrikes to probably have been carried out by a state other than Libya, either under LNA command or under the command of the foreign state aiming to support the LNA. UNSMIL/OHCHR cited page 126 of report S/2019/914 of the UN Panel of Experts on Libya, where the Panel argued that LNA military assets were incompatible with the precision guided missiles that appeared to have been used, and stated that Mirage 2000-9 fighters were present at the time at al-Khadim and Jufra air bases and could not have been maintained and supported by the LNA. UNSMIL/OHCHR stated concerns that the airstrike that hit the detention center may have been illegal under international humanitarian law. They also stated that the Daman Brigade's responsibility in the close colocation a military target and the detention center, and detention center guards' failure to help the detainees flee to safety following the first strike, could constitute violations of international humanitarian law. UNSMIL/OHCHR summarised their report by making recommendations to the GNA, the LNA, third parties supporting the two, and to the international community, for implementing international humanitarian law.  Reactions  = Libya = The Government of National Accord (GNA) blamed the attack on air forces associated with General Haftar of the Libyan National Army (LNA). Haftar had been waging an offensive against the UN-backed GNA in Tripoli since April, and the airstrike had occurred two days after the general threatened bombings in the area after announcing \\"traditional means\\" of war were insufficient. Although the LNA had announced plans for airstrikes in response to losing control of Gharyan, a spokesman for Haftar told The Independent that the allegations that the LNA was behind the bombing were \\"incorrect\\" because \\"the LNA has no air operations.\\" GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha announced on 4 July that the government was considering closing detention centers and releasing all migrants as the government cannot ensure their protection. The next day, Bashagha accused the United Arab Emirates of bombing the migrant center with a US-made F-16 jet. When asked if the GNA had any proof that an Emirati jet conducted the attack, the Minister said: \\"The sound of the jet was identified by technicians and pilots who heard it. The destructive power [of the bombs] is very big and is similar to the destructive power [of the bombs dropped] in 2014.\\" = International = The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration made a joint statement: \\"Our two organizations strongly condemn this and any attack on civilian life. We also call for an immediate end to detention of migrants and refugees.\\" The UN Security Council considered a resolution drafted by the United Kingdom which would have condemned the attack and called for a ceasefire, which didn't pass after not being endorsed by the United States. The African Union issued a statement via Commission Chair Moussa Faki reiterating its call for an immediate ceasefire and demanding that \\"an independent investigation be conducted to ensure that those responsible for this horrific crime [against] innocent civilians be brought to account.\\" Faki also emphasized the need for humanitarian relief from the international community to protect migrant populations. Foreign affairs ministries for regional neighbors of Libya and the United Arab Emirates similarly called for changes to international migrant-holding policies and condemned the strike as a war crime. The Minister for Foreign Affairs for Malta Carmelo Abdella emphasized that migrants and refugees in dangerous situations should be \\"swiftly transferred to safe places under the supervision and protections of the United Nation,\\" and on 7 July Malta's government allowed 65 migrants rescued while sailing from Libya to Europe to stay in Malta to await relocation to the European Union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Qatar, a regional neighbor to the accused United Arab Emirates, called for an \\"urgent international investigation\\" into the airstrike. Algeria's government similarly condemned the airstrike for the wanton deaths of civilians, and insisted on the \\"immediate return to the process of inclusive dialogue between all Libyan parties.\\" Representatives of nations outside of regions affected by the European migrant crisis stated their outrage while demanding investigations and policy changes. The U.S. State Department made an official statement for conflicting Libyan parties to \\"de-escalate fighting in Tripoli and return to the political process,\\" and Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attack a \\"crime against humanity\\" and blamed Haftar's forces for the airstrike. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs similarly issued a similar statement emphasizing the need for a \\"comprehensive and credible investigation of this crime\\" and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in order to prevent new casualties.\\" Aftermath In the week following the airstrike, the remaining detainees at the facility were either released or transferred to other detention centers. A migrant processing facility run by the UN Refugee Agency which seeks to evacuate refugees and asylum seekers received over 400 migrants from the Tajoura migrant center. However, days later, the Tajoura migrant center began receiving new detainees. By July 16, the migrant center housed around 200 migrants – including refugees recently intercepted by the Libyan coast guard, people transferred from other migrant facilities in Libya, and re-captured detainees who had escaped the facility during the airstrike.

It was Mme Kasenkina whose fears and indecisions precipitated the crisis.”Ellis M. Zacharias, Behind Closed Doors: The Secret History of the Cold War, G.

She worked in the kitchen serving farm workers, many of whom were previously active in the White Movement.

HD 139139 is a G-type main-sequence star, a little larger and more luminous than the sun, and at an almost identical temperature. It has an apparent magnitude of 9.8. The companion star is thought to be a K5-7 red dwarf away from HD 139139\\\\. It is about three magnitudes fainter and has a temperature of between 4,100 and . Both stars have a similar proper motion, meaning they may form a gravitationally-bound binary pair. HD 139139 exhibits dips in brightness similar to those caused by transiting Earth-like planets. The Kepler space telescope observed 28 dips in their brightness over an 87-day period (23 August – 20 November 2017). The dips do not appear to be periodic as would be expected if they were due to transiting planets. It is unknown which of the two stars produces the dimming events. Potential explanations that have been investigated include planets transiting a binary star, planets that are perturbing the orbits of each other producing large transit timing variations, a disintegrating planet, large dust producing asteroids, and short lived sunspots. According to Andrew Vanderburg, one of the researchers of the original studies, “In astronomy we have a long history of not understanding something, thinking it’s aliens, and later finding out it’s something else ... The odds are pretty good that it’s going to be another one of those.” Background HD 139139 was identified as unusual by two independent groups of visual surveyors (citizen scientists) working in collaboration with veteran astronomers. \\"But some of these patterns are too complex for computers to tease out; volunteer citizen scientists also comb through the Kepler catalogue, using the human brain's power to uncover surprising signals.

Previous statistics have shown that about a third of girls and one sixth of boys are victims of sexual assault in Canada. In 2016, results from a national representative survey indicated that the sexual abuse of children has been declining in Canada since the early 1990s. In Canada, child sexual offences also include the access and use of child pornography, since the use of these materials indirectly harms a child. Child pornographic offences are considered child sexual abuse, since its production involves direct sexual abuse of a child. The criminal justice system has been transitioning the term of child pornography to \\"child sexual abuse materials\\" and/or \\"child sexual exploitation materials\\" as these terms essentially underline the fact that children are being sexually abused. By contrast, \\"child pornography\\" has an underlying tone that these materials are erotic and are used for sexual arousal purposes.  Prevention  In response to this issue, several prevention initiatives have taken place: * Little Warriors works at a national level to reduce the stigma of child sexual abuse, and have ongoing workshops to help caregivers spot signs of sexual abuse. * Calgary Communities Against Sexual Abuse (CCASA) has launched several initiatives in preventing child sexual abuse, including the Third Option, which allows victims to store evidence against offenders and choose whether to report after a year. * The Prevention Study is an initiative that aims to prevent sexual offences against children by treating people who have not offended and feel they are at risk of offending (also see Prevention Project Dunkelfeld). * Cybertip.ca is a Canadian national tip-line to report online child sexual exploitation. * Canadian Centre for Child Protection (CCCP) is a national charity that aims to reduce and prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation. It has several ongoing research projects, such as Project Arachnid, which is an automated webcrawler that actively reduces the availability of child sexual abuse materials on the Internet.  Penalties for child sexual abuse  The Criminal Code indicates that the following charges are considered hands-on sexual offences: Sexual interference on persons under age 16, sexual assault on persons under age 16, and invitation to sexual touching. Child pornography-related offences under the Criminal Code include: Making child pornography, Make available/distribute child pornography, Access child pornography, and Possession of child pornography. In addition, offenders might be placed on the Section 161 order, which restricts interactions with minors (age 16 and below). Offenders might also be placed on the Sexual Offender Registry for either 5 years, 10 years, or a lifetime. Those who have been convicted of these offences might have the option of serving weekend sentences while getting treatment for their problematic sexual interests and/or behaviors. Currently, Canada does not have any public/community notification laws. Many studies have shown that there is no empirical support that public notification laws are effective at preventing sexual re-offences. In fact, research has shown that public notification laws might present more problems than help. There have been emerging studies that show treatment efforts may be more effective at reducing sexual re-offences.

History Izone was proposed by Selwyn District Council in August 2000 to attract business to their district. The council bought of rural land in April 2001 to start the venture. One year later, the council signed up The Warehouse Group to have their South Island distribution centre established on the site. The distribution centre, which opened in June 2003, was built for the council by Naylor Love and later sold it to an investment fund. It was the largest single-storey building in the South Island at and was extended by another in 2016. By 2010, Izone was New Zealand's biggest industrial subdivision. In 2015, Port of Lyttelton and Port of Tauranga both built container handling facilities at Izone. Port of Lyttelton did so because the Christchurch Southern Motorway had caused congestion on Brougham Street, slowing down access to Canterbury's port. Port of Tauranga did so because it owns a half-share in PrimePort Timaru. Both these South Island ports are accessible via the Main South Line. The PrimePort facility opened in July 2015 and Lyttelton's MidlandPort opened in June 2016. Location and access Izone is framed on two sides by railway lines. The Main South Line forms the southern boundary and the Midland Line forms the south-western boundary. Parallel to and just beyond the Main South Line is State Highway 1, and beyond the highway is the township of Rolleston. The intersection on State Highway 1 that is formed with Hoskyns Road was signalised in March 2007. As State Highway 1 segregates the township from its industrial subdivision, a bridge is planned to connect Rolleston with Izone to be constructed in 2021.

The company currently owns and operates four farming facilities in and around Newark, New Jersey.  History  AeroFarms began in 2004 in the Finger Lakes area of New York. In 2015, the company relocated its headquarters to Newark, New Jersey. The company was co-founded by CEO David Rosenberg, CMO Marc Oshima, and CSO (Chief Science Officer) Edward Harwood. In 2015, AeroFarms started a growing space a 30,000 square-foot former paintball and laser tag arena in Newark. In September 2016, the AeroFarms Global Headquarters opened in a 70,000 square-foot facility in Newark, New Jersey, and is the largest indoor vertical farm in the world based on annual growing capacity. The farm was built in a 75-year-old former steel mill facility and has the capacity to produce up to two million pounds of leafy greens per year. AeroFarms also has a functioning farm in the dining hall of the Phillips Academy Charter School in Newark, New Jersey. This 50-square-foot farm opened in September of 2011. Product AeroFarms uses aeroponic technology in their farms. Unlike hydroponics, aeroponics utilizes a closed loop system to mist the roots of the greens with nutrients, water, and oxygen. The growing cloth medium is made out of BPA-free, post-consumer recycled plastic. The cloth can be fully sanitized after harvest and then reseeded with no risk of contamination. Acting as a barrier between the mist and the plants, the cloth allows for a clean, dry and ready to eat product. LED lights are engineered to have specific spectrum, intensity, and frequency which controls the physical and flavor components of the produce. The controlled indoor environment disrupts the normal cycle of indoor pests so they never get started. This pest resistant design does away with the need for pesticides, herbicides and fungicides.

It is located next to the Plaza de la Libertad. Originally constructed around 1520, it was rebuilt after the volcanic eruption of 1706.  History  In 1520, Cristobal de Ponte, the founder of Garachico, ceded a plot to construct the church. The dedication of the church to Saint Anne was inspired by his wife, Ana de Vergara. Construction of the chancel had started by 1532, and had been completed by 1542. The Eruption of Trevejo (1706) severely affected the church, after which it was rebuilt between 1714 and 1721, with new walls and roofs, following the original plans. The church was restored in the 1990s. Three of its sculptures were restored in 2010. Work to restore the tower started in 2014, and included the repair of the wooden structure, the external stonework, the coatings and finishes, as well as the replacement of the electrical cabling and pavement, costing €253,000. It re-opened in 2016, after which it hosted several exhibitions. It was registered as a monument of cultural interest by the Cabildo de Tenerife in 2010, and is part of a group listing (conjunto historico) of properties of cultural interest in Garachico.  Design and contents  The facade combines elements from Plateresque and Renaissance architecture. The interior is divided into three parts, with a series of arches and columns. (In Spanish one says there are three naves; in English a nave and two side-aisles). There are a number of different altars, some of which are Baroque, as well as sculptures and paintings. The church houses an image of Christ of Divine Mercy from Mexico, made using the marrow of corn, and a baptismal font made of marble in the 17th century. It also houses a museum of sacred art.

It was a development of an earlier 290 MM race car that won the 1956 Mille Miglia. The 290 S was the first sports car manufactured by Ferrari to be powered by a DOHC V12 engine. Its career was very short but it served as an important milestone in the Jano V12-powered lineage. Development The Vittorio Jano- designed V12 engine received some technical solutions and experience from the Lancia’s Formula One V8 engine. It was an evolution of the one earlier installed in the 290 MM sports racing car, now with a four overhead camshaft configuration. The new engine was installed in the same, unmodified tubular chassis from its predecessor. The spyder body, coachbuilt by Scaglietti, was updated to incorporate the new technical regulations introduced by the FIA. Unlike its predecessor, the 290 S did not score any victories. Only two examples were produced (chassis numbers 0646 and 0656), and both were further converted into a larger displacement derivative, the 315 S, one before 12 Hours of Sebring, the second after the race. Specifications The new Jano V12 engine, codenamed Tipo 136, received a new configuration with twin overhead camshafts per cylinder bank. The internal measurements of of bore and stroke, and the resulting total capacity of remained the same as before. At a 9:1 compression ratio, the power output was at 8000 rpm. For comparison, the 290 MM had a maximum power of 320 PS at 7200 rpm. The fuel feed was also updated, now with six Weber 42DCN carburettors, instead of three 36IR4s. Ignition was by twin spark plugs, served by four coils. The engine used a dry sump lubrication system. The tubular steel chassis, known as tipo 520, was the same as on the 290 MM that in turn was derived from the 860 Monza. The front suspension was independent, and the rear was a De Dion type with transverse leaf springs. Hydraulic shock absorbers were installed on both ends. Transmission and braking remained the same as before. Racing Both cars debuted at the 1000 km Buenos Aires in 1957. The first car s/n 0646, was driven by Eugenio Castellotti, Luigi Musso and Maurice Trintignant, and managed to qualify at a second place. In the actual race the car has retired around half-way with an ignition problems. Musso has changed the team and supported the winning 290 MM’s crew. The engine was upgraded to 315 S specification for Sebring race by March, and the car was subsequently destroyed at the tragic 1957 Mille Miglia in the final 335 S guise. The second car s/n 0656 also debuted in the Argentinian race. The 290 S had qualified on a fifth place but also did not finish the race. Issues with an oil pressure had forced Peter Collins and Mike Hawthorn to retire after completing only two laps. The 0656 was then prepared for the 1957 12 Hours of Sebring, but was not upgraded to a bigger capacity. Instead the car received an older, SOHC tipo 130 engine from the 290 MM. Masten Gregory with Lou Brero drove the car, entered by George Tilp, to a fourth overall and a third in class. It was the best Ferrari result in this event as the more powerful 315 S’ came sixth and seventh. The car was later converted into the 3.8-litre 315 S before May 1957.

She is is best known as the creator of the Disney Channel animated series The Owl House. She is also known for storyboarding on Gravity Falls and directing on the 2017 reboot of DuckTales.  Early life and education  Terrace was born in Hamden, Connecticut. She spent eight years going to Catholic school, gaining an interest in painters such as John Bauer, Remedios Varo, and Hieronymus Bosch. As a child, she watched cartoons like The Powerpuff Girls, South Park, and The Simpsons, inspiring her later works. Similarly, Hayao Miyazaki's \\"mature anime\\" film titled Princess Mononoke, Studio Ghibli films, and Garfield influenced her as well. The video has been archived here. It is not known whether Terrace is referring to Garfield the comic or the animated series, Garfield and Friends. In 2000, she created her first flip-book animation, which focused on \\"Pikachu thundershocking a Charmander.\\" Prior to studying animation at the School of Visual Arts in New York, Terrace was a dancer for 10 years. While obsessing over Pokémon as kid, she was \\"big into cats,\\" with the characters she drew being cats or cat-girls \\"being chased by ghosts and dinosaur ghosts.\\" This continued at SVA. While there she drew for about eight hours a day, as she had during her years at Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School in New Haven, Connecticut, and began posting work to her Tumblr blog. In April 2012, during her third year at SVA, she created an animated short titled \\"Kickball,\\" which was praised for its design and \\"expressive motion,\\" complete with voiceovers by Yotem Perel and music by Jeff Liu. The exact page was never archived, only the page listing all the blog entries, hence the different url. Her film won a grant from the National Board of Review. See bottom of 2012 Winners section The following year, she worked with Iker Maidagan on a short animated film titled Mirage. The exact page was never archived, only the page listing all the blog entries, hence the different url. Maidagan did the layout and wrote the story, while Terrace animated and design the characters. The film was praised as being \\"flawlessly executed,\\" was shown at the LA Shorts Fest, and resulted in Terrace and Maidagan receiving an Alumni Scholarship Award. See 2013 section. At the time, when asked about animating, she said she loved it, and said she is on the track to become a \\"proper filmmaker\\" and stated that she would collaborate with Maidagan in the future. She later described her experience at SVA as a mixed bag, although she stated she learned a lot from online tutorials, her peers, and fellow students.  Internship and early work  After graduating from SVA in 2013, she interned the following summer at JibJab, where she met an individual from Gravity Falls who saw her student film Mirage and sent her a storyboard test, subsequently landing her a job on the series as a storyboard revisionist. As she described it in 2017, she was brought into Gravity Falls because creative people working on the show liked what they saw on her Tumblr blog, and she was brought in because she was willing to do any kind of animation for a specific scene. Her work for Gravity Falls would be her \\"first professional animation job,\\" where she learned to storyboard, how to handle a crew, and have a clear vision. In 2019, she said she had a \\"wonderful experience\\" on Gravity Falls and said she \\"couldn’t have asked for a better first gig.\\" However, she admitted in a 2016 interview that she was waiting to hear back from Steven Universe because she was a fan of Rebecca Sugar after seeing her films at SVA, but they \\"took too long to reply\\" so she decided to work for Gravity Falls instead. In 2014, she tabled at the CTN Animation Expo with Nate Swineheart, and sold prints, sketchbooks, and other works. In later years, she drew illustrations of characters such as Hermione Granger, a protagonist in the Harry Potter series. In 2018, she inked 34 pages of Hirsch's graphic novel, Gravity Falls: Lost Legends: 4 All-New Adventures!  Career  In 2017, Terrace directed various episodes of DuckTales and made the character Webby Vanderquack \\"more dynamic.\\" Terrace later described this job as a place she wasn't feeling \\"fulfilled artistically or emotionally,\\" which moved her to create her own series. Although she had never watched the series before working on the show, the line producer for the second season of Gravity Falls was also working on DuckTales and brought her into the show. The same year, Variety highlighted her as an up-and-coming animator, saying that she is learning more all the time and is always \\"looking for the next way to push herself.\\" Also that year she worked as a storyboard revisionist for Tangled: Before Ever After, a film directed by Tom Caulfield and Stephen Sandoval, the latter who would later work on The Owl House. Additionally, she would storyboard the fourth episode of Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, \\"Challenge of the Brave.\\" After years of working on other Disney Channel shows, Terrace began to pitch her own series, coming up with the characters and \\"baseline idea\\" for the show at the end of 2016. Her pitch, which came only a few months after she started directing DuckTales in 2017, \\"a young girl [who] goes to another world and learns magic from an older witch\\", later developed into The Owl House. The first character she created was the Owl Lady, which she based on the women in her family, including her aunts, mother, and grandmother. The character Luz Noceda is named after her roommate. The series was also influenced by Pokemon Red, a game Terrace’s father, Thomas Terrace, an attorney in Hamden, Connecticut, gave her before he died when she was age 11. Terrace said she was motivated to create The Owl House to prove it was a good story, and gave it the current name because of the \\"mystique surrounding owls.\\" She later said that while there is some information for fans who want to \\"dig deeper\\" into the show, like codes and ciphers in Gravity Falls, there is a way to \\"enjoy the show as it is\\" without digging into the show's lore. The Owl House began development on February 23, 2018 when it was greenlit alongside Amphibia, and premiered on January 10, 2020 on Disney Channel in the United States. The series was approved for a second season on November 21, 2019. The same year, Terrace illustrated an alternative cover for issue 4 of Adventure Time with Fionna and Cake: Card Wars, a BOOM! Studios six-issue miniseries which featured Fionna and Cake, the gender-swapped versions of Finn and Jake. Terrace also provided guest animation for the episode of Adventure Time titled \\"Bad Timing\\". A few years later, Terrace criticized the cancellation of The Venture Bros. by Adult Swim, writing \\"this timeline sucks.\\" =Terrace and LGBTQ+ representation in The Owl House= The Owl House has been praised for its LGBTQ+ characters, for which Terrace is responsible. She actively uses Twitter to confirm the LGBTQ+ identities of characters. Though Disney was initially resistant to the portrayal of a queer relationship on the show, Terrace eventually gained their support, crediting the change of mind to her \\"stubbornness\\". News sites like CNN and Deadline have expressed support for these portrayals, while conservative sites like One Million Moms have expressed the opposite, condemning Disney Channel for their inclusion of LGBTQ+ identities in the series.  Personal life  Terrace came out as bisexual in 2017, and drew on her experiences to create The Owl House and the bisexual character Luz Noceda. Terrace has mentioned multiple times that she draws inspiration for Luz Noceda from herself. As of 2015, Terrace is dating Gravity Falls creator Alex Hirsch. Terrace and Hirsch have participated in numerous charity live streams together, in which they draw cartoons to raise money for various organizations including Planned Parenthood, The American Civil Liberties Union, The Southern Poverty Law Center, The Natural Resources Defense Council (with Ninja Sex Party and Arin Hanson), Direct Relief (with Justin Roiland and Ethan Klein), The Trevor Project (with Rebecca Sugar and Ian Jones-Quartey), and RAICES (with Daron Nefcy and Eden Sher). All together totaling over $270,000 raised. Terrace also signed a petition for pay equity in the animation industry, as did other fellow creators like Rebecca Sugar, Justin Roiland, Lauren Faust, Ian Jones-Quartey, Owen Dennis, and Matt Braly. Political views Terrace has been outspoken about her political views on social media. In a tweet on September 18, 2020 she stated her opposition to the swearing in of a new justice to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court as a result of the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She argued that if the nomination was confirmed, then \\"the most basic of human rights\\" will go back 50 years, and mourned Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling her a \\"titan of justice.\\" In the same thread, she called for \\"science-denying GOP bootlickers\\" to be removed from the U.S. Senate and replaced by Democratic Senators while encouraging people to vote in November. Later, she gave tacit support to Joe Biden in the 2020 election as a way to \\"stop Trump,\\" while she admitting that she aligned, originally, with Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. Earlier in the month, on September 13, she hosted a charity event with two other staff members who had worked with her on The Owl House, animation supervisor Spencer Wan and storyboarder Luz Batista, which raised money for Rock the Vote.

The hotel's keeper, Remedios, and it's groundskeeper, Jacinto, are a helpful, older couple with teenage twin children, brother and sister Francisco and Lucila. Remedios enjoys talking to her guests and finds out that Vanesa is, to Remedios' pleasure, 4 months pregnant. Francisco and Lucila, meanwhile, spend their time playing a Ouija type game with another guest couple, Esteban and Teresa Rivero, trying to communicate with their father, which Lucila and Francisco at first thought was Jacinto, but which they later learned had died. Remedios and Jacinto are reluctant to Lucila and Francisco trying to investigate who their father was. Jacinto surprises Esteban looking through Jacinto's gardening tools and Esteban becomes horrified but he walks away from the tool's room convinced something sinister took place there. As he, his wife Teresa and the teenagers continue playing the game for more clues about what happened to the teens' father, they have visions in which Jacinto had killed their dad and buried him within the hotel. Jacinto tells Remedio that maybe it's time that they reveal the truth about their father to the teens, which infuriates and worries her. Later on, it is revealed that, on another stormy night about 15 years before, another man and his pregnant wife had arrived at the hotel hoping to stay one night. Remedios, who was a deeply disturbed but religious woman, had been praying to God for Him to let her have children. The pregnant woman went into labor and had no choice but to give birth right away; Remedios helped her give birth, but then killed her by asphyxiating her by pulling a pillow on top of her face, in order to keep the children, which she saw as God's answer to her prayers. Upon seeing his wife dead on the hotel room bed, her husband attacked Remedios, trying to kill her and regain the newborn children. But Jacinto saw this and hit him on the back of his head with a hammer, killing him instantly. Afraid that Jacinto was about to reveal all of this to the kids, Remedios kills him and then places a rope over his neck so that it is apparent he committed suicide instead. The teens find his body and then she runs into his room and starts crying and yelling at them, telling them its their fault that he killed himself. After they leave the room, she stops crying and talks to Jacinto's dead body, then the kids learn their parents' fate and how they got to live in the hotel. Confronted by the teens, Remedios kills them. At this point in the film, the second couple arrives at the hotel, returning to the film's starting scene. Remedios comfortably and amicably chats with them, offering them free breakfast the next morning. Critical response As of 2019, the film had no critical consensus on the film critics website Rottentomatoes.com. The film was given a positive review by critic Adolfo C. Martinez of Argentine daily newspaper La Nacion. Martinez praised Marcos Palmieri's ability to \\"influx all the ingredients necessary to satisfy the genre's followers\\" as well as to make the hotel structure itself \\"another character (in the film)\\". He also praised actors Maria Alejandra Figueroa, Lucia Guzman and Diego Sampayo and the movie's technicians.

The play was first performed and published posthumously in 1696, but was probably written in the late 1680s. The first published version of this play (February 1696) included the first biography of Behn, and this was probably written by Charles Gildon. It was staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, likely in early February 1696. The original cast included John Verbruggen as Prince Frederick, Benjamin Johnson as Sir Rowland Marteen, George Powell as George Marteen, Hildebrand Horden as Welborn, William Pinkethman as Sir Merlin Marteen, William Bullock as Sir Morgan Blunder, Thomas Kent as Brittone, Frances Maria Knight as Mirtilla, Susanna Verbruggen as Olivia, Elizabeth Willis as Mrs Menage and Mary Powell as Lady Blunder.Van Lennep p.459  Plot  The old but wealthy Lady Youthly is due to marry George, an impoverished younger brother. George's father, Sir Rowland, is due to marry Lady Youthly's granddaughter, Tereisa. Mirtilla is the 'amorous jilt' of the title. She previously dropped George in order to marry the wealthy Sir Morgan Blunder. She has an affair with George's friend Prince Frederick, and also pursues a young page (in reality the page is George's sister Olivia disguised as a boy). In the end, Prince Frederick gives Mirtilla an alibi and returns her to Sir Morgan, who agrees to let the Prince visit her in the future. The play concludes with a wedding between George and Tereisa, and a celebratory dance.  Reception  The Younger Brother is in some respects a conventional romantic comedy. However, Peggy Thompson calls the play Behn's \\"bleak final vision\\" about the lot of women, saying that \\"the final lines remind us that the weddings in this play also mark the triumph of a patriarchal, objectifying system: George gloats that his 'younger Brother's share is one that's Rich, Witty, Young and Fair'\\".

A spin-off title in the Kunio-kun franchise, the game stars Misako and Kyoko (originally appearing in Nintendo World Cup and Kunio-tachi no Banka respectively) who fight their way through enemies and obstacles to rescue their kidnapped boyfriends, series protagonists Kunio and Riki. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in September 2019. Gameplay River City Girls is a beat 'em up brawler. The player can choose between Kyoko or Misako, who play similarly but have unique moves and animations. Two players can play a local cooperative mode with both. Waves of enemies and occasional bosses are out to oppose the chosen character(s). The player progresses through six areas in a linear manner similar to Shodai Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun and Shin Nekketsu Kōha: Kunio-tachi no Banka. Like River City Ransom, the player is free to return to previous areas, but they must complete certain battles and objectives to go to the new locations in their current area. In many areas where combat is initiated the first time, chains and a lock will surround the edges of the screen. At this point, the player will be unable to leave the area until all enemies are defeated. There are six bosses in the game; to be able to advance to the next area, the player must defeat the boss of the current area. Defeated enemies drop money for the player to collect, just as in River City Ransom. Money can be spent at various shops to purchase items, food, and gear to increase stats. Money can also be used to purchase new fighting moves from the Dojo to complement the starting basic set. Abilities are all simple to perform, being a direction + a button; complexity for advanced players lies in chaining the simple moves together into long combos.'BARF!': Designing River City Girls' approachable, challenging brawling Characters also gain experience points and level-ups from defeating enemies, as in River City Ransom: Underground. Completion of quests grant experience and money rewards to both characters, ensuring that the one that the player is not using in a single player game does not fall behind in levels or money. As bosses are defeated in the game, enemies become stronger. Upon defeating the final enemy in an area, they might surrender. The player can choose to either defeat the enemy as normal, or to recruit them. Recruited enemies can be summoned to assist the player, although only one recruit is kept at a time. The player can pick up various objects during the game and use them as improvised weapons, but they will break after being used multiple times. If the player loses all their stamina bar and is defeated (or both characters defeated in multiplayer), the player must restart the current room and lose a portion of their cash on hand, but their health is fully restored. In multiplayer, if only one character is knocked out, it is possible for the other player to revive them by standing over their fallen body and repeatedly kicking their departing soul back into it. An angel leaving the character's body acts as a timer so that the other player can perform the revival as fast as possible. Once introduced, Kunio-kun character Godai will offer players numerous side quests. There are also various NPCs that the player can interact with. Plot River City Girls single-player gameplay; four attacking enemies inside a mall. Misako (voiced by Kayli Mills) is in detention at River City High, accompanied by her best friend Kyoko (Kira Buckland). She receives an alarming message on her phone: a picture of Kunio (Greg Chun) and Riki (Kaiji Tang), the heroes of River City High and their boyfriends, seemingly being kidnapped. Kyoko and Misako decide to spring into action to rescue their boyfriends. The pair rampages across the city, attacking any suspicious person they find while attempting to find answers. Development River City Girls is the first collaboration between Arc System Works and WayForward, and the second time that WayForward works on an intellectual property that previously belonged to Technōs Japan Corp, having previously worked on Double Dragon Neon. The game was in development for nearly three years.River City Girls Questions Answered By Game Director Adam Tierney – Insight For The Big Fight. (HappyGamer) River City Girls was directed by Adam Tierney and Bannon Rudis, the latter of whom had previously worked on River City Ransom: Underground. Tierney approached Rudis with the idea to co-direct a new entry in the Kunio- kun series and take the game in a new \\"goofy, zany direction\\".River City Girls Wants to \\"Beat You Over the Head\\" With Character (USGamer) Once Rudis saw what Tierney had done, he agreed to work on the game. The goal was to create a River City Ransom game in the style of Shantae (WayForward's flagship series), more expressive and larger in presentation than previous games in the Kunio- kun franchise. The aim of the game was to exude style, with each character having their own unique moves that would accentuate their personalities. As assistant director, Rudis tried to make the game's fighting mechanics as close to an Arc System Works fighting game as possible while minimizing the play controls and inputs to make the game have more in common with the Super Smash Bros. games or Dragon Ball FighterZ. Rudis also worked the game's lead animator Kay Yu to decide how each attack should look like. From the start, it was decided that the game would use pixel art to connect it to previous games in the franchise. A director at WayForward introduced Tierney to Shin Nekketsu Kōha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, while the game was in development and he instantly fell in love with both Kyōko and Misako, the two playable female characters in the game. WayForward wanted these two characters to take the lead role as they have already created games with strong female protagonists. During development, Tierney learned from Arc System Works that Kyōko and Misako were no longer acting as the girlfriends for the main protagonists of the franchise, Kunio and Riki. Riki had been with Mami longer than Kyōko (she was Riki's girlfriend in only two games) while Hasebe is often linked with Kunio (though she is only his love interest in Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo Zen'in Shūgō!). This led to discussions of creating a rivalry between the girls for the game's plot. Although River City Girls is billed as a canonical game in the Kunio-kun franchise,Destructoid article, We chatted with WayForward about River City Girls' ass-kicking heroines and the Kunio-kun legacy (Destructoid) the game does not follow the continuity started with Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun Special, and it also ignores and contradicts old continuity from previous games in the franchise. Most of the game's staff was new, mostly regarding the game's art, music and animation. Composer \\"Chipzel\\" did most of the boss battle music and arranged the boss theme from the original River City Ransom. Megan McDuffee composed the tracks for the stages, cinematics, menus and nearly everything else, some of these tracks include full vocal tracks. She also arranged music from River City Ransom and Kunio- tachi no Banka. Priscilla \\"Rem\\" Hamby, the illustrator of the webcomic Devil's Candy, was sought out to re-imagine the Kunio-kun characters.We Talk To WayForward About All Things River City Girls! (GoNintendo) Hamby also illustrated the cutscenes. Cristina Vee directed the voice actors. WayForward VFX artist Jordan Vine animated the sequences while Kevin Samuels from WayForward's SFX department added sound effects. Release River City Girls was released in September 2019, generally over digital distribution channels such as the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network (PSN), Xbox Games Store, Steam, and GOG.com.

Her research focus included arulae (small altars). Early life and education Elisabeth Anna Marie Jastrow (nickname, \\"Ebit\\" or \\"Ebith\\") was born October 7, 1890, in Berlin. She came from a family of assimilated German Jews. Her father was the historian and social scientist, Ignaz Jastrow. Through her father, she grew up in a world full of scholars and artists, the sister Lotte Beate Jastrow Hahn later combined education and horticulture.Obermayer, Hans Peter: Elisabeth \\"Ebith\\" Jastrow. In: Derselbe: Deutsche Altertumswissenschaftler im amerikanischen Exil. Eine Rekonstruktion. De Gruyter, Berlin, 2014, pp. 133–191. (in German) Early on, Jastrow became interested in the ancient world and in 1909, began studying classical philology, archaeology, art history, and philosophy at the University of Berlin. Her most important teacher was Georg Loeschcke, after whose death in 1915, she moved to the Heidelberg University. There, Friedrich von Duhn became her doctoral supervisor. The title of the dissertation, from 1916, was Tonaltäre aus den westgriechischen Kolonien (Tonaltäre from the Western Greek colonies). At the time, she also joined a circle of archaeologists whose center was Margarete Bieber. In addition, Gerhart Rodenwaldt, Valentin Müller, Erwin Panofsky, Walther Amelung, and Bernhard Schweitzer were among them. Career From 1916 to 1922, she worked at the archaeological seminar of the University of Heidelberg and at the University of Giessen. From 1922 to 1924, she worked for the German Archaeological Institute in Athens, from 1925 to 1929, in the Rome department. In Rome, she was involved in the creation of the catalog of the library. After returning to Berlin, she worked briefly for the headquarters of the German Archaeological Institute. After that, she worked until the beginning of 1933 at the University of Marburg. From Marburg, she was to move to Bonn, where she was to create a catalog of the vase collection at the Academic Art Museum. Before she could begin her work in May, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (\\"Law on the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\\") came into force, which prohibited opportunity for advancement to her in Germany. After being thus barred from all opportunities for scientific activity in Germany, she received a scholarship from the American Association of University Women for the year 1934/35, the A.A.U.W. International Fellowship. With it, she moved to Italy, and also traveled to Greece and the United States. During this time, she continued her studies in ancient terracotta. At the end of the scholarship, she continued her studies with support from Hetty Goldman. After the death of her father in May 1937, she returned to Germany to settle the estate. After that, it became problematic for her to leave Germany at all. When she succeeded, she first went to Switzerland, and in October 1938, to the United States. Although Jastrow lacked the economic resources for a secure new beginning, she could rely on a broad network of connections. For example, her cousins Marcus, and his sons, Joseph and Morris, who were academics in the U.S. for some time. The circle also included her friend Margarete Bieber as well as Frank William Taussig, a friend of her father. First, she settled in the Boston area and took smaller positions as a German teacher, museum photographer, and seller of casts. Her sister, Lotte, and Lotte's two daughters, including Cornelia, also left Germany, first to England, before arriving in New York City in 1939. From June 1939, Jastrow received recognition as an emigrant to the U.S. and a permanent residence permit, which allowed her to accept better work. She first became a leader and associate at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for one year, and from 1941, she taught at the Department of Art of the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Already in the fall of the year, she was promoted to the rank of Assistant Professor at the Department of Art. She taught there all periods of art history, which was not easy for her as an archaeologist. On the one hand, Jastrow was aware of her luck to have escaped from Germany, on the other hand, she suffered from the local situation, over the lack of contact with the German academic world, the bad library, to the lack of opportunities for their own research. Because of the poor pay, she tried to balance her schedule by teaching German and English courses. Whenever possible, she left the confines of Greensboro to do research in New York City, Boston, and other places. Jastrow and her sister, Lotte, tried to rescue their mother from Germany, finally succeeding in October 1941. Anna Seligmann Jastrow lived with her daughter, Elisabeth, until Anna's death in August 1943. In December 1944, Jastrow became a U.S. citizen. Later years and death In 1961, Jastrow retired from the university. After that, she devoted herself more intensively to her archaeological studies. In 1970, she moved to a retirement home in Greensboro where she died in September 1981. Her papers are held by the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, California.

The story centers around the twin children of the Protector, whose magic powers cause them to become entangled in the political machinations of their mother. It is one of the first two novellas in the Tensorate series, the other being The Red Threads of Fortune. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novella, Locus Award for Best Novella, and World Fantasy Award for Best Novella. Plot Summary Sanao Hekate, The Protector, rules her empire with the help of Tensors, people who can control elemental forces known as the Slack. She opposes the development of technology for non-Tensor use and violently oppresses her populace at any hint of rebellion. As payment for the Grand Monastery's help in suppressing a rebellion, she sends her twin children Akeha and Mokoya to them. The children train their slackcraft with the monks of the monastery, becoming proficient in the usage of their powers. Mokoya begins to have dreams which prophesy future events, particularly events involving violence; any attempt to prevent these prophecies from occurring is impossible. Mokoya suffers psychologically from the effects her nightmares, creating strain between the twins. When the twins are almost seventeen, they undergo gender confirmation. Children in the world of the Tensorate are raised without gender, and physical differences between the sexes are suppressed by slackcraft. Mokoya chooses to be confirmed as female, while Akeha chooses to be confirmed as male. Mokoya prophesies that a young man named Thennjay will become the next Head Abbot, despite the disapproval of the Protector. The Protector begins using Mokoya's powers to strengthen her rule, but has no use for Akeha. Akeha flees the city and begins a career as a smuggler. Mokoya stays in the city, marries Thennjay, and has a daughter named Eien. Akeha falls in love with a man named Yeongchow, who is part of the Machinist rebellion. Machinists believe that all citizens should have access to technology. The Tensors and Machinists are developing modern technologies such as guns and bombs, increasing violent conflict throughout the empire. An accident in a research lab in the Grand Monastery kills Eien and severely injures Mokoya; the Protector uses this event as a pretense for an assault on the Monastery. Akeha returns to the capital to face his mother. He bests her in a fight but does not kill her, and she agrees to withdraw troops from the monastery. Mokoya recovers and reunites with her brother for the first time in years. Background The novella was published on the same day as The Red Threads of Fortune, and they can be read in any order. The Red Threads of Fortune was written first, and takes place after the events of The Black Tides of Heaven. In their pitch to Tor.com, JY Yang stated that they had more Tensorate stories to tell. Though only one novella had been written at the time, this led to the idea of publishing both debut novellas on the same day. Reception and Awards The novella has been well-received critically, with positive reviews from fantasy authors such as Ken Liu. Hugo-winning author N.K. Jemisin recommended the book, praising the Tensorate novellas for their worldbuilding. Geeks OUT praised the novella for its treatment of gender identity, as well as its exploration of wealth inequality. Several commenters have referred to the Tensorate world as silkpunk. The Black Tides of Heaven was a finalist for the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella, 2018 Locus Award for Best Novella, and 2018 World Fantasy Award for Best Novella.

Lechia Gdańsk  Nowicki started his career in 1951, making his debut against Gwardia Warsaw in the promotion playoffs to reach the I liga. Playing as a midfielder, Nowicki was instrumental in Lechia's early years in the top division. Despite relegation back to the second division in 1953, Lechia bounced back straight away finishing runners up in the II liga for the 1954 season.

The meal is seen as an act of social solidarity; it also has mythological connotations. Etymology The name \\"pampa mesa\\" comes from the Kichwa pampa, meaning \\"ground\\" or \\"plain\\", and Spanish mesa, meaning \\"table\\". Description The origins of the pampa mesa tradition are unknown. Pampa mesas often are used at festivals, at family celebrations, or after mingas (gatherings for communal work). For a pampa mesa, a long, typically white cloth is spread on the ground. Traditionally, participants in a pampa mesa bring the food they are able to share, and each spreads the food he or she brought along the cloth for all to eat. Once the food is spread along the cloth, participants sit along the cloth and use their hands to eat, rather than using utensils and dishes. Before eating, a community leader may give thanks for the food, and a portion of the food may be buried as an offering to the earth mother. The food on a pampa mesa tends to be largely staple items such as mote, potatoes, quinoa, oca, carrots, and fava beans. Sometimes, cuy (guinea pig) and other meats are present. Flowers and fruits may be used to decorate the pampa mesa. The spicy condiment ají frequently is served alongside the pampa mesa. The fermented beverage chicha de jora sometimes accompanies a pampa mesa. Interpretation Pampa mesas are a form of social solidarity: all contribute as they are able, and partake as they wish. Some believe that sitting on the earth and eating from a pampa mesa is a form of connection with Pachamama (earth mother), a goddess in Inca mythology who continues to be an object of reverence in Ecuador. A pampa mesa also may be seen as an act of thanksgiving for the harvest.  Similar practices  A similar tradition in Peru and Bolivia is called apthapi.

Paulet was brought up a Lancastrian and took part in Buckingham's rebellion of 1483 against Richard III for which he was attainted.Collins, Arthur, The Peerage of England, Vol. 3, 3rd edn., 1735, London, p. 222.

Paulet was tasked with collecting the fines of various individuals implicated in the failed rebellion of Perkin Warbeck in 1497. In 1501, he was one of the west-country gentlemen who met with Catherine of Aragon, the future wife of Henry VII's son and heir, Arthur. Under Henry VIII, Paulet travelled to France to command 25 men in the expedition to the north of France in 1513, during the first Anglo-French war of Henry VIII's reign. Altercations with Thomas Wolsey It is alleged that when Thomas Wolsey, not yet a man of much reputation, came to take possession of the benefice of Lymington in Hampshire, Paulet clapped him in the stocks. The precise details are unknown and vague but it is likely that Wolsey and Paulet quarrelled over a minor issue, the former possibly being inebriated.Edward, Simon; Lambe, John, \\"Much joy and favour to you: you are the King's now\\": Cardinal Wolsey as a domestic patron, Royal Studies Journal, 4(2), 2017, pp. 161-176, DOI: http://doi.org/10.21039/rsj.v4i2.154 In 1521, Paulet became treasurer for Middle Temple and Wolsey, now Lord Chancellor and the King's closest adviser, took revenge on him for the previous indignity which Paulet had put upon him. Wolsey ordered Paulet not to leave London unless given permission (by Wolsey) and so Paulet stayed virtually a prisoner in the Middle Temple for five or six years. In order to gain Wolsey's favour and forgiveness, Paulet placed Wolsey's arms on the Middle Temple gateway. Marriages and children Dying in 1538, Amias Paulet married twice. He only produced children from the second marriage: *Firstly, he married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Paulet, himself the grandfather of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, who held prominent positions under Henry VIII, Mary I, Edward VI, and Elizabeth I. *Secondly, he married Laura, daughter of William Kellaway and by her had three sons and a daughter: **Sir Hugh Paulet (bef. 1510 – 6 December 1573), an English military commander and Governor of Jersey. **John **Henry **Elizabeth, who married firstly to John Sidenham, secondly to William Carswell, and thirdly to Henry Coppleston.Collins, Arthur, The Peerage of England, Vol. 3, 3rd edn., 1735, London, p. 223.

She is the first black woman district attorney in the state of Alabama.  Early Life  Washington was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and graduated from A. H. Parker High School. Early on, she was interested in criminal justice, and despite her mother's attempts to persuade her to become a nurse or a teacher, she set her sights on going to law school. Being a lawyer \\"just wasn't one of those things that a lot of black people, particularly in our family, had as a career path,\\" Washington said. \\"My mother looked at that like an impossibility.\\" She graduated Auburn University and Miles Law School before working as a Defense Attorney.  Legal Career  In 2010, during a campaign for a district judgeship, Washington was diagnosed with Breast cancer. She had resigned from a previous position as Assistant District Attorney in order to focus on the campaign. She recovered and is now a breast cancer survivor, but lost the election. In February 2011, she was appointed presiding judge over the Bessemer District Municipal Court. Washington ran in 2016 and won the November General Election on the Democratic Party ticket for the Jefferson County Bessemer Cutoff District by only 299 votes, beating her opponent, Bill Veitch, the incumbent District Attorney who ran on the Republican Party ticket.  Stance on Issues  Death Penalty DA Washington is opposed to the death penalty, and campaigned on that issue. After being elected, she told Vice.com that \\"Among other initiatives, she plans to beef up the convictions integrity unit that probes possible wrongful convictions, launch a citizen-police advisory board, and divert low-level offenders from prison by creating alternatives to incarceration.\\" Misdemeanor Marijuana Arrests Washington has indicated that she is seeking to end arrests for misdemeanor marijuana offenses. \\"It is no secret that Jefferson County, like others around the country, is plagued with overcrowded jails,\\" Washington stated in a press release. \\"Now that the Jefferson County, Bessemer jail is closed for renovations, the need to address overcrowding is even more urgent.\\" Washington has stated that she is working to implement a procedure she calls the \\"Big Ticket program\\", under which misdemeanor offenses such as simple marijuana possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and harassment would no longer require an arrest.  Notable Cases  = Marshae Jones = In early 2019, Marshae Jones was indicted by a grand jury on charges of manslaughter, after the death of the fetus she was carrying after being shot after an altercation. Jones was accused of starting the altercation which led to the shooting. Washington declined to prosecute the case as District Attorney. She said in a news conference: \\"After viewing the facts of this case and the applicable state law I have determined that it is not in the best interest of justice to pursue prosecution of Ms. Jones on the manslaughter charge for which she was indicted by the grand jury. Therefore, I am dismissing this case and no further legal action will be taken against Ms. Jones in this matter.\\"  References  Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Auburn University alumni Category:Lawyers from Birmingham, Alabama Category:African-American lawyers Category:American women lawyers Category:Miles Law School alumni Category:District attorneys in Alabama ","title":"Lynneice Washington"},{"id":"61206673","title":"Easy Skanking in Boston '78"},{"id":"61206675","text":"Akhun () is a rural locality (a selo) in Kuzeyevsky Selsoviet, Buzdyaksky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Biographical details Johnnie Swearingen was born the son of sharecroppers in Campground Church, near Chappell Hill, TX. He started painting around the age of twelve, using whatever materials were available, including house paint and shoe polish. After his first marriage to Lora Ann Williams ended in divorce, Swearingen made his way West, chopping cotton, picking grapes, and working other temporary jobs.Adele, Lynne. Spirited Journeys: Self-Taught Texas Artists of the Twentieth Century. (Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1997), 148–53. He eventually made his way to San Pedro, CA, where he worked as a longshoreman.Rosenak, Chuck and Jan. Museum of American Folk Art Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century American Folk Art and Artists. (New York: Abbeville, 1990), 298. Swearingen returned to Texas in 1948, settling in Brenham and marrying his second wife, Murray Lee Williams the following year. Back in Texas, he returned to farming and painting, and, after receiving a call to preach in the early 1960s, he completed a correspondence course from the Lone Star Bible School in 1965 and became ordained. Swearingen began selling his paintings around the area: in his front yard, on the side of the road, and outside of the Washington County Courthouse. An article in the November 1976 issue of Houston Home and Gardens brought greater attention to Swearingen, and he was included in the 1980 exhibit “The Eyes of Texas: An Exhibition of Living Texas Folk Artists” at the University of Houston. By the time of his death in 1993, Swearingen had become one of Texas's most notable folk artists. Painting Style Swearingen is considered a memory painter who captured scenes of rural Texas, including work and leisure activities and local buildings. His paintings represent an important record of the African-American experience in the area. Swearingen also painted religious scenes, though these were not as popular with clients.Moore, Louis. “Now, a Portrait of the Artist as a Jonah in the Year 1981.” Houston Chronicle. December 12, 1981. His “simple yet sophisticated” paintings are “characterized by multiple perspectives and rhythmic lines.”Smither, Stephanie. “Swearingen, Johnnie S.” In The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, vol. 23: Folk Art. Edited by Carol Crown and Cheryl Rivers. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2013), 425.

Hiplife controversy Hiplife generally is a Ghanaian music genre that fuses some elements of hiphop with highlife.Oris Aigbokhaevbolo,\\"Hiplife in Ghana\\", Modern Ghana, 8 June 2015. The hiplife genre was founded in Ghana in the early 1990s. Zapp together with Michael Cooke coined the name hiplife when they were contemplating on what name could be given to the genre, they ended up with the name hiplife by blending the \\"hip\\" in hiphop with the \\"life\\" in highlife. The first artiste to record a song with the highlife genre is known to be Reggie Rockstone. His album; Makaa maka was the first hiplife album to be recorded. Zapp worked on some of Reggie's earliest recordings; agoo, Tsoo Boi and Night life in Accra. Zapp argues that Reggie couldn't be the only one to be credited with the founding of the hiplife music genre since there were others involved in making the music which include; the beat maker, the sound engineer, producers and others. Reggie on the other hand argues on the contrary that he was the sole founder of the genre. He added that Zapp didn't know much about rap music and he helped him understand the basics of rap music. Therefore, it wasn't possible for a person who knew little about a genre to claim to be a co-founder of the genre.Livefm staff,\\"I taught Zapp Mallet how to play Hiphop beats – Reggie Rockstone\\", Live fm ghana, 7 September 2015.

Reggie later apologised to Zapp for his utterances on television and radio regarding the conversation of who founded the hiplife genre. Reggie explained that his utterances were as a result of heightened tensions and the involvement of emotions. He believed Zapp's argument was an attempt to discredit him for creating a brand many young Ghanaian artistes benefit from.Kasapafmonline.com,\\"Reggie Rockstone offers apologizes to producer Zapp Mallet\\", ghana news, 16 September 2015.

Its common name is pale anemone hermit. The species is known to transfer sea anemones from one shell to another when it moves to a different shell. It can be kept in an aquarium. Habitat The crab can be found under dead coral in a lagoon alongside sea anemones. It lives in the low intertidal zones or subtidal zones. Locations that the species can be found in include the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Tasman Sea, and the Indo-west Pacific Oceans. Sea anemones The crab carries Calliactis anemones on the dorsal surface of its shell as well as the anemone Verrillactis paguri on the aperture of its shell. When the crab moves to a new shell, it transfers V. paguri from the old one to the new one on the same area as before, along with the Calliactis anemones. The hermit crab is one of at least 24 species that transfer over sea anemones to a new shell. The placement of the V. paguri might protect the crabs from having their chilepeds and legs eaten by predators such as fish and octopuses. This behavior was first studied in 1920, but with no specific anemones mentioned. Breeding In a 2003 study of the species' breeding season at Maputo Bay, it was found that the crabs breed with peaks of spawning from August to October and a small decrease from May to July. The study concluded that rainfall is the main factor that controls its breeding activity. Captivity The species can usually be kept in an aquarium with many other invertebrates, but it has been known to attack Caulerpa algae. The process of transferring anemones to another shell can also happen in an aquarium. While in captivity, the species does well in dim light and eats either frozen, flake, or tablet food.

He became the party's chairman from 1989 until 1998. He was also the vice chairman of the People's Representative Council from 1997 until 1999. He had served as the vice chairman of the People's Representative Council, vice chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council, and as the second chairman of the United Development Party.  Etymology  The name Ismail was his given name. The middle name Hasan came from his father, Ben Hasan, and his last name was based on where he was born.  Early life  Ismail's grandfather, Panglima Ibrahim, was a military commander in Aceh. He was commanded by the Sultan of Aceh at that time, to attack the Dutch at that time. He also bring his son, Tengku Ben Hasan, which is the father of Ismail, to join him at the frontline. Unfortunately, due to the support of several local kingdom to the Dutch Army, Ibrahim lost the battle. The Sultan of Aceh was caught, and Ben Hasan along with several companions flee to Malaya via the Malacca Strait. In Malacca, Hasan chose to learn about Islam in a pesantren at Yan, which is organized by Tengku Tjhi'. After gaining knowledge, Hasan then returned to Aceh. In his return, Aceh was occupied by the Dutch, but Hasan was no longer in pursuit by the Dutch. Hasan then established a pesantren in Ismail. There, her wife, Hajah Hindun, give birth to Ismail Hasan Metareum on 4 April 1929. During his childhood, Ismail was taught in his father's pesantren, Meunasah Baro. He also studied in the People's School until he was 12 years old. After he finished his elementary studies, he was brought to Madrasah Sa'adah Abadiyah until he graduated in 1946 at the age of seventeen. Due to the location of his school, which was quite far from his house, Ismail left his family in 1944 to live in a pesantren located close to his school. During his studies at Sa'adah Abadiyah, the Japanese Army began occupying Aceh on March 13, 1942. The stationed Japanese troops, the Fujiwara Squad, promised to the people of Aceh that they would not violate the Sharia law. In reality, the Japanese Army forced students to dig trenches for the Japanese war causes. In Ismail's madrasah, his studies was not much disturbed by the Japanese. Ismail can continue his studies relatively smooth compared to other students at that time. One year prior to his graduation, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed the independence of Indonesia on 17 August 1945. The warlords and rulers in Aceh urged their people to struggle for the independence. After his graduation, Ismail went to the Islamic Junior High School of Banda Aceh. Alongside his studies, Ismail joined the struggle for the independence, and he was appointed as the Head of the Staff Commando III of the Islamic Student Army (TPI) until 1950. He also joined the Mujahiddin Warriors from 1945 until 1947, a similar organization to TPI. He graduated the school in 1949, on which the Indonesian sovereignty was recognized by the international world. In 1949, he left Banda Aceh for Jakarta. In the city, Ismail entered the General High School No. 3 in Central Jakarta. Here, Ismail was accepted as a 2nd grader, without him being as a 1st grade student first. During his studies, he frequently visited the presidential palace in Jakarta, where Sukarno give a political speech regularly every Saturday.  In the Muslim Student's Association (HMI) Ismail Hasan Metareum as the chairman of the Muslim Student's Association Ismail became a student in the Law Faculty of the University of Indonesia in 1952. As a student that was previously active in Islamic youth movements, Ismail also observe the Muslim Student's Association, which one of the largest Muslim youth movement at that time. At first, he rejected the offer to enter the association, due to the acception of the chairman of HMI, Dahlan Ranumihardjo, to the speech of Sukarno. Sukarno was invited by Ranumihardjo to spoke about the vision of Indonesia and Islamic state. In his speech, Sukarno affronted the Islamic leaders of Masyumi, which Sukarno would later dissolve in 1960. Due to the incident, Ismail consider HMI as more oriented to nationalism, and were merely Islamic. Eventually, after given explanation by Dahlan, that he wasn't meant to accept Sukarno, Ismail became willing to enter HMI. In HMI, Ismail was chosen as the Vice Chairman of the HMI's branch in Jakarta, two years in his membership. A year later, he was chosen as the vice chairman of HMI for the 1955–1957 term, and later as the chairman of the organization until 1960. During his tenure as the chairman of HMI, Sukarno bring up the Nasakom concept, which allowed communist organization to spread. To cope with the situation, HMI united with other Islamic organizations to counter communist ideology in Indonesia. The union was in the form of the Union of Indonesian Islamic Youth Organizations, on which Ismail was active in it. To align views of Islam against communism, Ismail was also asked by the Minister of Religion at that time, Wahid Hasyim, to read out a statement rejecting communism in Islam.  In the Parmusi  Ismail entered Parmusi, which was the continuation of Masyumi, in 1967. He entered the party prior to the official approval of the party. During the first years of the party, it struggles to consolidate with the grassroots. To help the consolidation, in May 1967, Ismail met several of his friends, Omar Tusin and Hasbullah, to resolve the problem. The three then agreed to met with the former members of Masyumi in a villa on Puncak, owned by Tusin. The meeting resulted in the former members of Masyumi to support Parmusi. Ismail was later chosen as the member of the party's executive committee, representing Muslim Student's Association. = Coup = Jailani Naro commanded of the coup, and later he was appointed as the 2nd chairman of the United Development Party. In 1970, the executives of Parmusi held a meeting in order to choose the party's representation in the General Elections Institution. The meeting was held in Central Java, with Djarnawi Hadikusuma, the chairman of the party, Ismail, and several other figures attending it. The company was surprised when they received a radio report from Jakarta, that reported that a coup to the party, led by , Jailani Naro and Imran Kadir, had overthrown the leadership of the party. Djarnawi quickly left Central Java for Jakarta, only to see that the party's headquarter had been occupied. Both parties claimed themselves as the legitimate executive of the party, but finally both agreed to hand the conflict to the government. The government appointed Mintaredja as the chairman of the party. Even though Ismail was in the other camp, he maintained good relationship with Mintaredja.  In the United Development Party  = Vice Speaker of the People's Representative Council = Ismail became the vice speaker of the People's Representative Council from 1992 until 1999. He served under two presidents, Suharto and B. J. Habibie.  Death  Ismail died on 2 April 2005 at the age of 75.

The bicycles were designed by Royce Husted incorporating his patented Rim Band Brake scheme as well as a Radial Gear concept for shifting through fifteen gears. The Yankee Bicycle has neither rear or front derailleurs, internal hub, or chainring. Instead, the Radial Gear scheme uses a single six-segment sprocket that expands and contracts establishing different gear diameters. Unlike with derailleur systems, Radial Gearing will not cause inter-gear slippage. In 1991, within Popular Sciences' Best of What's New issue, the Yankee Bicycle was awarded the Grand Award for Recreation. The entry of the Yankee Bicycle into the bicycle market highlighted the impression that the bicycle industry is reluctant to introduce new innovative technology unless it is rolled out by major industry leaders (e.g., Schwinn Bicycle Company).  History  Starting in 1991, the company was in operation for a year. Being frustrated by bicycle manufacturers' reluctance to embrace new innovative bicycle technologies, Royce Husted, the founder, created his company and sold Yankee Bicycles out of a facility in West Chicago, Illinois. Husted would have preferred that others built and sold his bicycles. Royce Husted witnessed his family having problems when they rode their bicycles. As a person capable of holding several patents, he designed a whole new approach to shifting and braking bicycles. After being in operation for only one year, starting in 1991, the company and relevant patents were sold to NordicTrak in 1992.  Yankee Bicycle  Perhaps only 3,000 Yankee Bicycles were built. The unique elements were not readily accepted by the bike industry which, arguably, valued only industry leaders' innovations. The name was derived as a reference to \\"Yankee ingenuity\\". Unlike other regular recreational bikes, Yankee Bicycles use systems invented by the founder, Royce Husted, for its shifting and braking. Not using chainrings, Radial Gear has a single sprocket that expands and contracts in response to a single gear shift lever. The selection of the gear is based on the length of time the shift lever is depressed. The braking scheme uses a Kevlar-covered steel cable that completely encircles the rear wheel around an extra rim. Due to lack of available parts and limited production, the Yankee Bicycles have become a collectors item (see external link section).

Davis is an American scientist. She is a senior scientist and head of the Social Epidemiology Research Unit at the National Human Genome Research Institute.  Education  Davis completed a B.A. from University of Arkansas in 1980. She earned a M.Ed. from Northeastern University in 1983. In 1987, she completed a M.P.A. from John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. She earned a Ph.D. from the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in 1991. Her dissertation was titled Assessing the effect of Medicare's Prospective Payment System on access to intensive-care treatment among the very-old: A pre/post examination of intensive-care admission patterns. Stuart Altman was her doctoral advisor.  Career  Davis is a senior scientist in the Metabolic, Cardiovascular and Inflammatory Disease Genomics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). She is head of the Social Epidemiology Research Unit. = Research = Davis' research has focused on the effects of social determinants on cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity among disproportionately affected sub-populations. Her lab is now engaged in an emerging field of human social genomics. This research identifies the types of genes that are subject to social-environmental regulations, the neural and molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of social processes on gene expression, and the genetic polymorphisms that moderate individual differences in genomic sensitivity to social context. left Davis' lab is also assessing the association of ancestry on sub-clinical cardiovascular risk factors among African-Americans and skin color as a phenotype associated with genetic ancestry and cardiovascular outcomes. The group is measuring differential telomere length correlated to cardiovascular outcomes and social determinants on telomere length among African-Americans. Davis' team, along with other investigators in the Cardiovascular Section, have implemented a research protocol with the objective of developing a community-based cohort and novel genomic science resource for defining the biological significance of ancestry-related genomic variation in African-Americans related to cardiovascular disease. The study is designed to test the hypothesis that race-ancestry differences in the burden of cardiovascular disease in African-Americans reflects the influence of a unique interplay between the distinct genomic variations characteristic of African-Americans and the \\"exposome\\" of social determinants and environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.  Personal life  Davis was married and had 2 children during the completion of her dissertation in 1991.

Geography Sakato is located on the Oecusse coastline which is on the northern coast of Timor island. It is located to the west of the Noel Meto river which forms the East Timor-Indonesia border. The mountains of Oecusse rise up behind Sakato. Transportation The village is served by the main road from Pante Macassar, the capital of Oecusse which is located 15 km to the east. From Sakato, the distance to the main part of East Timor via the Mota'ain/Batugade border crossing is about 75 km along the northern coastal road which traverses North Central Timor Regency and Belu Regency of Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia. Border crossing checkpoint The Sakato integrated frontier checkpoint (Portuguese: Posto Fronteirico Integrado) is located 15 km east of Pante Makassar and just west of the bridge over the Noel Meto which forms the East Timor-Indonesia border. The checkpoint on the Indonesia side is called the Wini border crossing checkpoint. The checkpoint was newly built to cater to immigration, customs, quarantine and security procedures after East Timor became independent. The facility was opened by Vice Prime Minister Jose Luis Guterres on 28 June 2012. The border crossing is the main one for Oecusse as it is located on the shortest route between Oecusse and the main border crossing into the main part of East Timor at Mota'ain/Batugade.

Produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman's studio Playtone, the six-part series chronicles the cinema of the United States, ranging from the \\"Golden Age of Hollywood\\" to the present day. It is a spin-off of Hanks and Goetzman's retrospective miniseries for CNN (including The Sixties and its sequels).  Production  Owing to the costs incurred with licensing the required film footage, episodes on cinema were not included in past Hanks/Goetzman miniseries projects such as The Sixties. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Goetzman remarked that \\"it cost a fortune, and some is fair use, depending on how you guys talk about it, and some isn't, but within it, it's an insane undertaking because the licensing is a very tricky business in this type of thing, and you know, you set out thinking, hey, this is going to be great, right? And then you realize you have approvals, you know, beyond belief with estates in a lot of the situations, too.\\" He went on to explain that the episodes, in their opinion, would present a \\"pretty good outline of what those decades are\\", and that they had managed to obtain every interview they had aimed to include—including John Singleton prior to his death in April 2019, as well as Martin Scorsese and Robert Redford almost immediately before a production deadline. Herzog explained that \\"most directors like Singleton are really historians of film, and they know film, they know the impact of films, they study it, and so it was like talking to historians, all of them.\\" Owing to their complementary nature, Variety stated that CNN planned to incorporate The Movies' respective episodes into its marathons of past Hanks/Goetzman miniseries in the future.

It was described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1781. It is well known as a predator of aphids and other small insects. Although sometimes known by the common name of six- spotted zigzag ladybird, this is misleading as there are several colour morphs and some colour morphs of the species can be confused with Micraspis discolor and Chilocorus nigrita. The species has a wide distribution range within the Asian tropics and subtropical zones from India to Japan and parts of the Australian region. They have been introduced into the Caribbean islands as a biocontrol agent and their spread to South America was noted in 2019. The elytral colour has been identified as being controlled by two genes with two alleles each U-u and D-d and the phenotypes have been grouped into varieties quadriplagiata (“Q”) [UUDD,UUDd,UuDD,UuDd]; unifasciata (“U”) [Uudd,UUdd]; diversijunata (“D”) [uuDD,uuDd] and sexmaculata (“S”) [uudd]. The darker forms predominate in higher latitudes where absorption of heat may aid their survival.

His other art names included Hōrai (蓬莱), Kanraitei (観雷亭), Kikyo (箕踞), Shōun (湘雲), Tekkan Dōjin (鉄冠道人) and Tekkanjin (鉄冠人).  Life and work  He was the eldest son of Gion Jun’an, a doctor who served the Kishū Domain of the Tokugawa clan. At the age of thirteen, he began to receive instruction from the Confucianist Kinoshita Jun'an and became attached to the group of ten disciples that included Arai Hakuseki and Muro Kyūsō. He became distinguished as a writer of poetry and prose and established himself as a teacher of Confucianism in 1713. At the age of twenty-four, he was expelled from his teaching position for misconduct, for reasons now unknown. Ten years later, he was pardoned and returned to a teaching post in Wakayama. The following year, he was the head of a mission to Korea, for which he received a credit of 200 Koku. He was then entrusted with managing one of the newly founded Han schools. At this time, he began to study the art of the Yuan and Ming dynasties and incorporate elements from them into his works. He also studied the Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden. As his most notable influences, he claimed Zhao Mengfu for calligraphy and Tang Yin for painting. He also admired Yi Fujiu. He was one of the pioneers of nanga (literati painting); passing it along to his students, Yanagisawa Kien and Ike no Taiga. He mostly painted birds and flowers, together with a few landscapes, using a minimal variety of colors. Many of his works are in the Tokyo National Museum. He also wrote a collection of essays on Chinese poetry.  Sources  * Tazawa, Yutaka: \\"Gion Nankai\\". In: Biographical Dictionary of Japanese Art. Kodansha International, 1981. . * Laurance P.

Early life  James Forsyth Thallon was born at Markinch, Fifeshire, Scotland on 21 November 1847. The youngest of seven children, his father an artisan, died shortly before he was born. Raised by his mother, he left school at the age of 14 at which time the family relocated to Edinburgh.  Railway career  = Scotland = After plans to become an apprentice architect fell through, young James now 15, entered a clerkship at the head office of the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway (later North British Railway Company). His work ethic and capabilities quickly saw him rise through the ranks, being appointed as head of the rates and fares branch in 1875. Among his many achievements in this position was the successful introduction of intersystem through traffic between Ireland, Scotland, England and France, making use of the company's steam boats between the former. = Queensland, Australia = By 1881, Thallon was suffering from ill-health and commenced applying for positions in warmer climates. The position of Traffic Manager of the Southern and Western Railway in Queensland, Australia was advertised shortly afterwards, with his successful appointment confirmed in July 1882. Thallon emigrated to Australia taking up in the position the following September, however his appointment was short-lived. He resigned two months later on 26 November 1882 after clashing with the then Commissioner for Railways Arthur Herbert, over safety concerns. Herbert had insisted on running non-timetabled and construction trains without a train staff (a token which ensured only one train could be on a track section at a time), as a personnel cost-saving measure. Thallon's concerns were well founded, with a fatal head-on collision occurring on 3 October 1884 in a cutting between Oxley and Darra in Brisbane, between a passenger and materials train. The materials train had been running without a train staff. Six weeks later, at the request of the Queensland Government, Thallon returned as Traffic Manager of the Southern and Western Railways, quickly instituting stringent use of train staff and ticket to ensure safe train separation. Herbert was subsequently replaced as Commissioner for Railways by Francis Curnow in March 1885. With the enactment of the Railway Act of 1888, which Thallon had assisted in drafting, a Board of three Commissioners was introduced to oversee decision making in the railways, in a bid to reduce political influence. The Board promoted Thallon as General Traffic Manager of Queensland Railways in November 1890, with a further promotion to Deputy Commissioner of Railways in July 1896. By this stage, the Board of three Commissioners had been reduced back to a single Commissioner, with Thallon serving under Robert Gray. In June 1899, he was appointed Military Director of Railway Transport in Queensland and bestowed the honorary title of Lieutenant-Colonel.  Commissioner of Railways  On 5 November 1902, Thallon became Commissioner of Railways, replacing Robert Gray who had succumbed to a long illness. His popular leadership oversaw a large expansion of the railway network in Queensland, culminating in a government sponsored study trip abroad to report on the management and operations of railway networks in Canada, England and South Africa in May 1908. Prior to his departure, in recognition of the high regard and esteem with which he was held, he was presented with numerous gifts on behalf of the citizens of Brisbane and Toowoomba, including an expensive moroccan leather address, a sovereign case and £560 in sovereigns (the equivalent of almost A$80,000 in 2018). Thallon promptly returned the monetary gift, requesting it instead be used to present a gold medal to the railway employee who gained the highest marks in the annual Queensland Railway Ambulance Corps exam. As of 2017, the annual Thallon Medal award was still in existence. As was characteristic of his career, Thallon encouraged innovation as Commissioner, including: * Improvements in carriage design of the Sydney Mail * Importation of a Renard Road Train for early road haulage * Importation of the McKeen Rail Cars, the first internal combustion rail passenger vehicles in Australia * Creation of the Advertising Branch to harness external revenues (as Deputy Commissioner).  Death  Thallon died at the age of 63 at the Mater Misericordiae in Brisbane from complications of Dengue Fever, which at that time was a common illness in Brisbane during the summer months. He was replaced by Thomas King as Commissioner of Railways.

The same test is also used to check if sympathectomy is a possible management option for peripheral arterial disease. Procedure The specific nerve of the suspected ischemic limb is anesthetized using local anesthesia. In case of lower limbs, the whole limb could be anesthetized using spinal anesthesia. If the ischemic disease is at the stage of vasospasm, the nerve block relives the sympathetic vasospasm and the temperature of the limb rises after the anesthetic block. The rise in skin temperature of the limb is compared to the rise in mouth temperature for reporting Brown's vasomotor index (BVI). It is mathematically expressed as: :BVI = \\\\frac{R_s - R_m}{R_m} where R_s is the rise in skin temperature and R_m is the rise in mouth temperature.

Unlike P. brasiliensis, which is found throughout Central and South America, P. lutzii is found only in Brazil and Ecuador. It is less virulent than P. brasiliensis.  History  Paracoccidioides species were discovered by Adolfo Lutz in 1908 in Brazil.Lacaz, CS; Franco (1994). \\"Historical evolution of the knowledge on paracoccidioidomycosis and its etiologic agent, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis\\". Boca Raton:CRC Press: 1–11. P. lutzii was formerly classified \\"PB-01 like\\", and proposed as a new species in 2014, being discovered in the Central-West region of Brazil. The infection it causes is considered to be a neglected endemic mycosis, a type of neglected tropical disease.  Ecology  P. lutzii occurs in nature as a filamentous structure. It forms conidia as part of its life cycle, which cause infection when inhaled into the respiratory tract of humans.  Epidemiology  Lesions of paracoccidioidomycosis on a Brazilian child Little is known about the epidemiology of the new species, as most previous epidemiological reports have focused on P. brasiliensis. Infection with the Paracoccidioides species, known as paracoccidioidomycosis, may be asymptomatic and subclinical, or may form into either acute/subacute (juvenile) or chronic (adult) forms of the disease. P. lutzii has less adhesion to lung cells than P. brasilensis, potentially explaining its decreased virulence. It is predominantly distributed in the Central west and Amazon regions of Brazil and Ecuador. Social and environmental changes, including increased agriculturalization, deforestation in Brazil, expansion of settlements and coffee agriculture could explain the increased incidence of Paracoccidioidies, especially in the Rondônia state of Brazil.

It was also used in World War One as a training camp and, later, a prisoner of war camp. History = World War One = Redmires Camp was first used in World War I. Originally it was set up as a First World War training camp for the Sheffield City Battalion, who trained in the area around Redmires Reservoir. Archaeological surveys of the nearby training areas, including trench systems dug by the trainee soldiers were undertaken between 1999 and 2006, but no investigations have been made of the camp. When the Sheffield City Battalion went overseas, the camp and training areas were used by other British military units. It subsequently became a prisoner of war camp. Its most famous inmate was the future Admiral Karl Dönitz who had been commanding a U-boat when captured on 4 October 1918. = Inter-war Period = In 1925, a severe outbreak of smallpox meant that nearby Lodge Moor Hospital was unable to house all the patients, and Redmires Camp was used as an auxiliary hospital. It remained in use as such until 1935. = World War Two = At the beginning of World War II, the name of Redmires Camp was changed to Lodge Moor Camp, becoming Prisoner of War Camp 17. The camp housed Italian POWs who established a friendly rapport with the locals. As the war progressed they were replaced by German prisoners who endured overcrowding; the International Committee of the Red Cross, which, described the conditions as “insufficient/uninhabitable”. A witness suggested there were more than 70 prisoners in huts designed for 30. Others were in tents.  Murder  On 24 March 1945 Gerhardt Rettig, a German prisoner of war, was severely beaten by fellow German prisoners of war, and later died of his injuries in hospital. Two men were subsequently tried for his murder and executed. = Current Condition and Uses = Many of the concrete bases for the Nissen huts remain, along with remains of toilet blocks and emergency water storage tanks. However, apart from the concrete bases, the area is now overgrown with trees, bracken and brambles, and used mainly by dog walkers. It is signposted as Redmires Camp Plantation and owned by Sheffield City Council. In 1979, a small part of the area was cleared to make a permanent site for Travellers, which is still in use today. Archeology students from the University of Sheffield, working with the Sheffield Lakeland Landscape Partnership (SLLP), undertook new searches of the World War Two camp remains in the Summer of 2019.

It was located along the Algoma Eastern Railway line between two mine sites, Crean Hill and Gertrude. It functioned as a brief offshoot of the nearest major settlement along the line, the Inco company town of Copper Cliff, which today is a suburb of Sudbury. Origins and growth In the 1910s, the landscape around Copper Cliff was dominated by large open-air roast yards. At the time, roasting was a labour-intensive activity which involved workers bringing ore to the yards in wheelbarrows, piling it, and manually spreading it before removing the roasted ore once again. This required a large workforce, and roasting activities were initially done close to the town. However, this process devastated large areas around the yards, and concerns began to increase about the long-term health implications of air pollution near roast yards, so the decision was made by the Canadian Copper Company to move its roast yards from Copper Cliff to a new site along the Algoma Eastern Railway (AER) line heading west. The new roast yard location was established in 1915 and named after the man appointed to be its foreman, John O'Donnell. The yards themselves were laid out next to a spur line which extended to the south from the AER main line, and which also featured a loading area for the ore. A town site, which also fell to the south of the AER main line, was laid out to the north of the roast yards. With an estimated workforce of 200 men at the site, the town was planned for a population of approximately 600 inhabitants. It was laid out along four streets: Foley, Savage, Vermillion, and Ellis, with Vermillion and Ellis functioning as the main streets running southwest, perpendicular to the AER. Most of Savage and Foley Streets never saw permanent housing, and instead were used to park boxcars that functioned as overflow housing. The town did, however, have a few amenities, including a post office, club house, general store, school, town hall, jail, hockey rink, baseball field, and ice house. Vermillion and Ellis streets contained permanent housing of ten duplexes and ten detached dwellings, along with apartments above the two-storey general store, and were also serviced with sewer and water; the entire town also featured electric power. Decline and abandonment The town's growth was tempered in 1918 when the workforce requirements were reduced to 40 men due to the construction of an ore bridge, and the actual population hovered around 100. The overflow housing was removed around this time. In 1921, the yards were temporarily shut down due to reductions in Inco's nickel production, and the entire population was removed. In the following year of 1922, the yards reopened and the town was re- inhabited. The new owner of the general store, Sam Fera, used a jitney to transport goods and passengers to and from Creighton Mine. This revival was to be short-lived, however. Despite Inco's efforts to mitigate the issue, the environmental problems of open-air roast beds were clear and by 1929 the Canadian government began to take steps toward shutting them down. In 1930, Inco constructed a new roasting plant in Copper Cliff and ceased operations at O'Donnell. The majority of the workforce was removed for the second and final time, though cleanup operations continued until 1931 with a handful of workers remaining. Around this time, the struggling Algoma Eastern Railway was acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the CPR's consolidation of its rail lines around Sudbury led to the redundant sections (mostly of the AER) being abandoned as an active freight railway, though Inco continued to use sections of the rail line privately as a part of its mining operations. This, combined with the decline and abandonment of other nearby settlements and mining operations, ensured that O'Donnell swiftly fell into obscurity. Current status Today, the former town site is largely overgrown and nothing remains of the buildings other than foundations. The roast bed, however, can be seen in satellite images, and in 2012 the City of Greater Sudbury pushed to have it designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to serve as a reminder of the catastrophic long-term consequences of industrial pollution and to commemorate the struggle of the people of Sudbury for environmental justice from mining companies, as well as the pioneering environmental reclamation work which began in the area in the 1970s.

He provided legal counseling for activist Martin Luther King Jr., one of the leaders of the civil rights movement. He served on the legal team of world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, and argued the Clay v. United States case in which the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Ali's conviction for refusing to serve in the United States Army during the Vietnam War. Early life and education Eskridge grew up in Homewood, a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Westinghouse High School. He graduated from the Tuskegee Institute in 1939. During World War II, he served as a pilot in Italy as one of the Tuskegee Airmen and flew 105 combat missions. After the war, Eskridge attended John Marshall Law School in Chicago, graduating in 1949. Legal career Eskridge advised the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an African-American civil rights organization, in the late 1960s. He was also the executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Foundation. Eskridge represented Martin Luther King Jr. in the City of Memphis v. Martin Luther King at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. This was King's last case. Eskridge was present at the Memphis hotel where King was assassinated in April 1968. He helped place King on a stretcher at the hotel and accompanied him to the hospital. After King's death, Eskridge also represented King's estate. Eskridge was a member of Muhammad Ali's legal team. His most importance case for Ali was Clay v. United States, in which Ali was appealing to the Supreme Court of the United States to overturn his conviction for refusing to be inducted into the United States Army during the Vietnam War. Ali had been sentenced to the maximum penalty of five years in jail and a fine of $10,000. Eskridge argued that Ali satisfied the three tenets for conscientious objector status: that his objection to war was religiously- based, that he was sincere, and that he was opposed to all wars. The last tenet was contentious because the Nation of Islam only forbade Ali from participating in wars \\"not ordered by Allah\\". Although the Supreme Court initially voted 5–3 against Ali, they later revoted 8–0 in favor of Ali after Justice John Harlan decided to change his vote. Harlan made this decision after being persuaded by his clerks to read Elijah Muhammad's book Message to the Blackman in America, which convinced him that Ali indeed qualified for conscientious objector status. Eskridge became a judge in 1981 and served as an associate judge on the Cook County Circuit Court until 1986. Media representation Eskridge was portrayed by Joe Morton in the 2001 biopic Ali about Muhammad Ali. He was portrayed by Chuck Cooper in the film Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight about the Clay v. United States case in the Supreme Court. In the film The Muhammad Ali Story, he was portrayed by Paul Winfield. Personal life Eskridge married Yvonne Jackson. They had two children, Victor and Victoria. Eskridge died in January 1988 at Oak Forest Hospital after spending eleven months in a coma. He had been residing in Avalon Park at the time. Eskridge served on the board of directors for the Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank beginning in 1968, making him the first African-American director of a bank in Chicago.
